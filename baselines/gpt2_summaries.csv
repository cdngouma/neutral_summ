B0002VQDVM,"I find myself saying ""What?"" And I had a reason to be. Its small and light with a nice look and color. When you do that, the phone stops dialing out after an hour or so. - T9 is not the default for text input (why??!) I'd have to say that i'm in love with this phone. The softkeys are nice. As for the features, the phone is incredible. I purchased my brand new samsung e317 on ebay.",12
B0009MYS9S,"Good range and volume. Mine broke first time. Took forever to get replacements. Just like the others wrote, mine broke in about three weeks. My son also noticed similar failure after I pointed out the problem. It is only a matter of time. I recently purchased the bad design flawed heaphones October 2005. This one is consistent, comfortable and very reliable.",9
B000BI4KKM,I have really enjoyed this headset. Pairs up with my Nolia phone quickly and effortlessly. Audio quality in both directions seems fine. One of my gripes is that it doesn't fit in the ear very well. Nothing special. Great for entry level headset. This is my first Bluetooth Headset. With the RAZR it always disconnects in middle of transfer. I bought two of these headsets when I saw the deep discount. Now I know why the discount is so deep. I would not recommend it.,12
B000CQFMEQ,"It has absoulutely no range. One I purchased at a retail Cingular store for about $80. It says it's good for 33 feet; Tried many different calls. If I do, it is very scratchy and garbled. Needless to say Motorola droped the ball on this product. This was a great purchase. Nothing to complain about.",8
B000FYU4SO,"Before this phone, I had only LG, the latest being the vx6000. Why can't I make it stop? With the reccomended bluetooth it is even worse. But until the battery issue is sorted it is hopeless. - Good Windows functionality. I use it more for business than personal use. (1) The battery power sucks. Very frustrating as I spent hours on trying to like this phone. Very frustrating. The phone is not good. I have had my Q for about 2 weeks now. I would like a touch screen, but I don't miss it. That was the other phone I considered. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible.",15
B000HDZA28,Everything seems to be included in the package. I will be anxious to use the phone once I am in Europe. Delivery was very quick (less than 24 hours). I didn't know they made cell phones so small. Return was also easy; It was easy to add minutes.,6
B000I8FWMK,"The case fits perfectly and seems to be durable and sturdy. Would recommend. This case fits great! not good for kids
didnt expect the edges to be quite thin.",5
B000JCDUFG,"Thanks Denver Post. Not once, but twice in two weeks. I give the Denver Post 3 stars because there is no Weather (really? Reading it is so easy....love saving the trees! So easy to hold.",10
B000M92GLK,"I can't believe I was able to buy it for such a low price! Very good clarity, so much so that you have to turn the volume down. This headset delivers everything as advertised by Plantronics. I purchased this model because it is compatible with the iPhone. In fact I actually had to turn down the volume a bit. Overall a very clean design. The DC charging station/dock for the car is great. Call volume was low and the amount of static
was unbearable. I really expected more from Plantronics.",10
B000Q5J2M6,"Well, it's not working the way it's intended. This is the first bluetooth device I have tried to own. Those are my issues with it. Amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well. Even comes with a carrying case! they just came apart at the seam. My 700 LX arrived and would not take a charge.",8
B000SRGF2W,"The characters just seemed too vague. This was a fun read, but don't expect anything other than that. It is extremely smutty and the use of fowl language is horrible. This was the case in this novel. Not too realistic. But if you are looking for an easy beach read, this one is for you!",7
B000WCWUWM,"Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms."" Highly recommended. Dev is a strong werewolf who arrives to Asheville for business. It was pretty face paced. It jumped right into the action and didn't slow down. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership. This story's not about that. I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics. I thought it was a weak plot point.",11
B0018969BG,"Don't buy the H500, go for the H700. My end sounds fine. Having a cellphone up to your ear is not acceptable at post. This bluetooth lays against your ear and has a nice speaker. I used this maybe one day and ended up buying something else. You can't beat the price! I was very excited to find this bluetooth. I haven't been able to find this style anywhere. Very pleased with the fast shipping.",10
B001AS6J24,I'm pretty impressed. It's acutally hard to take off the phone. For the price it was a good deal. I love this cover. I cannot say enough about this cover. It just needs improved durability. Sorry it took so long.,8
B001B4AAJ0,"Appears to be a nice slim case. I like this case, but it's not overwhelming. Positives- Its a great looking case. It also dose not even fit right. Not real happy about that. Make sure you put the case on correctly! One problem...The finish on the back of my case started peeling. Great Customer Service.",12
B001BB242E,"OK you live and learn. I was disgusted! Negative 5 stars in my book. I like the charging module. Great product, even better price and fast easy delivery. I also cannot get a good fit with the earpiece.",7
B001E42QBW,"Product does extend the life of the battery significantly. It at least doubles the time I can go without charging my iphone. I hope it can be improved- physically, it seems very well designed. then, this device would be a 5 star. This was a coincident. I haven't had any rubbers issues. This thing is GREAT.",8
B001HVWUDG,"Distorted audio out, buzzing on recieve on I Phone and LG. 925 and 920 are very good. Unfortunately, I'm not very happy with this one. This product does not work with a higher pitched voice. Those called have reported that the sound quality is good. How is that supposed to work? Have it on opposite sides of your body and the static is deafening.",8
B001MYLTDA,"Stored a few pics but never used pic. Actually ditched my last phone because I love this one so much. This has those features and they work great. Camera is also nice. If you can get around that though, It think you'll like it. Powerful phone but somewhat problematic. Denied my rebate even though everything was in order. i like that its flip and qwerty key board. It does have a good web expereince, but alas I miss having a phone. this device is less of a phone and more of a very small computer. Multiple touches needed to execute commands
3.",12
B001N48GGC,"Doesn't sound like the original version of the song. Vocals are close. Wanted to have the follow up to Space Oddity. It's a good song, but I am not liking the singer on this one.",5
B001NZ0WP4,This is dr dre's worst album ever. EVERYONE REALLY HATED THIS CD. RC's cover of the song Fame is good and King T's verse is excellent. It's well produced and has variety.,5
B001PKTRVM,"i'm still trying to resolve. I discussed with LG and they were no help at all. All replacement phones are refurbs. Once again ATT warranty services was very helpful. If you need them, call 1-800-801-1101. I purchased (2) 2gb Micro SD cards to extend the memory. My wife's phone worked fine with it. That's what you get when you purchase T-Mobile Dash Black. The phone is great with a lot of features. I'm very happy with this purchase. Any USB 2.0 Cable, A Male to Micro B Male Cable should work.",13
B002DRMPMY,"Cheap has a very negative connotation. I'm happy to say my worries were unfounded. I would recommend this for any Palm Pre owner. In all fairness, I have only used the car charger part of this trio. Overall very happy with it.",6
B002EOTJFM,"It seems to be made out of PC. This was really disappointing. And this thing is CHEAP. I bought it to go over a Gelaskin on my 3GS. It's just not protection, except from scratches, I'd think.",6
B002JWJYX6,was hoping for a better product. This item was inexpensive and seemed to look ok. Server the purpose and felt nice. This is a cute case at a good price; It is very very difficult to prop open this case. Great quality product.,6
B002QIQ76K,This is a great case. I had a little trouble installing the screen's protective shield. I like the look very much but the front is not very usable. What's up with that?! Now the case protects this area nicely. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE! I fits perfectly. Everytime i opened the phone it would come off. It shakes a lot. I would have appreciated knowing that upfront.,12
B002S5R4IG,Very nice people and great to deal with! I didn't bother trying to return it since it was so inexpensive. I already have an iPod touch with a remote mic ear phone. Only works with music. So far it's working pretty good.,6
B002V6A2PE,"It is simply a hard plastic case with a soft, RUBBER-LIKE coating. Case initially fits nicely enough and looks great on the phone. otherwise, good product
It's been recieved by a friend in miami. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela",7
B002WC7RKA,I've had my Droid for 8 months. I don't think they could have done much more. This was a nice cover...while it lasted. The clasps broke on one side. Very pleased with this case. I have had several Body Glove brand phone cases in the past. Don't buy this case. I expected more. It does a great job of protecting my phone.,13
B0036FTZZW,"I loved this book. I like this book because the topic interesting. Oh sorry, got carried away...
I just finished reading the book. Great job Mr. Shea! If you like legal thrillers, this book is for you!",10
B003GLIDRM,It doesn't work. Now I too have to see how well the return policy is. But you should be able to pry it off your old one. I would definitely purchase Iphone parts from this store. Very glad I purchased it. This completely fixed the problem. The replacement part came quickly and installed like the original.,8
B003SU4ZRS,"This is not a good product. It worked great! 1 finger prints problem
2. installation was fairly easy. So buy it for the main screen protector and the back one. The 2nd time around I love it and it was pretty easy to put on. It is a little difficult to install correctly.",8
B003UO175U,Maybe it's my own fault. The ad said three protectors only got one. I threw all away. It's a great buy & the quality is good. I think the plastic may be to thick.,6
B003VDC4PW,"Got these from the seller very quickly. A bit prone to scratches, but you get five of them in the package. I've never had issues with those. Overall I'm happy with this product. Look elsewhere and watch out for mimes. I would recommend them. Now I don't have to. FU we're leaving""

Screw you phone.",9
B003ZHPWKS,"I'd rate myself as an average cell phone user in terms of gentleness. Slim, and comfotable in the hand. Maybe my hand wasn't used to the case, but I dropped it. Keeping the case though because it makes the phone look really nice. I love this one! This thing is cheap plastic that has poor finishing. My case has broken after a week.",8
B00403MNZ8,Did not get quality for my money. Even free would be too much for this book. I would not recommend it to anyone! Works well as that. Maybe I should have read Me Myself and Why before reading this one.,6
B0043RTJEY,"not complete protection, front plate cover won't stay on. I decided to buy another one. I've dropped my phone countless times and its never broken. Am very glad I bought it and would recommend to anyone. It's just not the same quality. The pink/white case looks great with my white Blackberry Torch. Thanks Otterbox!",8
B0044MPB2W,"This phone cover is an excellent buy. it was as beautiful on my phone, as it was in the picture! And the price was definitely right! i would definitely recommend it.",5
B0046SHQG8,"This is for Apple headphone replacement...nothing more, nothing less. These work well, and fit my ear, but they don't last. They kept sliding out of my ears, even when sedentary. The sound is comparable to the Apple earphones (not great). I hate to be so ""blah"" about a product. These work great. I ordered these hoping they would work with my non-iDevices. A lesson learned never again. They are certainly better than the standard Apple earphones. Great quality sound and comfort. I really cherish these, very nice!",15
B004BB1OLI,Yeah right it's the same stuff. The car charger also works well. Very disappointed! The car charger works well as does the additional USB cable.,5
B004CMIB8K,Very good cheap case for the iphone. It's protected my phone so far. Looks great and has a nice snug fit on the phone. Will buy again in different color. So I broke down and got the new Otter Box. I love this case! This was a cheap case I purchased for someone else.,8
B004EYI02S,"I am very displeased. My plans are to return the Bluetooth ASAP. Whatever the case maybe, I will be returning this Bluetooth. The cheap plastic ear hook ring snapped the first day I used it. They are poorly made.",6
B004JZFWVO,"This case fits my new verizon iphone like a glove. I have had this case for a little over a week. I love this case. It's not too bulky and fits the Verizon iPhone 4 well. Still a nice case, just watch the advertising. It's a great case. I had a white one before, took good care of my phone.",8
B004LZ576M,This book was bloated but interesting. We get a glimpse of horror. Other than that it has the most evil people in history. The book was interesting at most. I couldn't put it down.,6
B004MGCD0I,"The case did not fit my phone and broke while trying to put it on. It also makes the phone bulkier than other cases i have had. The cover is very pretty. I already ordered another one. Seems to be good protection for the phone. Don't waste the money, it was an expensive lesson to learn. IT IS NOT RUBBERIZED.",8
B004RE2HS8,"I love pink so of course, I liked this case when I seen it online. It's a good buy. Very cute case, fits perfect & the price was great!! doesn't even look like it'll protect the phone.",6
B004U349UA,I really loved this story. Return this one to the self-publishing slush-pile it came from. I guess this book just wasn't for me. I will definitely be on the lookout for more writing by this author. That is for you to decide. With a little work this would probably be a much more enjoyable read. This story is intriguing.,8
B004VMZZ3K,"Does this means that phone is locked? I expected an unlocked phone. I got the unfreeze code from the customer service. Highly recommended. I recommend this seller. My little brother didn't have a hard time getting used to it. A nice phone, although a little pricy.",8
B004Z29550,"Nice product dependable. Me gusta y se ve nice, pq si, h h h h  h hh h h yeah! Get more than one at this price. this case cover is ok. i thought i would be using it more often. Items was suppose to arrive to me no later than Jan 6.",7
B004ZGH062,the phone its self is great and looked cool and lean. It is easy to setup and on the Sprint network in minutes. sometimes it freezes.,4
B004ZS9ZP4,"It has a smooth touch to the case. Love the case, it fits great! The phone is uncomfortable to hold now and I'm disappointed. I am getting ready to purchase other colors.",5
B0052CHOS2,And now I can have the best of both! Excellent service. And it looks cool! For the money it was worth a try. I ordered this item thinking it would make texting easier.,6
B0053O8L6I,"It fits great on the phone and comes of easy. Would buy again. I like the texture a lot. They look great. compared to the price, I love it!!! Like the edge of the case is.. not well painted i guess? but its not that noticeable. I would spend the extra money to buy a product that is more quality.",13
B005441EVQ,"Nice, nice, nice. Not sure why, but that was the only let down. Last 2-3 hours longer then when trying to recharge your phone. A little heavy also for a phone. Definitely a perfect buy! The battery pack really did double my HTC battery life. For the price you can't go wrong.",8
B0055AWHP6,"I got this book, like, when it first came out. I think they should have had a native-English speaker proofread it. I love this book! This book really is for dummies.",5
B0055BKII8,It provides no protection whatsoever. And it's already dirty after using it for only 3 days. Not complaining about the price though! The design chipped off the case within 48 hours of arrival. I love this case. I should have known. The covers for the screen are good.,8
B0055S1U1K,"Product arrived earlier than expected, and fits its description well. However, it was a gift for a friend and she LOVES it. Boy was I surprised. It is cute and handles well.",5
B0057BE9PO,"This phone is great for talk, text, and email. I love it with my busy lifestyle. Great deal for the price! Does pretty much everything I want and need out of a phone. Highly recommended.",6
B005AMUTJ0,"All of them re really confusing ad don't make sense. This book really makes you think a lot. When I am board, I read this book for brain problems. Great reading if you enjoy
Riddles. Awesome book like it.",6
B005BA72GO,"Purchased a different phone from Amazon.com (not through, but from!) Used... but did not meet expectations from what I read. Minor surface damage. Big let down for me. Lo recomiendo 100%. Si volvera a comprarle a este vendedor.",11
B005BINK4Y,"What more can u ask for in a phone. Qik works flawless when using the Thrill. A little tough to install but better after this upgrade. Phone constantly reboots. Which is more than I can say about the iPhone I traded for it. I'm loving this phone. The 3d screen is hot, and the screen size 4.3 is even hotter. It's still stuck, to this day, on Android 2.3.x. The phone has tons of features, you just have to find them all. Overall, great phone. The battery's gone within an hour or two.",15
B005CERU0M,"I like the product, I've ordered quite a few for people. Usable and handy! Even its not what I am expected i do like the items. Probably it can have room for improvements.",5
B005DFEFDU,This book is one where I will think about it over and over. It is mildly disturbing. All my items were as the seller described and promised them to be. Even the ending was completely boring. Very uninteresting. Riveting if you enjoy a yawn a page. thank Heaven it does not describe all Brits.,8
B005DMMEMM,"I found the writing very clichd. So yes, I was very disappointed. I expect more from a book. Love Virginia Henley! The history and romance is an excellent combo. It is a well-written story, but nothing memorable, at least for me. It was that shallow. Who complains about free e-books? Why not call her Malmsey, or Hippocras, or Claret? Even Madeira would have at least been ironic.",11
B005I0GXO4,"The characters are explained quite well in depth. He doesn't know women or men. I was very disappointed. I agree with most reviewers that the sex scenes were way overdone. If I want Porn, i will buy it.",6
B005ISQ7JM,I was expecting a walk through the HTML5 specs and how to use them. Gets the point across about new features in the world of HTML. Good introductory book. It was FREE but hardly worth the effort to download it to my Kindle. It's OK for general knowledge.,6
B005JPT86S,"Most of the ideas are things to try like coconut syrup on pancakes. This is a well thought out list of must do things while in Hawaii. ""take a walk on a beach""... really? Very short and lacking specifics! There was not much in it.",9
B005JYUWVY,"When they finally get it on it feels so real, deep and exciting. Great easy read while sipping a hot cup of tea. The plot is exciting. I didn't realize this was a short story until it ended super quick. The story by the way was horrible. Hot and entertaining! Can vividly see what's happening with the written details.",8
B005KDF8QI,"Easy to put on, but doesn't come off easily. This item was great at first; Love the color, and the stretchiness. I got it for a friend and she liked it. It constantly falls off and is more annoying than helpful. So, all in all - good product for a short time. Wasnt the right one. :(",7
B005OGO2AY,This is the best one I have found. It is well worth the price and it works great. I don't have 20 words to say. Icons for events look great in month views. Highly recommended. Do not like the fact that only certain holidays are included. Love having the CLOCK also.,8
B005PUZO92,The sound quality is good for both music or conference calls. It is unfortunate because the headset is great without that detail. Sometimes difficult to lock on the extender position. It looks good and is comfortable.,5
B005PVXIVM,"Complete garbage. They are temporary/disposable earphones at best. The fit is excellent and the security of the over the ear helps. just not the headphones it came with. The sound is average for a set of gym headphones. very happy with my purchase. All that said, I didn't expect a lot for the price.",8
B005QTTDZ8,THE PHONE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1 MONTH. She really likes the large bright screen and ease of use.,3
B005T54NYK,"It is there though, and is a complete story. This was a teaser, not a short story. This was horrible!!!!! I don't understand why it even got published. The story was written from a cat's point of view.",10
B005W5W006,"It is cute, it doesn't cause overheating. Excellent product. BUT I CANT COMPLAIN FOR THE ONE PENNY PRICE, RIGHT? have had it several months with no problem and it is attractive. Good product for the prices.",6
B005Y2MYNK,It's an interesting short story. It was a corny plot with an even more corny ending. I didn't like it. Nice and hot and heavy. It took my breath away reading this book.,6
B005Z18ULK,"I constantly find myself trying to make it louder. They also have superior noise cancellation. good for the gym IF you don't sweat. I sent mine back for a refund. Sept 2013
The right ear bud as all but stopped working. It also quit working properly on the switch side. very expensive garbage!",8
B005Z19G7M,"They fit oddly in the ear and fall constantly. Ease of use is good. A bit too heavy. I loved the design and bought a pair despite the low ratings. They would not exchange it either or fix them. cause many people have this issue)

Sound quality : Great Product
Functionally, they're great. got the Plantronics BlackBeat Go.",8
B0061N848A,"An interesting concept for the story, but it wasn't executed well. The story was good, but it was short and unresolved at the end. This is a great series. I really can not care about these characters. Leonard, the Duke of Wentworth, has set his eyes on Lady Augustine. This is not for those looking for a rich reading experience. one of the worst prequels I have had the misfortune to read. Forever and a day
3.",9
B0063672C4,Or white guys too. Well written and very descriptive. You must be kidding. I could not get past the cliches on the first page. Here I thought if was a romance novel!! Talk about hot and steamy.,8
B0064GYRFI,"For the price of the product, it definitely fulfills my expectations. Fits the iPhone 4s like a glove and looks nice. For the price, what can you expect
It is cheap. Other than that, it is a great accessory. All the buttons line up well and work fine. This is a high quality product.",7
B006DI8FIW,Not loose at all. My last bumper came from Apple and lasted well over a year. Guess you get what you pay for. All the side buttons came off. Would buy again.,6
B006G3C8SW,I order this three months ago and never got my phone case. But it is still a nice case I have recieve many compliments on it. As good as any i have used.,4
B006PNKS2Q,"This junk was HOT. Got myself a sexy, well written short story for the fap file. I would not purchase again and would not recommend it to a friend. jump in for a great quickly! The second one was very predictable. Absolutely ridiculous.",7
B006S4X7DE,"Couldn't have been more trite. Very disappointing. I'm glad I read it! It actually tells you to get other books for recipes. Not worth it at all
This was honest and to the point!",6
B006SKO09S,it may be the wrong unit for my hot spot. 5 days just to ship. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a portable antenna. I don't think it's having any effect whatsoever.,5
B006UCVJKM,"Not a bad read at all just expected the ending to have more to it. It just doesn't really go any where. And it certainly isn't ""revealing"" into the ""psyche"" of youth. Lovee the book except how it ended. I read a lot of books and try to read new authors. We try to pin down the reason. They wil be familiar.",8
B006VYMHT6,I would order it again. Don't buy this one. Exactly What I Wanted!! Would Recommend As A Replacement To OuterBox! You can't beet the quality and price of this.,7
B006W0PPAM,"Useful for the time being, but won't last you very long. Cheap plastic, doubt it's rubber. Doesn't even hold together. Nowhere near durable. I give it a one star because its a two piece unit that snaps in.",6
B006YXIF8G,"This is more like the home version where you only have two rolls. and the goal is to reach the winning total before your opponent. It is a very limiting game. Each player gets three rolls. A roll of 4 of any number is worth 1,ooo points. Not at all boring.",7
B006ZDPPBA,The content seemed very good. but it needs an index (preferably active) to find things. Very very disappointed. If Mary wants us (readers!) This is a great informitive book!,6
B00761OU0C,"I read the reviews, I didn't think it was THAT bad. Despite English errors and typos the flow of the writer is very good. Off to investigate. The writing is horrendous: "" LEAVES you question ing what's next? Stopped reading at page 5 couldn't continue. Yet another sex story about teen angst.",7
B007CE0ZA2,"Like a modify android only to Chinese market. Totally useless in America. It only had one GSM and the other slot fits something else. cumple con todas la expectativas,100% recomendable. if you are not chinese, don't buy it.",6
B007FWO19W,"I'm sure this effort may be worth reading; however, not on my dime! Nobody could be this deluded and silly, right? SO,
the answer is, you are not really Americans. You should move.",5
B007HIMU3S,"It will not work in my Kindle and is therefore useless. Can we get a similar book on drums next, please? You can't fake talent.",4
B007Q2ZKD2,"I cried a lot in the first part of the book. Janes death is heart wrenching to watch. Although a very sad one. I enjoyed the book very much. This book has unrecognizable characters and awkward wording. It seems to defy conventions of the time. Fanny Bennet is cruel and not simply silly. They usually not an improvement on the original, but they are fun. I read this when it was a work in progress on an online JAFF forum. Download the sample and try it first. I'd rather use it to buy your books.",12
B007RRPPH2,That single fact felt like deceit. Disappointing add on. Everything in the package works great with my kindle fire. Best value out there. The cover didn't fit my kindle .,6
B007SJHHH0,"I purchased this as a gift for a teenager. This was perfect. But beyond that, it stinks. This is a very good case, but fragile also. it will break very easy if you don't know what you're doing. I got this to replace my otterbox cover. The white plastic is just cheap.",8
B007X90DNK,My daughter had difficulty putting the cover on her ipod touch. I love this case. But first time the phone dropped the case broke. Not recommended.,5
B007Y117IC,I haven't had any trouble with the jewels falling off. Case barely fit my phone. Pieces fell off after 1 day of having it!!!,6
B007Y73CGQ,It was exactly as promised. I'm hard on cases but this one is still holding up perfectly. It was not worth the wait. I'm disappointed. Looks nice on the picture.,6
B008327Z6O,"Looking forward to the next installment. Well done, Steve. Still..I will buy the next installment just to see what happens. I have enjoyed every one of Karmazenuk's Omniverse books. The story is great. The description of future technology is thought provoking. I have no idea what happened to this series. Good story line  Write faster.",11
B00853OGS6,"There are some lines showing after application. Thankfully, I have 4 more tries! I recommend it totally.",4
B008B92GJU,"Makes it difficult to raise and lower volume when on your phone. We bought a few of the covers. Comes off Phone easily. Pooooooor Pooor Pooooooooor Item. Not a good buy for your Razr
This is not what I expected. made cheaply and does not fit properly very disappointing.",7
B008HPAHDU,It is what they say it is and color is true. Overall a good product. It's a loose fit and doesn't stay on the phone. It's more like a Magenta color which was ok with me! * It is better than nothing though. Hope this helps!,7
B008OSES58,This cover is pretty thin It looks good and keeps the iPhone compact. This is really pretty but the flip top is a pain. This case is very functional. This is why I bought it. This is a great case for the iphone 5 - esp. good fast delivery; I do love the Color. I have to clip them every couple weeks.,8
B008SA15KI,"...what's more funny: Favorite line: "" May try again later. I was left wanting more. It's a mix of Steven Colbert and Garrison Keilor. Plenty of cheap shots at conservative values. Obviously the title lets you know the audience the book aims at.",9
B008UR3L6A,This was absolutely amazing reading. I wanted to finish. THIS MAKES NO SENSE! Really enjoyed this story but way to short!! Nothing in it that made me want to follow this series. Extremely short and it didn't feel like a complete story.,8
B008ZCO1QY,"Perfect fit, great protection, minus the top and bottom section. I had to spend $250 to fix the damn phone after having it for 1 week. think scratch protection. The case is good quality and easy to grip. It has cracked in two places since the 9 days i have had it. The matte finish stains very easily. This is a total waste of money. It does have a grip.",9
B0091V9BPE,"I have no idea where all the glowing reviews came from. This is an extremely short story. Talk about low standards! Aames spins a mean plot, too, with some genuine surprises. Communication between life and death is it? This isn't what I would or could call a romance. I didn't bother reading it.) Aimelie Aames is an excellent craftswoman.",9
B0096HVJGM,"It gets scratched ALL UP, which just doesn't work for me. This case is cute and sleek. I loved the color and recommend it to anyone who loves hearts. Description stated ultra thin. It's so thin that it's a little see through.",6
B0098FKJXQ,"Too hard to push the top on / off button. As others stated it is hard to push the top button. I would still buy this again. It fits
You get the intended thin body of the iPhone 5

Cons: Find something else. This is a great case for the iPhone 5. Clickable but needs pressure. Just a couple small complaints.",8
B009E5VHOK,"What's not to love about more Walking Dead? Fast paced, exciting. I liked the little tidbit, I just wanted more! Really short but liked it. All of the Walking Dead series is a page turner. Otherwise, it was a good story.",7
B009GSEHR4,"The price is great, hands down. Five sets of front and back protection in this LOW price? A good product with a low prize.",4
B009GSWUNM,Poorly written and poorly edited. I really enjoyed this boxed set. But I was massively disappointed when I started reading. the recipes were a bonus. Wouldn't recommend it. Not as good as other Amish books I have  read. I just enjoy reading about their customs and their lives in general.,8
B009HJUQ7M,They are now greenish and really ugly. Happy with product. It also adds a noticeable thickness to the phone. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CASE!! I like this case a lot.,7
B009JAE7NS,I wasted my money! I chose this rating because the cover seems poorly made.,3
B009JBABG4,The tab that holds it on the phone broke off so now it is worthless. Gave this as a gift and she was delighted with it. the case is nice and beautiful. You can't beat the price either!,5
B009T75ZNC,"Not to excited... you get what you pay for! :0)
Very flimsy. Spend the money to get an Otter box. This one is great for initial use. Great cover...nice grip, fits phone well. It's a very pale pink and it's extremely flimsy! But really not bad.",14
B009VY2QOE,"I was just upset that the fit for the Iphone was a little too snug. This arm band is exactly as described. put it on as soon as i recieved it, but it doesnt work. so you have to be the exact size as the armband to wear it. Exactly what I expected, however the band is almost too large.",6
B009X78DKU,I bought a white one to give it a try for my white Note II. It comes back flat as a cover. Its worth the money. It does not add weight to the phone. Delivered in 20 days. This item is exactly what was described A original Samsung case. For only 3$ the same case was listed for. Case is fine but not from Samsung.,9
B009XL4J4U,"I put it in my toaster oven and it turned into a pile of blue good. The first phone case I received was completely wrong. And clearly, you can't beat this price. Great durable case. Looks nice and is non slip. Very frustrating.",7
B009Y39ORY,"It's a piece of s***, & didn't even work. I don't recommend anyone buy this product. I so love this case. very popular with the family since they like light up things",4
B009YC0W3K,"Beautiful quality! Really looks classy and modern. I took a gamble on this case. Unfortunately, there's no felt on the sides. Dimensions (roughly, couldn't find a caliper)

height: I still wasn't too upset it only cost around $10. I have dropped the phone a couple times and the phone was undamaged.",7
B00A6SNTW2,"Great value for the 99 cents, so I would recommend. I should have guessed by the title that it was pure filth. I don't know what else to expect from short stories. I loved these short stories. The stories were short, and very formulaic.",6
B00AECQJ68,"To much of a hassle to send back! Thought it was more blue than purple. So It doesn't work. I like the pattern. Waist of money don't buy if you have an ATT phone
Pretty color.",6
B00AEEEUMQ,I recently got my Samsung Galaxy s3 a couple of months ago. It still fits in my i-bolt car dock ok. If it does then I will up my rating. keyboard function. She loves this keyboard. It makes the S3 literally an inch thick. don't even use it anymore. the screen doesn't rotate to face the keyboard.,9
B00AGDLWYE,"I Ordered this charm and it didn't come for 2 month's. And it never showed up. was disappointing. Unfortunately, the cat itself is not at all as pictured. But this product looks so cute, I really hope its worth the wait.",6
B00AJDBGME,"I've bought better cases for cheaper. Honestly, the studs for me stayed on for a couple weeks surprisingly. Thanks as she loves it.",4
B00AKQ082Y,"The story was very well written. And who is Brad ?????? Was a brad  a fleeting thought by our female lead? I loved this book. I know my man was sure surprised. But, in this case, I could take it or leave it. Quick story and the title says it all. This was an extreamly quick read, straight to the point. Austin or Brad??",16
B00ALAVS46,"I read on in the sample and bought the book. However, the main character, Mistral, was very unlikeable. Starts off great. Until of course she get's in love. Wouldn't recommend. Glad I bought the first book before seeing the negative comments.",7
B00AMRSNTQ,"The cover comes off all the time while in pocket . Wouldn't refer it at any price. i like the case, but it doesn't fit snug like i expected it would. I would buy again. It was good and easy to use. the case does not fit the phone correctly.",7
B00ARZIOE2,No depth to story. Didn't know when I purchased this book that it was a short story. It was a nice story and I like westerns. Vocabulary was not faithful to the time and place in the story. It is just like the title says a Sweet Western Romance. Easy to read too.,7
B00AT1GM3E,I felt like I was watching an episode of her show. Kind of dissapointed . I just felt like I was reading someone's essay or book report . I was disappointed. Not much new here- covered in the own book.,6
B00ATJC2GM,This is a pretty good item. Its a waste of money. The picture also show a bluetooth headset but thats not included.,4
B00B04B0KY,"More of an article that you might find in a local paper than a book. Save the dollar. This is very much worth a read. In short, I love this account and it left me wanting to read MORE. This was my ""free"" book to borrow for my Kindle. Thank goodness it was ""free""!",7
B00B0VZSEG,I was expecting a bunch of short stories and got a bunch of Intros. Eloise is a great romance writer and enjoy her books very much. I get there was a good plot some where . Great way to showcase new books. Very disappointing. I was disappointed. I fully admit skipping over the stories I do not really get into.,8
B00B1FDWDK,"There were many good useful applications in this book. -I'm just that awesome
Definitely worth a look thanks. I was surprised by the apps I'd not heard of yet. It's good bro! #",5
B00B3FROF0,The case fits very nice. The case came 2 weeks later than the first. I am so hapy I placed the order. This is my favorite case so far. I would recommend it.,6
B00B3MSD2G,It's like they took a book and divided its chapters into mini books. Don't bother with this one. Very disappointed. It is written very well. Sicily Yoder is one of my favorite authors. I managed to finish the volume but only because it was short.,7
B00B84UZKW,This was a great short read! I couldn't stop reading this book. Expect it to be as cheesy as the cover. I love the romance but this was not for me. Two stars from me. This was a good read. I wish it had been a full novel.,8
B00BFSM7YS,"Good follow on for The Vintage Tea Cup club
My fault! It was a bit bland but for a short story it was ok. I didn't rate it highly. Again, a lovely light read.",5
B00BJ53ANY,I wanted to see more stories about other children. this is truly a tear jerker and quite gripping! I was messmarized by the change of scenes. A great book indeed. The ending laft questions.,6
B00BJRCM3Q,"This one, at times, seems arbitrary. The author complained, whined and longed for her home. We look for her next book. Happy reading!!! I thought it was an honest depiction of her life in France.",8
B00BLV5GPG,"This book is a quick easy read, that gets straight to the point. Not a long book, but exceptionally rich with solid advice. It was just what I needed to read. Well written and a fast read.",5
B00BP0EZ3M,"The storyline is OK but the language is rougher than I would prefer. Great story and very good writing. But, a good read and fast paced. Book lack depth and focus. The characters were a little one dimensional, but got the job done.",6
B00BQYE9H4,"Did not hold up well for normal teenage usage. I probably wouldn't buy another. I was a bit hesitant when I read the buttons were stiff. However, mine are great! Galaxys4Active phone case is a little bit bigger than this one. I need a case for S4 active. 2) Headphone port is too small. So I got one for my S4 and it was pitiful. I'm not happy
well constructed case.",10
B00BWVIN9G,It does allow you to reposition but it isn't as easy as it suggests. Works with s-pen and feels like its not there. In conclusion - it's worth the price. The clear protector worked great though. Good for its purpose. Would recommend others to buy this product.,7
B00BWYDQ36,"It's full of unreadable poems in the beginning; Difficult to find a particular poem. So large I am still reading it, every page a hidden gem.",3
B00BXVHEZY,Would not recommend to anyone. I thought It could of been made better. But with a product like this it has to fit multiple applications. Only fits small purses. Great for my new car. Keeps my purse from spilling all over the seat and floor of my car.,7
B00C0ZJ42S,"The first thing you notice about the Armor Series Case is its heft. Very protective! The case was too bulky for my day to day use, but I will make due. For this price I expected more. I would not recommend this case for the money.",6
B00C6NHLC4,"Such an unbelievably beautiful love story! I truly enjoyed not having a cheating Hh in the story. I didn't like it. Found this read boring. It was quite a long read and very detailed. It was well written. Like, my rich handsome boyfriend.",8
B00C6OORDO,"It is a hard case, but yet it has a soft feel to the outside of it. Other than that I do like it and the shipping time was perfect. This is an okay case for the price. Overall it does the job. Would purchase again!!",7
B00C74I9Z0,I totally love it! The sticker is raised. It looks very pretty on my iPhone.,4
B00C9TRH7E,Interesting pamphlet. Not exactly War and Peace but  worth $.99. I will be looking for more of this type. Great short read! I really like Josie.,7
B00CAE71L0,Good info but my husband would never allow it bc of sports. I liked the ideas in this book; Very poorly written. It helps to be reminded again what you might have already known. Only a few pages were actually on topic......cutting your cable bill. Happy I grabbed this one.,12
B00CHQOT2K,No real insights; It is a good read fast moving study of what not to do. It was interesting.,3
B00CINM2YE,Very convenient for walking or running. It wouldn't stay tight on my arm. The fit was wrong. Arm band pinch my arm when trying to adjust. It's great for running but not for lifting. I wanted an armband to hold my phone while walking with my dog.,7
B00CKH0X2G,"I liked all the stories. Wanting to read more!! I liked all the stories but. The cliffhanger had me wanting more. I have most certainly read more riveting, and consuming stories. Good way to pass time
Didn't like the writing. Not one I will save to read again.",9
B00CKW2V3A,"Phone slips to the side and then you cant type. Purchased this for my sons birthday. I love this case! I like that I can use it without taking it out of the case. Other than that, it's the perfect iPhone case.",6
B00CLRN47G,"Not even worth the 10$ I spent on it, fell apart in a week. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I am so glad I bought this case! The material is very cheap and inflexible for this case.",5
B00CMRF9YQ,THIS BOOK IS NOT 200 PAGES. Then the book was short! Referring to the sucking of toes. Not that interesting. These girls really were young & dumb (as hell) lol. This is definitely a good ready for da Young n dumb!!! This really takes place in everyday life. Glad this was only a dollar or else I would feel cheated.,11
B00CRAR2GQ,"Just the white color, get dirty very easy. but it's a good buy for all...
The item I received is clearly used. Extremely cheap! And case did not fit S4 well. Not too pleased with this product.",9
B00CU8OK88,"The fit is great, love the color. And it is the exact same phone they said the case was made for. Average product. It does its job. Wouldn't purchase this again.",6
B00CWL34IK,"Bought this with all of the other toys to go with my new s4. It's way more convenient than this mount. absolutely useless. Not good at all. Worked great, but needed to remove the phone from the otter case. Phone fits in it really securely.",7
B00CX1LJJK,The ears are a little too flexible. Then for some reason its a big cut on the side ..never order.! This is a 5 star case. I ended up getting my product a little faster then expected. If you are really set on this case I would suggest it again. Totally 100% awesome! It's a little lose.,11
B00CY0MAJ8,This is a really helpful little device ---- for as long as it works. I have to find it to retract the cable. Item as described. No problems at all. make this product stop mid-wind and you have a winner. To me they are unusable.,7
B00CYNN4ZO,"My charger isn't the one that came with the phone. Which makes it a pain to use the touch screen. not only is it cheaper than the lifeproof its a lot better. Specially for the price!!! its cheap plastic. so, it does keep your phone dry and dirt free!!!!! It doesn't have a switch for me to switch from vibrate to sound,
2. Really I don't think it was worth it. Live and learn I guess.",16
B00D1PGELA,"It went straight back. Pictures are only OK, if it fits exactly where needed. Not really worth the time. Buy a tripod if you plan on using the telephoto more than once.",5
B00DD5UYOG,This is probably one of the best purchases I have made so far. Haven't had any problems. Now I can use my phone all day without running to a charger. Case protect the majority of falls. It worked ok for one day then stopped charging.,6
B00DD6ICX0,"Case looks nice but it is not strong enough. Haven't found another case I like more unfortunately. I love Spigen products. They look sharp. If you do, then the case will not last at all. When it came with the whole case the frame broke with in a month. Then after ordering a second frame it broke again in 2weeks.",8
B00DGXS9VK,"Borrowed this book on Amazon prime, and I'm glad I did. I did the Adkins diet twenty years ago and it work then. Calling this a book is a stretch.",4
B00DKHJZUQ,There was a lot going on in the story. The entire book was the same way. I don't know who edited this book but it was very poorly done. Very disappointed. A very good story about the Seals that I enjoyed . The expression is for all intents and purposes.,7
B00DYJ0ZNG,you can buy much nicer for just a few bucks more. The hunt is over. This one is good for THE PHONE! I used this case for about a month before it started coming apart. The edges are held together with a glue. The case fits the Samsung GALAXY S4 Active perfectly. But it isn't supper variable.,8
B00DZG2XK6,"Just don't like how the skin sheds off. Very cute, but not too durable. The main part of the case is not soft at all. I got so many compliments on it, it's so adorable. This item took a long time to arrive, which was expected. I waited forever for my case and did not receive it.",7
B00E6AQ96Y,"In my opinion it is definitely not worth $20. The one I received is different from hers. Highly recommend. Not ideal for summer running. In addition, it gets very wet because of sweat and is hard to dry.",6
B00ECN4PWA,"Confusing,Incomplete. I absolutely loved these books. I just relax so much when I read my Amish books. This last one was difficult because of the many typos. the  spelling errors
and the. Sicily Yoder is a very good writer of Amish  stories.",7
B00ECUG9TA,Maxine quit her day job and opened her own chocolate shop. This lit a fire under Maxine and her grandma Ellie. There were too many punctuation errors; too many incorrect words; The proofing of this book however was terrible. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It keep my attention and totally surprised me at the outcome. I could relate to the characters in this one. And who doesn't enjoy reading about chocolate? It's a worthwhile read I recommend! Chocolate Martini anyone?,10
B00EDYL3FU,What a disappointment! I really enjoyed this book by Sylvia Day. Once I started the book it was very hard to put it down. Story line is very exciting. I was disappointed.,6
B00EE7213E,Screen died after two months of light use. Very disappointed. Still ended up buying a new phone. If you own a HTC ONE X AT&T...DON'T BUY THIS. bought another screen from another place and it work OK.,9
B00EHSUFD8,Wonderful and exciting book. Love Cindy & Mattheus. The one less star comes from the poor editing of the e-book. I'm going to read Book 1 next. I couldn't find a single character to like in the entire book. I was drawn to the characters. The dialogue was juvenile.,8
B00FCNKTPQ,"The poor grammar was too distracting. It would have been safe but a cellphone rings. I really enjoyed this book. I only write reviews on those I truly enjoy. I enjoyed the plot and the characters very much. Let me start off with that fact that I did not finish. Editing aside,  just a very ho-hum boring read. Sounds beautiful where story takes place.",9
B00FUUDP1G,"This is truly a good HEA. I was totally into this story I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters except for that snake in the grass Ruby. Can this be true love ? Of course, being a love story, they do fall in love. I'm glad it was free. It turned out to be a quick page turner.",8
B00FVXZ57Y,Don't waste your money. Or how many howevers do you need? It's a must read for growing garlic and doing it right. Buy this specific brand of garlic. Not too useful to me.,6
B00GATDL7O,I love when the crew starts in on their shanties! Highly recommended! There's only a few of the good shanties on the album. And it's only 16 tracks.,5
B00GB0VRZA,I enjoyed this little love story. I thought this was terrible! I couldn't even finished it it got so boring and lame. You cant get lost in Hannah or any one else in this book. Exciting book hard to put down.,6
B00GG02SIA,"This is you reading my review. If you want to make a mystery boring, well this is how you do it. The ending was satisfying. The swim team milieu was interesting and full of detail.",5
B00GZAZX2O,This had a good spin on the shifter romance genre. Both of the character are unlikeable. A very good book. This was not the normal alpha wolf story but I loved it.,5
B00HEWJO7W,"This was a different yarn for me, but enjoyable all the same. It is very short but entertaining. It turns into really BAD authors' habit! But if you like that kind of thing, go ahead and read it. Good story but too many loose ends.",6
B00HHH8B0U,"Swiftly paced, interesting concept. Enjoyable story. short story that was a nice thriller. loved the ending and made me wish for more to read. Very interesting.",6
B00IDNLAOQ,"It's worth the price. It was a quick and engaging story. 10 minutes or so. It's only a few pages, and of almost no value to anyone.",5
B00IGK7IRO,"fun read  He clearly loves what he did, the good and the bad. A very enjoyable read. I am a just learning to sail so this was fun and informative for me. Easy to read and entertaining too! Whatever happened to the ""Ready about?""",6
B00IGSMYHK,Ms. Mathews presents those points very clearly. Don't bother with this one. Pass on this one. Also good at letting you know what pitfalls to avoid.,6
B00IJKERAM,"good interview about a subject that is not on the top of my radar. Finke controls him, and says very little. Highly recommended. Exceptionally honest - I love NF. An interview with Nikki Finke, I'll buy that for a dollar! Wouldn't recommend it to my friends. A quick, honest glimpse into the twisted world of Hollywood.",8
B00IY5RM04,this was a fun book. This took forever. Good thing it was free but still terrible. Not enough hot sex scenes. Interesting concept but a bit short on execution. It was a very good short erotic story one I will share with friends!,7
B00JPJQR4U,"Really enjoyed this series, waiting for the next book. A SciFy that is ok and then great at times. Other character development is not bad. I read the book until the end I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. a very good read. hokey hokey hokey.",7
B00JW1R79U,American Lara Croft wannabe. Very predictable. The FBI doesn't work outside the U.S. like this. Felix Leiter was CIA remember. Loving the last name.) My issue is the ending was very anti-climatic and abrupt. I'm curious to see if the author gets better in the series.,10
B00JX4TOLA,"The characters themselves also weren't that great. I definitely won't be trying out book two. suspending reality just didn't work. Still I liked the book. This could've been a great read. Trevor did not enhance the story for me, now the mysterious caller. Just tell the man already.",8
B00K7Q8I1A,I liked the story but could of had more to the story line. This novella took like less than ten minutes to read (if that). I am hoping for a better ending then the first. This was new to me. It works out and Matt really does like Penny.,6
B00KFAT4QG,"Too much about Bill and didn't really get into understanding her. Wouldn't recommend it. Then it gave me an insightful view of Hillary. A somewhat disjointed look at the life of Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary"" Review:",5
B00LADYBSS,"Complete waste of time. Frankly, I was disappointed in this one..Mr. All are fine thrillers; Not a single likeable character in the story. The title doesn't lie. this is a short well written story.",8
B00LAGPOO0,"Anyhow at least it was free when I downloaded it. Utter rubbish, and the author must have been joking. I haven't been able to finish it yet. So I
started my own veggie garden. Enough to get you interested. Poorly constructed. I am thankful I purchased while it was free!",8
B00M179WOU,"An enjoyable beginning,but I got lost trying to continue to the end. This story could use some help. My only complaint is that I wanted more. Slow, stiff read. I can forgive a lot of things but this book fell for short for me. She really shines in this one. Loved the debt of the characters. I was satisfied by the end of f the book. All the Bennet sisters had happy ending.",10
B00MF8BJQE,"Your reputation is like your virginity; Very good efforts. However, overall I thoroughly enjoyed the novel! Well its all down to taste. Much of the novel consists of internal thoughts and monologues. I too am here because the author spammed some of my reviews. I received a copy of this in exchange for an honest review.",7
B00MN06YDM,"Really enjoyed reading this passion filled novel! Enjoyed it as foreplay. Not so much on depth and characters. The book is a must read if you love great hot love scenes this is it. Just the thought of not knowing what was to come, drew me in. Terrible editing, too. There was no story to it.",8
B00MWDIUKU,"Good but basic information. Out of date  Had to play around on my Kindle to return a book; less of a problem on the Website. Only you can tell, based on your pattern of reading."" Some good information.",5
B00NQ7K284,"First of all, wow! I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed reading it! Needed more storyline. Interesting theory. This won't end well
What a fantastic read!!! I cannot wait for book #2.",10
