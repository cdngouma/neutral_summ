B0002VQDVM,"It seems strange that Samsung would try so hard to make such a nice phone that includes great features (picture caller ID, dual LCD screens, intuitive menu,etc), and then forget the most important part - the phone.
The reception is great (at least that's what the phone indicates), but the sound quality is horrible.
It has some great features- it's very small, great display, the numbers are very BIG when you type them in on the screen...but the sound quality is awful.",7,82
B0009MYS9S,"2nd replacement set cracked after about two weeks.
The sound is quite good and the wireless freedom is brilliant, which is why they receive two stars from me, but the breaking and tightness is annoying.
Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful.
They work great, they are comfortable, the charge lasts a long time, etc.
These headphones broke in the first 3 weeks.",6,73
B000BI4KKM,"Good design, especially the earpiece but sometimes the audio quality is terrible.
But as an introduction into the bluetooth headsets it's great.
This is a good product for the price.
It also disconnects from my RAZR sometimes, but I don't know if it's the headset or the phone.
The physical configuration of this headset is quite good and fits almost any ear comfortably.",6,63
B000CQFMEQ,"The range on this headset is pretty good, I sat the phone on the other side of the house, and walked to the furthest corner (which is well over 30-33 feet), and I could still hear everything (keeping in mind this was a 100% charge), and they could hear me.",2,50
B000FYU4SO,"If you don't mind HUGE lies about battery life and slight underperformance as a pseudo-PDA, then it's a good phone with a few additional capabilities.
(2) Because I have my emailed account synced to the phone, my battery dies even faster.
Now I finally have a phone that will work at my house and the data card is a much better way for me to handle emails.",4,67
B000HDZA28,"I was able to call Italian and American phone numbers easily, but the minutes get eaten up fast when you can't just text instead.
Ordered this to have an emergency phone when I had to travel to Europe for 10 days leaving ailing parents at home.
I had customer service to help me set up the phone and then again to increase my minutes.",4,64
B000I8FWMK,"I like the materials, the texture and light of colors, not shinny, it gives a pretty good style and protection to your tablet.
I would not recommend this case as protection for a tablet.
This case fits great!
i had it on my note an so far its been working great.",5,51
B000JCDUFG,"The Denver Post is a well organized paper that helped me complete my work there easily and effortlessly.
I like the paper but, during the two week trial period, there was a problem receiving it on my Kindle.
I used to have a subscription to the Denver Post when they delivered it outside of the metro area, but living in the mountains meant that one good snowstorm equals no delivery until later on in the day if at all.",4,79
B000M92GLK,"Very good sound quality but people can't seem to hear too well when the car window is down.
The bluetooth itself fit comfortably in my ear, with some adjusting, no problem with sound quality on either end.
I've tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I've had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise.",4,63
B000Q5J2M6,"The Scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity, and handle wind noise far better than any Motorola I've used.
After evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range I choose this one based on features and reviews.
It is smaller than the 500, works just as well, has a few more features like bluetooth 2.0.
this is a great headset it works well comfortable easy to use and the price is right.",6,72
B000SRGF2W,"The characters were great and while it's quite short I thought the author did a good job with the pacing of the book.
I believe the author didn't spend enough time on creating a history for the characters and you are just thrown into what feels like the middle of a book.
This book is so short, I read it on my lunch hour start to finish (after skipping about what felt like 20 pages of smut) Not good...",6,79
B000WCWUWM,"I love  this story an  the author is amazing however I liked the second book better.
I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.
When the local pack Alpha continues to torment Laine, Dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover/mate.
I liked the plot and most of the characters, though Lainey was annoying after a while",4,74
B0018969BG,"Bought this initially with my Motorola v3m 2 years back - never had any problems with it- my friends couldn't tell if I was talking on the bluetooth or not.
I don't honestly know how I lived without this, I use Skype and often times get tangled in my headset, now its just so easy, works just like my cell phone, but FREE I make all my international calls free, I would HIGHLY advise getting this bluetooth, it literally changed the way I do business.",3,85
B001AS6J24,"Oh well for the price I got a cover that matches the color of my phone pretty darn close at least, maybe I will find one that does not slide until then I continue to chase the phone or leave it in my pocket.
This case might fit the phone nicely, but it isn't painted all the way around.
This case for my new ENV 2 phone is really close to the right color.",4,74
B001B4AAJ0,"Best looking case out there in my opinion and also comes with a clear film to protect the screen
The screen protector is garbage and the case could have been made better to fit the phone.
Since I will need to buy another screen (probably from the Apple store) - maybe the type that sticks to the iphone screen, rather than the hard plastic given with the Griffin, it makes the price of protecting my phone more than I thought when I found this product on amazon.",3,87
B001BB242E,"The stylish design is really cool, and if your background music is at a medium level it will cancel it out but let me make sure you know what noise canceling does, it makes it so when you talk on your bluetooth ex: In your car and the music is playing not too loud, it will cancel out the music and let the person on the other end hear you clearly.",2,71
B001E42QBW,"Since these things do not affect the functionality, it is still worth putting up with them for the extended battery life, but it is disappointing after a short time to have a shabby looking item plugged in to such an awesome phone.
I am also a little unclear when the phone is runnign off the mophie juice pack or the iPhone battery.",3,62
B001HVWUDG,"Then, there are little things here and there where there is brief static sounds, my bluetooth will disconnect itself once in while but that might be my phone, although I haven't had that trouble before, and I personally just don't like the plastic part that holds the bluetooth to the ear.",2,51
B001MYLTDA,"If you are somebody who uses some features rarely, like Web, email, or GPS, there is no need to carry around a big smartphone.
Wouldn't want to use them on here all the time, but for somebody like me who just uses it to phone and text, it works great.
When sending text messages sometimes its a bit slow, but I love the phone.",4,64
B001N48GGC,"Doesn't sound like the original version of the song.
This is not the version of this song that I wanted and it is very flat and boring.
I have the original Peter Schilling german version which is good, but amazon does not appear to have his english version which is what I am looking for.",4,55
B001NZ0WP4,"Simply because the album hardly got any good songs, the only ones worth mention is the intro, eastcoast/westcoast killaz, been there done that and the mel-man track called shi---n on the world.
""East Coast/West Coast Killas"" by Group Therapy consists of four emcees / rappers of killing lyrics of RBX, Krs-One, B-Real & Nas.
this is a fairly good album by Dr. Dre's company Aftermath, and there are some excellent songs on here.",5,73
B001PKTRVM,"The keys became unresponsive and the phone impossible to use after a few months (I could accept calls, but do little else.)  ATT warranty services was very helpful and shipped me a replacement phone.
This phone is for people who hardly tex,its great for taking pictures and making and taking calls.{The pictures come out great,and its very easy to use}Just be carefull using some of the features like games etc..They charge you for everything almost,and if your going to buy this phone,beware of the hidden cost,like 20bucks for texing,and roadside assistence and voicedial.",7,93

I thought it was an issue with the USB cord, but I have plugged it into the computer and the wall charger and both cause the phone to start charging immediately.",4,72
B002EOTJFM,"I fell with phone-in-hand and landed screen to the ground, my screen is completely fine and the cover has a bunch of scratches that aren't very noticeable since it is clear.
I'm notorious for dropping my phone so purchasing a durable clear cover was essential when I got my iPhone.
The cover was easy to use and snap on but always snapped off when the phone was dropped.",4,68
B002JWJYX6,"The case is ok, however, the clasp on the bottom broke the first time i tried to put it on...
One by one they would no longer snap in and the case finally broken a few days later.
You get what you pay for, and I would recommend avoiding these type of snap on cases.
This is a cute case at a good price; however, it doesn't fit quite right.",7,70
B002QIQ76K,"The screen protector was a little difficult to make sure it fit properly over the phone, but I was successful.
The case fits quite snug and I am able to open the cover for the USB cord/charger without sliding open the phone.
This is not the case for me as the little cover for the usb connector broke off the day I got it.",4,64
B002S5R4IG,"GTMax Stereo adapter, pictured with a 90 degree angled plug.
I ordered this to listen to the music I store on my phone using my nice Bosse headphones rather than crappy earbuds.
I was actually looking for mini usb to 3.5 mm stereo-plus-mic jack for my Samsung highlight mobile, this product is good for listening music from your mobile which I don't do.",5,63
B002V6A2PE,"I purchased this item believing it would be more flexible than the ""rubber feel"" cases I have purchased in the past, thus giving my phone a bit more impact resistance.
Case initially fits nicely enough and looks great on the phone.
I wanted cheap case to protect my phone while waiting for a replacement Invisi Shield.

B002WC7RKA,"GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A DROID CASE!!!!!!!!!
I use the belt clip which works well (make sure the tab is seated properly in the case before putting it over the droid).
I have had 2 of the Droid cases and both have broken at the tabs that hold the front cover on.",12,54
B0036FTZZW,"I really enjoyed this book, by an author I'd never read before.
I hate it when a review gives away the story so I'll be careful because this was a really enjoyable read with a great ending and I would have been sad if someone had ""ruined it"" for me.
I personally had never read anything by Charles Shea, but I thought the book was great!",4,66
B003GLIDRM,"I damaged my LCD screen while replacing a broken glass screen on my 3GS, so I ordered this.
I ordered this because my iPhone 3gs LCD was cracked but it still worked.
When I got the new LCD I installed it and now the screen does not work at all.
I damaged the LCD panel trying to replace a broken iPhone screen.
I found this replacement LCD panel on Amazon and ordered it.",6,73
B003SU4ZRS,"I have tons of fingerprints trapped under the screen protector (this is the 3rd product I've bought and have yet to find a good one).
If you buy directly from Wrapsol you know you are getting the newest release of their products.
The back protector works great, the big problem I had was how the side protectors fit...",6,58
B003UO175U,"Totally worth the price, I haven't found one screen protector that doesn't leave any bubbles, I applied the first one to my phone and it left a tiny bubble.
I went to best buy to find a screen protector for my iPhone and all the ones there were priced @ around $20 and up, plus they only had the glossy finish, but I found these online and have them a try, and I love them, plus they come with 3 of them.",3,82
B003VDC4PW,"As I will be looking to trade in my phone in the coming months, I didn't want to spend too much on a new screen protector.
I ordered these screen protectors mostly because they got relatively good reviews and the price was right.
I received the product only to find that the protector only covered the lit area of the screen...it doesnt cover the entire face of the phone.",7,69
B003ZHPWKS,"Don't be fool by this case it look great online but is a cheap plastic that you can fold with your hand and it won't protect your phone
I bought this right before the holidays, and while the case looks really cool, their plastic is not strong enough over the volume control, and this has broken twice.
The phone was protected, which I guess is the point, but the right lower corner of the case broke off.",3,77
B00403MNZ8,"added to my book collection for my kindle and I always have great reading material just at my fingertips from my phone, laptop or tablet
I thoroughly enjoyed ME, MYSELF AND WHY?, so thought this short little prequel would be a fun, entertaining read.
I can understand how it could frustrate others especially the way the crazy blonde talks throughout the chapter but, I love it and can't wait to read the book.",4,73
B0043RTJEY,"I giving it 2 stars because it's pink and looks good on my phone, the back cover is sturdy, and when the front piece of my case broke, I got another sent to me with no hassle.
I drop my phone a lot and am really glad I got this case.
The pink/white case looks great with my white Blackberry Torch.",4,61
B0044MPB2W,"I am a huge klutz and drop my phone all the time and the cover doesn't even come off.
This case is just as pictured and goes on easily but it is thin plastic and feels like it will snap in two when you try to take it off.
It is a very sturdy case that will protect my phone the only thing is the colors are different from the picture.",4,71
B0046SHQG8,"Great headphones for the most part with decent sound quality for the price.
I assumed that such a small headset in this price range would not be good enough for music listening, but this has surpassed my expectations.
Sound quality is awesome and the mic works great.
Sound quality was much better compared to the headphones that came with the phone.
Sound was good but the headset controls are why I bought them, so another set of headphones in the trash.",6,81
B004BB1OLI,"It is rare I give 1 star on a review, but on this purchase the wall charger froze my phone during use,and the rapid car charger doesn't work at all.
The car charger works well as does the additional USB cable.
The charger works at times but not at others, which could be because of the phone not the charger.
Car charger, wall charger and sync cable work perfectly, and the price for all those is really good.",5,78
B004CMIB8K,"Looks great and has a nice snug fit on the phone.
Great buy and I will be looking to purchase more colors in the future.
I wanted something to protect the glass from getting scratched (front and back) while being slim enough to still fit in my pocket and have some grip.
There are millions of case options these days and this one does a great job of protecting the phone when dropped.",5,73
B004EYI02S,"I purchased this Bluetooth maybe a week or two ago and it is not working.
I really do love this bluetooth its easy to set up and not hard to use, the only thing i do not like about it, is the ear piece that i cannot seem to get on right, but other than that it's an awesome piece for my phone",2,63
B004JZFWVO,"This case fits my new verizon iphone like a glove.
The case keeps my iphone safe and very easy to use all buttons on the phone.
When I received the case, I was disappointed to see that it did not come with the advertised screen protection kit.
The case is not at all bulky, the rubber sides have a nice feel, and the pink is very pretty.",5,67
B004LZ576M,"I enjoy true crime books and have read many and yet this one had several evil people I had not heard about and more information about others.
In his introduction the author made slight sense, but it fell apart when I started reading about his first ""evil"" person and I noticed some information that was wrong (30 seconds with google and 2 ivy league college resources), I confirmed it.",3,69
B004MGCD0I,"This case looks cool but it didn't fit my phone correctly and it took about an hour to snap it on and then when i finally got it on and dropped it for the first time....
It was cheap plastic, the picture chipped off withing the first two weeks or so and it did not protect my phone when i accidently dropped it, the screen was cracked...so much for being a shock absorbent product!!",10,74
B004RE2HS8,"The color is more of a neon pink  than is shown in the picture, but It's still a really nice color and it looks good on my white iPhone.
The color is more of a neon pink, with a bit of an orangish tone, than is shown in the picture, but I actually like this better, and it looks really good on my white iPhone.",3,65
B004U349UA,"I loved the twist at the end and can't wait to read the authors other stories.
This first draft of a short story is a good effort for a first-time author, but needs much work before it's ready to be released to the public.

B004VMZZ3K,"I tried plugging in an AT&T SIM, but getting a message 'Phone Freeze'.
This cell phone worked well except for one major feature that I really needed.
I even called AT&T and to my surprise, the lady I talked to said that my sim card should work in any phone.
Wish it had worked, the other features looked like it would be a fun phone to have.",5,67
B004Z29550,"This case did not fit properly and thus kept coming off of the phone constantly, to the point that I cannot use it.

I got two case covers for my phone a purple and a red one.
High quality case for a good price.",4,69
B004ZGH062,"So far the phone is working well but if I need another phone I will not be ordering it through Just Cellular, and I would advise others not to as well

This keyboard and case seem to work well on the iPhone 4S.",5,66
B0053O8L6I,"I love the bright vibrant color orange and was somewhat disappointed when I opened the package to see the cover looked slightly red in low light.
I thought the color would be more of the burnt orange look rather than the bright orange I received but it will work
When I first bought my phone, Incredible 2, because I'm very clumsy, I bought the ugly looking black case for over $25 which didn't last no more than 3 months.",3,79
B005441EVQ,"It worked as advertised quite well, doubling my battery life and allowing me to spend a whole day without having to plug the phone in.
Not only does it give me enough battery life to last the whole day (like carrying two batteries), but the rubber case is very comfortable, not too thick, and does a good job of protecting my phone.
This case literally almost doubles the thickness of the phone and makes it VERY BULKY.",4,77
B0055AWHP6,"Very good primer for anyone wanting to learn how to speak and understand Korean.
If you want a tool where you can learn some words and expressions, this is your book, but do not count on any methodology to understand etymologies, neither to understand korean in such way you could create your own phrases.

The Author is just using his Fllet academy story as a hook for ALL the sex scenes.",5,68

B005T54NYK,"I finally figured out that Kindle had opened the book in the wrong place and I found the exclusive short story which is a follow-up to On Strike for Christmas.
As I hadn't read either of the books these stories were connected to I felt a little lost.
Ok  not really what I'm interested in reading to short not not much going on seemed like the first chapter of a book",3,71
B005W5W006,"Really liked the case, it was on time, and was even cutter then I thought, I fell in love with the bees.
Case does its job in protecting Sprint Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch, however the charger did not fit while case was on phone.
I had to shave the sides of the case in order for the charger to fit.
They need to redesign the bottom of the case for connecting the charger.
Good product for the prices.",6,80
B005Y2MYNK,"It's an interesting short story.
I'll have to read more books by this author.
Kept me captivated and Loved reading this short story, but left me hanging n wanting to know more!!
Sex scenes are great.
Not really a plot, the characters weren't memorable.
It was just a short read.
It took my breath away reading this book.
It had a very good story line to it.kept you wanting more",10,70
B005Z18ULK,"I didn't expect these to compare to the Bose (wired) IE2s headphones I normally use but after using those for a long time, the Rockaway Headset makes my music sound like it's on an AM radio with an old shallow speaker.",2,41
B005Z19G7M,"I was not going to compare them with my Bose headphones for the sound quality, but they are good for being as small as they are and bluetooth.
the sound is great but if you want something that will blast your ears off these are not for you.
great battery life and easy to connect to your Bluetooth products.
Sound quality : considering this is a bluetooth device, not bad.",5,70
B0061N848A,"That way, you are not spoiling some of the story from Forever and a Day. Plus, I personally enjoyed seeing Leonard first as an older gentleman in the role of Roderick's father, and then in the novella as his younger self finding love for the second time.
I have had a great time reading the rest of the series, except for the ending of book ""2.""",4,67
B0063672C4,"A cheating housewife having unprotected sex with a man from a different race to pay her rent.
A little unbelievable but still a fairly well written short story.
I enjoyed reading this story about a couple who were behind on their rent, were being threatened with eviction if they didn't pay up.
This was a good story but it was just too short to be a satisfying read.",5,68
B0064GYRFI,"Fits the iPhone 4s like a glove and looks nice.
It looks good out of the box, matches my white iPhone well, and was waaay less than the overpriced bumpers Apple sells.
I'm not hard on my phone at all, and I only got about 4 weeks out of this bumper case.
The case did fit my iPhone 4S perfectly and all buttons worked well.
The light gray color looks great on my white iPhone.",6,75
B006DI8FIW,"This case appears to be red on the picture and the title but when you relieve the bumper it is almost hot pink.
All the buttons on the bumper work.
This phone case was pink more than red.
The lock button came off the bumper.
Looks good, fits good, but doesn't last very long.
The color that was sent to me is pink and not red liked I ordered.",7,69
B006G3C8SW,"This was a horrible case when I got it I put it on and it worked great just until about 2 days.
I order this three months ago and never got my phone case.
the colors were great because it represented my team but the durability of the product itself wasn't too good.
Other than that its a good bumper case.
Quality: As good as a Bumper can be",5,70
B006PNKS2Q,"The newest ones are great so I thought I'd read older ones...this book was way to short and was  rushed through what was suppose to be a `story line`.
Love sylvia day books.
I was expecting a novel, but soon realized I was reading two different stories.
It's like just reading a chapter of a novel
I just wish there was more to it, the story is so short - but it's a quick, enjoyable read.",8,76

I've tried many times but plugging this in makes absolutely no difference on the reception of my Mi-Fi.",4,71
B006UCVJKM,"this is an interesting story.everyone can learn something from this book.the firdt time i went yo montauk i knew i have end up writing about it.
It was a quick read (although I tend to go through at least a book a day no matter what length)and I really liked the style of writing.
I have since read a couple more of this authors books and liked them just as well....keep me interested the whole time!",10,76
B006VYMHT6,"the plastic is inside and the rubber is outside which is really bad way of protecting the edges and glass of a smart phone.
Kick stand Works well, AnD I Have Dropped My Phone At Least 8 Times Since The Purchase Of This Cases And IM Happy With It. Fits Motorola Droid Period.
Nice price and protects the phone though.",5,60
B006W0PPAM,"The case is also hard to take apart when you're trying to take it off the phone.
The case is good with protecting your phone
I didn't like that it was a two-piece case and came apart if my phone did fall on the floor
If you drop it splits up due to hard case.
I know it's hard to believe a plain white cover is cute, but it's really stylish and makes the phone look really nice.",4,78
B006YXIF8G,"I love playing it on my computer all of the time.
I have the actual game and love it but this electronic one is AWFUL.
I love this game but i wish it had the same rules as regular Farkle.
This is a good interprettion of a dice game which has many names such as Zilch, You're Out!
The game of Farkle the way I learned to play is very different.",6,71
B006ZDPPBA,"Would have to recommend this for the wonderful information, But if you wish herbal remedies for the United States this book is not for you.
Many herbal remedy books are organized alphabetically by the herb name.
A good book for someone trying to learn herbalism from the ground up.
I haven't read the entire book but overall it is very informative and helped me find what I needed with no problem.",5,71
B00761OU0C,"This read like a junior high short story.
Loved it it was simple the best book Ive read I would read it ten times if possible its great
I like some gay stories but not mad about this.
Rather buy the whole story in one book than wait for next installment
If you get this book, which I got free, it will make you want to read the rest of the series.
I really enjoyed reading this story.",5,78
B007CE0ZA2,"But only works if you live en China, no Google Play, no Google Apps, no Google services, you only can put English o Chinese language.
I was actually looking for dual sim both working for GSM network.
The dual-sim works perfectly as it should, but if you're just looking for a cheap dual-sim phone (Not smart) then you'll find cheaper good ones in here.
Good, but i have problem to install google play, and the language available is only chinesse thailandese and english.",5,83
B007FWO19W,"I  only have the sample download and knowing the credentials of the author (Jerome Corsi) of this book, I was dumbfounded to read  ""I was approached on this issue because I dislike  ""of""  the standard ...""  on page 2 of the introduction followed on the next page (page 3)  with  ""I instructed them to go at this investigation with no preconceived idea  ""that""  and I personally ...""",7,68
B007HIMU3S,"It is more about simple, basic guitar playing and little with the song.
I bought this book to assists me with learning to play a wide range of songs.
Some of my favorite songs have only one chord so I don't understand what's so great about the number three.
There are numerous ways to play one chord.
This shortly will be handy once I actually can play some more chords!",6,70
B007Q2ZKD2,"After reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, I can see how this book could be a very believable variation.
Darcy resigns himself to being Elizabeth's caretaker as she mourns Jane's death...not a lot of romance.
I am a fan of Jane Austen's books, and I also like the alternate takes on the romance of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.",7,60
B007RRPPH2,"I was a little disappointed in the charger/usb cable,for it broke the second day I had it,but the case was nice and the car charger works great,the headphones were dollar store quality..the screen protector is nice..you're definitely getting your money's worth in the case and protector,so all in all a good buy
The case, car charger, and earphones are very nice but the wall charger does not fit correctly into my Kindle Fire therefore it doesn't work at all.",6,79
B007SJHHH0,"I gave it two stars because I was lucky that the phone cases even existed and that it shipped like next day.
I love this case, its easy to take apart when my phone malfunctions and not hard on the hands- but the rubberized purple part of the case makes it hard to put in my pocket and the bottom charger entrance cover broke off by the next day BUT it still stayed in tact.",3,75
B007X90DNK,"At first had little difficulty snapping the lower part of the cover, once I figured out, fits and I am happy with this product so far
But first time the phone dropped the case broke.
Only thing the rhinestones are falling off of the case.
Definitely wanted more bling, like the picture shows it
It started falling apart a week after we got it and it was nice for a second .The value was good but the quality was kinda poor.",5,81
B007Y117IC,"arrived on time but it is practically made out of cardboard and plastic and wil not protect your phone at all and the jewels fall off after like 3 days
I love this case it is so pretty and fits me perfectly.
I did not like this phone case.
I mean it is a very cute phone case and at a good price....BUT after the first day 4 rhinestones had already fallen off.",8,73
B007Y73CGQ,"Very Cute and I love that they send you  glue along with it in case you need it to touch it up.
Is a really cute case but the lace fell apart on my second day having it.
i like to change my case often, so this is just another outfit for my phone to dress up in every day.
When i got this product in the mail it looked nothing like the photo.",5,74
B008327Z6O,"The time hopping of the narrative is a little difficult to follow, but the story is a good one.
The chapters go back and forth in time without any way for the reader to figure out what is going on.
I assumed the authors were trying to simulate some types of alternate reality, like what would happen if you went back in time and prevented your father from meeting your mother, but the end result was just confusing.",4,78
B00853OGS6,"When putting it on the screen leaves a lot of bubbles!
It is good for protecting your screen and without bubbles of air on your cell.
The Product is the worst kind of screen protector I have ever seen or used in my life.
Cheap plastic protective film and it's impossible to stick it to the phone without bubbles.
So necessary for protect the screen of your Sony xperia P and keep it always like new.",6,76
B008B92GJU,"Does protect phone and has a very nice fit.
He had to remove the cover to charge the phone.
when i got this cover the black part was broken but it fits my phone nicely.
another i don't like is the cover makes it hard to press the power and volume buttons.
Nope Does not fit , camera gets covered up.
I bought this case for a light duty case and it was cheap.",7,74
B008HPAHDU,"The case itself was in good condition, but it is not the color I ordered.
If you are looking for protection for your phone, I would not recommend this case.
It comes off all the time when I take my phone in and out of my purse or pocket.
But Wherever I take my phone out of my pocket or purse, the case is sliding off.",5,66
B008OSES58,"This cover is pretty thin It looks good and keeps the iPhone compact.
I thought it would be like the old flip phones - no different than that.
This will buy me time to investigate a real ""protective"" case for the phone.
The red plastic inner case left red color on sides of my white iPhone.
Never ever buy this flip case unless you have a black iphone5.",6,68
B008SA15KI,"Readers will likely find these purposely-absurd ""fairy tales"" at least a little entertaining, especially those currently unenthused with the satirical target, the American Taliban--or ""The Tea Party"" for those with sensitive palates.
As a bleeding-heart liberal, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every cheap shot James Finn Garner takes at the Tea Party and other self-proclaimed super-patriots.
Stop reading Fifty Shades Of Gray and download Tea Party Fairy Tales right now!",4,70
B008UR3L6A,"There was nothing even tempting about the story that made me want to read anything else by this author.
The writing was clear & concise , the sex scene was very nice , I will be looking for more great stories from this Author.
This book is sick .I stopped reading it after about ten pages...
I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I READ THE WHOLE THING AND COULD NOT FIND ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES FOR THIS STORY.........",16,76
B008ZCO1QY,"I dropped my phone with the case on and it fell right where it wasn't and cracked my brand new phone.
I'm pretty sure if I used this case, I'd have to fix my phone, or buy a new one within a week because I was dropping it so much.
I bought this cover for my new Galaxy S4 and had only positive things to say about it until about 2 weeks of it being in use on my phone.",4,80
B0091V9BPE,"First, I have to say that I really enjoyed the author's writing style and would have read the book just for the flowing prose and lush little details, but the best part is that she spins a great story too.
It starts out much like the ""billionaire"" romance story structure I'm sure we're all used to by now, but then it diverges from there in some very interesting ways.",3,69
B0096HVJGM,"Although the case looks just as described, is super cute and adds no extra bulk to my phone, I was only able to use it for about two weeks and then I had to just throw it away.
the case looks cute on the phone but does not do much in protection from drops or liquids.
When I opened it up it looked so cheap and flimsy, would not recommend anyone to purchase this case.",4,75
B0098FKJXQ,"However the power/sleep button is hard to press compared to the NGP case on my iPhone 4S.
There is something different about the design for that button between the two models, and I don't think that Incipio has completely fixed the issue.
Even though it is harder to press the button, the amount of force is reasonable so it doesn't accidentally get pushed inside pockets, and I am still happy that I bought this case for my iPhone 5S.",4,79
B009E5VHOK,"I did also like that we get to see the beginning of the next book as well, but I just wanted to keep reading.
It's about 1/3 as long as a chapter in one of the two Walking Dead books so far.
I was pretty bummed that you really only get a few pages of content...the story itself was worth reading, but the first chapter of the next book took up more space than this story did.",7,77
B009GSEHR4,"Great quality for the price, but I'm going to replace it with an HD screen protector from Zagg here soon.
Good quality  it fits my phone perfectly, great protection for my iPhone front-back and i got a good price from this shop i live inGermany it costs about 5  for 3 front screen protectors I'm very impressed definitely going to buy more stuff from this shop again!",3,67
B009GSWUNM,"I have read a lot of books by Sicily and have enjoyed them all.
I was actually looking forward to reading this set because I like books about the Amish.
I enjoyed reading this book.
I am so encouraged by her writing and reading about the Amish women in these stories makes me want to clean my house and make some bread.
Not as good as other Amish books I have  read.
I enjoy these short stories of Amish families.",7,80
B009HJUQ7M,"The phone case fits fine and it covers the front a little which I liked but the sides are made of a different material then the rest of the case a got dirty almost  instantly.
The case fits snug to the phone and I like the glossy finish on the back.
Looks like the picture and fits the phone great.",4,60
B009JAE7NS,"The pearls came off before I opened it, and also the lace isn't glued down all the way and is coming off and I haven't even used it on my phone yet.
I got this as a gift for my moms new phone, and it seems very cute and looks like it will hold up with light use.
The white lace gets dirty quickly but for the price it's cute.",4,70
B009JBABG4,"If your looking for a durable case this is NOT it but if you want a cute phone cover this does it !
not very durable and breaks easy, would recommend if just wanting a cute look for your phone, packaged well, decent price considering and excellent shipping time thank you",2,51
B009T75ZNC,"When I get new phones I can never find cases right away.
When I first got the case it was great, but it started stretching and eventually I had to through it away because it didn't fit anymore.
This case is great, easy to put on, and I love the color.
Great cover...nice grip, fits phone well.
This case is NOT hot pink!
What a waste of time and money to order it!",10,73
B009VY2QOE,"They sent the strong size to fit the phone than I ordered.
I have small arms, so like many other users, I found that the band didn't fit.
This says it is for the iPhone 5, but I am using mine with an iPhone 4S (and it fits fine, even with my small case on it).
I have to take the phone case off in order for it to fit.
These where ordered for iPhone 5 and they did not fit.",6,81
B009X78DKU,"Imaging you phone looks: glossy black with sliver blue chrome edge and textured front cover with white trim on the front.
so buy this cheap one for now and keep looking if something better comes up for our amazingly awesome Galaxy Note II :)
Looks like the one Samsung sells for $25............just a better price and material feels the same to me.......buy it you won tcomplain",21,66
B009XL4J4U,"I didn't bother returning it because it still stays on the case, but I play with the loose corner like I used to play with the hinge of my flip phone.
However, it covers it enough to 1) not let the case fall off and 2) still protect the oh-so-fragile corners of the phone.
The corners of the case do not fit around the phone.",4,65
B009Y39ORY,"This case actually has a piece that allows it to light up.
Bright light up its good had plenty of people comment on it that's an awesome case must have but the flaw about it kinda take up the battery the only thing
I love the phone case looking for a lot ore products like this ..There good price and great as gifts",4,63
B009YC0W3K,"Case arrived in nice package and on time.
If you drop your phone one time this cover will break as mine did.
Nice case but cracked within a week due to design flaws.
Though, the second one I purchased was delivered broken, but with a case like this, wood glue works.
It is not as durable so if you drop your phone alot this is not the case for you.",6,70
B00A6SNTW2,"I enjoyed all four of these short stories, it was some very erotic and enjoyable reading for the holiday season.
I don't know what else to expect from short stories.
I loved these short stories.
If you are looking for a quick romantic read with a few tantalizing tales, this is a good book to pick up.",5,57
B00AECQJ68,"This case fits my phone perfect it snaps together and covers the phone great.
My phone is a lgls860 so the case was to large - I have mailed it back and would like to exchange it if possible
I like this phone cover and the design thats on it.
I could not even get the case onto my phone so I returned it and would like a full refund.",4,70
B00AEEEUMQ,"I love the phone, however I wanted an option to use a keyboard instead of the touchscreen so I immediately jumped at this sliding keyboard when I seen it.
The phone fits into a rubberized case, that case easily slides and attaches onto the keyboard.
takes a little while to get use to the keyboard but is a really great case.",4,61
B00AGDLWYE,"this was really cute i loved it BUT i put it on my phone got ready for work put my phone in my pocket when i went to see what time it was i couldn't find the kitty  : (
I ordered it some time ago as a Christmas gift for my sister, it didn't get here until after Christmas and it looks nothing like the adorable stripped cat in the photo, the paint job on the face was bad and it was all grey with no stripes.",2,88
B00AJDBGME,"It's a cute case and it doesn't come off easily (which is a good thing) but the rhinestones that create the cross symbol come off easily I lost two within the first week I had it.
But the floral case by itself is cute and still use it even though they fell off.
The case is really cute and all, but two of the studs fell off after the first day I had it on my phone.",4,77
B00AKQ082Y,"Short was right.hot if your into reading about the whole bondage domination thing.
Yes it was short but I think I need more than this offered and I give it four stars just for the steamy well written B/D personally would love to know more about the who, why, what fore of it all.
This very short story was a hot read.
This story was short, which could be good or bad depending on preference.",6,75
B00ALAVS46,"I read the whole book hoping my view of her would change because I liked some of the supporting characters and the plot ideas but when the book ended I knew I would not be reading the sequel.
My only possible issues were with the main character who I had trouble relating to until a good way into the book, and speed with which the story developed.
I had a hard time reading through the book due to the inconsistencies on Mistral's experience.",4,83
B00AMRSNTQ,"Case fits really loose, I do not see how it would protect your phone.
i like the case, but it doesn't fit snug like i expected it would.
Its bad enough that just by picking up the phone you have to put the case back on to even use it.
When buying a case for my phone, I would like it to fit snug with no gaps.
the case does not fit the phone correctly.",6,75
B00ARZIOE2,"Of the hundreds of books I have read over the past few years, this is the most poorly written one of them all.
This book is extremely short and while a clever story line, hardly  time to get interested before this mini novel ends.
The book was very good I like this type of romance stories.
Good escape reading but it left me wanting more depth of character and plot.",5,70
B00AT1GM3E,"I love Theresa and I love her show but this book was quite disappointing.
I just felt like I was reading someone's essay or book report .
I was just kind of disappointed and it only took about 30 minutes to read!
Reading this book helped me realize a lot of things that I've been sensing and how to deal with them.
this is a waste of money, spend it on Theresa's book.",6,73
B00ATJC2GM,"Good value for money as for the cost of a normal watch , one gets a cell.phone .
Works as designed, I have had no problems with the watch or phone to this point.
phone works good great sound best with blue tooth although the stylist broke 2 days after i received it other then that get what you pay for price was right ...",7,65
B00B04B0KY,"Just as the author, I've always felt a connection to ""Night of the Grizzlies.""  I still have the original paperback, which I pulled out not long ago to read once more, coincidentally about the time I ran across the essay while searching for a kindle version of the book and something more current.",3,53
B00B0VZSEG,"I make it a point to not read the extra chapter teaser at the end of books, because I don't like not having the whole story so I can read it.
I really like samplers, because I always find new-to-me authors/books I want to try!!
But, if you like all romance genres, then you should check this book out to see if you would be willing to buy these full length stories once they come out.",5,76
B00B1FDWDK,"Looking through the book and apps I was able to find others apps I could use as well.
Good basic info about apps so I don't have to spend a lot of time looking them up or trying to find them.
It was frustrating to read about a good app and not be able to use it.
This has a lot of good apps you will find very useful.",5,69
B00B3FROF0,"I loved it, the trouble is that the space to connect the charger is too small and it will not fit and I have to remove the cover so that it can charge, it is also very hard to press the volume with the case on.
Love it the bow fell off after a week or so but nothing a little bit of super glue couldn't fix!",3,67
B00B3MSD2G,"Owning a Kindle and being able to read these new authors that I may not have found out about is great.
Now I'm curious as to what will happen in the next book but not curious enough to read it with the irritating italicized Amish words throughout.
I recommend this book to others that love to read Amish Fiction!
Very good story, short, leaves you wanting the answer at the end.",5,71
B00B84UZKW,"This is the book for anyone who's looking for a short and quick read.
I got this free,so I have no problem with the book,if I would have paid full price,I would have been disappointed,but this was a quck sexy read,and it tried to be a romance book with somewhat of a story line,but basically it was just a quick sexy romp,it was an enjoyable read and had a loose story.
I have read some really great short stories / novellas lately.
Was a good short read.",5,87
B00BFSM7YS,"A very short book can read in less than a day and just a follow on from her previous novel - could have included it in the main novel.
Good follow on for The Vintage Tea Cup club
Not as good as The Vintage Tea Cup Club but kept me reading.
The original book was a light read but the extra didn't develop in any great degree the characters or the plot.",4,72
B00BJ53ANY,"It's poorly written, has underdeveloped, stereotypical characters and a boring story line.
characters were fully developed the story plot was was focused for the reader at all times a part of our history that needs to be remembered
I found it so interesting, and I wept tears while reading  and so there was sadness and happiness  all in the book.
This is a great story but it is poorly written and edited.",4,72
B00BJRCM3Q,"Having lived in 5 countries over the last 13 years, with only brief returns to my ""home"" in the US, I enjoyed watching the author's metamorphosis from wide-eyed & somewhat arrogant American to a person with some understanding of other cultures.
A whiny self serving young person who went to a foreign country to experience change and then complained that it wasn't like the U.S.A. Anyone who knows what it is to be home sick, or has experienced culture shock will appreciate this book!",6,84
B00BLV5GPG,"This book is a quick easy read, that gets straight to the point.
Good work that help to understand the life, and never give up, we have to listen our heart and remember everything.
This book is easy to read and insightful.
It was a good quick and easy read.
He brought up a few good points and quotes but I did not find this book helpful",5,67
B00BP0EZ3M,"i looked the title read the summery and thought seems cool but from the first page it was confusing it was horrible and just full of words like it wrote by a 5th grader
I think the author has great promise and just needs to keep plowing ahead.
I bailed on this book when the first female character was introduced.
From the first page there was action along with dialog beginning to tie together character backgrounds with the overall story plot.",4,81
B00BQYE9H4,"Once we put the case on, I had no problems pressing the buttons or snapping the port covers back into place, and the screen protector did its job without a hitch.
I've tried reaseating the phone several times, but to me it seems that the plastic rim that holds the screen protector in place gets in the way of the buttons.",3,61
B00BWVIN9G,"Good product, easy to install and looks great on, The price was great also, I would purchase from this company again.
The matte protector installed easily with no bubbles.
Matte screen protector sucked.
I bought this product after I purchased my Galaxy 2 Note tablet and I love the way it looks and how it doesn't leave any scratches or fingerprints on my screen.",5,64
B00BWYDQ36,"A rather conservative choice meaning 500+ Greatest poems would be in this collection which perhaps is some form of verification.
It's full of unreadable poems in the beginning; and by unreadable I mean words that look like another language besides English.
The poems at the beginning of this book are written in Middle English with no translation.
I would recommend this Kindle book to everyone.",5,65
B00BXVHEZY,"I love that my purse sits right next to me instead of spilling all over the passenger or back seat.
When my grands ride with me, my purse was always in the way - now - no problem...this is great!
This in theory is a great idea but it is a struggle to get my purse into the straps, once secured it does do its job.",7,66
B00C0ZJ42S,"I got to tear my phone out of the case before answering it so I no longer use the product
*UPDATE* The Otter Box is very protective but you cannot hear calls without opening the port at the bottom of the case.
We do not use it we tried it and we do not like it because you can not hear with the case on ether way
3 as a phone case.",3,72
B00C6NHLC4,"I Skipped A Lot Of Pages Until I Got To The Interaction partS Of The story
this story had a boring plot, very little action, and the author just kept rambling on and on about the same things over and over for pages upon pages.
I almost felt like the author jumped around a bit during the story.
Also, I felt that Effie was a little obsessed with Jack's money.",4,70
B00C6OORDO,"Also the picture is a lot brighter than what it truly looks like on my phone.
I live in NYC where inexpensive phone cases are very easy to get, for the price of this case, in comparison to those I can buy in this city, i would not purchase this again.
This phone case as shown in this picture is not what i received, it is much lighter than in the picture but i use it anyway!",4,77
B00C74I9Z0,"Theres times when I push the home button and have to push hard to get were i want too,which i should do that..
It looks exactly like the pictures , it lasted for a good while on my phone but then it fell off .
It looked exactly like the picture and the design was very well made.
The sticker itself is pretty , but I tied taking it off and It took my home button off with it",5,79
B00C9TRH7E,"Josephine Sarah Marcus Earp colourful life, deserves a much better in-depth rendering of the facts and details.
Good read for a short story.
It's hard to substantiate some of the material in this article-length piece, but it makes for a fun story and is worth a read for those interested in the Earps, the Old West, and / or Ms. Marcus.
I enjoyed this short story.
Very interesting and fun read.",7,71
B00CAE71L0,"I read this book today as another friend wanted me to cut my cable and save.
Author has taken great efforts to collect information and details that are very relevant to the topic and useful for those who want to save money as per their needs.
I really liked the frugal guide to cutting cable costs, there was so much useful information given by the author and it was fully worth the cost.",4,73
B00CHQOT2K,"But that doesn't change the fact that he wrote a great book about the Romney campaign, or that he correctly diagnosed the political consultant/marketer industry as being the primary problem with the GOP.
Go read, ""A Bad Day on the Romney Campaign."" It's $2.99 as an ebook, and is well worth it.
Failing to pay attention to Schoenfeld's book will result in GOP reforms that will institutionalize the errors of the Romney campaign.",6,73
B00CINM2YE,"Even then it is such a tight fit that the plastic is pushes up against the touch screen and causes apps to open or the screen to change, so you can't actually use the phone anyway.
Nice band and a great price but my arm is thin and the strap is meant for larger people.
The plastic part where the phone fits is too loose for the Galaxy S4, even with a case (slim Ringke Fusion).",4,76
B00CKH0X2G,"A waste of time...this book was lacking from beginning to end....don't waste your time reading it, it's very poorly written..
I don't care to read sex book but just make a complete story (long or short I don't care) about it.
This was a very good short stories this is my first time reading this author.
This book was good to read once.",13,63
B00CKW2V3A,"I'm really loving my way I Wallie iphone case because it's very practical ,it holds what I need to go to work, it's not bulky and it's just easy to carry around in my pocket, and the best thing about it I do not have to open it to answer the phone or make a call or text everyone that sees me with my phone want to know where I bought it so I let them know the name of the wallet and Amazon.com",2,84
B00CLRN47G,"came in fast and so far so good fits perfect and looks just like an otterbox.
But I would buy other things from this seller and I would recommend him to others
I ordered this product what seems like 6 weeks ago and I haven't seen it yet.
I am hoping that the case is able to protect my phone, however since it hasn't arrived I am unable to give it a review.",4,73
B00CMRF9YQ,"Also, as a young 20-year old girl I felt ashamed of my generation along with my IQ dropping as I read this book.
Wow. All the little Miss Knowitalls I know will get a lil something in their ear about this book so they can see for themselves how ""Young and Dumb"" they are.
These young girls are truly dumb.
The title of this book tell it all Young and Dumb.",6,71
B00CRAR2GQ,"So, It took forever for the cover to come, but the seller was super attentive and they made up for their mistake, I love the case it is exactly as pictured!
The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit hard to hit the volume and power buttons with the case on because the material is stiff, but headphones and charger work no problem, and the speaker hole is in the right spot.",3,75
B00CU8OK88,"The fit is great, love the color.
The problem is that it didn't fit my phone,my phone wouldn't go in the case.
Over price and not fit perfectly for the phone.
This case looks a lot like the original phone before the cover.
just got it....fits perfectly adds a touch of color to this great phone.holes for everything just right...will buy more colors",13,63
B00CWL34IK,"The charge cable winf fit my phone with the case so I have to use it no protection, the charge plug is oversized.
The Case I bought won't even come CLOSE to fitting into this thing even with the insert removed..
Unfortunately, we had to return this as it doesn't fit the Galaxy S4 case I just bought.
Phone will not fit in Mount with the phone case still on.",6,70
B00CX1LJJK,"Otherwise it came in good shape and coming from that long of a distance the package and the phone holder were in excellent condition.
It fits my phone great but to me the head looks a little weird.
kid loved it it was a tad loose on phone ears fall off easily
Just hard to charge the phone with the case on.
The ears fall off easily.",5,67
B00CY0MAJ8,"Be sure to get the plug a little longer than the earbud end so the buds don't come off every time you pull them out
I got this for my daughter so she'd stop losing her earbuds, and after only two days of use the recoil-action stopped working.
I really wanted to like this product, but it does LITERALLY what it says -- winds your cord.",3,66
B00CYNN4ZO,"My charger does not fit through the tiny hole so I am unable to charge my phone when it is in the case.
I didn't realize until I had started using the phone with the case on that it makes the touch screen a pain to use.
I was kind of nervous with testing it out but I placed the case in the water with no phone in it and it actually worked.",4,73
B00D1PGELA,"The Telephoto Lens is a little hard to keep steady in place on my iPhone 5s, but it has an amazing zoom.
The Macro, fisheye and wide angle lenses work good, but you have to be careful not to bump the lens because it doesn't hold in place very well.
The Macro lens, just like the telephoto lens works best on a tripod.",4,63
B00DD5UYOG,"The case works great, no problems with it except the back panel was loose when I received it and shortly fell off and was lost.
The replacement case was received and the back panel wasn't loose and works great.
Bought this for my girlfriend for V-Day, since she liked my UNU charging case so much..
It holds a charge just as a good as the Mophie case, only requiring a charge every 2-3 days with average phone use.",6,78
B00DD6ICX0,"I order this item beginning of May and now mid June, the protective case ""strip"" id broken after the phone fell from my pocket.
bought it to replace my original Spigen case in silver.
I bought this as a replacement band for a case I already owned where the orginal band broke.
When it came with the whole case the frame broke with in a month.",5,66
B00DGXS9VK,"Makes easier to understand the basic principles of the Atkins diet n offer a few tips not to fell off the wagon, so do speak.
The book is a quick read (~30 min) and provides basic information about the Atkins Diet.
This book contains more than enough information to help you get started on the Atkins Diet, begin to lose weight, and actually keep that weight off - there's even some tips on how you can speed up your weight loss!",4,81
B00DKHJZUQ,"I am addicted to military novels with Navy Seals and enjoyed the book but sorry to say, and please don't think I discriminate against female authors but they just don't do justice with this type of story line as well as male authors like for example Keith Douglass
Good book would recommend as good military read  there is an expression that was used incorrectly.",2,64
B00DYJ0ZNG,"Its called a wallet case for reason...so you can carry it around like a wallet, and even though it kinda does what its supposed to, it's  junk and will not last long.
The case fits the Samsung GALAXY S4 Active perfectly.
When I originally ordered this case, the name Active wasn't in the title nor the product description!
Case as made well and I wish I can say functioned well, but my phone would just flop out?",8,77
B00DZG2XK6,"I love this case, it is adorable!
Very cheaply made and doesn't fit my phone very well....to short all the way around not giving the phone ANY protection,fur coming off and it is brand new.....save your money and buy something somewhere else...took way to long to ship from CHINA and this is not a U.S. company.
It's absolutely adorable, I love it's precious little ears and fluffy little tail.
The case was really cute but after only a few weeks of use the ear fell off.",19,86
B00E6AQ96Y,"This item looked like it would fit the bill, but when I received it was disappointed to find it seemed rather cheaply made and was way too bulky.
I've washed it a couple of times already and recommend putting it in the dryer on high with other clothes because if you don't, it'll take forever to dry.
The wrist gets a little hot after starting running, but the band is nice and snug and the touch screen works very well through the plastic.",4,83
B00ECN4PWA,"It was a real good series to read I really enjoyed them.
Any one that like Amish books would enjoy reading it.
I am sorry but this was not done very well the author kept getting names mixed up and each new volumes chapters were repeated over and over know that I will never purchase a Sicily yoder book ever again!
First, I recommend that you read this series within close proximity of time.",5,74
B00ECUG9TA,"Recommend this book and author to those that like to solve crimes!
Apart from the punctuation and other editing errors mentioned by another reviewer, I found it difficult to read this book because the main character is frankly unrealistic and meddling in her attempts to solve the murders.
For the most part, I liked this story but I felt there were too many characters mentioned in the beginning chapter.",4,69
B00EDYL3FU,"I really enjoyed this book by Sylvia Day. Once I started the book it was very hard to put it down.
Loved the story, but oh so short and I wish there was more!
Too short wish it was longer more chapter need more to the ending  what happen next.
l enjoyed reading the book.
I liked the characters and story line but it ended too fast.
Very Short wish it had been longer only received about 10 pages.",8,79
B00EE7213E,"This horribly makes the whole phone look like junk, but, for now, I guess it'll work...
At least my touch screen works now...
I thought it was some app on my phone, but as it turns out, part of the touch screens ability to detect touch (mostly vertical scrolling) has stopped working.
The screen did not work at all.
bought another screen from another place and it work OK.",10,69
B00EHSUFD8,"I am enjoying this series however, they seem to b running the same story line...fianc,wedding,murder...more curious if Cindy &Matheius work out.
Have read up to 7 in the series and like the books.
I couldn't find a single character to like in the entire book.
Would like to read more of this author and see if there's better editing in other books.",11,62
B00FCNKTPQ,"Loved the book but way foo many editing errors.
I happened to discover this book while searching for a new cozy mystery to read.
Really enjoyed this book characters were great real creeps which is what they're supposed to be really great story.
Enjoyed reading this book.
The book is well written overall and I enjoyed the story completely from beginning to end.",6,63
B00FUUDP1G,"The story line is about those who have money and how the parents decide who they will marry.
Michele married her friend Brad not because she loved him but because her and his parents made them.
It was a quick read, but the characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue flat and trite, and the storyline both predictable while being pretty ridiculous.",4,60
B00FVXZ57Y,"This book covers all the processes involved in having a garlic garden, however it seems to me that there is a lot of information missing.
I have had gardens since age 8, but never had much success with garlic- this short presentation answers a lot of my questions & points me in the right direction.
The author's writing style is a real turn-To off, and to have a good garlic garden, there is a lot that this book doesn't cover.",4,80
B00GATDL7O,"I love the shantys the sailors sing on the ship in the game while looting and pillaging on the high seas!
It was a good album but only 25 total minutes of songs makes it almost not worth it.
I love the soundtrack to this game, I really do, I'm really disappointed that even on the so-called ""Complete"" Edition, we still don't get all 35 Shanties in one place.",4,69
B00GB0VRZA,"However, the author felt like she was in such a hurry to get the relationships set up with each other that there was no real story or plot to this particular book.
But did read the book all the way through and I though, as a romance, it was a nice book.
This book has very little plot or character development.
Like she wanted to write a book but didn't  have time so just slapped something down.",5,77
B00GG02SIA,"This is you wondering whether a story about a serial killer stalking a swimming team will be interesting.
The first two words in the title of the book is the way Ms. Murphy began many sentences in THIS IS THE WATER, and it seems to be her writing style.
I was looking for a mystery, but found a book mostly about swimming and the personal lives of the team's parents.",5,70
B00GZAZX2O,"I liked the book I thought it was nice love story.
I was reluctant at first when I realized this was a love story about a wolf....but it turned out to be pretty good.
Not what I expected wouldn't buy the second book for nothing this was a total waste of time and reading
This author has really out done it and all of her books, Good read with interesting  characters, cannot wait to read the next installment!",8,78
B00HEWJO7W,"This book was a rather good story and you will probably enjoy reading it.
I really enjoyed reading Murphy's Law. What got me was the way it ended, it left me a bit irritated, probably because I wanted more and it just ended abruptly.
The book was good, but the fact that it stops right I'm the middle of the story just ruins it for me.",5,66
B00HHH8B0U,"Very good short story I'm waiting on the next part didn't know people could be so sadistic but this book tells it
The story interested me and kept me reading quickly.
Weird and short the book was over before I really got a chance to get into it I know it said short story but wow
The ending could have been better and it left you wanting to know more.",3,70
B00IDNLAOQ,"Yes, the final shot is similar to the Hathcock shot but this a short story with good descriptive writing that shows both the frustrations and emotions of dealing with an enemy sniper and the patience needed to deal with a worthy enemy.
This was a very poorly written, short story, which I thought was misrepresented as a book.
Not what white feather would have done but makes for good reading for a short story.",4,74
B00IGK7IRO,"I wanted to read this book because we have the same boat and we're looking to cruise in the same area as the author writes about, but I couldn't finish it.
The experiences described in this book are ones that most sailors will encounter at one time or another regardless of the size or type of sailboat.
I dream the ""Dream"" and love to read and put myself on board for sailing & cruising adventures.",4,75
B00IGSMYHK,"For the person looking to landscape their home either as a DIY project or to hire people in the trade, her book will prepare you for both.
It might be a good book for some but I did not understand many of the concepts and decided to ditch the read and spend my time on other methods and gardening.
I have not finished reading this book, but it has been helpful in designing my landscape for my front yard.",4,79
B00IJKERAM,"Wish it was longer, gave me a real sense of Finke.
This interview with Nikki Finke was a revelation.
An interview with Nikki Finke, I'll buy that for a dollar!
All those years, regardless of what outlet anyone worked for, everyone read Deadline.
I got very little information from the interview.
The interview was very boring and not what I expected.",7,61
B00IY5RM04,"A hot steamy quick erotic page turner to keep the fun going
Like most ""shorts,"" in the genre it read like a one scene excerpt from a full length novel.
It was a good fun read!
It was a very good short erotic story one I will share with friends!
I could see all the characters, and just by reading, I felt like I was there watching.",5,67
B00JPJQR4U,"Other character development is not bad.
I read the book until the end I didn't hate it and I didn't love it.
a very good read.
a very good read.
Very good story kinda old west gangster space epic.
Good book a rather weak ending.
Not really what I like in Sci-Fi. I prefer much more character development.",9,58
B00JW1R79U,"This was a great fast paced adventure story with just a bit of romance in it.
I just wished the story was a bit longer :) Loved the main character,  Chyna Stone she is an intelligent  and knows how to take care of herself and the others in her team  .
This wasn't a bad story, reads well, but seems a bit short.",4,63
B00JX4TOLA,"good book to read if you like interracial like me, however it's a 3 part series.
Her and Carter seem like a good couple until the end something about her keeping a secret from him.
I liked how the story started out wish it was a little bit more detailed but overall a good read.
The story was good and I loved the characters.",5,64
B00K7Q8I1A,"Soon as they are discovered she takes off and the book ends....
This novella took like less than ten minutes to read (if that).
Love this book and waiting to read the other two
Sadly, even the little teaser at the end isn't enough to salvage what could've been a good story.
However i do look forward to the next book, the author left me curious and hanging.",8,68
B00KFAT4QG,"If you really want to get to know the real Hillary, read Edward Klein's book,""The Truth about Hillary."" I see some of the reviews seem to sympathize with her, just as you'll get people to side with Stalin and Hitler.
I am a fan of Hillary, so I knew I would like this book.
You are certain to enjoy this insightful look at our next president: Hillary Rodham Clinton.
""Hillary"" Review:  I found this book very interesting.",6,77
B00LADYBSS,"Fabulous short story book, I couldn't put this one down if you like criminal justice type novels you will be mesmerized with this book.
The author doesn't understand what hearsay is, and so the prosecutor ""reads the police statement"" of a missing witness to the jury in a criminal trial.
Good short story on what criminal defense attorneys are supposed to do like it or not ?",4,67
B00LAGPOO0,"Hm. I have found numerous spelling and grammatical errors within this book, it is not even a great reference as it contains basic information anyone doing a google search on 'homesteading' could find.
I haven't read the whole book yet, but I had to laugh when the author suggested picking a carrot off a tree.",4,55
B00M179WOU,"I really think you need to try this book for yourself, as I said, I did enjoy it and read it in only a few days.
I loved this telling very different they characters are true, I would have like to have seen more of Richard Mary and Anne I think those three made very interesting back story in this novel and would have made a great book by themselves.",3,70
B00MF8BJQE,"Written during a different era when a persons reputation was extremely important, this female narrative story authentically captures the mores of that generation with a snapshot in time and an engaging plot.
I like stories that feature female characters who have won through hard times and extreme adversity, and that certainly describes the lead character, Jane.",3,56
B00MN06YDM,"And...to know this book is loosely based on Kelli Sloan's life when she was younger, makes it even more enjoyable to read.
Good short story line with lots and lots of sex.
No real story line or character depth
No plot, no story, thin characters.
Boy meets girl, they have sex a few times without knowing a thing about one another and then fall in love.",8,66
B00MWDIUKU,"Very helpful and informative little book.
Good concise information as well as helpful insight into how Amazon works in general.
Only you can tell, based on your pattern of reading.""  - huge thanks!
Some good information.
good information just could have written it once.

great story, characters and steamy HOT !!!
Cannot wait to read the rest of the collection ...
I can't wait to read the next book.
The characters were alright, the story seemed like the author didn't have to go all out for the storyline.
I cannot wait for book #2.",11,65
