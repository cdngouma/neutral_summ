All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,great fun product looking forward to the next dress up party going as the tattooed lady,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,what a waste of money this product is waaaaayy over priced for it is poor quality i bought this kit to have my best friend pro artist draw ani had for a tatt on my arm we followed the directions to a t and it still came off within the next day the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use one marker never worked bc it was dried up and the adhesive is a joke it is messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross you would honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice invest in a real henna tattoo kit,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i would not recommend this product it is just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,pens work beautifull but after 3 days sometime less you need to remove definatly not lasts lasting for weeks the latex covering feels gross and does not last long i will not purchase again company did send out quickly,38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with these they are basically sharpies they function the exact same way and the colors are not true to the lids it is fine to have them if you are expecting markers but they do not make convincing or lasting tattoos,39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,product does not stay on for more than a day ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo nice colors although,22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love love them where have these been i love to change up my tattoo never permant thank you love it,20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,they do not stay at all it says 2 - 3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and i was sadly disappointed,20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,this was really fun and I am glad i got it because i enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough they all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones do not work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos do not usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long either way i still really like it and recommend it,66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,needs many many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly they are not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead these are just permanent markers with glue / adhesive do not waste your money on this,51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the product is not as advertised mine did not come in a box the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil the tattoo remover is very dry without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper the topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what the pens are ok with good colors too bad the kit is so poorly put together bewild get your act together,86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the ink washed off without the sticky stuff if you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week it is like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it also the yellows and light green pens do not even show up on skin,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,not what i although there just likemakers not worth the money,13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,we had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies we bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised colors bright and vibrant all the pens were in new condition not dried out like the store pens had been my only disappointment was that there really is not a lot of ink in these they dry up much faster than regular markers for the price you would think they would last longer I shall be buying more wish there were more colors or choices of colors,110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,one pen was dried out when i got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones very disappointed,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,this was a gift came in a cheap plain box a lot of the pens do not seem to work the fine tips do not seem to work,27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the product is ok you are better off getting the 18 piece version or none at all because i got multiple red green and yellow markers the yellows hardly show the tattoo remover wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants the most impressive part of the pack is the sealant which is essentially watered-down glue you are better off with sharpies or other thin permanent marker that does not run through the creases of your skin mind you elmers glue water and rubbing alcohol things you probably already have if you do decided to buy this kit i suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue this sometimes keeps the sealant from collecting lint,117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer it fun to design things,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the thick sides only worked on all my pens could not get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the fine point on the markers did not work,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,these markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily even with the protective coating having a lot of fun with them at parties although,27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,ok my daughter does cosplay these pens were so great for her costume they stayed permanent and no smudging she had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days i do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it,44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,so i got them in the time frame it which was wonderful and all but like several people have said they come dried out i had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up one had mold on the fine tip I am like what the heck also they do not last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing very disappointed,76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out so honestly i will stay with the sharpies,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love them i think my daughter loves them even more so fun to work with i like being able to change not really into permanent body art these are perfect for that,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,some of the pens were dried out which i did not expect did receive it in a timely manner,19,27

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this kit was a gift for my teen daughters they have a lot of fun with it the tattoos do not last long even when you put the protective material supplied but they still enjoy it i would recommend it,39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,i was so happy when they came in the mail i opened them up used them and thought all was well the ink did not run when i took a shower but when i went to use them again they would not work if you happen to be looking for a one-time use then you found it,55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,did not work well did not last the two black pens stop working before i could finish the first temp tattoo not worth the money just use eyeliner or a sharpie,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter loved this gift awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each,19,33

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this kit is great for any artsy child this was definitely the favorite christmas gift,15,35
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get all of the different colors however i found that it was not that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks it is fun but i was disappointed,52,36

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,worked really well need more black pens in the set although,11,41
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i did not buy this and I am not recommending using temp tattoo markers use sharpies they have cleaner clearer colors that show up well you can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it is simple so please do not waste your money when you can use sharpies,51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,i like to play with them they are a bit to easy to come off fun to play with although,20,43
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 15 year old niece and as far as i can tell she was thrilled with it she wants a tattoo when she turns 18 so i thought this would help her make that decision,39,44
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,they are good colors and even without the coating the design will last a few days only issue is that after you first do them you need to let it dry a bit and even then a bit can rub off very fun,43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,it was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,looks real had several people come up to me and comment hard part was telling them it was a temp glue is sticky even when dry use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash,44,47
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,this thing is a waste of money does not even stay between your breast maybe if you are a very large and obese person it might work I am small with very large breast this thing was like huge between my breast and kept popping out tried with a bra and with a bra under a tank did not work,57,0
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,did not work for me but was able to get a refund promptly i think this is for larger chest ladies,20,1

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,sleep with this every single night not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs oh my god so fricking painful anyways since becoming pregnant i want to sleep on my side a lot and so i am worried about wrinkles too i guess but the pain dear lord it is so bad i tried using a pillow but this just slides in place and stays better i mean it does not even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom score,87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,dumbest purchase of my life do not let it be yours cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best i was shocked to say the least roll up a towel and use that instead,33,8
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,does not work since has no straps the bear will not stay in place so it is useless,15,9
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i did not like this it did not stay in place,8,10
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,it is a bit thicker than expected i imagine for more generous boobs but it is very comfy to jam into my pj top helps with pregnancy sweats and heavy pregnant boobies,30,11
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,the titty bear is adorable curvy and shapely like me tb is not deplorable as you can plainly see made of firm foam a cover that does not roam my titty bear stays with me even when i leave home,40,12
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,does not work very well it is very small better use as a baby or dog toy better to just use a pillow,25,13
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i bought this bear on another website the other reviewers are right this would only work well for very large boobs i bought the isima breast pillow and that has straps that secure it in place sometimes i put a comfy bra on too over the pillow to secure it even more so and also i like sleeping in comfort bras i would recommend the isima breast pillow i have size c implants,73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,this works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place my primary complaint is it does not rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts I shall wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still need a tight sports bra to hold it in place at least for me I am 58 tall slim build with breast augmentation might work better for natural breasts still use it although i do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place,116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product works as advertised according to her she finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place,39,16
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I have been dealing with sweaty uncomfortable boobs forever and titty bear is the breast,14,17
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,helps to have a shirt or tank top on while sleeping,11,18
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i am a 38 ddd even with a sports bra it did not stay in place and as i moved it came completely out of place too bad because it is super cute,33,19
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,might work for some but was too thick for me natural 34ddd the bear design is adorable but i went with the bosom buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me,36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all not worth the money,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,well damn i missed the return window by a few days i have dds and this thing is too big it has to be for someone with fffs or someone with nat geo tits,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it is pretty useless unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this does not stay put at all,32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,love it after researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles i saw this and thought ah ha it is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 ddd breast from smushing together i notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place h m has great long stretchy tanks i use,77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed it is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place even with wearing a sports bra to sleep ultimately it does not do well what it is advertising to do,51,25
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,funny gift for a friend love the name,8,26
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,it is kinda to big and honestly it is not hard enough to stay put and to hard to sleep with to might work for some people it just did not work for me i think it will end up the dogs toy,41,27

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,i love this I have had it over a year now and I am starting to think i need a new one the foam inside has become a bit mushy i like it too much and will definitely order another,38,29

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,interesting thisis a much darker pink than expected but it is a pretty pink toned stain,18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this is a fun product goes on very sticky you wait til it dries and then peel it off the longer you leave it on the darker the shade i would say it looks like you have eaten a popsicle,39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,do not buy this horribly disappointed i anxiously applied this and immediately knew i made a bad purchase lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry when i separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips it was gross then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,product exactly as expected after watching some youtube videos of girls reviewing this product apply quickly before it starts to dry also make sure like are dry and do not put chapstick on prior or the product does not stain as well impressed this did not try out my lips like most lip products do,52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i love these they are really great they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink they do not leave any marks or anything once you have finished applying it and done it right however for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so although and leaves a thin outline on theof my lips but that might be because i often lick my lips my favoriteis lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark redjust do not apply it to dry and flaky lips,104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,this was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss i had fun experimenting and applying it i just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen i was done however since i did get it close to my lipi had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well it is a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips would buy again,100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,this just did not work for me on any level I have heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try i followed the directions and put the gel on my lips it was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky after leaving it on for some time i tried to peel it off but nothing really peeled it just was stuck and i ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth what i was left with was no visible difference inwhat has so ever i was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash,106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,i would give no stars if possible extremely messy and difficult to apply it is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible i threw it away,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,absolutely useless the gel is sticky clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it there has no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off extremely disappointed,38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I am kind of 50/50 for this lipstain i like the fact the last long in ur lips and does not dry out my lips it is a greatthe only problem is very hard to apply sticky and messy it difinitely need some time to get used to it this is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off overall i would buy it again,83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,love it it is weird to apply at first and it is pretty goopy but once you have gotten the hang of it it is amazing dries out your lips what lip stain does not so have chap stick ready to apply after the watermelonis more red than i had expected lovely peach is a nice light pink just bought another in the peach,62,17

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this applies horribly burns the lips and is just gloppy it does not ever dry to peel off and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips,33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,the peach is a little lighter than i expected more of a very light pink it is a little messy but once you get the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it is easy to remove i just scrub my lips and it comes off when i do not want theany more,56,23

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,okay so i was excited to receive these and then i swatch them and they are all almost the samethe orange and red are almost the same and ll the pinks are similar i do not know which is which oh and i received two 08s they did not come too clean like the caps had a bit of lipstick residue on them they are really small they are not drying although they are creamy i just hope none of them break when applying however I am not too pleased,87,21
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,love the colors they glide on and feel very expensive,10,22
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,the colors are very pigmented and easy to apply but may have to apply more throughout the day because they are not long lasting other than that the lipstick containers are very cute and came quick,36,23
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,waited for a long time but it was nice packages love the purple one,14,24
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,horrible smell and construction is very cheapwhat you pay is what you get,13,25
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,i like the variety of colors although you do have to be careful because they do break easily but thestays on great worth the money,27,26
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,my order still says that the earliest it will arrive is feb 26th but here it is on the 25th which is nice the lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy they were all pretty colors but i guess because I am dark they do not transfer so well but whatever I am happy to have them either way they are not super pigmented when applied but that might be because of my skin the colors i wore were 10 first pic and 13 second pic edit I have concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others also known as the light pinks,104,27
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,these lipsticks were very cheap i used one once and it broke right off and the other have been very hard and do not apply very well i would not recommend this product at all,33,28

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,smaller than i expected but still a good size sponge is adorably cute and brush is very soft some colors are not very pigmented but others are,26,3
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,honestly if you can not spread this you are not applying it correctly this is the second time getting this pallet the colors are great and go one well if you put it on the right way I have had my first pallet since nov january so it has a good life span also the brush is amazing still learning the blending sponge since not 2 days having it my ex friend stole it but other then that I am givinf this product 5 stars if no one knows how to contour identification suggest a few youtube videos on how to contour and such,101,4
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,a lot smaller than i thought it would be and it is very shiny on the skin i could have gotten better quality for the same price at walmart so I am pretty disappointed,32,5

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this is very cheap makeup this is the kind of quality you would see from a dollar store or in a childrens play makeup kit i tried to use it and it caked up all over my face,37,7
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,the brush is the nicest thing out of this set the blender sponge is uber small and the colors are very hard to use they do not apply easily and blending is difficult,32,8
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,the pallete is extremely pigmented which i liked however the brush and the sponge that was supposed to come with it never came all in all i was kind of disappointed,31,9
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,did not blend at all and the sponge did not even come with it just saying,14,10
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,doing what name brands are for a lot more reason cost thank you this is allowing my budding make-up artist learn the tricks if the trade for a lot less,30,11
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i just thought it would be bigger and come with instructions but the product is great and it was fast shipping,21,12
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i am so happy this was actually supposed to come on january 5 - 10 so it came early i love the brush and the sponge plus i rubbed my finger in theand it came off very pigmented and I am so excited to use so thank you so much,49,13

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this should be offered at a dollar store oily and very bad quality makeup do not waste your money,18,20
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,to me this feels more like halloween makeup than every day makeup it is a constancy issue for me,18,21
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,all of the inserts were melted and fell out with no brush,12,22
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,although the brushes were good the makeup was cheap heavy cakey thick and terrible,14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,this kit is very small everything is way smaller that you may think but the makeup itself is good quality the beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless i threw it away it is almost like a novelty toy the brush is great and so is the makeup but it is creme that means you have to put a few drops of water on theyou are using and water on the brush before using i really like the palette colors i would recommend for the price,87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like the tacky-ness of the product it really makes powdered colors stick and look vibrant the brush and sponge did not come with the makeup i received amazon refunded the money for thisback to me and said it was ok that i kept the product since i did not receive all the pieces this made the experience super positive for me i ended up spending more money on amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one,86,25
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this is like childrens fake makeup the brush has bristles just falling out of it i could have got better quality makeup at the dollar store,26,26

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,love the this i just wish the beauty blender was bigger and i did not get the brush that it says it comes with,24,39
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,works amazing i love the colors and it was really simple and easy to use my first time it turned out perfectly and I am loving the contour it could use a little more volume to it although there is not very much in there for 10,45,40
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i love it especially the correcting colors works great brush is great too and the sponge is small but works good,21,41
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,it is fun to use the different shades the brush spreads it on nice and feels soft i think it makes a great look,23,42
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,well worth the money for 10 you have a contour kit with a free brush and beauty blender the colors are alittle light but they still work they are very creamy not thick i highly recommend,36,43
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,it was exactly what i expected very good high quality and worth the price,14,44
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,product was alot smaller then i expected but good quality i love the brush,14,45
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like it but only used a few colors and it runs out fast,14,46
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,one of the better ones i have tried matches skin and does not make me break out if i accidentally leave it on overnight,23,47
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,i would never buy this product again or recommend to anyone the creams are so terrible they can barely be applied they are not spreadable i might just throw this right out a day after it came in the mail so disappointing,41,48
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this sucked did not work at all i would never buy this again i was extremely dissapointed,16,49
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,the beauty blender was smaller than expected but everything else was perfectly fine and came on time,17,50
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,this was a multi purpose pallet that i loved to use i am planning on purchasing a new one as i just recently went through my last one after almost 2 years,32,51
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i have ordered this over and over again love it,10,52
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like this product just fine for the price i have another set by another company and they are about the same it is not supposed to be clown make up I am satisfied with it there has something for all skin tones,40,53
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i actually really like it I am a tomboy so i do not do makeup when i got the pallet i just went on youtube for how tos and i really like the look gave it 4 stars because it is a little thick but good,40,54
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this was terrible it almost looks like a kids set for makeup plastic i could not even use it really because the contour will not even come out of the circle with the brush do not waste your money,38,55
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,i use this for a rainforest reptile habitat it works great and makes feeding easier i like that my reptiles go right up to it after i place it in the tank and i can watch them feed more easily if you buy this make sure you clean it the next day i am sure this has nothing to do with the design of the product but i have found that one or two crickets will die inside each feeding,80,0
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this another great exo-terra product very well made and functional it is surprisingly heavy and thick and very durable safe for my chameleon or any reptile perfect for supplement coating and feeding crickets,32,1
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i really like theof this but i purchase 35 small crickets for my beardie and dumped them in and i could not close the bottom lid fast enough and oops like 15 got free not cool,37,2
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,my bearded dragon only went to this twice i have better chance to just toss 5 to 10 crickets in for him to chase around looks nice in the terrarium although,31,3
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,does not fit together snugly to keep crickets in,9,4
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my beardie loves it it comes in his tank and he knows what has gon na go down,16,5
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,total junk the pieces barely fit together and the plug will not stay in i have to tape it closed my bearded dragon immediately tried to walk onto the rock in which all of the pieces came crumbling down and crickets were everywhere i would try to return it but i doubt they shall take it back after I have used it once you couldsomething much better,65,6
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,our bd loves this feeder i only give it 4 stars because it is pretty hard to get the crickets in the rock and keep them in there before closing the rock everytime I have tried at least one or two crickets would escape until we bought another product called lees kricket keeper the kricket keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out you can get a lot of crickets at once we now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock then we place the rock in the terranium unplug the hole and our bd will basically sit in front of the opening and grabs each cricket as soon as it approaches the opening,132,7
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i like thebehind this feeder it feels substantial it looks good but it has significant flaws the stopper does not fit and requires modification to make it useful probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store but the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed this may not matter too much with smaller lizards but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you are a dragon just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process so while refrigerated crickets are easy tointo an opened cricket rock warmed up crickets are even easier to get out if you are a dragon by kicking the rock open add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I shall be a customer for life otherwise buy with caution,180,8
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,1 the little cork to lock in the crickets was way to loose 2 the crickets felt it was their safe place and stayed in instead of crawling out to be eaten alive,34,9
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,very bad quality does not work and is complete garbage it is most certainly not worth the money,18,10
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,great way to coat the crickets with calcium and it looks good in my water dragons home,17,11
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,it is very hard to cover crickets with calcium powder every morning somehow to be sure our baby bearded dragon gets his essential nutrients so we use this rock to do it we sprinkle a small amount of calcium powder inside the rock every morning we place 3 - 5 large / small crickets inside covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container after turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner they get fully coated with the calcium the crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder the goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for it is future meal to pop out it makes for a very happy and healthy dragon at play with his / her food baby bearded dragon also likes to climb on the rock and rest a bit good purchase arrived on time and a very hard sturdy design,172,12
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,works good if you want a lazy dragon ours would sit and wait for each cricket and snatch them right out of the hole we have a baby and he loves chasing them now that we quit using this,39,13
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,worked like a charm and made our hungry hungry geckos happy by giving them all the live hunting food they needed while we were gone now if i can just get the mister automated they will be set,38,14
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,got this because i was going out of town and did not have any one to feed my bearded dragon i put crickets calcium food and a girl water in the rock and with the darkness the crickets stayed in and would of course come out for the bearded to eat bc when i got home there were no crickets dead or alive in the cage and my beardie was not hungry or malnourished,73,15
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the piece to close hole keeps falling out,8,16
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,if you are like me and not a fan of having crickets around your house this is a bit complicated to get them into without them jumping out before you can cover them but it does what i need it too and i use a 2nd person to help me fill it and close it quickly,56,17
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i purchased thisthinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder usually i purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes but for whatever reason they started dying quicker the very first time i used this to powder the crickets my beardies were so happy it was like a buffet the only issue is getting the crickets in and not wasting them the crickets were jumping out as i was putting them in the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage and when i opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside although i had only put in a few at a time i guess for someone more experienced with thisit could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets i would not recommend it at all,168,18
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,got this for my chameleon it works great to coat the crickets in the calcium dust but the little plug falls out way too easy so we do not really use it we just block it with a finger when we shake to coat the crickets and it works out fine,50,19
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,captain for hole broke a little piece but waited due to lost shipment for too long to return works just fine lizard enjoys hunting crickets that come out,28,20
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,put 12 fresh pin head crickets in added calcium and shook plug fits horribly and does not hold them in nor do i think it would hold the dragon out from getting in in my opinion it is made upside down as you have to keep the lid which has the logo trademark and writing facing upwards on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out anyways put all 12 in let a few escape he ate and then i put plug back in went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews waste of money and time to us,119,21
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my bearded dragon loves hunting the crickets out of this it has gotten him way more active then he has been in the past and let us me cut back on the amount of supplament powder i use since i can save it in the rock,45,22
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this rock looks so natural in my frogs habitat i have a rock fountain and added moss i do not use the cricket powder i use cricket drink to bellymy crickets but i can tap several into this rock and put it in the tank pull the plug and let the hunt begin,54,23
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i bought this on a whim and i have to say i am pretty pleased with this purchase it gets the crickets perfectly dusted and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out my dragon sucks at hunting so this was ideal for him if i dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them but some days i would not have time to individually feed him until he was done now he sits by this rock when he has hungry and makes sure he gets every single one also helps with me not wasting as much calcium / multivitamin dust as i was before,108,24
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the bottom part does not even fit properly vitamins and crickets easily escape and create a mess if you try to shake it not sure if mine was defective or if they are all this bad,35,25
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,plug was too loose and at the angle it would not stay in,13,26
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this thing is genius i got it with very little expectations and got so much more it is made of great heavy material which is perfect for a heavy monitor that likes to ransack his cage and thebehind it is amazing really helps during feeding times,47,27
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,first off you will need a cricket funnel scoop rainbowmealworms has them for 750 linked below scoop them up in the scoop add vitamin powder to the cricket feeder dump crickets inside and then close shake to coat them if you have finicky eaters this works like a charm the exo terra cricket feeder stimulates the natural hunting / feeding instincts as i sit here typing this i am watching my three female breeder bearded dragon sit patiently picking off crickets one by one [ ],83,28
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,would have given it 5 stars but the little plug does not fit anywhere close to snugly if you have this problem the quick fix is a small rubber band wrapped around the plug and then it snugs on pretty good so the good nice way to feed your pet usually the crickets come out one by one and give the pet some time to breath b / t crickets,67,29
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,it does take either 2 people or to refrigerate the crickets first so you do not have crickets jumping out everywhere i read the reviews first so i have not made that mistake my beardie is really enjoying this and it made adding calcium powder easier,44,30
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this is a pretty cool product my bearded dragon anxiously awaits the crickets and attacks as they come out of the rock,22,31
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,awesome exo cricket feeder it is durable has a lid to the top and an exit spot with a cork like cover makes for a lazy lizard to get their crickets laughing out loud,32,32
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my leopard geckos love this and i love that it promotes natural hunting habits with my animals,17,33
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,hard to use theis good but it almost impossible to get the crickets in without them getting everywhere,20,34
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,terrible product good luck getting the lid on before the crickets are hopping all over your house it serves as a hidey hole for crickets to escape being eaten this product is poorly designed,34,35
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,this is totally worthless first the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder when you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free second how do you get the crickets into the feeder every time i tried the crickets just climbed out it took some time to get even a few to stay in long enough to close the lid bottom the few i got into the feeder never came out unless you think this would make a good ornament for your tank do not buy it,108,36
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,greatbut you have to get use to putting crickets in at first,14,37
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,it is very difficult to get live crickets into this rock i lose about 1/2 each time which i consider a waste you can not pour them into the rock without them jumping out all over the house the ones you do get into the rock come right out once you remove the plug either mine is defective which i doubt or this is just not a good,68,38
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,received quickly and brand new as described tried to use it to keep crickets for my frog for a couple days and they all ran out within 5 minutes it was a waste,33,39
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,this thing sucks I have tried so many ways to make it work but every time i try to use it crickets always escape my beardie just climbs on it if i wanted a rock for him i would have gotten one from the backyard and tossed it in the oven,49,40
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,thislooks more natural than typical feeders but not very practical and takes up valuable floor space crickets easily escape while filling more than just a few at a time some users have recommended putting crickets in the freezer for a few minutes to make them a little slower but why should i have to go through extra steps just to use this easy-to-use feeding rock crickets also tend to use this as a hiding spot and not come out when they are not running for their lives trying to escape before you get it closed it makes a good decoration but that is about it,105,41
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,do not even bother buying this unless you feel as if you have money to waste absolute waste of money not even worth the 1 worth of crickets i used this with,31,42
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,horrible to get crickets into does not fit tight and it is just not worth the time and money would not recommend,20,43
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this product is very creative it is just alittle hard to get the crickets in and the lid closed before they are all over the house my secret is to do it in the kitchen sink so when a few do get away they can be caught more quickly,49,44

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,this arch groomer is flimsy and lightweight moves around too much for the cats to even really brush themselves my cats do not like to lay on the groomer as the photo shows but instead circle around it this groomer just does not work for them and they stopped using it after one night,53,78
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cats love this from the moment i bought it my 2 cats have been all over it they love to lay on it scratch the carpet part and rub their heads against the arch they also love to bat at the yellow ball for the price it was a great investment and makes my 2 kitties very happy,59,79
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the yellow toy was destroyed in less than 30 seconds but the cats still play with the string it took both cats a while to start using this for it is intended purpose but they both like it you need a little muscle to assemble it,45,80

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,one of my cats played with it for about 2 days then mangaged to tear the yellow ball off so now they do not play anymore maybe more consideration for a stronger attachment of the ball to the groomer would have made me give this more stars,46,116

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cat loves to play with the little ball but never figured out how to use the groomer part so it is an expensive toy for us,27,136
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,i put it out for my cat and she smelled it a few times and then would have nothing to do with it i kept it for quite a while and then requested a refund and the company was very nice and refunded my purchase it may just be my cat i do not know but you know how they say cats are finicky she may be,66,137
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the cats treat this like they do everything else with fascination at first and then only occasionally give it a once over the ball came off almost immediately when the cats played with it which i expected no ball on string ever lasts long with cats they do like the plastic bristles and so it was worth the purchase,59,138
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,neither of my two cats will pay this any attention and even if i coax them to rub on it for a couple seconds it only picks up 1 or 2 hairs,32,139
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat loved the puffball to death very quickly i do find that the groomer slides some but she does play with it and enjoys it,26,140
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat has not figured it out yet he sleeps on it but that is it and it serves as an arch for a three year old boys to drive under,29,141
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,not good impossible to assemblev i failed at it and had my daughter attempt also with no luck i would not recommend,22,142
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,my 2 adult cats have nothing to do with it which is why i bought it but my kittins just would not stay away from it,25,143
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,and they have all played with it but they do not seem to be prompted to actually use it for rubbing on and scratching themselves but they have only had them for a few days too,34,144
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cats must be flaky or something but all 3 of them hate this and so do the outside cats i dunno why,22,145
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,this is easy to assemble however the yellow ball had to be retied out for the way for assembly my cat likes to rub on things and he is slowly warming up to this product,35,146
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,the carpet that arrived with this product is not the same as in the picture in fact it is very different one piece had an elk on it also the texture is different than it appears in the picture the ball is a big hit although,46,147
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,it is just as it looks but my cats ignored it completely after a moment of curiosity my cats are two and three year olds it might work with kittens,30,148
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat found this toy mildly interested and occasionally still returns to it I have shown her how to scratch on the plastic parts but to her this is just a mat to scratch on the ball that was included broke off after a few months of rough play from my gatita,51,149
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,i have no clue how cats knew what to do with this thing but i guess they are smarter than i expect them to be both of my cats use this religiously they groom themselves and rub and play with the toy and even sleep in the middle of it at first when it arrived it looked thin and flimsy but after i assembled it i had no problems with it and it keeps the shape and form without breaking or unlocking cats love the carpeted bottom they love scratching it too,95,150
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat does not go anywhere near this thing and i have had it for a few months now it is smaller than i thought too so that may be why she does not use it,34,151
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cat does not like to be brushed but does like carpet and hanging balls so i thought this would be a win however she has never used it and does not show signs that she will,35,152
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,he has a big maine coon cat and took awhile to find the parts that he could scratch on but loved the ball and i kept putting his little cat nip mouse on the rug and he worked it out he sleeps on one side of it like it is his security blanket,51,153
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cats will not and do not go near this at all would never get one again it is a waste of my money,21,154
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,this really seems to attract the cat to it right from the start it really seems to work good toy for cat,22,155
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,very lightweight candy does not like it really although i need to give amazon a break but i need another spot a spot that cares about the shopper,28,156
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,very cute even my daughters cats use it when they come to visit put on a little catnip and they are in heaven,23,157
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,she will thou i buy my two cats everything they are spoioled but she loves to be brushed and rubbed down she limes her whiskers commed she is a big baby it will sit for a while and then she will get around to it she stands in a lot but that is all,54,158
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,we have a brush arch but felt it was to stiff even hurts when you rub across it but the cat loved it showed her this one and she just walked away will not touch it probably because it is light and moves to easy plus no ribs on top donation pile,52,159
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,our cats love this they constantly rub against it and 1 seems to think it is her home base so we will have to order another for the other cats,28,160
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,thearrived quickly and in good condition thank you very much i would have given it 5 stars if it was more sturdy,24,161
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my two cats love this toys they ran straight to it and started rubbing their faces on it i have one that lies on the carpet piece and plays with the ball that hangs in the middle this is a great buy,42,162
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,it looked kinda cheaply made and i was not at all sure that the cats would like it but the price was right silly me the thing has not only stood up to almost constant use los guys are jockeying for position on it i think it is become their all time favorite feline diversion the best part is they do most of their shedding right there so that it can be easily vacuumed,73,163
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,both of my cats totally ignore this thing i even put catnip all over it to make it more appealing they simply do not use it,25,164
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,cat has not really caught-on to the possibility the pleasure of this device as i had hoped but she still may I am hopeful,23,165
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,my cats certainly use this but not necessarily as a groomer they like to scratch on the base pad and walk under the arch easy to put together and the pad is weighted enough to stay put even with the scratching,41,166
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,these did not work at all our lab had them off in less than a minute we bought them with the hope that it would give her added traction going down our wood stairs as she is getting older and slips on occasion,42,0
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,my 15 year old dog could not walk on our wood floors until we found these booties they are really great,19,1
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,these shoes seemed ok except for the fact that my dog had them off within a half hour maybe some dogs just will not wear shoes,25,2
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,i was going crazy when we put in our wood floors and our large dogs were scratching them i found these booties and have been using them for the past 3 years i buy a new set every year for each dog when they come in the house they have to get their booties on and i have not had any scratches on my wood floors since they are good for the snow but i would recommend getting a couple of pair since they will lose them in the snow if it is really deep you will always find them eventually but it is always handy to have extras on hand they did not like them initially but have gotten use to them,121,3
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i loved theof boots for dogs there were just two problems first the sizing instructions were inadequate and i ended up with the wrong size second one velcro strap per boot was just not enough for an active dog they came off repeatedly and in the snow got lost i think i can modify them to do a better job but someone else should have given it more thought before marketing was started,75,4
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,forget it all the velcro in the world will not keep these things on a dogs feet they are flimsy and easy to pull off i thought they would be the answer to my large dogs wet feet but just getting them on was harder than using a towel thoroughly to get the dirt off,54,5
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,this is the second time that i have bought hot doggers the dog wears them all the time in the house the first pairs lasted two years and can still be used although the rubber padding is wearing in places they are excellent and serve the purpose not scratching hard wood floors the dog took some getting used to them but being food oriented looked forward to a treat the first few times we put them on everyone asks about the slipper wearing dog,85,6
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,the size falls about 1 size bigger i ordered a size medium and it is kind of large on my dogs paws bought it since he tends to jump on us with his claws this works out great no more scratches for us,43,7
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these work great for my boxer he does not mind them and they never come off he needs protection due to a foot allergy the only flaw is that they sometimes reverse thus he is running on the non-padded side which has caused some small pin holes to appear I had rather see padding on both top and bottom overall very pleased as my boxer has worn these for hours at a time with no issues,74,8
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,the quality seemed good but they would not stay on my dogs feet,13,9
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,do not stay on toes drag when the dog walks labrador and they rotate around every time so the stiff grip bottom is on top,24,10
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,super frustrating fell off my dog after only about 20 minutes of playing in the snow size was correct,19,11
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,goodif you could glue them on my dogs feet,11,12
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,keeps the salt out of paw crevices wish they were water proof,12,13
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,did not really hold out a lot of hope for these but ordered them out of desperation my golden retriever loves the snow unless it is any colder than 10 degrees or so her feet freeze instantly we gave them a try and she tolerated them better than i had expected but the issue is keeping them on i fasten them as tightly as i can without cutting off circulation but within a few minutes at least one usually two slip off i have not given up on them and we will use them when absolutely necessary but they are really a bit of a hassle fyi my dog is roughly 65 - 70lbs and i ordered the large they fit fine,114,14
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,it is cute however it kept slipping from my dogs foot,10,15
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,amended my stars to 2 these are poorly made do not stay on positioning of velcro does not keep protectors in place and elastic sock top is useless extremely frustrating for dog and owner sent them back,40,16
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,we have 3 medium sized dogs who quickly start limping when the snow gets in their paws i did not want to spend a ton of money on boots for them and the regular muttluks can each cost as much a a pair of my shoes i decided to give these a go and could not be happier being short they are easier to get on than the regular muttluks we do own 1 pair of those and the dogs appreciate the least amount of fussing with their feet so we are all happy sometimes they lose one or 2 in the deep snow but it is not often enough to say they are not doing a great job,116,17
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,ordered for my pomeranian in a small they will fit a lab sizing is way off totally useless to me,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,our lab slips these off within seconds i will wait a few months to see if perhaps they are too big on him but I am doubting it,27,19
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,fits my 110 lb bernese mountain dog great,8,20
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,get the right size and wrap the velcro tight enough you should not have any problems with these falling off my dog drags his feet badly so i got these for protection he does not mind them at all great product great price,41,21
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,i bought these booties on wednesday just before a major snowstorm by saturday i was back in the store for a refund with two torn up booties that had fleece sticking out of the toes admittedly my dog loves snow so he ran around like crazy in the booties but unless you have a dog that only walks gingerly or only wears them inside i would not / not recommend these boots,70,22
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,these started coming apart at the toes after a few days i stitched them up on my sewing machine and a few days later they were coming apart again,29,23
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,i originally ordered the red but i received an email from the company that they were out of red would i take black instead with this years cold winter these boots are very popular we took in my moms dog when she passed away and we do not have a fenced yard so we walk her the dog is about 10 and when the temperature dropped below zero she would start to walk on three legs and sometimes sit or lay down in the street our local pet store only had rain boots which i bought based on the sizing chart i bought extra large for a german shepard they are too big but we used them while i found the muttluks online use their sizing chart our dog is small for a shepard so i bought the small boots and they are the perfect size make sure to pull the straps tight or they could come off and they are a little slippery on,165,24
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,they do not stay on very well and they are bulky using them for the winter nut not ideal for the long run,22,25
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,for my dog he would not have these on he immediately and successfully got both off in less than a minute my dog would need a more secure type of shoe it gets very very hot in the palm springs area in summer and i did not want my little guy to go barefoot in the 110 degree temperature outside,61,26
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,these are very cheaply made i thought I had try them because of their claim to be non-slip well no matter how tightly i secured these on my dogs feet if they did not come off they rotated around and around and around and around you get the picture so totally not worth it the only good point of these booties is that the toe material is a lot more flexible and soft i had bought another brand before they stay on great but the toe is just extremely stiff with no bend so very unnatural to walk in as my dog as told me and not very comfortable in the toe area these were more comfortable in the toe area but that was it,124,27
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,this is a good product for the price two straps would be nice and the boots would stay on better but it is a good value,25,28
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,i tried so hard to make these fit my dog was great i thought he may try to pull them off he did not what did happen was the boots falling off his paws as he walked around for a very short period of time nothing seemed to work i measured his paws as was instructed they just keep falling off,60,29
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,bought these for use indoors on a 70 lb lab mix had a pair of knock offs that she could shake off in just a few minutes these work very good for what we wanted indoor use for protecting our new hardwood flooring i would not recommend for outdoor use although as the fabric gets wet / dirty very easy,56,30
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,this was a waste of money my chihuahua would only wear them for a few minutes and then they would fall off i kept putting them back on her feet and finally got tired of putting them on her when she was wearing them she was able to walk on the wooden floors but it was not for too long before she was missing 1 or 2 shoes,67,31
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i bought these dog boots for my two bulldogs we have tile and wooden floors and they often slip when walking as they are getting older i thought that these boots would help provide them a little more stability the product itself seems ok but my bulldogs neither one would wear these in fact within seconds they both had them off both bulldogs were able to pull the velcro strap with their mouths and release their paws very easily i put them on them a couple of times in hopes they would tire of me putting the boots back on but they insisted on keeping them off in the end buying this was a waste of money,117,32
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i put the dog boots on my golden retriever and they fit fine my only problem was that i purchased them so my dog would not slide across the wood floors but the boots have no traction for wood floors i will try using non-slip socks next,46,33
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,I have used these to protect the hardwood floors from our dog at my moms house I have also used these to protect my dogs pads outside in some rough icy conditions they have a good non slip rubber bottom and velcro pretty tight they do loosen and fall off after a long while but well worth the price and my moms peace of mind about her new hardwoods,68,34
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i have a german shepherd that drags his hind toes [ to the point of quicking his nails ] and planned to use these on his back feet while on our poolon first use when i apply them as tight as possible they do stay on however they immediately spun so he was walking on the fabric side not the bottom i then sewed the velcro strap across more of the boot thinking that would help it stay on properly it did not they still spin around he has now worn through the fabric side I shall have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up i expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each on the positive side he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on even during / after swimming if i were to order again i would go a size smaller i used the suggested measurement procedure and ordered the large but think a medium would definitely go on and maybe eliminate some of the other issues,187,35
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,the boots work fairly well they do tend to come off and turn around on the dogs foot during use,20,36
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,we were hoping to get rid of all the runners in our kitchen and hallway since our lab will not walk on the laminate floor once in a while she slips then will not walk anywhere she will walk on the floors with the hott doggers on but they do not stay on very well after two days i was tired of putting them on 5 or 6 times a day and gave up back to the runners,75,37
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,search for these somewhere else you can buy at least 3 sets for this price,15,38
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these little boots are great our 1 year old german shepherd really did a number on the hardwood we recently had our floors redone and these are really great both to prevent scratching but also helps her with traction they are easy to put on and they stay pretty well the only suggestion i have is that they go up a little farther next time i might try a larger size,71,39
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i bought these because we have hard wood floors and our black lab was having problems with traction on the floors when he tried for traction out came his claws and so did scratches in the floor the boots are easy to put on however once they are on they tend to roll and the bottoms become the top additionally the boots are easy for my lab to get them off so they are a nice introduction but I shall be looking for a bootie that is longer so it goes up my dogs foot further and stays on better,98,40
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these skuffies are a god send to our older dog 14 1/2 kodi on our new hard wood floors easy to put on and she never even noticed them or acted like they bothered her the sticky part really helps her get up and keeps her from doing dangerous splits on our floor she reminds us of our grandma shuffling down the hall in her slippers so we call them skippers,71,41
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,upstate new york has had a very cold winter and these booties arrived in time and saved my poodles paws from freezing it takes a few times to get use to putting them on dog and a few times for the dog to get used to have dog booties on the velcro helps to keep the booties snug on the paws,61,42
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,we just remodeled our home to hardwood floors one of my dogs with long legs had trouble walking on them and we were afraid he would fall and get hurt he would lose his balance and sometimes have a leg slide out from under him we investigated different methods and decided on these booties they have worked very well and our dog can now walk confidently on our floors you can tell the difference in his ability when he has them on he knows he can walk anywhere in the house as without them he is very hesitate to walk and goes from rug to rug like he has island hopping thanks for a great product,115,43
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,this cd rom set is a joke if you really want to learn the russian language the first cd just teaches you some random words the second cd does not teach you anything it is set up like a game show where they ask you questions that are entirely in russian then you have to guess the answer this is not for beginners if you want to learn russian i suggest getting books and tapes,73,0
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,i found this product easy to understand and use it was organized as a game playing experience that made learning fun i wanted the english version but it also supported 50 other languages so if you were french it spoke to you in your native language and taught you russian have purchased several other products and i have found this one the best introduction to russian and the easiest to use it is fun,73,1
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i bought this thinking hey it is ten bucks what have i got to lose well the answer to that question is ten bucks if you are broke and want to learn russian save your money for food and get a library card pass on this I had only give it one star but I shall give it two because it is so cheap and you could learn something from this if you put forth serious effort but you would be better off buying the penguin russian course instead for almost the same price,88,2
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a very good program for people who are just starting to learn the russian language this program gives students a few basic words and phrases that will help a student get introduced to the language it is worth the money in my opinion however the program is geared toward a younger age group and does not go very deep into the russian language overall this program would be a good way to start,75,3
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a program that will help you learn russian through games it is purpose is to teach you mainly through listening the purpose is not to teach you how to read or write or even put together full sentences cd 2 is definitely great if you want to improve your listening but have nothing to listen to the cd is all in russian and teaches you to get used to it the first cd is fun because you can play their games or even make up your own using the games they give you before spending 100s of dollars on grammar books and such pay for this program if you can not grasp this simple vocab maybe russian is not for you,123,4
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,before you can learn any language you have to know the names of things that is the key this cd-set understands that and challenges you in a game-show fashion to play along with the game and gain points in order to progress to advance to the next level after all you can not learn to conjugate verbs or understand the gender value mostly foreign to native english speakers attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before it is a very complicated thing russian and ukrainian if it came in a pill everyone could take one too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective huh but this one is just the right speed slow and simple sure it could have utilized more sophisticated graphics but remember when you are a kid in a language you have to be treated like one and being a kid again is actually quite fun,166,5
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,if you want to learn to speak russian this cd will not help you very much it does help you learn some random words and gives you a feel for russian but that is about it however the cds format does allow you to learn numbers time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor if you feel you are weak in numbers time and dates then it is worth the cost to learn them i found that I am very fast at numbers as a result of this course by itself the course does not do much but for the specific area of numbers and time i can not think of a better way to learn it is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language it is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games,154,6
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,i bought this to learn russian as it says it is easy inexpensive and a fast way to learn do not be fooled it mostly teaches you words not sentances or conversations believe me it is the worse the first cd teaches you colors numbers time the alphabet and so on but it does not help with actually communicating with the people although i agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words and three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words but to learn the actually language i find that it is impossible to this is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it is basic words again do not be fooled spend the extra ten bucks and get the rosetta stone russian explorer it has more programs and conversational teachings i recommend that better than this product,154,7
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,my biggest beef with this product is the speakers do not always enunciate which made attempting to repeat what they said a struggle,23,8
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,my husband is fluent in russian and absolutely loves this cd it is cheap and great quality he teaches our son with this cd,24,9
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,nice simple easy to use program i like it a lot better than rossetta stone,15,10
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,received cds that do not work in cd players nuts piece of junk do not get it what a rip off,20,11
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,good program for learning another language I have used the german ones and my wife is currently learning spanish with the same system,22,12
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,bought this several years ago to learn russian the cost around 10 was great but the product is very lacking in helping you to do anything in learning or speaking the language if you are going to spend your money on any product to learn a foreign language go with rosetta stone or pimsleur even a college textbook will help you learn more do not waste your money on this,66,13
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,there was not a clear voice doing the talking and so when we got to russian nothing was pronounced the way we thought and we could not be understood at all,29,14
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,first of all do not but this if you are a beginner looking for an introduction to the basics russian language this product is only meant for learning words and phrases through repetition and memorization that constitutes the first cd the second on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous it is basically a game that you have no way of winning or even doing well at unless you are relatively schooled in russian the one thing that this product did come in handy with was helping me to at least hear spoken russian from native speakers while i worked my way thorough nicholas j browns the new penguin russian course which you should redirect your search engine to right now if you are looking to this product to help you actually learn russian language it is the best of the best all in all buy this if all you want is to memorize words / phrases or if you need the aid of hearing a native speaker while attempting to self-instruct yourself through the basics of the russian language either way you will only receive any use from the first of the two cds,186,15
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i liked the combination of repetition of words and games to reinforce learning although the male and females pronunciations were difficult to hear at times also the program stopped running in the middle of the lessons i have windows xp and have not been able to figure out the problem rendering the cds useless to me if anyone knows what the problem is and how to fix it i would like to know,73,16
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my oldest daughter loves dora and took to this game immediately she loves to sit on my lap and play and our father-daughter time is often spent on the computer she can not get enough the 3 levels offer a nice change for children that are getting bored with the game some puzzles she plays at level 1 where some puzzles she plays at level 3 the game is very educational and fun and it follows the same format as the cartoon does she will turn 3 soon and she still loves it I had also recommend doras backpack adventure they make a trip to the library little people discovery airport winnie the pooh where pooh gathers all the friends for eyores birthday party and mickey mouse where mickey and minnie stop off at goofysstation daiseys diner,137,0
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this for my daughter who loves dora but what a mistake she has our old computer which is not a powerhouse but this game is a total memory hog and i had to delete every other game in the computer to install it and it still will not work well so unless your child has a top of the line computer not recommended,64,1

Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,my daughter is 4 and loves dora the game is short and not interesting her also it is seems there are a few glitches in the game trying to get the stars into backpack is nerve racking you do not actually click on the stars but just to the outside of it it becomes a pain do not waste you money,58,3
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,if you child likes to play on the computer and likes dora this is a great game for them my son just turned 3 and loves to play this game after playing each individual game with him he was able to play on his own the different levels are a great feature most of the games deal with number recognition so the lower the level the less numbers it deals with there are also some print-outs tobut not many to choose from,84,4

Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,my son is 3 and a half he has mastered many games like jumpstart preschool and more this game is way to difficult for him there are numbers moving on the wall so he not only has to identify the numbers but try to click on them as they move past i would highly not recommend this game for younger kids under the age of 5,65,7
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,our four-year-old daughter loves dora the explorer so we were delighted to see the release of lost city adventure the reviews so far have been raves from the little one and from us the animation music and sound are first rate but more importantly the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler this program stacks up well against the knowledge adventure titles like reader rabbit skills such as sequencingmatching memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments plus there are three difficulty levels so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level you can adjust accordingly the program works great using the classic environment on our macintosh g4 laptop and g3 desktop computers have fun,123,8
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,i have a 3 year old and after a week she is already bored with this game for 20 there should be more to do it constantly repeats itself and has no real direction very limited number of activities available and really no variety i would not recommend this game at all i am currently reading reviews to find something much more interesting,63,9
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,i thought it was very good it should be for older children although,13,10
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this product because it specifically stated that is is supported mac os x 101x and above turns out that there is a problem with the mouse tracking on os x 102 that makes the game unusable i went to the companys website for a patch only to find out there is not one and there will not be one their solution is to install it in 0s 9 and boot into os 9 to play it i checked for os x support specifically to avoid such nonsense i am very disappointment in this product as a result and would recommend looking elsewhere for both windows and mac if a company such as this can not properly fix their bugs 15 wasted and one very unhappy toddler,126,11

Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,this game is ok and my 3-year-old son plays it from time to time he loves dora and diego so i thought this would be a great hit but it has been pretty disappointing there are two game tracks with 3 levels of difficulty my son completed both tracks in about 30 minutes it is pretty repetitive after that even at higher skill levels he gets pretty bored with the long-winded videos in between the actual games i took off an extra star for requiring that the cd be in the computer when he plays the software it is 2011 now get with the program you require me to register the program any way so use a license number like every other software company,123,16
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this game for my daughter when i tried to install it to my computer the security program ms security essentail warned that it detected a malware so i scanned this game by the other security program tred-micro office scan it also detected same malware finally i threw it away,49,17

Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i had the regular money product and bought the small business addition to manage receivables invoices and more regarding invoices you can create a very basic awful template using the new template editor it is not something you would want to use unless you are a child selling lemonade hey microsoft why not use microsoft word for invoicing templates duh it is only your own product oh and if that is not bad enough when you want to send an invoice by email it does not use the invoice template you have created instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers also remember those customer accounts you created in money well the invoice does not pull in the customer information that is right you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information again for invoices terrible product yes it manages accounts but no better or worse than other versions of money if you are using this to manage bank accounts fine otherwise unless stay away shameful,175,17

Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,i have been using ms money for small business since i started a one person psychology practice after having been an owner of a large group practice where we used quickbooks i never liked qb i thought it was too complicated to get started and now if i want to use the online banking i have to pay 15 a month to my bank and an extra 200 for a one person payroll i found ms money for small business very easy to set up no charge for online banking with my bank and one year free payroll that costs 10 a month after one year seems to me that using ms money for sb is a non brainer and using qb is an expensive and complicate proposition,128,19

Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,I have been using wtfast for a while now and i like the program for 2 reason 1 wide options to get the best results 2 great customer service what else would a person want people who are complaining that they are not getting results probably do not know how to get them but surely they are there i connect to a server in canada with a 330ms and get a 185ms on best days and 200 on bad days but the connection is alwats stable so it is very useful,91,7
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,being from sydney australia my average ping to any us / canada based servers is 300ms wtfast brings my ping down to 220 - 240ms which is a 20 improvement this is significant i primarily play mmorpgs and shooters where every millisecond counts it means the difference between landing that raid saving heal getting that agro skill off or firing that all important crit that just procd or not those that are in the know are fully aware of how and why ping matters and use wtfast i now use it for all gaming including steam and origin based games,96,8
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,great product it decreases my ping i tried the trail a year or two ago and i absolutely enjoyed it my ping was constantly low even lower than y lowest ping while using wtfast this is not a tool where it makes it look like your ping is down it actually does improve it but it might not work for everyone a few have already said that it does not work for them so yea,74,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,hi this is a great phone bluetooth syncs with my mac perfectly all functions i need are available intuitively and easily it is the details with this phone that i love the rounded buttons which allow even my huge hands to type with ease the strong construction the bright and great in sunlight tft screen the ability for it to use my calling cards and enter the numbers for me the sms and data counters the post-it notes feature the alarm the games the big stuff rf and sound are great battery life i have found to be good they clam something like 300 hours in the specs but i would say more like 150 still this is pretty good the camera is only decent but i do not consider this a big deal it is for fun and it achieves that goal fine the menus are fast and access to numbers is easy the phone is small and stylish is smaller than my old t720 if you include the antenna which you must ouch obviously you can pay more and get better phones but for the great price it is selling for now net 50 return with new 1yr contract i do not think you can go wrong especially if you want a candy-bar style best of luck rob,223,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,been using this phone for 3 weeks now and i love it i got one of those screen protector things definitely get one the menu is easy once you get used to the keys since i have had nokias before the menu / navigation is slightly different i also got a bluetooth usb adapter which makes transferring ringtones and pictures as easy as ever i just transferred my entire phonebook through outlook in one easy click the camera takes ok-ok pictures nothing close to a one megapixel digicam I have seen my friends samsung e715 and this screen is waaaay better the colors are more vivid the only drawback is no mp3 / voice ringers if you are into that but the polyphonic ringtones in my opinion are more than enough you can transfer any midi file instrumental to your phone you can even assign pictures to your contacts so that their face shows up when they call supercool phone would buy it again anytime remember to charge it overnight the first time although,168,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,coming from a t68i it is hard not to like this phone the reception is 10x better the camera is easy to use and the resolution beats anything I have had before i have the t226 as a backup and it is performance is what convinced me to buy a t637 i clung to the t68i for it is features bluetooth mainly and resigned myself to a nonbluetooth t226 when reception was poor now i have it all I am not wild about the form factor but hey performance is key,87,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,the phone works ok unfortunately have never used a t610/616 extensively so i can not compare to say what has improved reception is ok screen looks good the keypad and area above the screen with sony ericsson are a lot closer to grey than black and the sides are silver it just does not look good together i wish they had made the t637 in frosty white like the mainstream t630 i saw that phone in person and it is cute btw i purchased this phone at a cingular store without service and it came gsm unlocked so my t-mobile sim card works in it i can not vouch for the ones sold online the included java chat client aim icq cingular msging does not seem to work through t-mo but that is probably to be expected other nitpicks no quick access user-settable / programmable keystrokes or menu sim card entries are second-class and a pain to navigate to default ringtones are peculiar / bizarre imho too many keystrokes to delete t-mos inane you have voicemail sms msgs although i blame that retarded system more on t-mo my joystick is not quite centered when at rest -p,192,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is just a quick response to lixin li who dissed the ericsson t637 for the big internet m-mode button that charges you when accidently hitting it well if you knew anything about the phone you would turn on the automatic keylock and not have this problem well what do you know there no more charges thanks sony for a great phone [ i had to clear this up because it is people that lixin li who diss a great phone they do not even know how to use ],85,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is a great phone with excellent battery life i can usually go four or five days without having to recharge the battery that is just awesome the ringer volume is loud and the screen is bright you will never have to pay for a ringtone or game again thanks to the excellent bluetooth support performance of java games is sluggish that is my only complaint you may want to spend some time searching for mophun games as those are much more responsive and smooth a lot of the negative reviews here make reference to the online button being too-easily-pushed that may be true but let me tell you something this is not a flip-phone this is a candy-bar style phone non-flip-phones usually have a mechanism that locks the keypad when the phone is not in use so that random buttons do not get pushed when they are in your pocket or purse or whatever if you are too stupid to turn this lock on when you are not using the phone or to enable the auto-lock function then you do not deserve to own a mobile phone period,180,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,i had this phone through cingular and i had alot of problems with it first of all the small size and crammed arrangement of the buttons made it hard to type a phone number in the keys are slippery and thus my fingers were always missing second the online button on the side is way too easy to push and my phone was always connecting to the internet when i was least expecting it and running up charges third cingular does not make it easy to see if you are roaming or not on this particular phone which accounted for 3000 in spurious roaming charges being accrued over a course of 3 months this combined with cingulars really bad customer service they kept shutting my phone off and the regional director finally had to personally intervene in my case made for one bad experience translated do not buy this phone if you live near the canadian border cuz this phone will not tell you if you are roaming or not better yet steer clear of cingular as well,173,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,first of all let me say this is a great phone i will note a few important things 1 it is a smaaal phone the buttons are small if you have a large hand or fingers it is going to be hard to grasp the phone properly i have average hands and it was hard for me 2 no speakerphone this is a huge downside 3 there is an online button conveniently accessable which can be mistakenly pressed and you will never know you went online and you were being charged 4 camera sucks it is a very basic one you have to be standing within 2 feet of the subject to get a recognizable picture pros 1 crisp large display 2 sleek looking 3 lot of great personalization tools within the phone 4 bluetooth 5 better reception than most phones,138,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is the best cell phone i have ever owned it lights up brightly with large digits that you can see without glasses it goes 5 - 6 days without charging for light use although i ordered cases they are unnecessary as the phone is small enough to comfortably and inconspicuously fit in any front pant pocket it has no protruding antenna to break off and require replacement when talking from houston to lubbock i actually have to hold it away from my ear because of loudness it even has a camera in it is small size best of all it is logical and user friendly with frequently-used operations requiring only 1 keystroke or 2 at the most although available in after market sony could have easily made a dual charger to handle a spare change-out battery,134,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i am wondering why there is no rating of 0 star or even negative stars sony errison desnt even deserve the 1 star i chose this riduculosly stupid phone has one big button and a so-called joystick both just need one single touch for you to get into the m-mode and get charged by every bit of data transferred to your phone and there is absolutely no way to deactiviate it even if you spend more than two hours to just get the unprofessional at t or cingular customer service to deactivate this stupid service on their end another stupid thing is that they send me a software cd which is totally crap there is nothing in the package talking about the cd but i just thought why would not have a try the stupid hand-made-like software just can never be succefully installed and what is worse is that you can no longer uninstall it either [ ],155,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i just got this phone from my friend and i must say that i was first skeptical about the phone and how it would perform against my motorola v551 but i must say it is a great performer i tested out the internal antenna of the phone and i think that the reception on this is superior than that of the v551 in areas where my old phone had minimial signal i had 3 bars the speaker phone sounds good and the battery life of this phone kicks major butt the only disappointment that you might have is that there is no holster for these candy bar type phones you basically are left out and if you are not careful you will scratch the screen like i did my keys were in the same pocket and i forgot about the delicate display i will be buying pda clear covers for the screen soon i learned my lesson the hard way as for the camera it is pretty fuzzy and i do not like it the bluetooth syncs up with my computer fine and works wonders when combined with the right headset I have gotten no drop calls or anything but sometimes the buttons can me small for big fingers get this phone it will be worth it,210,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,this phone is really cute but it is so hard to use it does not matter you have to put the phone on key lock otherwise it will easily go onto the internet if you leave it in your bag in order to turn the volume down or off you have to go through settings there is no quicker way while talking the phone goes in and out and makes it hard to hear even when there is full service basically the phone is super cute but is so hard to use it is not worth it even if it is free i will say that cingular / atts service is really good i have not been anywhere where i do not have service yet and I have owned it a month,125,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i spent over 2 hours researching a plan and phone with amazon went through their order process which is already a pain for cell service forms do not remember all data if there is an error cmon i get better service from mom and pop web sites and then this morning get a vague email that cingular needs more information and my order has been cancelled I have been a heavy user of amazon for 6 years but i doubt i will ever try to get cell service from them again because the order process and site navigation is horrible i am really surprised amazon would maintain this poor level of service,111,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,get this phone unlocked and use on t-mobile reception on 1900 is excellent comaprable with original n-gage voice is good both from phone itself and bt headset bluetooth is reliable no problem with dell axim like nokia 6820 but the gprs setting has some problem that you may have headache if you have more than one gprs apn it do not have option to let you choose apn the ringtone is okay simply transfer some from computer through bluetooth supports mid even i put t-jingle on it the phone supports class 8 gprs which you can get the fastest possible speed when using as modem achieving 56k like speed another downside is the phone do not have speakerphone which is available for most of nokia and moto phones withsupport will be a big plus lcd is very good both indoors and outdoors but the white is not even if you look at it sideways this phone is highly recommended for att cingular and t-mobile users,165,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,my review is on cingular i bought a phone w / service and was told i could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used they lie the phone did not work in my area and i cancelled the next day they are charging me for activation even although it never worked in my area if you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service do not buy from cingular amazon will also do nothing to reimburse,79,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,well i got this phone with a cingular package the phone is tiny and cute it is well built and has lots of connectivity however it has some serious drawbacks from the usability point of view 1 it maybe just me but i can not seem to find how to input a wait sign for example if i want to input an extension number i do not know how in my old motorola phone i just just insert a wait synbol and it is done i do not even need to consult user manual to figure that out for this phone i read through the user manual and still can not find how 2 i make international phone calls often and there is a calling card feature in this phone that allows you to call a number using specified phone card with password all these are nice with one fatal drawback once the phone connects with phone card number it will wait only for 2 seconds before it dial the phone number you want to reach 2 second it not enough for any of my phone cards to confirm the password overall this is a good looking nice and little hard to use phone good thing for it is it is connectivity which is outstanding easy to use it does not even match my old motorola v120c,220,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,while gsm seems like universal mobile phone standard the carrier frequency may throw a curve ball to unlocked phone the 900/1800/1900 unlocked phone became useless on phila cingular network,29,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,the phone itself is wonderful good reception easy to use bluetooth it uses java for some applications and games which is cool it also has icq and aim which is a plus another cool feature is music dj in which you can create your own polyphonic tunes midi one button push will get you online your phonebook has space for more than one phone number home work mobile plus it has a space for email you can set up special ring tones for different people in your phone book you can also take a picture of that contact and the picture will pop up when that person calls it is a coolto have a single push of a button to turn on the camera and allow you to email the picture to someone after saving the picture you can save it as wallpaper for your camera and you can send it as a mms or via bluetooth or via infrared ir the camera is not that good people need to be 3 - 4 feet away to get a clear picture of their face any further than 4 feet and nothing is clear feature-wise but i did not buy the phone for the camera quality the camera is a perk if you want to buy a sony ericsson for the camera quality I had purchase the s710a which has a 13 megapixel built into it or the z500a which does video and 3x zoom the my previous phone was a sony ericsson t68i the reasons i stayed with sony ericsson is easy to use lots of options and the biggest reason bluetooth wireless is the way to go i gave this camera 4 stars because it rocks if the camera would have been better it would have gotten 5 stars,298,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i purchased this phone for each of the members of our company and thus far we have all been pleased with it the bluetooth technology in the phone works just as advertised the phone book entries store multiple numbers to a single name so joe schmo has a home phone work phone and cell phone but only one entry in the address look up this is much improved i would strongly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth enabled phone i synch my calendar tasks and email with the phone like a pda and use a wireless headset jabra bt200 and love it,109,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,beware of buying this phone from amazon with cingular i tried buying this phone from amazoncom with amazoncom as the seller i finished the checkout process and then in 5 mins i got an email from amazoncom saying your order has been cancelled because cingular needed some additional information which we can not provide a ridiculous reason to put it mildly could not they have asked me for that information i later tried for a customer service phone but could not find one all i found was an email address and i emailed them and got a reply after 2 days saying that they can not do anything later i bought another cingular phone at letstalkcom and during the checkout process they asked me a lot of questions additional information according to amazoncom and i got the phone without any hassles i even ported my old phone number such a ridiculous service could be expected of amazoncom only i do not understand why they sell cellphones when they do not know how to do it if anyone wants to contact me send me an email at rphanikanth yahoocom,182,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,one thing for sure the service of amazon is not what i had expected initially the when the order was placed amazon cancelled the order in about 4 - 5 hours the reason gives was cingular can not process your order on the information given since amazon does not have the requirements that cingular wants we are cancelling your order awww cmon amazon if you can not communicate with cingular i guess then you guys should not be doing business with cingular or there should be a statement somewhere stating that the order can be cancelled for any reason the prime being cosmic radiaton so i tried placing the order again it was processed after about 4 - 5 futile attempts and the information that was provided was the identical as the first time the estimated delivery date was 10th sept so far it was a struggle so i checked the status of the order a day later and the estimate delivery date is oct 12th wow so much so for stating that thisships in 24 hrs it has been a fustrating experience so far will wait for a day or so else there are other places online that can be given a try do not buy from amazon,204,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,do not even buy this fone it has the worst reception and will drop ur call if the reception is weak on cingular motorolas v300 and above are the best fones i have this on cingular and even in places where the v300 picks up signal this one does not do not even try to buy,55,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i have used half a dozen cell phones in the past five years and this phone had the worst reception hands down the background noise was so loud people on the other end of the phone thought i was being attacked by wild pigs,44,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,three times i tried ordering through amazon and all times the order was cancelled with cingular is requesting information that we can not provide so we are cancelling the order intead of just asking the customer for the information so i called customer service yeah do not try finding that number here on the website i had google it because the only time they give it to you is on the page displayed right after your order not on any of the emails you get to be told they are a new carrier for us and we can not do anything we tell customers that get cancelled orders that basically sorry you are out of luck direct quote from customer service representative would have been a good deal if i could have gotten it maybe it is because I am an existing att customer,133,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i just bought this phone five days ago and my experience has been great themonitor is clear the camera is as good as the motorolas and better than nokia 3200 i love that i can customize the phone such as changing the wall paper i also have it setup to synchronize the contact information with my pc ms outlook via bluetooth and the software that comes with it it really works great the phone is so light and the screen saver just works well you do not have to worry about accidentally press a key the previously comments about the screen saver is right although it is no use to change the screen saver you can not see it anyway the voice control works fine too with this phone you can give voice tag for all of your contacts and also record commands such as redail and number type work mobile home the phone really recognizes my voice the phone has such rich features it is true that it takes time to explore and study the manual so that you can take full advantages of it but i think it is well worth it,195,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,it reads great do not get me wrong but the interface is miserable and the speaker picks up everything around you when you are on the phone I have had half a dozen mobile phones over the last decade and this is the first one where i had to access the menu system to turn down the ringer the buttons on the side with nope they show the phone status i hate phones you need to read the manual to use there has no excuse for it,85,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is a cool phone with lots of subtle features the battery-life is good but you really have to explore to discover the most powerful things about it continued i have been using this same phone for a couple of years now and just so everyone knows it is still working well I have probably dropped it fro 5 feet in the air at least 6 times,66,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,the camera is horrible there has a screensaver function but the screensaver only comes on for about a second because the phone goes into standby mode in two seconds no way to change that you can create only one true shortcut interface seems to be geared toward getting you online to buy more pictures and ringtones you need to buy a proprietary headset if you like to customize the settings on your phone i suggest you stay away from this one,80,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,just got the phone but there was a fuzz sound or low humming coming out regardless of who i called or how high the volume was seems like a great phone otherwise is anyone else having similar problems,38,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,maybe i was too generous in giving 4 stars should have been 3 or 3 and a half the phone is very attractive and light weight but the battery drains so quickly despite of their claim of 540 minutes of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by time after using for a day the battery meter becomes yellow short bar warning sign that the battery is almost completely drained talk about 2 hours and stand-by for 22 hours also the voice volume is not as loud i live and work in manhattan as a sales rep meaning most of the calls i receive and make are done so outside even with the loudes setting i sometimes can not hear callers voice also several people made comments that the background noise level that they hear are excruciatingly loud i never had this problem with my former nokia or motorola phones i am also not so thrilled about cingular their customer service closes so early during the weekdays i believe it is around 9 pm and they are closed on sundays all other carriers that i had sprint verizon and t-mobile had customer service 24/7 also the phone keeps asking if i want to update the time like every hour i called cingular but there was nothing they could do they said that it was because of the phone not it is service i have a friend who has motorola v400 and he swears it is the best phone i also have talked to several people at cingular and they personaly use v400 or v600 so you may want to opt for these phones instead of t637,277,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,5.0,positive,this is the fourthscreen phone that i own previously i owned sony erisson t68 t68i t610 and i found this phone to be the best among the other sony ericsson phones the software of this phone is very stable the menu is pretty user friendly and i like the convenient speaker phone feature with sensitive receiver people can adjust the volume with the joystick while talking unlike the other ericssion phones where you can find the buttons on the side of the phone the camera also has 4x zoom feature and able to tune the brightness level of the picture i think the phone is great for it is price and size the previous sony ericsson phones all have either battery problems or software problems the phone will turn itself off while using or it keeps pressing 3 so far this is the best phone I have ever used best of all this is a tri-band phone so i can bring it everywhere around the world,168,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,4.0,positive,i like this phone so far it is smaller than i expected it scratches somewhat easily so you definitely need a protective case i think it is user friendly camera works great it is fun to take pictures very loud and a lot of good features i recommend it,46,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,1.0,negative,i bought this phone moto c650 along with sony t610 for the family plan pros 1 usb interface if they have drivers 2 appearence of the phone 3 brand motorola famous for cell phones 4 zoom functionality in the camera cons 0 c650 is not user friendly 1 you can not take out the battery or sim card once you installed it you will endup breaking your nails 2 once you lock the phone it is dark and you can not see anyting 3 incoming / missed calls are very difficuit to find out even you set it as the soft key 4 it has no side buttons to increase / decrease the voice volume while talking 5 the colors are t610 are much better than this 6 the usb functionality is of no use there is no driver available 7 the phone does not have the infrared port ir to connect to my laptop i have around 100 contacts to enter on my t610 it took only 5 minutes to enter 8 i do not know about other other phone but if you are thinking of buying eithter t610 or c650 go for t610 i am going to return my phone and buy another t610 for my family plan,217,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,2.0,negative,I have just recieved this phone on 11/29 when the phone goes into standby mode the screen display is completely black i can not read the date or time or anything the phone appears as if it is off when keyguard is on even movement of the phone does not make the back light come on there is no way to determine at first glance if you have missed calls or messages has anyone else experienced this problem with this phone,79,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,2.0,negative,i have only had this phone for a little over 2 months and i have sent it back to be repaired twice already the first time the camera stopped working and i was no longer able to take any pictures or view pictures that i had taken i received a replacement and within a week i had to return the replacement the second phone would not turn on after a week i had not dropped the phone and there was no abuse to it i am now on my third phone motorola c650 we will see how long this one lasts other than the returns i do enjoy the features and find it relatively easy to use if i had not needed to send it back i would give it 5 stars it is very difficult to open the back cover i need to use a screw driver the reception is good at times sometimes i have people saying to me you get reception in here and in other places i can not get a signal when everyone else is on their phone one of those things i guess,187,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,1.0,negative,based on the three reviews all gave five stars on amazoncom as of october 8 2004 i bought this product and had to return it to amazoncom two days later after receiving the phone once i installed the sim card and battery and close the cover i could not make the back cover open again it took me at least 30 minutes and had two finger nails broken trying to open it the upper body of the phone is made of some kind of plastic as far as i can tell and it can be easily scratched i have not even used it and it already has scratches based on my experience i would not recommend this phone no matter what good features it offers of course if you would never need to replace the battery or install a different sim card you could consider this phone i would give no star if it is one of the selections,158,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,5.0,positive,i have this phone about 1 month and i am happy with it so far it immitates some good feature of nokia such as faceplate changeable the camera is so cool although the tft screen is not quite good to show full quality of the picture you have to transfer the picture took from camera to your computer to enjoy it is real quality but really good also very light weight nice design functions are good enough to qualify your everyday activities something i need to complain is the battery life is a bit short if you talk too much 1 - 3 hours a day you might have to charge it every night in addition it does not have any cover for the camera between the camera and the faceplace cover there is a big space that often vacuum all dust into the back inside of the phone so you may need to open and clean it occasionally it does not have bluetooth fine you can use a bluetooth adapter or a wired headset or the built in speaker i do not like bluetooth anyway it can make people think you are crazy when they see you talk to yourself in addition it consumes battery a lot overall i love this phone many times in the mall or in work place people saw me using this phone they stopped and asked what brand it is it is so cute indeed it is smaller and cuter than the sony ericsson t610 which has similar design if you want light weight and functional but do not like flip phones this is the one for you,272,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,5.0,positive,i was looking for a t mobile phone which is small tri-band with speaker phone and vibration first of all this phone is so cute and little it is a world phone so you can use it in europe the speaker phone is great and loud enough the screen is beatiful and the picture quality is very good this phone has a direct usb connection which is great but it neither comes with the driver nor the cable i have cable but since the driver is not released you can not connect to computer i think this is something motorora has to fix i am using the phone in la and i am very happy with the reception and sound quality overall this is great phone,125,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,1.0,negative,this phone was an extreme disappointment i had to return for another phone after trying to use it for 3 days the volume is very quiet even in maximum the screen is very small and difficult to see in the day light the bottom of the phone to charge plug is not smooth and has sharp edging no wonder they had to give more rebate than the 1c cost for you to use it it is not worth it,79,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,4.0,positive,i like this phone for many reasons but with any phone there are some drawbacks first of all this phone is very small and stylish this phone offers a lot of bang for your buck it has mp3 ringtones a decent camera and good internet browsing and mms capabilites however the joystick is very cumbersome it may seem like a goodbut it begins to lose sensitivity after about a week also like other reviewers noted when trying to push it straight down to take a photo or select anin the menu you normally wind up pushing it the wrong way t-mobile service is very good i have been with them for 3 years previously i owned a samsung r225 m see my review on it is product page and with the motorola phone i have noticed areas that i now get reception where i previously did not with the samsung overall the this is a great inexpensive phone with great service small design and powerful multimedia features make a great cell phone for all update update update 4/20/05 phone working great however the black plastic coating is peeling off on the right side of the phone and this phone scratches very easily still working fine but keep note that this phone is more delicate than one would think update update update 6/19/05 phone completley crapped out i was getting shocked and it was freezing up and dropping calls i replaced it with a samsung e315 see my review,243,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,1.0,negative,have not got the phone yet but the 1 star is for the shipping ordered 2 phones on monday the phone was not shipped within 24 hours cuz amazon said i chose the free super saver shipping then amazon used usps and i did not get the phone until tuesday the next week that is more than a week from the date the order was made t-mobile starts charging the cell phone service from wednesday when the phone left the warehouse ended up paying cell phone service when the phone is not even activated the shipping experience sucks should never believe usually shipped within 24 hours if you choose free shipping be ready to pay extra for the days you have not even received the phone,124,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,2.0,negative,1 screen is too dark complaints from lots of users and i experienced first hand 2 camera is ok not great but good for starters 3 menus and options are too many but easy to locate and use some simple stuff like how do i change the ringer tone 4 documentation is useless google it to read more but you are wasting time not to worry about back cover issues for first time as it comes from amazon separetly and you can install in 10sec yes if you want to open it for some reason use credit card approach,97,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,3.0,neutral,i bought it since it was the best deal i mean cash-back when you sign one year contract now heres what i hate in this phone when in power saver mode screen is totally dark can not read anything on the screen when outside in bright daylight again can not read anything on screen even when the backlight is on battery takes 4 - 6 hours to charge and mine died after 4 months new battery costs 45 it has usb port but no cable or software is included so they basically want you to spend more money on that after the initial purchase back cover is hard to open watch for broken nails i tried all methods screw drivers credit cards but this back cover has some serious attitude problems camera quality is poor but so is with all other phones in the market in this price range charger works on 110v only do not plug it into an outlet in europe or asia or you will fry it speakerphone is good when you are alone in a silent room you will not be able to hear anything on speakerphone with your car window open ringer tones are not loud i missed many calls because i was on the train and even although ringer volume was set at 7 i could not hear it,217,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,2.0,negative,i really dislike this phone when i read other reviews saying it was hard to open broken nails boo hoo i thought that was sour grapes but it took a combination of my husband and i 25 minutes to open the phone which we ended up doing with a key and scratching the he shall out of it so fine i got it all set up but it would not transer the info on my sim card so i had to rekeyboard my address book then after a few days use the sim card got dislodged and i had to go through opening the phone yet again the navagation is also tricky i have very small hands and still find the buttons too close together if you do not lock your phone or keep it in a special case the camera comes on all the time i have spent so much time adjusting the settings so it is effecient i have nowhat they were thinking but next time i am going back to nokia,174,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,4.0,positive,i got the c650 as a replacement for the t610 i liked the menus / display on the t610 better but was having major reception issues signal strength jumped all over the place missed / dropped calls in major cities all along the west coast i had this problem with three different t610 phones how many i had to try before they would let me switch brands and know other people who have had this problem too the c650 gets much more reliable reception and to respond to others comments i find it is relatively easy to pop off the back if you put two nails of one hand in the two slots and one nail on the other hand where the silver inlay is on the top of the phone i personally like that it is not easily removed so your battery does not just pop off randomly my old sprint phone would do this also if you set one of the soft keys to recent you can easily access missed or received calls you only have to hit the call button to see previously dialed calls you do not need phonebook as a soft key since pushing the up / down button will get it for you finally use the menu key lock I have had the phone go through menus in my pocket and order wallpapers / ringtones without me even knowing it respectable phone not perfect but reliable,229,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,3.0,neutral,i feel it is not worth it for the price 1 once you place sim card foget about changing it again 2 very delicate and speaker phone quality is not good 3 mobile service starts charging when you order phone on on-line my advice is see it and feel c650 at near stores before you place order,58,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,some errors in software telling us to turn incorrectly although following route on map was accurate not a good product to use for single travellers having a co-pilot to monitor route kept us from following incorrect commands from voice program,40,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,no need to wait this 2005 order comes with a free upgrade card for street atlas 2006 I had previously used ms streets and trips but needed something to replace it fast and cheap when it is usb gps broke down i bought the delorme purely for availabity and cost now that i have it i will never go back the delorme software is extremely well designed and works flawlessly do not let the cost fool you it is a class act,78,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,do not forget to download the serial driver from the delorme site so you can use the usb gps with other programs after installing the driver netstumbler immediately recognized it,29,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,in august delorme will be releasing street atlas 2006 and it will offer the optional bundle with the earthmate gps unit i would wait till then my version of street atlas 2005 is fine but the maps are a bit outdated hopefully the new software will correct some of those things,51,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,I have been using a garmin e-trex for some driving navigation not it is main purpose for some time having wanted something better for driving i saw this as an inexpensive solution to use my laptop and have large screen gps navigation in short the active navigation direction including voice work pretty well the large display my laptop is great but the database and route management tools lack having only used this h / w and s / w the included street atlas for a few days I am sure i have not figured it all out still i quickly found that the database only knows about one of the several home depot stores in my area i looked for the hotel I shall be staying at on an upcoming trip and it is not in the database a two year old street in a newer nearby residential street is not present in each of these cases my garmin mapsource s / w had these elements and the level of detail and accuracy are better too I have found work arounds by creating waypoints where i know things I shall be going to are located delorme will not let me move an existing waypoint that I have created so if it is not right delete and recreate I shall probably use it for such things as our rv traveling but when i want to find the nearest hardware store well most anything I shall pull out my little e-trex,231,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,i am a gps sort of guy love maps map software and more i bought this for a business trip to detroit a city that i rarely visit to use with my new laptop tried to install the software on the plane and could not due to a driver issue resolved later no thanks to the installation software or delorme so when i got my rental car i went ahead and rented the garmin c550 with the car after getting the earthmate software installed later in the trip i was able to compare the dedicated product to the delorme product there was no comparison i had become used to the super easy accurate and fast garmin product and essentially could not get earthmate to work it took forever not an overstatement to locate satellites really the most frustrating part of this product is the software interface i use several mapping products ms trips and street garmin and more and i simply cold not figure this out totally unintuitive totally non-windows standard i should have know before i bought this product as other delorme products topo united states also have a similar non functional interface this product is going back,197,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,i purchased streets and trips with the gps a few years ago and upgraded the software as it was available loved it then my gps died so i decided to give the delorme with gps a try the delorme software and gps is so much better than streets and trips it is kind of like going from notepad to word,59,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,i got this as a gift for my husband to use with his delorme software and he has really enjoyed it and uses it every day,26,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,i tried this set but returned it because the lt-20 refused to find the satellites in a timely manner i called delorme and a rude agent told me it took 15 minutes for it to lock on i said that was a long time and he said all gps software takes that long i explained that i hooked up my garmin gps to the software and it locked on in less than 1 minute he was rude and disagreed needless to say i took the package back to best buy and exchanged it for the microsoft streets and trips 2007 with locator the software installed easily and the gps locked onto the satellites in less than 2 minutes from a cold start the next time i used it the time to lock on was less than one minute delorme has some good software but needs to find a better gps unit and hire nicer agents,155,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,this is a good inexpensive gps system it does a good job of tracking your location the map is excellent the labeling is not as good as the previous version poi finder is top notch,35,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,it is a great gps once it is starts and detects the satellites sometimes it can take up to 5 mins i used it with iguidance and that software is the whole world of difference i can actually hear what the direction are saying against the software that came with the gps unit robotic sounds need to subtitle that for me please,60,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,this product could put user / customers life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road this is the worst product that i have used in my life,39,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it is cheap i used it on a 1000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it the navigation is poor i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was off route so often due to the poor maps the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback 1 the unit would show me being off the road even although i was on an interstate in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around 2 it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction 3 it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 it does not provide a chime when it is time for a turn it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead but that might be the last time you hear an instruction 6 in one case it got me to my destination at least close enough but could not guide me back to my starting point the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well but the maps are poor as is the verbal instruction it sounds like a 1980s computer generated voice if you are looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas this is not it this is going back as soon as possible,264,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,i rarely write reviews but i decided to write this since i had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad the review by reviewer rc lansinghas listed all of my frustrations and i will not go over them again but the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review the summary of this product is that it is highly unusable you will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again yes you can manage you way with this product however it is not worth your time and money and last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps based on locations they have travelled not covered by the original map database come on,163,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,i have used ms streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year it has some map errors that i wish were updated i read that the delorme street atlas was far superior so i bought it it only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems not only is the mapping way out of date many years microsoft streets and trips 2006 maps are far more up to date on many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road does not exist in that direction it does not even know the name of some very old roads displays unknown name while driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that i am driving 30 feet below the program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a u-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp i have used microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable the delorme is very confusing and frustrating I am sending it back for a full refund,191,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,this is my first experience with gps this product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions viewing the screen on a laptop as opposed to most of the portable gps units is a definite advantage to the user i would purchase another immediately if the need arose,51,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,the gps lt-20 is a great device and is fairly accurate the problem is the delorme maps they have so many errors and interstare ramp data is inaccurate or sometimes even missing the estimated time of arrival and time to turn is determined by the speeds that you set and estimate that you will travel on different roads and does is not determined by your actual speed which the gps can calculate i do not understand how a company that is a map maker can but out such bad street maps i think they should get them from garmin wish i could use this gps with other mapping software 2006 street atlus was some inprovement but still filled with street errors bob b,122,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,there has a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought i did not do much research i think the data may be in there but i could not learn how to make it work the interface is horrific unusable do not do it,54,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,while the ms streets and trips has good map design it is gps feature does not compare to the earthmate gps and street atlas 2006 i have tested both street atlas will give you better voice instruction and visual data by far the back on route feature of street atlas works great if you deviate from your planned route it adjust your route accordingly the voice directions are clear and loud the ability to adjust your view of the map to compensate for sunshine in the car makes it easier to see on a laptop after comparing ms street and trips with gps and street atlas with the earthmate gps i would highly recommend you go with the earthmate gps lt-20 package with street atlas 2006 f fleming houston texas,128,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,first gps I have ever bought but seems to work well most of the time i really like being able to give it voice commands via a microphone it is a big safety plus only thing that concerns me is that sometimes it tells you to turn left when it should say right and right when it should be left i find i have to double check it is left verses right recommendation against the actual map which has yet to be wrong acquisition time and sensitivity have not been a problem for me all of the roads in my neighborhood are on the map although some are not where they should be gps shows you driving about 20 feet away the software is so feature rich that figuring it out takes a while do not wait until you in a moving vehicle to learn the software,144,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,it is taking some time to learn how to do things quickly with the software things like a new route or finding a restaurant or hotel but it is all there i can not depend on the voice commands to be in time for the next turn so i generally do not use that feature i find i need to read the directions for the next turn overall for under 100 i think it is a real nice gps,78,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,this gps system is great value for money sure the aquisition time could be faster but it is not too bad and once the sats are found tracking is fast the software is a breeze to use it even talks to you which is nice when you are paying attention to the road just bear in mind that you will want to plug your laptop into your car speakers as the road noise can easily overwhelm the tiny speakers in a laptop i really reccomend this gps system i am very happy with it,94,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,i bought this new earthmate and it was doa death on arrival i was dissapointed since it costs me extra money for the shipping back to delorme they sent me a new one and the new one works i was kind of dissapointed at delorme that they did not pay my shipping cost other than that the new one work fine,61,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,installation disk will not run i tried to install it on a 6 month old toshiba mx35-s111 laptop with 5x the cpu 10x the memory and 30x the hard drive space required according to the box i made sure nothing else was running the installation failed repeatedly delorme should test their product better before shipping after several hours of trying i gave up and returned it I shall give one of their competitors a try,73,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,the earthmate lt-20 works like it was advertised and was easy to setup and go it is quite facinating to see your speed compas heading and elevation as you travel down the mapped roadway it is also interesting to see the surrounding areas of roads and streams and rivers as well as a much broader view of the surrounding area thisis one of the better purchases I have made for my laptop,72,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,2.0,negative,i have been using this laptop delorme gps program for 2 months it is so user unfreindly i got the basics down but all the other functions are a mystery i am a ten year computer user and just feel the whole set up from the tiny fonts to the jumping around of the screen make this program no fun at all try calling customer service if they answer within 20 minutes your lucky and the help is limited look for other programs first,80,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,i never get out of town without this device it is very accurate on major roads and the re-routing feature is great the downside of this gps is that sometimes it goes crazy and tells you are off route even although you are on the right track it once directed me to the wrong exit and re-routed me back onto the same highway just give yourself enough time 95 of the time it is accurate,72,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,we started with a kenwood navigator with touch screen at 3000 liked it but the database was extremely poor and an updated dvd is 450 tried delorme not at all user friendly and had annoying perhaps fatal characteristic of showing a turn 1/10 mile after the turn but then sometimes it would show the turn where it was supposed to be microsoft streets and trips is user friendly intuitive and works well database is excellent,73,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,software is so bad i sent the whole packages back before even trying the gps and purchased the microsoft product,20,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,the software for this system is so horrible i doubt even the developers could figure out some of the features I am an experienced engineer and i could not figure out how to get the thing to easily navigate to a walmart once it was found on their database their database is also terrible and does not include things like drug stores i do not even want to waste my time on this review it is that terrible i develop software for experienced technical professionals and if my software engineers gave me this they would be out of a job good luck,95,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,i live in southwest virginia a very rural and mountainous area and this device along with the software has not gotten me lost yet i am very pleased with the voice commands and the maps i love the feature that if you press f5 repeat last command that it will update you travel distance and estimated time based on your speed tell it to you the best feature by far was it is ability to get me back on route when i made a wrong turn it quickly recalculates your route and begins speaking the direction to get back on route immediately being a guy i naturally hate pulling over at astation for directions and hopefully this baby will keep that from happening again over all i give this 5 out of 5 stars i have used the garmin gps 18 very similar to this and i hated the user interface of the software it took longer to recalculate routes and the map is very hard to read especially if you are at a red light and only have a couple of seconds,184,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,just replaced 2004 with 2006 not much better but easier to use for windows junkies very accurate gps but sometimes the maping software as with all needs improvement use it extensively for back roads and it has saved us several times will buy again if needed,46,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,i have been using street atlas since 1997 and upgrade most of the time as they produce new versions the program is good they keep improving but still have not done a great job they need to compare the look and feel of their program with others if they were to do a study they would realize that the last thing i want to do while driving down the road is to fight with my gps software at the top of the program should be a file menu then editending with help there should be a mute button so that i can easily stop the voice the says off route off route when i am no longer following the planned route heck a way to delete a route without creating a new one would work after years of upgrading to the latest version and hoping that they have sent their programmers to school to learn usability i am buying a gps mapping system from another company probably microsoft update 6 - 10 - 2008 i tried the microsoft gps and returned it it did not work well at all then i purchased delorme 2008 and love it it still does not have the standard file menu file edit helpand that would make it better but delome 2008 is much easier to use than prior versions i will upgrade to the next delome version next time i need new gps software,241,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,1.0,negative,i installed it to my xp the gps receiver can not detect anything the user interface is confusing i tried everything but the gps receiver still does not work finally i return it then i bought a microsoft street it works perfect quick and easy set up except that it does not have voice functionality,52,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,practically hands-free using voice commands via microphone and aural response from the software maps are not always 100 accurate but none of the mapping software I have used ever are 100 accurate use common sense and check your route firmware updates available from delorme website,44,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,i have been useing this for a year now this product has alot of bugs it tells you to turn the wrong way alot of times it freezes up alot lots of problems i would not buy another product from delorme beware,48,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,i purchased the 2006 package from delorme so i could have the most up to date maps available my 4 year old subdivision is not on their map yet a really nice feature is that you can actually draw roads on the maps once i was driving a route my position on the map was consistently 1 inch away from the road i was supposed to be on very annoying this was awful in areas with many roads that are close together because it would get confused as to which road i was really on and constantly rerouting me the maps are very clear however you can manually adjust the contrast for easy night viewing the voice navigation is nice as well it will tell you the name of the roads that you are supposed to turn on to the voice is the standard microsoft voice which can be hard to understand some of the time i emailed delorme tech support about my problem and they never responded i then called their customer service department and they honored their unconditional 30 day money back guarantee policy no questions asked for the money i would recommend the garmin 18 i received it today and it is outstanding,208,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,the gps receiver included works fine but the software is still a work in progress i have had it tell me to turn left when it should say right and vice versa it has routed me off of major highways to put you right back on the same highway a few miles down the road for no reason it thinks i am on the next street over when i am at my house it is fun to play with but i do not think i would leave home without a real map yet,92,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,this was my first experience with gps i recently bought and used it on a business trip from new jersey to virginia based on that experience i will always drive with gps in unfamiliar territory this software has some great features including voice it is easy to get started and use the routing is excellent and it will even re-evaluate your route automatically if you should get off course the down side is that the gps unit that came with it is not accurate and slow to respond i first set it up in my driveway and the gps indicated that my position was in the woods 200 yards away while driving the gps did track well on major roads however on small roads off-ramps and residential areas it thought that i had left the road and was 4-wheeling in the field next to the road this tended to confuse the software do not use thestation feature in the software unless you know what you are doing otherwise when the software thinks that you are low onit will direct you off at each exit that has astation until you realize what is going on you will be loosing a lot of time confused by why the software keeps sending you on these detours i guess i will need to read the directions on how to use thefeature properly,236,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,i do a great deal of traveling by car the delorme earthmate really helps me out i just hook it up to my laptop and off i go because it works by satellite you can always find what you are looking for in a hurry for people that travel or not this is a great way to go it is a wonderful product and i recommend it to all my friends it is easy to install and easy to use,78,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,5.0,positive,we took a 200 mile trip just to test it before going 4000 miles worked like a charm,18,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,i went ahead and purchased from amazon understanding that a free coupon was included for the upgrade to the 2006 version well it is not really free you have to pay 995 shipping and handling wait for the 2006 version and save,42,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,3.0,neutral,I have just used the lt-20 with street atlas 60 on a long trip most of the time it works well but there are problems first when sa needs to recalculate a route it does so slowly many times it tells you to turn after you have passed the intersection this is still somewhat helpful but it is a pain i am using an ibm laptop perhaps a faster machine would avoid this problem second several times sa told us to turn the wrong way one of those times itus into a circle and then directed us into a cul de sac sometimes you just need to stare at the maps the old-fashioned way third the interface is clumsy i have not used competing software for 99 you can have a lot of fun with this product but do not expect it to be polished or super-reliable and definitely do not rely on the voice directions without a co-pilot,155,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,the delorme earthmate gps lt-20 works really well i used it for navigational assistance during my vacation and it really works good but the built in tutorial is pretty sad at best i had to play with the unit for about 2 days to figure out how it works i think delorme needs to do a better job of a tutorial maybe if i had used another gps unit it might have been easier for me but this was my first time using gps it really does work great once you figure it out the website for delorme did not offer much help either on product use,106,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,despite what everyone is saying i like this phone someone said that there is going to be a v3x coming out for cingular which is a lie t-mobile has pretty cheap rates and has good signal in dc all of the reviews have complained about the price but it is a popular phone and it just got picked up by t-mobile so what do you expect overall it is the best phone i have ever had,75,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i did not get this phone for top-of-the-line features the camera is inferior to those on the new sony ericsson phones but i did not buy a new phone for a camera already have a digicam the phones memory is small compared to a lot of other devices and can not be expanded like some other phones for example nokia 6230 but i have not experienced any problems with memory yet of course I am not using this phone to listen to mp3s already have a player just to store some wallpaper and mp3 ringtones if you want a phone to store a large mp3 playlist i would not recommend the razr for you i did get this phone to have a cool functional new phone and so far I am very satisfied the sound and speakerphone are great the reception has not failed me yet and the battery time is decent for such a vibrant display it is huge and small form factor the only major dissatisfaction I have had is that the inner screen and keypad scratch easily way more than other motorola phones I have had the phone for less than a week and even although I am extremely careful there are already blemishes all over the inside the outside is flawless i guess my advice is buy a protective cover when you get the phone i wish i would have because this is a beautiful phone,227,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i rate this deal at one star because it is a supreme disappointment i am not rating the phone at 1 star but just the alleged deal wirefly just had this phone with 1000 minute service for 4599 service unfortunately you get screwed if you do not live in new york or la they pay 3999 a month for this deal the phone is completely free one cash rebate of 100 up front then another 100 in 180 days it comes with the bluetooth headset and the car charger i returned the phone alone that i paid 270 to the local t-mobile dealer who were rude and ignorant told me i had to transfer my numbers one by one so much for in store customer service the contract is only 12 months on wirefly in an aol promotion and i like cash back better than an amazon credit either their negotiation skills suck at amazon or they are making a ridiculous profit after all wirefly and aol are making money does amazon have to be a pig i used to trust amazon for the best deals but no more,183,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,the razr phone is a great marketing blitz it is about as thin as a pda but not quite it is actually thicker than my palm pilot but the razr is also about the same size height / width as my pda so if you want to carry around a slightly thicker version of your pda and call it a phone then the razr is the phone for you otherwise i strongly recommend looking at other phones such as the samsung 335 which easily slips into your pocket without being noticed,87,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i was delighted to find out i could have this phone with t-mobile tm is by far the best deal where i live but so far it is had less than desirable phones i am very pleased with this phone the phone is not exactly small like many reviews claimed but it does fit nicely in a hip pocket it is very long and wide but fairly thin this is my first bluetooth phone and that feature works very well with a jabra 250 headset pros aesthetically pleasing minimalist design top notch voice quality top notch reception charges with usb mini can be charged with computer adequate battery life maybe two days worth of heavy use easy to read both displays voice activated dialing works smoothly easy to set up bluetooth even non-motorola mp3 ringers cons really needs an external led for missed call alertsphone and bluetooth headset must be kept on the same side of the body for best sound vibrating alert is very faint the volume and voice-dial buttons are on the wrong end of the phone making them awkward to hit while talking the phone feels flimsy I shall try not to drop it the phone is a little on the wide side to dial comfortably with my thumb same old motorola interface not bad just not great,219,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,came out 12 month later want 19999 wile others offer it for free,13,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,I am on my second one from t-mobile the first one was okay at first and then reception continued to get worse and worse screen would go blank at times I have had the second one for about a month and it is beginning to do the same thing I have never had a motorola phone before so i do not know if it is them or just the razr i think I shall stick with samsung and nokia although for now on,76,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i got this phone when it first came out yes i still have it and it still does work but it needs too many changes to be a good phone the battery life is horrible and i only get a few days out of it if i am using the camera the battery dies way too fast the keypad is just too small for texting my daughter has the same phone and I have noticed our reception is very different sometimes she can get service but i can not or vice versa if and when i get another phone i will get something better next time and not go with a fashion trend,110,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i have one of these phones and at first loved it than after a while i started to loathe it it is too skinny and being an avid texter i hate typing messages on the flat keyboard i guess that i am biased towards black-berry type phones but it is not as flashy as it seems by the way i am 12 on my dads review not as cool as it seems,70,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i have been using this cell phone for 2 month it is pretty good the only disadvantage i can see is the battery life which is about 3 or 4 days other than that it is good it is thin it has got a camera i am satisfied with it,50,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i have seen this problem with 2 razor that we own and also the ones my friends own it is good for the first year and after that the battery does not stay for more than one day 3 - 4 calls in a day and the battery is dead,48,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,this is a rather stylish phone i still like the look but after using it for awhile i do not like the phone all that much it is not very durable the external lcd cracked when it was in my pocket with no evident unusual stress the interface on this and most motorola phones has serious usability issues the volume in the earpiece is unusually low i kept it at high volume all the time and still had trouble sometimes,78,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i got this phone as an upgrade from the v300 it is definitly a cooler phone to have in your hand but I am not so sure about it is sturdiness the v300 could be thrown against the wall which my little toddler did on occasion and it would keep working the razr on the other hand switchs off as a result of a simple fall that said it is a nice phone I have had no problems with calls being dropped or poor receiption it has lots of added features but most i really do not use so all in all it is an excellent day to day phone just keep it out of the hands of little toddlers,117,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,the motorola razr v3 has become an extremely popular phone in the past year and wanting to keep up with the trends i decided to buy it and try it out I have had it for a couple of months now and i have not had a major problem with it only a couple of minor glitches like for example it is very sensitive to being dropped the screen will go blank for a couple of seconds and the other glitch happened once when i was using the web browser it froze and for some weird reason it affected my mp3 ringtones not wanting to play them stating there was an error but i restarted my phone and it was back to normal special features vga 4x zoom camera video playback bluetooth web browser pros sleek design silver metallic finish large colorful screen keypad good sound cons battery life fragile no video capture overall I am pleased with my razr it is not such a bad phone but it does have it is flaws,169,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i wanted a good cellphone that did not give me the feel of carrying handcuffs on my belt and the razor is good in that regard the downside of that feature is that if you forgot what pocket you put it in you will have a hard time finding it when it rings i am lucky that i have pointy fingers because the small size means a small keyboard for dialing the software from motorola to allow it to talk to my xp os particularly the driver must be hidden well or i am more computer illiterate than i thought motorolas website is a maze of marketing and help screens the voice command feature on the razr is inconsistent i am with t-mobile that requires the phone to provide the voice command technology when i was with sprint they had a web base voice dial that was reliable obviously there is a reason i am not with sprint but that is a different story if you want a good bread and butter phone that is very compact razr does the job just do your homework as to what other expectations you may or may not have it is a bit pricey but you already knew that,204,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i was excited to have the phone but now that i have had it for 2 years it is a pain 1 battery life i have to re-charge every day the battery simply dies after you talk for about an hour or two 2 reception not sure if i have to blame it on the phone or t-mobile but it is of low quality luckily am getting close to my 2-year contract and look fwd to dumping this phone,76,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i had my old samsung phone for 2 years and needed a phone with bluetooth for driving even although my old phone still worked great i bought this phone about 7 months ago after being assured by t-mobile that motorola had fixed the widely discussed quality problems it is not true this phone does not hold up i am very gentle with my phone and still am constanly driven insane by the phone shutting off out of the blue with plenty of power only one month after i got the phone it started sporatic errors when trying charge it it tells me it has the wrong battery even although it is the same battery it came with often i have to turn the phone off remover the battery and re seat it to get the phone to work again this is unaccepable the camera is so low quality that it is not even worth fooling with after swearing at my phone a lot in public i have heard many other respond that they are also displeased with this phone bottom line do not waste your money on this phone it will never last,193,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,phone looks good has a good battery life and the reception is good the phone itself is very strong and sturdy as sturdy as a half an inch piece of technology could ever expect to be on the bad side the ear piece volume is poor after about a year my and 9 key quite working i have heard similar stories about the key functions lights and more not working after some time however most of these phones only have a shelf life of one to two years,88,18

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i am overall very pleased with my razr and with t-mobile the phone has great audio quality and a very loud speakerphone i would recommend that you also get the motorola phone tools software from motorolas website it makes adding contacts and downloading pictures a breeze plus you can make your own ringtones from mp3s the phone would be perfect if only if had a sd slot like the verizon version this phone is limited to only 16 m of storage,80,20

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this is by far the worst phone i have ever owned I have only had it for 5 months and already the battery is worn out and it is starting to malfunction very disappointed i will never buy a motorola again do not waste your money on this garbage i will stick to the lg brand as i am going to have to she shall out major for a new phone buyers beware,71,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i purchased this phone from my local t-mobile store along with an unlimited nights / weekends/1000 whenever minutes plan and i must say i am very impressed the phone is beautiful and thin and although this phone has been available for a long time now i still can not get over how thin it is reception is great and compared side by side to my old samsung x475 t-mobile same network as the razr the razr always wins on the reception where my samsung gets 1 bar to no service in my room where i am typing this from the razr gets a steady 3 bars sometimes 2 but it never goes below that on my old samsung calls sounded weak and the audio would clip a lot sometimes the call would even get dropped i have yet to see my new razr drop calls the screen on this phone is beautiful or at least the main screen the front screen on the outside of the phone isbut it seriously lacks contrast andsaturation however for an external screen it does just fine this phone also has bluetooth and has worked flawlessly with my bluetooth headset i have also been able to send pictures taken with the razrs camera to my friends camera-less phone via bluetooth if you are looking for an affordable stylish bluetooth-rocking cell phone this is the one,230,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,bought two razrs from t-mobile first one lasted 15 months before screen started flashing on and off and different screens flashing on it is own second one got very poor reception and was returned-manufacture defect stay away unless you have at least 3 extra hours in your busy schedule to get it all resolved it is an overpriced piece of junk and waste of time,63,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i am a forgiving user and enjoy cool technology however this phone has exhausted my patience as has tmobile i take very good care of my eqiupment two-year old sunglasses with nary a scratch on the lenses but have had to replace this phone thrice and am about to replace it a fourth perhaps i was spoiled by the sony ericsson t616 that i had or perhaps it is because motorola is a disaster other than the t616 i have been a committed customer from the brick phone through the flip phone past the v86 all the way to the razr my dad works there so i feel obligated but i shall not buy agayn from motorola or tmobile until they produce a product that a does not break all the time b is not slow as molasses c is not designed to look cool while functioning poorly see motorolas enormous recall of the razr sorry but this phone just plain sucks,157,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,when i purchased this phone i was looking for something durable and small what i got was the worst phone i have ever had i have had phones back to 1993 when i had my bag phone the keys are really tough to use because they are all flat reception is not good and the worst of all for me it is the slowest thing i have ever seen if you text people do not buy this phone i tested it against someone the other day it took me just as long to get to the screed just to write a text message as my friend took to get to the text screen and send it it is rediculous I have had this for 4 months on a two year contract and I am going to bite the bullet and buy another phone at a rediculous price,143,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,I have used the razr as my sole phone for over a year now and although as a long-time nokia user i resisted the less intuitive user interface of the razr I have come to know and love this phone it is easily the most durable phone I have ever used which is suprising considering it is obvious refinement and seeming delicacy I have dropped it many times on concrete and the most I have ever had to do is pop the battery cover back on it is not even scratched it syncs perfectly with my mac i can create and transfer my own mp3 ringtones via bluetooth without a hitch using the bluetooth software that comes with mac os x the picture identification works as expected for a change the voice dialing feature is easy to set up and use the speaker volume for rings speakerphone and earpiece are the loudest I have ever heard in a phone and it is the only flip phone I have found that is thin enough to fit comfortably in my pants pocket i think it is wrong to rate phones based upon their ability to find a strong signal because there are just too many factors at play and even identical models of any phone can show a different number of bars in the same area it is a roll of thethat said reception has been outstanding for me even where some other models have failed if you are not used to motorola phones just keep in mind that the user interface will take some time to master but once you grow into it you will appreciate this phones strengths,264,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,I am happy i finally made the switch from my 5 year old samsung sch 8500 i have just one complaint about the instrument even at maximum volume i can not hear too well in loud / crowded places but my biggest complaint is that i never did receive the rebate from amazon i bought this phone in december 2005 and signed up for a 1-year contract with t-mobile i got an email in april saying that my submission for a rebated had been validated I have tried emailing amazon from the rebate website and also tried calling the toll free number several times i now get a message that my rebate number is not valid needless to say i feel robbed I had much rather have stayed with sprint who i found to be much better than t-mobile and got the new samsung phone that they started offering in february,146,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i switched to this phone after being assured i would have at least the same reception as my previous phone the razr turns out to have extremely poor reception verizon techs have admitted to me that the antennae in the handset just does not pick up well what has verizon wireless told me about this problem resulting in dropped calls delayed voice message alerts and poor signal reception just that i have passed the worry free 15 day return period so my only option is full retail replacement thanks verizon,89,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,love this phone does what a phone has to without any extra frills the battery life with blue tooth enabled is pretty poor love the compact size pretty sturdy build too,31,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,the phone maybe fine but t-mobile is the worst customer service i have ever come across they could not get the phone to work possible a bad sim card but do charge for the call to the customer service which was 38 min being on hold and no fix and promises which they did not keep they also refuse to give any credit for no service or to make up for it in anyway i have to recommend to stay a way from t-mobile since they do not want to serve or sell a service that works a real rip off,100,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,I have had this phone for about 9 months now when i bought it this was the only phone of it is kind thin and wallet like there were no other makes like the similar ones from samsung and more that are available now or many colors that are available now and cingular did not really offer much choice in terms of phones anyway it was stylish and was very highly rated now here is the review 1 good reception 2 sound volume is average can be louder 3 thin but wider than most phones 4 the camera on the phone stopped working when i try that feature it will just freeze and go blank the only to restart is to take the battery out and plug it back in 5 i charge it overnight and then make one call in the morning and the battery dies indicator starts blinking 6 sent it back to cingular under the warranty they sent me another one may be refurbished may be not hard to tell but it has the blue motorola logo on it so must be an older one conclusion razors glory days are behind it over the long run the phone is not reliable if you are in the market today i think there are other better choices available i will not recommend this phone,219,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i only have 70 hearing in both of my ears and am regretting not doing more research prior to buying this stupid razr unless i am in my car with the radio off or in my house i do not even bother answering my phone i can not use it on the trains to and from work outside of my building near the somewhat-busy chicago streets or pretty much anywhere else if you want a phone that you can hear the people you are talking to do not buy this phone,89,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,only had it for a few months when i would close the phone then open it i realized the phone had shut off completely by itself and this happened on a daily basis i would close my phone put it in my purse and people would try calling me and told me it went straight to voicemail often i would flip it open and the screen would be completely white the phone was still on but the screen was white sometimes it would not start or charge and this had nothing to do with batteries or setting well i lost the phone yesterday and believe it or not i was sooo happy to lose it I have had 7 or 8 phones in my lifetime and this was the worst one i would complain about it every single day do not say you were not warned,142,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,my family got three new razr phones in nov 2005 so far all of them have been replaced at least once under warranty service one as many as three times not sure why these phones are still on the market or how motorola is still in business they all have bad batteries that last 6 months or less to have to replace the phones so often for defects blows me away someone needs to file a class-action lawsuit against motorola it costs me shipping and handling each time i have to replace the phone hint hint any lawyers out there,102,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this phone is the worst one i have ever owned tmobile is great to work with but this phone i would never recommend it drops calls and breaks up i rank it as the worst of the worst that motorola has ever put out junk,45,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i have had my razr for about six months now and will not elaborate on the positive and negative aspects of the phone as that has been accomplished in other reviews however my experience with t-mobile as a carrier has been awful and worth noting here i have had numerous issues with billing and statements which is fine to be expected in this industry but the customer service reps are so offensive and accusatory it makes me not want to call when i have questions perhaps that is t-mobiles intent in an attempt to reduce calls but as a customer in good standing i would expect customer service to be more open and available to questions especially when in many instances upon closer inspection their billing statement was shown to be erroneous put simply t-mobiles customer service is frustrating to work with and when you are locking yourself into a contract for a year that is not comforting at all,156,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,this is an address book it gives you a separate listing or line for each phone number no addresses or notes so if your contact has four s you get four separate listings phone numbers are listed by first name then last name that is it not filed by last name first hey we are not all in high school where we look up our contacts by their first name no memory card so if you have more phone s than the phones memory i think it is 1000 or 2000 s just cull them out because they will not fit on your phone unless all your numbers are on the sim card rather than phone memory which limits it now to 100 or 250 s depending on the sim card no way you are gon na get speed dial to work the font used by the phone is a throwback to a decade or more ago not pretty to read the alarm clock is a pain to use you can set five alarm clocks and i like the eight minute snooze but you must reset the alarm each day and it takes a few steps,190,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,I have owned maybe 20 cell phones over the past 15 years the good news about the razr it is small and light and you barely feel it in your pocket the bad news about the razr everything else scrolling sound quality visability ease of use it is just a piece of junk,52,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,let me just start by admitting i sure am glad i waited 6 months of owning the razr v3 before writing a review i was psyched when i got my new phone in december 2005 that it worked perfectly it was just as stylish as promised the screen resolution was and is excellent and it was just great as i was used to the motorola interface and all it is little quirks however just six months later my phone is unusable just out of the blue the all the keys stop working well correction one key still works the power button i end up having to drag out an old phone to use because given a few days the razr miraculously recovers however it is tiresome hauling a back-up phone around i do not know what gives but I am tired of this little quirk which can be a major problem if I am faced with an emergency overall a very unstable disappointing product,156,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,I have own this phone for 2 months and felt quite disappointed the phone looks beauty and cool however since it is too thin and wide the feeling in hand is not so good as everybody knows the battery sucks with wired ear bud it may support talk time from 2 hours to 3 hours at most but with bluetooth ear bud most of the time it can only have 15-hour talk time but when you use bt ear bud the phone automatically disable all the customized the ring tones so that you have no way to know who has calling you from the ring tones the only good thing of this model over my old v300 cell phone is the mini usb port which let me easily download / upload pictures and ring tones from my computer but the software is not come with the phone same as v300 you still have to buy the software luckily you save the money for the data cable if you have a digital camera or camcorder which uses the same mini usb cable,177,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,cell phone is great pros great function features very cool style no antenna internal and external display cons video time is too short a little to wide could not hide numbers secretly no flash feature for night camera shots suggestions needs to have a self destruction feature when loosing phone due to all the picture memory and video clips,59,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i bought this phone in feb it is now june and the thing completely died on me by the 3rd month i liked the look and feel of this phone compared to my old fatty nokia 6600 and the menus were easy to customize however the speaker volume at maximum sounded very low compared to my old phone and the metal round hinges that held my flip phone together kept popping out i thought i was having dropped calls when i realized my phone would just shut off and no i did not hit the power button the backlight to my key pad kept going on and off and the text messaging began to slow down the more i used it the battery life was great until my phone randomly shut off during a charge session i dropped my phone on carpet once and the battery cover on the back flew right off i highly recommend you get the warranty from your service provider do not rely on motorola alone because when i called them they just pointed me to my service provider who would not exchange the phone without a warranty plan which i did not purchase when i bought the phone back in feb good luck and i hope you do not get a lemon like i did,215,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,do not let the nice look deceive you i bought this phone in september 2005 it looks really nice and flat but 1-phonebook is prehistoric you can not store more than one number under the same name unless you enter the name again 2-the charger seems to have some connection error after 2 months i have to move the plug up and down till this sensitive gets electricity i had nokia and sony ericsson before and used them for at least 2 years with no problem motorola after 3 months started giving me trouble will never buy and recommend this product,100,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,we are very disapointed with this phone in march 2006 we switched over to t-mobile service got three phones two were razrthe problem no service in any commercial building if it were just one of the razr phones we would have it checked out but both phones do not work inside buildings we have trouble at times getting service in our own house we had talked to several people who use t-mobile and were impressed by the package and service available so we switched none of those people have a razr phone and none have any problems with reception anywhere the third phone on our plan samsung has no difficulty getting reception do not waste your money on this phone or at the very least do not plan on using it inside,132,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i got my first razr in january in february the phone just stopped turning on for no reason i did not drop it there was no damage done to it the screen simply stopped lighting up so i returned it to cingular and they quickly sent me another one 2 months later my phone started dialling the number 2 constantly whenever it was open again did not drop it or damage it in any way i can not call anyone whose number is not 222 - 222 - 2222 i hate this phone,85,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,to put it simply the v3 looks great the v3 works just ok i previously owned the motorola v330 and i was very happy with the way that phone functioned my only problem was that i wanted something slimmer that would not bulge when i had on a suit i bought the razr about a month ago and i can honestly say that it does not work as well as the v330 i have trouble hearing callers unless i hold the phone just right and even with the blue tooth i have both the motorola hs850 and the hs700 the volume is still a bit low i have also encountered drop calls periodically with the razor that i did not get with the v330 both phones are with t-moble lastly the razr is extremely easy to scratch buy a cover as i type this i am wondering if the reception problems are due internal against external antennas all in all i am not that impressed with the razrs functionality only with it is form the v330 works just as well if not better and for the money one would expect the razor to be a bit sharper,195,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,so far the phone seems to be alright i just switched from nextel so anything is an improvement i have dropped it a few times and it is still working fine,31,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i got this phone for mothers day from my husband and it is great it takes wonderful pictures when you forget your real camera at home i took pictures of our daughter in the hospital and it takes great in-door shots so her daddy could see how she was doing my husband was thrilled to see the photos i took the phone works great and since we live so far up north in the redwood forests we get clear perfect reception i was so thrilled with this new phone i love it and take it everywhere comes with several fun things to add to the phone too try one out you will love it too i have not had anything go wrong yet and I have dropped it a few times with nothing breaking i have the silver one it is thin comfortable to hold and easy to dial without trying not to hit other buttons in the process my friends all want one too so far this is the best phone yet,167,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,my first cell phone carrier t-mobile first razr has garbled / distorted reception right out of the box after a month with no improvement i spend a day and a half having the phone checked out to no avail t-mobile sends me another not only is it a return from someone else they charge me 1095 s h for their defective phone second razr has same problem i live in 4 - 5 bar t-mobile coverage area i even kept voice mails to confirm / prove bad reception local phone store salesman who has a razr confirms he has to use bluetooth to get acceptable reception and t-mobile rep says they have more problems with razrs than any other phone they sell i am going thru the return process for the second time t-mobile acts like the problem is only with me they do not have any history of poor reception or problems with the razr i am just glad i only have 10 more months on a 12 month contract i have spent four working days trying to get a phone that works with a service i have used less than 2 hours in two months buyer beware,192,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,dust dust dust dust everywhere this phone has the tendency to attract dust and keep it tightly within there has so much dust accumulation on the inside screen that i can barely see the background picture of my [ ] i called motorola about this problem and they feign ignorance they pretended that i was the first caller to ever report this problem look on the internet and you will find a zillion reviews relating to this issue call quality is mediocre at best if you have a choice to not pick this one on your plan do not,96,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i got my razr since febuarary and the first thing i noticed was that the phone dropped calls that were longer than 5 mins i thought it was a reception problem but it kept on happenning everywhere i went so i called t-mobile tech support and they told me my phone was a factory defect they sent me a replacement around 11 shipping at my own cost so it is not free and it is been working well as for the ringtones it is worth the money to invest on the application software so you can upload your own rigntones also saves pics calendar contacts to your pc although you need to convert your own music with a mp3 editing software before loading it to the phone,123,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i purchased this phone in the middle of january 2006 and have had nothing but issues at first my phone just proceded to turn itself on and off as it pleased wherever i was and whatever time it happened to be i had enough of this towards the end of march and spoke with a t-mobile representative who basically told me it was a design flaw with the phone and he would send me a slightly larger battery which will solve the problem we will i received the battery the last week of march and as of yesterday my phone will not even take a charge i spoke with t-mobile again this morning and got nowhere they told me it was a design flaw again and they would send another battery i would not recommend this phone i know other people including my best friend who have had this issue over the past few months with the razr v3 2 of which have it through cingular not t-mobile as i do i will defintiely not purchase another razr or uprgraded version of this phone again,183,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this phones flaws include a ergonomically unfriendly dialing and gripping the phone are uncomfortable b has a muted volume the volume is inadequate it is impossible to carry on a coherent long conversation on this phone c an annoying buzzing sound once the connection is established d large number of dropped calls even in large metropolitan areas e menus are user unfriendly the menus are not logical for example when you miss a call you usually want to know who called and then check voicemail on this phone you are forced to check voicemail before seeing the name of the missed caller who wants to do that f no memory expansion available i like to make voice records but i can not tap into the large bank of photo memory on my previous phone the user had the choice of dedicating memory toward voice records or photos g the software that allows synchronization of contacts with ones pc is unreliable unfortunately you can only sync contacts about 1/10 attempts due to software issues h phonebook does not support multiple numbers per person so if you have 5 numbers for george bush then you will have 5 entries for george bush i you can not display sim card memory or phone memory so if you have 3 numbers for george bush then 6 entries will show up 3 corresponding to the sim card and 3 corresponding to the phone so bottom line this is a horrible phone probably the worst cell phone I have ever had I have had 4 so far it is unusable,257,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is an excellent phone great reception great sound the speakerphone works the speech recognition works even in a car even with my young sons voice also pairs easily with bluetooth headsets i can not speak for the camera or the browser or most of the other functions sorry i do not use them,52,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,the problem with this phone is that some white dust gets accumulated under the screen i exchanged the first one and got a new one because of this reason now the new one also started getting the white dust under the screen also my friends and coworkers phones have this dust some of them very badly like 1/3 of the screen is covered by this dust apart from this everything looks good,72,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,too bad i had to give this phone 1 star amazon should change that so users can give it no stars read on after owning three 3 razr phones in 3 months i gave up good news was that cingular was very nice each and every time i had to do an exchange it was no hassle and very easy but this review is not about cingular it is about motorola and that waste of a phone they call razr dust under the view screen was a problem low low low volume was a big problem dropped calls slow and sluggish command responses i also bought the software to make my own ring tones and sync up with outlook but the software was quirky and had a mind of it is own too i rarely write reviews but am compeled to urge you not to buy the razr the one i own now thanks to cingular is the sony w600 and have no regrets no dust good volume no dropped calls software works like it is supposed to fast command response no worries,179,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i have owned motorola phones in the past and they have all been terrible i knew i should not have gotten the razr but it was a special deal and i had lost my good samsung phone so i got suckered in looks great performs horribly 1 the camera stopped working inside of a few days and all the pics came out as a blurred mess 2 reception was horrible and I have never had reception probs with t-mobile 3 sound quality is terrible i could not understand people think of the teacher from charlie brown muaa waa wa waaaa waa 4 it says you have 4 new messages when there is only one 5 the response time when you press a button is up to two seconds 6 the volume knob is in a bizarre hard to get to place in the upper part of the flip do yourself a favor and say as far away from any motorola product as possible and if you get suckered in you would better buy the insurance plan because it is not if it is when for me it lasted about 2 months before completely falling apart,188,59

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this phone is clearly a marketing gimmick the worst reception ever on a cell phone i have had other phones all nokias that did not have all the bells and whistles of this phone but i actually received phone calls if you live in an area that does not have the greatest reception you will really regret this purchase i hope i save one poor soul from this phone,67,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,this is the very lastest in technology that money can buy it got everything from a camera to organizing all your dates and events this phone is great for those on the go people with not very much time but lots of things to do there was one thing i did not like about this phone although it is a flip phone which normaly is quite stylish but when you open this one out it is really big really thing but really long making it look sometimes old fasioned to me other than that this is a great product a cool querky desing makes it ultra desirable to the professional end of the market overall i really enjoyed this phone well built well desinged and most of all stylish really it is quite something sam worrall rating4 stars motorals best product in a long time,141,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,the razr phone is great when it works but it has a strong tendency to break not shatter but something will happen like the camera will go out my razrs camera stopped working after less than a month of use pitiful for the cost of this phone i know that my problem is not an isolated incident because several of my brothers friends have had the exact same problem leading me to say this is unacceptable if they release a new version i might consider it but for me the looks of the razr are not worth the problems it carrys,101,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this is the worst cell phone i have ever had immediately i heard an annoying buzzing noise when phone was opened also while talking i hear a sound like a teapot boiling the volume sucks even at it is loudest it is sometimes hard to hear missed calls are not always reflected on outter screen stay away do not buy this phone buy a samsung,62,65

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,my husband has this phone it has better reception in our living room anyways than my beloved motorola v300 the camera and video are wicked i also love the bluetooth since my v300 does not have bluetooth capability or video I am interested in upgrading the razr would be the perfect phone for me but it is too darn wide it is like a graham cracker before you break it into quarters that is how it feels to me husband says it is perfect for him cos his hands n fingers are big with smaller phones he would always misdial cos the keys were too close together for him the razr seems to be a good phone i do not hear husband complain much about it it is just to wide for my dainty little hands,127,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,I have bought the razr v3 and the samsung t809 from t-mobile other than being thin razr has no outstanding features screen is not sharp an ugly looking hard to use menu with old looking text and images my old ericsson t68i had a better looking interface you are not able to manage your contacts in a good way you can not delete all contacts from the sim or from the phone so if you make a phonebook transfer from your sim you are stuck with duplicate a contact list although the usb interface is universal you can not use it because the phone does not come with any software you have to buy it from motorola,118,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i paid a fortune for the special edition magenta phone but it is hot pink the volume was low i thought it was just me but i could not always hear other people not too bad although just low the screen was always getting dirty makeup but i have not had that problem with other phones had to wipe screen all the time i found the phone too light to hold on shoulder while doing other things and talking it is a great looking phone and has some nice features but it broke easy i admit i dropped it twice it broke yesterday and now i have a 25000 phone i can not use they will not replace obviously and can not fix it i think the flip phones especially the thin ones are very delicate if you take care and do not drop it and do not mind not hearing other people now and then it is a nice phone,154,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i am a busines person and my needs for a cell phone are probally different than some of the consumers here i disagree with the person who says ignore the naysayers i bought my razor phone in march of 2006 and i have had to return the phone twice both times cingular gave me a new phone i am now having the same problems with this new phone the error message battery unable to charge keeps coming on making the phone inoperable yet the battery is fully charged also the screen of the phone is the worst I have ever had for attracting lint and i have to use a spray to twice a week cingular is aware of this problem by the way and the phone is difficult to hear other people on this is might be good phone for the average consumer who feels a cool looking phone adds to their image but if you are in business like me i would never own a razor,167,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,pros nice looking very nice design for keypad phone gets one star for this bluetooth main reason i wanted it gets another star for this easy to sell since everybody wants them cons very low volume it is hard to hear other people if there is a even a little noise around you even if you set it on the volume on highest setting for comparison with samsung e105 phone i can hear well even if the volume is set lower than highest can not see missed calls phone just displays missed calls and picked up calls together so there is no way to distinguish must copy to phone memory in order to use speed dial why should i have to do this too big yes it is thin but it would still would benefit from some weight loss after using it for couple days i ended up just selling them and went back to using my old samsung e105 no regrets about that conclusion if you looking to make then definitely get a free razr with your new service sell it for 150 200 and use to buy nicer simpler phone that is samsung x495 hint amazon sells it for 90 with t-mobile to go plan no contract if you do not want to go through this then just choose some other phone,229,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,the razr is now the most popular cell phone in the country almost half of my coworkers now have this phone and every single one of them is happy do not believe the naysayers on this board the razr is cool and after the recent firmware fix it now works better than ever,52,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,ok the good i got it for free it is made mostly of aluminum which is cool it looks cool it has a really nice screen on the inside it is large and the colors are decent the bad it drops calls almost as much as my old nokia which was inexpensive compared to the going cost of this razr i dropped it twice onto pavement and now it resets itself at random so this is basically my fault but come on we all drop our cell phones they should be able to withstand a couple of drops especially if it is made out of metal and not plastic the cameras resolution is pitiful the outer screen is unnecessarily tiny bottom line i expected more from this phone with all the hype from motorola but that is what happens when you give in to the media i suppose if you get this for free then i guess it is ok but i would never pay for this phone,164,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,the razr comes with a usb cable so that you can charge the phone from your computers usb port you can also use the same cable to upload pictures from the phone the charging / data plug on the phone is a mini usb jack cingular has very good coverage since it merged with att wireless so they have towers everywhere when i bought this phone from amazon i switched from t-mobile to cingular because of the coverage in the northeast us and international rates like the ads say do actually get more bars in more places,97,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,as with all my other cell phone reviews i just have to say that t-mobile is a great service provider and in my opinion the best out there compared to coverage and other problems that my friends have told me about sprint cingular and verizon t-mobile seems like heaven they have the best customer service i have ever dealt with and are very cheap especially the family plans that now are only 8 for an additional line and only 10 a month for unlimited text messaging for everyone on that account now to the phone i am on my 4th razr since january of this year i have had problems with the hinge screen and now this final issue not being able to recieve any calls in fact i have had similar experiences with all of the moto phones i have owned in the past c650 and v330 now t-mobile has agreed to let me swap my defunct razr for a hopefully better samsung e635 anyway as everybody knows this phone is very stylish and slim but very wide so it does not fit in many generic cell phone pouches and holders it is pretty durable as far as scratches go but the screens scratch easily do does the keypad and the screens show fingerprints camera is average voice quality is good speakerphone is average video capture is poor battery life is average screen is excellent although i have had to have repairs done and it shows fingerprints menu design is average bluetooth works well nothing much really stands out with this phone it is just an average mid-range motorola cell phone in a sleek package my advice there are better options,283,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,this is by far the worst phone that has ever landed on my lap my ancient nokias are better than this piece of junk to start the phone gives a wide variety of programs to use and those that stand out are the outdated picture camera and aim although aim in my opinion is unsurpassed it is outdated camera is far surpassed by other competition this phone gives you a mp3 player a video player and all the goodies but the video recorder is horrid with a set limit of seconds and no easy straight way to upload songs and oh by the way these are short clips not full-length because of the memory of the phone is just that limited the looks has to be up there but the phone itself does not come close to it is exotic appearance the overall phone lags enough for an easy notice the phone does not even come close to user-friendly and bottem line getting this phone is going to piss you off more than make you smile there is actually one quality that can be said and it is the reception I have noticed razrs generally give decent reception on any given day on any given provider so finally a good characteristic the overall phone sucks bottem line and that is it not much more to say it is so bad you will not even feel slight happiness getting it for free horrible buy,235,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,razr is the phone to get if you are into form and function i have the first generation one from t-mobile and my only problem is the camera resolution it is very low bluetooth is great connect with the car bmw and headset sony with no problems speaker phone is a must if you have young kids,56,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this phone is nothing but trouble yes it is stylish but it is not a good phone i do not have the problem with the battery that another person mentioned however my display keeps messing up even going away i take excellent care of my phone i never let my daughter play with it I am the only one who uses it i have only had it about 3 months and have already had to replace it once and now i need another replacement t-mobile must be having problems with the phone also because it is no longer listed for sale on their web-site all i can do is give you my advice buy a different phone,115,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,this phone has terrible battery life a big sacrifice for the thin profile I have actually tried two razrs thinking the first was defective because it was unable to get me through the day the second was the same what good is a phone that must be tethered to the recharger most of the time i traded the razr for a pudgy samsung sch-a950 not as stylish but so far the battery life has been great the razr does have a huge display and some nice features if they could only fix the battery problem,94,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,bbb reliability report the better business bureau of washington state processed a total of 11566 complaints about this company in the last 36 months the standard reporting period of the total of 11566 complaints closed in 36 months 5461 were closed in the last year the company has an unsatisfactory record with the bureau pros free reduced price phone 1 year 2-year with cingular or others contract cons frequent network outages and technical glitches horrendous customer service go with another carrier or be writing a similar review soon,88,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,my wife and i own razrs she is rough with her technology she recently dropped it in water and has on several occassions dropped it on our hardwood floors I am impressed with the phone and t-mobile as a provider they have excellent customer service you actually speak to someone and who speaks english as their first language,57,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,well I am on my 4th razr v3 now the first one had broken bluetooth and a buggy os returned for warranty repair and got a refurbished v3 the second one had lines running down the screen the moment i turned it on proving the refurbished phones are still very broken returned this on for warranty repair got the third v3 and within 2 weeks the screen was going black when opening the phone had to take battery out to reset and put screen back on just to have it continually repeat sent it in for warranty repair this time they cingular send me a new phone that was unusable from the first second i got it this v3 dropped calls like no manana in a 2 minute converstation you were calling back the caller 3 - 4 times sent it in for warranty repair and got my 4th phone two weeks ago this phone has a nice visual aspect but is very unreliable terrible camera resolution and the screen has the same bad resolution nothing like the sony ericsons or samsungs never had a problem with my samsung in 3 years less than one year and 4 razrs the screen on the front of the phone is always dark and in the sunlight you can not see anything on either battery life is about 3 days on a fresh battery but nothing like my samsung that would last 5 i would caution against this phone,242,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i would give 4 stars to the phone i am happy with the phone as well as the customer service for the product the only thing razr v3 lacks is a good search capability for the phone database else it is very good,44,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i bought the razr with having only looked at it online it looks great and has several really neat features but looks are not everything if you do not hold the phone just right and not where it is comfortable you can not hear the other person at all also the buttons are flush with the phone which makes it very easy to mis-type a number or type something out of whack when sending a text i am not overly impressed with this phone,81,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,overall the phone is not too bad but the volume is horrible if the phone is not positioned just right over the ear you can not hear squat the features are cool but if i can not hear the other person what good is the phone,40,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i am now on my 2nd razr v3 in the last 10 days the 1st phone had an annoying humming noise from the ear piece and alot of static i now have my replacement and although the phone has yet to start humming everyone sounds like static i should have continued using my motorola 722i that i have had for the past 3 years everyone sounded very clear,67,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i remember ordering a motorola razr but this phone clearly says that it is a razor this is a clear breach of typographical misconduct,23,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i got this phone from t-mobile they had a buy 1 get 1 free deal so i decided why not so far this has been the best phone it is charge lasts forever and reception is fabulous people tell me they can not even tell I am on a cell phone the speaker phone works perfect as well as the hands free set it comes with i would recommend this phone anytime to anyone,71,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i got my 1st razr v3 through t-mobile and discovered the camera would not work i had to mail it back before they would replace it the new phone i received a couple of weeks later worked for a couple of weeks but the battery was drained in less than a 24period sometimes when you press the number 2 on the third phone the one i have now nothing happens and has to be reset to factory settings it looks good although motorolas moto motto should be it is better to look good than work good,96,89

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,daughters review it is a great phone but i think there should be more features pros it is the most cute phone out there huge lcd screen great quality very clear good picture very thin good for talking on photo caller identification voice dialing 4x zoom camera cons could be a little more easy to understand at first stupid ringtones only found 3 good ones overall great cell phone get the pink one,70,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,my wife and i just got razr phones for use on the t-mobile network although i sometimes wish the menus were a bit more intuitive the quality of the calls and the look of the phone are fantastic the quality of the reception compared to our old phones are significantly improved highly recommended,53,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i had heard so much negative about it flimsy low volume slow-software low signal strengthsnone of that it is a wonderful phone volume is just fine software is great hey it is motorolas generic software and signal is great too i bought it at sams club kiosk anyone can buy there without membership for like 69 1 year comittment and refund of activation in 3 months no mail-in hassels i get headaches from mail-in scams,72,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,this is my fifth phone and i really like motorolas features personalized ringtones categories in the phone book that can also have specific ringtones ease of use for the menusthe razr is a sharp looking phone has great specs fits nicely in my pocket or my purse and has a very nice display easy to read too i miss the status light from my other phones which was a quick way to glance at the phone and see if i had missed a call or had new voicemail the vibrate function is a bit weak probably due to the phone size the speaker function is loud and clear my main complaint is that there are not enough slots for voice activated dialing only 20 when the phone can hold 1000 entries and that does not include your sim card i think 50 should be the minimum for most of us who have lots of friends and family and/or lots of business contacts that we are in frequent need to call while on the run and using hands-free sets speaking of hands-free sets i do not understand why the motorola bluetooth headsets and phones do not always use the same power adapter i do not like having to carry cords for my laptop pda phone and headset overall it is a good phone and i would still recommend it i use this phone for both personal and business so it is going to get a lot of use i highly recommend the bluetooth headsets too i never realized how tethered to my phone i was until that cord disappeared no more jamming the phone in your shoulder either,271,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i recently purchased this phone not on amazon actually a t-mobile booth at costco this is my first phone however my brother and mom also on he t-mobile plan have cheaper phones which do not even begin to compare with the razr v3 it is so thin and lightweight enough to carry around in my pocket without so much as causing a wrinkle yet it is very durable considering the fact that it has been dropped a few times the screen on the outside f the phone is very nice espc for incoming calls and caller identification the screen insde of the phone is beautiful it is big enough to see everything clearly i love the keypad as well it combines sleek appealing looks with funtionallity and practicality the camera and videocamera capabilities are nice and great quality everything was easy to use and understandable too there are so many features that this phone truely is a toy for adults i completely am satisfied and i love this product so if you want a phone that not only is useful but is packed with amazing features trust me buy the razr v3,189,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,being a [ former ] sprint customer i am quite pleased with the razr and overall tmobile customer service I have recently purchased the phone a few days ago and have not had any difficulties sitting here searching for flaws as nothing comes to mind except the lack of options for the skin feature which is still a minute ingredient as any girl would know it is a bit challenging to put a phone in our back pockets comfortably with the razr it is almost like it is not even there at least until you sit on it one thing i was skeptical about was the layout of the keypad most flat keypads are difficult for girls to tap because of our nails the razr equally sections off every key making it easier to grip easy faceplate dissection is a nice known feature as well if you like to match 0 pictures picture mail text messaging video bluetooth web and more worked as expected and i am overall pleased,161,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,the razr is a stylish phone and the price seems right and most of the features are okay bluetooth was a biggie for me and this phone seems to perform fine there is however one major flaw which is not documented anywhere the capacity for sms messages is fixed it is not calculated from the memory of the machine which at 5 megs should be plenty rather it is hardwired my phone maxes out at 30 sms messages that is it you have to start deleting after that i had to call motorola and speak with an engineer to learn about this feature so if text messaging is important to you and is the major reasoning behind my getting a new phone be aware of this limitation,129,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i bought this phone on the internet which will be free in 6mos after the rebates i drive a convertible and use the phone at freeway speeds with no problem hearing and the other person never has a problem hearing me reception is very clear no dropped calls i figured out a lot of the functions before reading the manual which is a complete dud most manuals today are a waste of time written by some engineer who does not know the language i want to set it up for voice activation not explained too good either i play around with the setting every day and it is really up to the user to decide what they want it to do it is a little delicate and use with care i dropped it into a cup of coffee day 2 and it did not damage it i think the battery will get better after a couple of chargings like a lot of equipment also liked the one year contract 2 years is too long tmobile 1500 minutes I have used up half in 2 weeks and the phone is hot looking and easy to use keys camera voicemail and more give the phone some time and keep trying or ask questions btw some people here complained about dust or dirt on the display not coming off maybe it still has the protective plastic cover on the face if so remove it and use the phone without the plastic or maybe it needs the protective cover,248,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,got this phone about 2 months ago it has recently started emitting a quiet high pitched whine where you normally have your ear when making calls when the phone is open and the screen on as well as a low buzzing noise from the area where you speak into the phone i had heard about this problem before and I am not sure if motorola will fix this but i will try to send it in soon the phone itself works great and the noises are annoying but everything still functions perfectly,91,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,I have had this phone since it first came out and i have nothing bad to say about it i have dropped it numerous times yeah it happens to us all and i am going back in a few days to get another one i have never had the dust under the screen problem and the only place i carry it is in my pocket has never blanked out very comfortable and if you ever get tired of holding it the speaker phone works great i would recommend this phone to anyone who likes to carry their phones in their pockets as it is a very comfortable cell to carry around if you have the dust under the screen problem i am sorry i have never had this problem nor ever heard of it until just now thanks for reading,139,100

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,ok if you keep this phone in your pocket you will get lint and dust under the screen and there has no way to clean it out I have had my phone for 5 weeks and i started noticing dust on the screen that i could not clean off that is when i noticed that the dust was under the screen not on it so i took it to a cingular store and they said oh well just thump the screen until the dust falls to the bottom um what and then they said or just do not carry it in your pocket that was it that is their answer to this problem thump the screen it does not work btw the static on the inside of the screen holds the dust like a magnet oh and if you google dust inside razor phone screen you will see that lots and lots and lots of people have this problem oh yeah one more thing motorola will not fix the phone for you neither will cingular even if you have insurance they say it is your problem not a phone problem,181,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,pros looks great sounds great thin but not too small huge display cons low battery life hard to talk on for more than two hours cumbersome recommendations get car charger and get bluetooth hands free set i hope this review helped,41,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this is the worst case of customer service I have experienced in my life about six months ago i bought motos v3 tmobile via amazon 200 when i turned on the phone the display on the screen often was reversed as if read in a mirror i returned the phone to amazon which immediately replaced it unfortunately the replacements screen would go dark every now and then for no apparent reason requiring me to remove the battery and install to get it back by then amazon would no longer exchange the phone i sent it back to moto viai called moto weekly to find out how long it would take to be repaired or replaced for two weeks no one could find it in the system each time i called i was told it was being investigated with their highest priority on the 20th day after the package had been received by moto the customer service rep finally told me the box was empty and they were again investigating seven days later moto finally called me to say that they had concluded their investigation and that the box was definitely empty and i should contactfor reimbursement,199,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,best phone i ever had and i have had them all been a constant cell phone user since the motorola brick 1983 - 84 i think in the six months i have had it it has never dropped a call t mobile i use about 2000 minutes a month and all calls are short 2 - 15 min i have made long calls also and had no problems there either it has turned off three times since i have had it not sure what causes this i do not care what a phone looks like but it must work in my business and this one does everything i need,103,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,I have had my razr v3 for about 3 months this was my first motorola phone and I am used to samsung and sanyo so it took a little while to get used to the different functions of this phone the different menus and things like that i will say that the phone seems to be fairly durable i was worried i would scratch the large screen on it and i have not done so yet I have dropped it several times on concrete in the snow in the rain and i have not had a problem with it once you get used to the way motorola phones work i think you will be quite pleased with this phone pros battery lasts a very long time motorola bluetooth wireless headsets work very well with this phone cool styling everyone seems to want one nice colorful screen picture and video loud speakerphone cons not very much memory on the phone for video and picture difficult to download ringtones may just be my service hard to find a good looking leather case plastic snap case sometimes catches on things and the phone goes flying buttons are small and hard to push at times screen constantly getting smudged when phone is pressed against face in use overall-not a bad phone i like the ease of use and compatability with bluetooth wireless headsets phone is very slim and sleek packed with features and i have not had a problem with it yet even with the occasional rough treatment,247,106
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i have had this cell phone for six months and have been very please i use cingular so i get excellent reception even out in the middle of nowhere i like to hunt and it makes for a small phone to stick in my pocket the only problem i have with it is that the speaker phone is not that great you will also want to get a low profile cover on it becasue it is so small it is easy to drop i have dropped it several times and it has still held up,94,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is a very good phone period i was initially worried about some people giving bad reviews complaining about razr and poor t-mobile service but it seems to be fine with me the phone looks awesome the sound quality is great the t-mobile service is good in places i have used so far new jersey / nyc / pa / ct except low signal bars in some areas which is the same with most of the carriers and for the price at amazon it is unbeatable come on i can make and receive calls with no problems take jpgs / mpgs and bluetooth capable device can be used in other parts of the world after unlocking the phone and you can too i was also looking at motorola v360 for the mp3 capability but zeroed for this razr for the looks and am very very happy with it go for it [ ignore those bad reviewers either they are careless to take care of the phone or they want everything in one device ],161,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,I have had 9 cell phones in the past 6 years so i consider myself fairly knowledgable in this area all things considered this phone is pretty good it is not perfect but it works what more do you want cons as with other motorola phones the ui is not very intuitive also the thinness of the phone makes it somewhat difficult to handle and cradle on my neck battery life is not as good as I am used to with my nokia phones pros voice quality is great reception is great in the boston area with t-mobile service bluetooth is nice screen quality is best I have ever seen on a phone highly recommend this phone,113,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is the best cellphone i have owned to date and I have owned a lot of them the razr does everything i want it to do yet the form factor is so thin and it looks so beautiful that i can hardly imagine it actually being any better it performs very well and i have zero complaints with it voice quality both in my ear and to the person I am talking to seems clear and not distorted reception seems good as well sure voice quality and reception could always be improved with any cellphone that is a given but the razr exhibits no worse performance than any other cellphone I have owned / tried yet it excels over others in it is design it has such a small and thin footprint when closed yet when flipped open it is comfortable to use even for a long conversation the fact that it supports a wireless bluetooth headset is an added plus you can put the phone in a pocket or purse and talk totally hands free with a bluetooth headset the razr also supports a wired headset and in fact comes with one free in the package it also has a built-in speakerphone which works but is best used in a quiet environment speakerphone does not work very well outdoors or in the car with the windows down in all for the price especially with rebates the motorola razr seems like a great deal here is an example where the cool design and form factor does not hamper the performance,252,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,well i got this phone after a year of it coming out as it was just to expensive then paid 100 bucks for it at bb with a 2 year contract back in sept at first i wanted the black one but it was not part of the sale at bb so i got the silver one and i am very very happy that i got the silver one from the black one that a friend of mine has the scratches are much more visible and to be honest it does not look as nice as the silver one does it works great and there are tons of things you can do to modify the phone and make it even better i just wish it would not of been as wide as it is but the slimness makes up for it that i almost always forget that i have it in my shirt pocket go get one now,155,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,you said a drawback was on the recent calls list i believe if you select this menua soft key on most phones then it will take you to the received calls and dialed calls so i do not see why you say that it does not distinguish those two and then if you click on received calls the ones that have a check mark next to it are the ones you answered and the ones without a check mark are missed calls same thing with dialed calls the ones with a check mark are the ones that were answered by the other party or went through even if it was voice mail i live in dallas and i do not find that the sound is very loud for me i used to have the motorola v400 and it sounded the same i try not to use my phone in the car because there will be a lot of huh going on i do not think other people that are saying this are lying or are too dumb to know we may all have different working phones i do not know what it is but just be grateful that you hear fine on yours but do not put down the others that do not have a great phone like yours,214,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,the phone looks really stylish and the design is ok bad things terrible battery life once it is down will not let you turn it on before you charge the battery not good at capture the signal sound quality not so good photos taken by the camera is a litter bit of greenish so far not very like motorola products would go for other brands next time,70,113
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,all in all the razr is a pretty sweet little phone being a twenty year old female of course i have to have the coolest looking phone and the one with all the cool extras the camera is okay but not stellar picture wise the video camera is pretty cool as well but i do not plan on using it however the major problem i have had with this phone is the annoying beep it gives out when the battery is low after getting it from the store it was of course going dead after a few minutes it beeped and alerted me of low battery okay fine whatever surely it will die soon right well i got the phone at about noon and it was still beeping long into evening very annoying feature if someone knows how to get rid of that then this phone would be five stars for me otherwise if you are bothered by beeping every five to ten minutes do not bother with this phone update my friend just got this phone and it is a piece of crap very worthless and fragile,185,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i got this phone about three weeks ago i was skeptical about buying it because i heard so many things about it too fragile easily malfunctions when it drops and more but so far i can not complain about the phone it works great it has the best reception on any phone that i ever had this is my fourth phone in five years the ringer is great you can hear it clearly the extras are great and it looks very cool however even i make sure that i am careful with the phone i strongly suggest that you do not plop the phone down on any counter top or any hard surface i made that mistake and the outer screen temporarily blanked out but it quickly came back on overall this is a very cool phone and i also suggest that you get insurance on your phone so it can be replaced much easier than just buying a new one,158,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,one thing which really bugs me about this phone is that it is cabable of video playback it can download but you can not record from the phone i do not understand why especially since the technology is obviously there perhaps i should have done my homework first it is my first motorola always had a nokia before and there has a couple more things which do not impress me when sending a text message you have to go through a few screens before the text message actually gets sent also if I am writing a text message and i have to stop writing it for one reason or another the message does not save in the memory unlike nokia so that may take some getting used to all in all although i do like the sleek design and it lights up really well,136,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,my mother bought me one of these for my birthday in september 05 both of them are broken and now i have purchased another more durable phone the first phone was accidentally dropped from a height of perhaps 4 1/2 feet while inside of a protective case the exterior screen prompty ceased to function the second phone got splashed with hydraulic oil and after the battery died it would no longer charge or do anything this phone is about as fragile as it looks it might be alright for little girls to carry in their purses but anyone who works any kind of physical job can not carry this phone without fear of it breaking the volume is also very low i had it at the top volume all the time and i could never hear the other person i was also a little disappointed by the ringtones i had another phone a while back that also broke unfortunately which allowed you to record your own ringtone this phone does not have this feature on the plus side the pictures it takes are pretty decent for a camera phone it is a nice looking phone but it is just not durable enough for me do not get it if you plan on carrying it in your pocket to work because it will not last,221,117
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,can not hear volume is too low ringing is loud enough although,11,118
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i hate to break it to you but apple computer had nothing to do with the design of this phone it is all motorola and kudos to them for bringing something this sleek and sexy to market,36,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,what an awesome design being a huge apple mac user and fan i truly appreciate this phone apple has always been known for their awesome design work the phone is great with two exceptions the volume out of the built in speaker on the phone is too low when you are driving with your windows down or sunroof open and the phonebook accessibility is not great i upgraded to this phone from an old nokia that had decent volume and the phonebook was accessible by using the keypad to type the first few letters of someone has name motorola does not allow that with this phonebook you put in the first letter of the name and then scroll through the names until you get to the number not the most efficient method when you have over 200 names in your phonebook i have been syncing the phone using os x isync address book and ical over bluetooth with no problems at all it works great all my names and numbers show up on the phone as well as my calendar which is a very nice upgrade over the nokia which would not sync with os x i am going to get a bluetooth headset and that should solve the volume issue,210,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,really many people complain about the razr capability but do not you buy a phone to make phone calls all the xtras are nice and dandy but you must remember that you do not buy a cell phone expecting a sony digital camera to pop out of it personally i luv the phone signal is great camera has some excellent pictures make sure you have a steady hand or they could turn a little fuzzylaughing out loud as far as the space issue 5 mb that is all you need for a phone download a couple of ringtones and call it a day if you want a full blown mp3 player I am sure walmart has a sale on them the motorola razr 3 is a great product and if you in the market for a new phone it is perfect go to the tmobile store and check the prices they can help you out ask them to add it to your cell phone bill if the money is a little tight if you want to upgrade to a two year plan right now is the time to get it 4999 with a 10000 mail in rebate so not only a cool phone that will turn heads buts it can be cheap and your friends do not even have to find how cheap it actually was was this any help,209,121
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,the phone works as expected but when it comes to interfacing the phone through the usb port to the pc there is numerous issues i would like to manage my address book and my local photo galary on my pc this not only allows for a nice back-up but also provides a convenient method for entering data into the phones address book this software does not come with the phone and is hard to find i finally found something on the motorola web site for 60 2995 software 2995 cable but one has to obtain a cable and the software independently which are not located in at the same place on their web site the web documentation on the site does not give a full discription of what the software will do and there are no assurances that these functions are supported it seems that a simple updownfunction should not cost 60 especially in light of the fact that this function was included at no cost with their older two way pagers which cost substantially less to take full advantage of any product all that is required to make the product functional should be considered and i believe this is a key part of that functionality any one buying this product should factor in the additional 60 into the cost when evaluating against other products in this class which now price it above many comperable products,238,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,well the phone is great it has all the cool fixtures a kid could have I have had this phone for 3 days now and it is awsome some things that are not good is that there has not alot of memory only 5 mb i could only have 2 songs for the mp3 player the other thing is that the buttons on the outside of the phone are stubby and need to have some strenghth to press it of course it is not that bad because u do not use those buttons that much another kool thing about my phone is that when u onlly have one signal on the phone and want to call somone send a message or even get on aim is that the signal gets to full another cool thing about the phone is aim it is really awsome to send messages to ur buddys of course the disadvantege of that is that it costs alot the camera is good with a 4x zoom in of course the figures is really awsome the really sucky thing is that u can not put more memory in the phone there has no memory card,186,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i was really put off by all the bad reveiws from razr owners on t-mobile and my original plan was to wait for the new razr v3i to come out however after losing my samsung e715 i was forced to use my upgrade and i got the current razr I shall admit there probably are other phones that have more features and may not be as fragile however look at this phone hardly has a phone become so popular due to it is aestheitically pleasing qualities alone it powered up for the first time inside a crowded mall immediately found signal and continues to carry it in areas where my samsung always dropped out the menus take some getting used to and the camera obviously is not perfect but then again i did not buy a digital camera it works well has a good speakerphone and luckily t-mobile service is strong in my area do i need to even mention how good it looks too,162,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i was pretty excited to get my new razr i was going to be a tech leader it is cool light easy to carry in a pocket and has lots of neat features that i do not really use then 2 months later it stopped working i think the software had a problem and it would not start up cingular got right on it and sent a replacement then 2 months later the replacement phones keypad stopped working again cingular is sending a second replacement i am so sad i am going to give the 2nd replacement a try but if it goes bad i am going to have to change phones i am not tied to my phone but being without it for a week every other month is a bit much,134,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this phone is really slick and good looking but also good quality it is really clear for both the user and the receiver in all cases with the phone or wireless headset or speaker phone the interface is user-friendly and easy to personalize to custom fit what you use most the voice calling is incredible and reliable the pictures are not bad for a camera phone i really like the 4x zoom option the only set back is if you buy this phone you should plan on getting a internet plan for your phone because there is no way to get the pictures off to a computer or something or get ring tones or wallpapers,114,126
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,as a customer in spain with a lot of vodaphone points chalked up i could get this phone for only 30 euros for me getting a phone is a serious business so why not get the one you love instead of having to take whatever you can get i still love it after ten weeks carried it to israel jordan england and france and it never fails people hear me well i hear them perfectly the battery lasts for several days the phone is tougher than old boot straps and i only have two gripes first of all style triumps over substance i find the keys all squished together instead of separated admittedly this is true of most phones but makes it impossible for my semi-blind wife to use secondly it does not use the symbian operating system so there is no program available for blind people well my wife used a symbian-based nokia for a few days which was heavier than the encyclopedia britannica and the blind-persons program was not very practical motorola nice job up to a point but instead of marketing pinkuns make a phone as beautiful as this but try to improve some of the facets some people have mentioned the os the camera and so forth,211,127
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i bought this phone and plan as the deal was too good to resist now i am not able to receive calls from some service providers they get a voice message this number is temporarily out of service i called t-mobile customer service 3 times and after being put on hold for more than 30 min finally was able to reach tech support he tried everything and in the end said that they can not help me [ if tech support can not then who can ] now i have been asked to go to a t-mobile store and they may be able to help me when i ask to talk to a supervisor i was transferred to a number which was playing the message the number you have reached is incorrect ha ha ha how funny will never take t-mobile service ever,140,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,the razr is a nice phone although it is very delicate and breaks easily motorola makes great phones the phone would be great if it was stronger but it is only good feature is it is slimness next is t-mobile their network is very small good luck getting signal i had t-mobile service for about 2 days and i dumped it because i could not get any service at my house if you really want the razr then get it from verizon wireless they have the best service in the cell phone industry i get full bars where people with t-mobile nextel and cingular have none i had cingular before also and i would drop calls almost every time i was on the phone with verizon i rarely drop calls it is great although i still would recommend a different phone than the razr,141,129
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i had been very happy with my motorola phone until the battery started losing it is charge within a day even when the phone was turned off the friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem after the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable due to customer abuse i have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage unless using it to make phone calls counts as customer abuse but got the same comment without explanation after i had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation it seems that motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty you will be fine with a motorola phone as long as it works after that you are on your own,162,130
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,I am sure the razr is a great phone but i would caution anyone from getting it with t-mobile service I have got it now and there are many times when I have got no service at all and my friends with other carriers have full bars I have tried to get them to explain why and i get no reaction so get the razr if you want but stay away from t-mobile until they fix their service problems,75,131
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is a good phone i love it I have had mine for a few months now thanks to my dad who bought me one some reveiws say this fone breaks easily I have spilled a whole glass of water on mine dropped it while it was open on the concrete at school and had it fall off my desk at home seriously you have to try to break this phone the software on it is the same as every other motorola phone I have used in the past if your familiar with motorola phones this will not be hard to use the camera is not the best but i do not really use my phone to take videos and pictures laughing out loud i kinda use mine to talk another thing i love about this fone is when someone calls there picture shows up on the screen i guess that is quickly becoming the standard for phones i think if you like being complemented on how cool your phone looks and talk regularly on the phone then get this i heard that a new version is coming out it looks cool it was set for release this year but there has only 2 or so weeks left laughing out loud,199,132
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i have had this phone for a month now and find it to be reliable the only thing i find odd is that the ringtones mysteriously change at times a few of my friends have also complained about the same issue other than that i am glad i purchased it,50,133
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i looked at all the bad things people said about this phone and thought that they were exagerating i have had this phone for 3 days the razr is hard to use the battery runs out almost as soon as you take it off the charger and too top it off it is already broke now it will not turn on or anything broke in three days,65,134
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i just purchased this phone with t-mobile having used the motorola v710 for two years to my relief the menu and key operations were nearly identical although the razr reverses the red and green keys with my sim chip installed the razr performed every bit as well as the reliable v710 with all my stored numbers still intact i love the sleek design it is so thin and light it fits into a pocket without bulge or cludginess the hi resolution video screen is more than twice the size of a regular cell phone making the screen much easier to see my bluetooth jabra worked flawlessly with the razr it might be a minor thing but the ac power adapter uses a standard usb port which is much better than the flimsy connector used by other motorola phones all in all i am enjoying the phone and recommend it highly,150,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,one of the better phones motorola has put out in the past three years works well great large screen good battery life even when using bluetooth cons itap predictive text screen while large is not as nice as similarly equipped samsungs buttons do not feel like they are working in a normal way and it takes a bit of getting used to,60,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i love the look of the phone as does everyone else however the phone does buzz occasionally also it is complicated to get to the video recording i still do not know how to do it and if you even can like they state you can it rings extremely loud which is a plus i get mediocre reception in rural areas where with past phones that were not motorola i got excellent reception motorla should reconsider a few things with the razor and it would be a great phone,87,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,the motorola razor is by far the best cellular phone that i have ever owned this is the 4th celluar phone that is nokia and other motos that I have owned the razor has an awesome combo of features that is bluetooth camera usb and more yet it remains a solid phone i looked at several that do more but bottom line they make poor phones that is too bulky too complicated t-mobile has very good service all-around i have had service with both cingular and verizon the razor and the lower cost of t-mobiles service are the reasons that i switched from verizon which i admit was excellent t-mobiles friendly and helpful customer service transfered my existing number without any problems i have found that t-mobile has pretty good coverage in the baltimore-washington area,130,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,yes this phone is beautiful it will impress all of your friends it has some wonderful features mentioned by other reviewers but three things led to my decision to trade it in for a nokia 1 remember how old cordless phones used to buzz well this phone buzzed i have seen that other razr users have stated the same thing 2 this phone is so thin that for me it was just too thin i like to hold my phone and dial all in one hand just like most people do this was not easy to do or comfortable with the large flat design of the phone 3 finally there is no external antenna it is actually in the bottom of the phone so i am told for me living in a more rural area this cut down on reception greatly,141,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,the phone is great 5 stars this has taken a week and a half just to ship it out of the warehouse i need my phone faster than that come on amazon get it together,35,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i purchased this phone about a month ago and was hoping that motorola had over a period of time improved on the quality and also that the reception was improving my friend did warn me about the poor reception of motorola i fell for the sleek design and the cool hot features i also work for a good company with a large office and my earlier samsung t-mobile worked fine at all the places but unfortunately motorola did not work well i keep the phone so that my family can reach me at any time but with this kinda reception this phone does not fit the bill i am now planning to keep the service since i did get into the contract and will change the phone,127,141
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,my wife has had not the razr phone but another motorola phone with t-mobile for over a year now all i can say is that when the phone was new the t-mobile service is very spotty and unreliable i have verizon and it worked much better anyway after a year the headset jack in her motorola phone is loose and does not work with headsets anymore in addition her calls last about 30 seconds before getting dropped now obviously something wrong with the phone in my experience motorola does not make very reliable cell phones we have had 3 different models of samsung cell phones in the past and they are rock solid durable and reliable not sure why motorola can not get with the program so we just terminated t-mobile service got her a samsung phone sch-a630 through verizon and she is very happy,142,142
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,I have had this phone for about a week after upgrading from a samsung e105 i really can not see any features this phone has over that phone except for bluetooth and the camera it is thin but bigger footprint and does not seem very durable for the price I had say it is not worth it may return it for one of t-mobiles free samsung phones,61,143
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,this is just an okay phone i was really disappointed with the length of video recording time i have a samsung e315 also and i actually prefer that phone which easily records about 90 seconds or longer of video you are lucky if you get 3 seconds of video recording time on the razr the pictures like the other reviewers have stated are not as crisp as other camera phones the reception is fine no complaints on that but the phone has locked on me a few times were i can not do anything turn it off make a call and more i have to take the battery off and put it back on in order to get the phone to work again speakerphone is okay the design is sweet which is why i gave it 3 stars the displays are huge which i also like if my samsung had a speakerphone i would have never experienced the disappointing features of the razr,160,144
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,sleek looking phone very confortable to use but definitley a bit of a dissappointment from a use standpoint dial out fails when my wifes no-name brand on same serive cingular at same location at same time works fine not uncommon that it fails to complete a connection even with 3 - 5 bars of signal streangth menue system is non-intuitive but that seems to be typical of moto phones compared to others I have had granted this is subjective camera pics are blurred and again not as good as my wifes off brand same pic in the same place at same time web browser is one of the bright spots of this phone bottom line i probably would not get another no matter how kool it looked,124,145
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i moved from baltimore to louisiana after buying this phone in a few words it is terrible i have noticed that people who have this phone with cingular down here have better reception and no drop calls if you get this phone and you live in the south do not be with t-mobile,53,146
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,there seem to be a lot of complaints about t mobile or the razr phone in general as far as service goes i think it really depends on where in the country you are yeah i do not think it should matter but the bigger the metropolitan area it is usually the better the service if you want to see how any wireless service may perform in your area just check out jd powers webiste it is fairly comprehensive with many subcategories for each service,83,147
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,as a professional who relies on his telephone for business affairs this thing is junk the exterior buttons on this super slim phone are constantly being pressed by accident and thereby changing volume and ring tones inadvertantly just removing from it the case will because you to depress these buttons the keyboard is so flat that it is impossible to feel the digits while you are driving thus you need to take your eyes off the road to dial a new non voice activated number it is not user friendly and was designed for it is visual appeal and not for it is functionality I am going back to sony ericcson,107,148
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,it is a good phone do not get me wrong but as stated before it is got problems the battery is not the best also the ringing volume does not seem consistent sometimes it is really loud sometimes not as much when on the same volume setting also i got the black one only a month ago and I have already got a few obvious scratches where the silver colored metal shows through to top it all off the screen recently became a problem it is got horizontal interference lines on it now and the image seems to vibrate up and down I have yet to call cingular and get it fixed so i can not comment on service it is also just frozen up twice before you can not do anything with it and you have to remove and reinsert the battery to start it up again on the other hand it is got great reception it is very small and handy it does not take up space and it has great sound quality overall I am not too happy i wish I had just gotten a nokia,174,149
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,as a veteran of numerous phone companies over the years this phone is another supporting data point to my theory that phone service mainly in the us is in a spiralling state of increasing entropy soon to disperse into nothingness first i can find no battery cradle chargers for it no cradle to charge it at all no integrated car cradle all of which i relied on completely with my nokia for years usb interface to pc usually does not charge it although if the battery is almost charged it might if I am lucky that day moto batteries last about an hour on this phone of talk time and one day with no usage it has buttons on the outside of it which will inadvertantly get pressed and change settings it only displays the last 10 calls the menu is totally chaotic with features i do not use in the way of ones i want that are harder to get to i admit my last phone of 5 years was a nokia 6150 so very old style but it worked like a dream and had all kinds of charger cradles integrated car carriage and more this phone can hardly be called a phone compared to that perhaps i am too old fashioned i think if they made a cell phone that just made phone calls and had a rotary dialer i would buy it over this,235,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,love flashy sparkly things and this phone definitely draws attention it works wonderfully the sound is crystal clear and i love the enormous viewing screen love this phone highly recommend it,31,151
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i like this phone so much except for the battery now i have to recharge it in every three or four days,22,152
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i just purchased my v3 razor black is the way to go about 3 days ago and i chose cingular because they have more coverage in my area my razr has worked great awesome speaker phone clear reception beautiful picture and i have no complaints this is my 4th cell phone and by far my fave when I am reading these other comments some of the complaints seem really petty i mean honestly-it was made for phone calls not to be a video camera if you want more video time are you ready for this buy a damn video camera and do not expect a 70 cell phone to complete your existence anyway i love my phone it is great for the one purpose that i bought it for to make calls,128,153
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,soon t-mobile will need to give away 2000 anywhere minutes to snag customers their network is that bad i have an unlocked version of this phone and used it with a t-mobile sim and a cingular sim during our bidding process for a national cell provider 4000 corporate users in atlanta chicago dallas and many road warriors the results of the test cingular by a landslide this is a great phone so do not hamper it with a lousy network ps i have no ties to cingular just contempt for t-mobile our users from europe and asia laugh at the us situation with cellular service and rightly so just pick the least bad network cingular or wait for another less bad provider verizon to offer this phone it appears that a few of the past reviewers have had a t-mobile experience,141,154
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,guys who were bashing t-mobile are probably under commercial influence verizon is not much better provider so it is coverage in corn fields of illionois is better i must admit in all other respects t-mobile is doing what it promises it is affordable gsm which is a huge plus if you are a frequent traveller good customer support and more besides t-mobile is using cingular / at t network in most western states so those who said that cingular has better coverage were not correct there has only problem with 1800 gsm is that uses too short wave length which has less building penetratino power than cdma phones let us say big thank you to us government for that and the person who said that he knows internal of that phone hm even if he has working in motorola he has a hypocrat because design of this phone was done by an oem partner of motorola few engineers there really know how it works,154,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,the razr does everything a cell phone needs makes phone calls takes pics which almost every phone comes with now that bluetooth stuff i do not really use but unlike any other phone it gets you to the center of attention slip out your razr and hear the ooohs and aaahs ladies and gents you will be known as guywith the sexy razr as x-mas approaches the razr is going to one hotand is it worth the hype yes oh yes,82,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this wonderful phone is available in black from cingular and the razr will be available soon from verizon think twice before you use t-mobile a previous post is correct the network is much more important than the phone also buy your phone directly from a storefront that is run by cingular or verizon never buy from an authorized reseller or even on the cingular verizon or t-mobile web sites if you phone service is important to you get it from a store that you trust in your neighborhood,91,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,hi i bought a razar with a t mobile plan of 2999 i was charged 150 and was under the impression i was eligible for 150 rebate but i did not read the fine print which said this was eligible for only 3999 and above so before activating the phone i called both amazoncom and t mobile and was told the 3999 plan would take int0 affect immediately but now i got the first bill and i am charged 150 for one month most of which were 1800 calls also i am not eligible for the rebate can not even find it on this site i feel completely frustrated should have stuck with cingular these guys suck big time,117,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i bought this v3 half an year ago when it is hot did not test it before i bought it that is my huge mistake no 1 problem camera sucksssssssss no flash light how can you take pics indoor or at night without flash so maybe it is better during day time unfornately sucks again my wifes samsung has way much better photo quality even although it is much cheaper my friend has sonyericson w800 image is almost flawless damn can not use this piece of crap for taking photos no memory card slot another big minus but the camera sucks i guess you do not need memory to store pics that is sounds reasonable i do not do text message either so memory do not bother me a lot,120,159
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i like this phone in general but minor thing that bothers me is that whenever i touch the phone i leave fingerprints all over this phone and i find this very annoying in addition it does not seem to have a profile function like other nokia units,47,160
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this phone changed my life i used to be a loser you know down on my luck sad and broke after i began making my calls with this sleek mobile phone things changed for good i hope for good at least people began noticing me i gained some much needed confidence and my hepatitis even went into remission I shall never be lonely again thank you motorola,66,161
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i bought this phone to replace an older model motorola phone whose headset jack was failing to work i love flashy sparkly things and this phone definitely draws attention it works wonderfully the sound is crystal clear and i love the enormous viewing screen i do wish the phone had a video recording option to go along with it is viewing option one general negative about motorola products even expensive ones like the razr they should come with more than 3 ring tone options,83,162
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,it is not a mp3 player it is not camcorder or photocamera it is not a game box it is balanced and very stylish mobile phone especially black one,26,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,what has good for with all that mp3 ring tone 4x zone-in camer but only 6 m memory to storage it i put one song in it and 3 m is gone this phone does not have slot for any memory card no expension ability at all,44,164
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,great phone only 1 problem volume is too low otherwise best phone i have ever owned i bought a leather cover for it but removed it as it was covering the earpiece volume now is much better but still not the greatest great photo quality and big easy keyboard to read good-looking too,53,165
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i received this phone as a present and while I am grateful that my benefactor would bother to get me something so sleek and trendy i would much rather have something simpler and more usable this phone is small and sleek but it is just a phone i am a person who likes using phones based on their phonishness smallness and unassuming natures this phone is indeed phone-like and small but few of it is ringtones are of the kind that do not attract attention which is indicative of it is general overemphasis on useless bells and whistles two of these are lousy-quality pictures and expensive games that you can play online for free also people give me way too much attention when i pull this phone out they are all hey look at your phone it is just a stupid cell phone but i will give you a lot of attention because you bought it at the store it is embarassing most importantly this phone is quite fickle when it roams i am in the midwest and roam with it every day of my life i find it is roaming reception to be surprisingly unreliable i am also perpetually unable to reach the mythical t-zone i do not mind although as i hear that the t-zone is a land of annoying ringtones you should save your money by getting one of those free phone with subscription deals i am a clumsy person who perpetually drops her phones into interesting places my free phones have always been game and responded by not breaking or blemishing my poor little razr is pretty scratched up although after only a month of use but if you like being a cool-guy there is no shame in this with an annoying ringtone there is shame in this you should buy the razr,299,166
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i just bought this phone a wk ago and so far i just do not see what the big hype was all about the phone looks cool colors are vivid but other than that there has nothing else to really get excited about the volume is really low even when I have maxed it out I have heard a humming noise when i use the phone the phone book is a pain in the to deal with and earlier today it froze on me while i was using the web features i got a good deal on the phone so at least i did not spend as much as others did with my previous samsung and sanyo phones i never had to enter any name in the phone book more than once even for multiple s or entries which is not the case with this razr i have yet to experience the other probs that everyone talks about,153,167
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i think this is a good phone i owned a moto v551 and this is almost the same except it lacks as much memory this phone has some good skins themes features and a huge screen it is camera is great considering it is only a vga i owned a sony ericsson t616 and that camera stunk I had take this one over my old sony it could use more memory but overall it is a pretty good phone especially when you can get one for only 40 there are better phones out there but this was not meant to be a top of the line phone it is an awesome looking all metal phone get one if you really want one,117,168
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,I have owned so many phones such as the nokia series but this motorola razr really worked well in so many areas i was looking for a phone in which i wanted to slim down my gadgetry i was directed to this phone and it has worked for me in so many ways it is definite size was a give away this phone could fit in any pocket you can possibly think of I shall list the pros and cons on this phone pros slim size big lcd screen able to change your phone preferences even while closed able to take photos of yourself when closed wallpaper picture can be seen when flipped closed mp3 ringtones are clear and vibrant bluetooth wireless rocks cons buttons are smooth and it takes time to get accustomed too could use better games outside screen can get scratched and dinged if not careful you have to be careful about handling the phone because it is slim phone attracts fingerprints and smudges quickly other than that this phone is great this phone will serve it is purpose for the long run if your looking for a phone that is sleek productive and reliability make this your phone,196,169
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i wrote the review under the heading slick and slim i did not mean for it to be a kids review can you please remove that part,26,170
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,battery life sucks just for two days even if u don talk on phone if u try to play games on it battery dies out within 20 minutes even if it is fully charged,35,171
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i have had the phone for a month and like it the reception is much better the signal does not break anymore in the places it used to the design is neat both front panel and overall size i use holster to carry it and does not take much space i have an ericsson bluetooth headset and the volume is so high that i keep both the phone and the headset at their minimum the speaker is also very loud i have to lower the volume after switching to it what it lacks in comparison with ericsson is convenience of voice labels each label is individual so i have to invent different labels for cell phones of my friends for ericsson i had to say friends name and 2 seconds later one of three words home or work or mobile i also miss the button c delete from ericsson i think motorolas navigation is not that convenient a tool to write melodies would not hurt as well for now i have to write melodies on ericsson-68i and pass them to razr through bluetooth,185,172
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i bought my first razr in april 2005 and after ten days it completely stopped working the supplier happily provided me with a replacement but i am completely unimpressed i bought it for it is internet capability but it is unbelievably slow and essentially useless for things like checking email the sound quality is very bad i strain to hear my callers constantly the inside screen is impossible to see in anything but low light gets gummed up easily and the keypad is practically invisible unless you are shining a bright light on it which makes it impossible to see the screen it randomly turns itself off you can only store the last 10 calls received instead of the 30 my old lower-tech phone could there has a reason why these phones are now being discounted and offered in special deals,138,173
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,I have had a lot of fun with this phone so far i get all sorts of comments on it which is always a fun conversation starter and i love the bluetooth technology although i have yet to figure out how to use it to the best of it is capacity for a high end phone although it does have a couple of problems first off it is a little hard to hear people through this handset even when you have the volume adjusted to it is highest 7 i find this the most irritating i heard people alot better on my old crapy nokia the second thing also volume related is the speakerphone it is not loud enough for you to actally put down the phone so you are stuck holding the phone close to your face anyways just to hear the person and then close to your mouth when you speak so the other person can hear you kind of a waste of speakerphone right other than that i can not complain about this phone it takes great pictures has really fun ringtones and is just oh so cool to look at,190,174
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,the razr is a very slick phone and I have been impressed by it is design and ease of use contrary to what some might think it is very sturdy and durable the menu is easy to navigate and the smart buttons allow you to breeze through the menu the sleek design makes it fit nicely in your pocket and helps avoid the typical cellphone bulge as for the cons well i the large screen does drain the battery quickly and ii fingerprints are visible on the phone in a heartbeat you do need to clean it frequently overall this is probably the best cellphone i have owned so far and i would highly recommend it to those looking for a quality product that looks good,124,175
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i bought this phone because of all the good reviews despite my bad experiences with motorola phones it is a mixed bag as is typical with motorolas the battery life and the signal strength are significantly worse than my last nokia i had hoped that because of all the hype surrounding the razr that they had fixed this problem but nothe screen and buttons get sorta greasy and i am always having to wipe them off and it is not just cuz I am a greasy person however my biggest complaint is that the earpiece speaker is very soft even at the highest setting and it is hard for me to hear people when i am surrounded by background noise walking down the street or in a crowd at least with my nokia i could really crank that speaker volume up when i needed to of course all this became apparent after my 2 week trial at least i got a good price on the phone and do not feel like i got ripped off i do love the style and usability of the phone if it were just louder i would be totally satisfied,192,176
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,my husband and i both have a razr we love them we have our service through cingular we have never had the humming noise in the handset we also have the motorola hs850 bluetooth headsets i love this accessory too,40,177
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,no humming and I have owned it for about 7 months now people who are technologically inept should not be writing reviews just keep bitching to your friends,27,178
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,in short this phone has been a total disappointment watch out for motorola phones i bought it and immediately noticed a humming / frequency feedback which was earpiercing coupled with a fading in and out of both the earphone speaker and the microphone so that people i called perceived me to be in an area where i was not getting cell service at first i thought this was a network issue then after 17 days of owning this phone i realized something was up with the mic / speaker and called t-mobile customer service the best they could do for me because i was technically outside the 14 day return period was to send me a replacement phone typically refurbished although they apparently have no way of telling replacement 1s key pad was peeling apart immediately so i called and requested a second replacement replacement 2 had the same issue as my first phone only the feedback noise was worse as of today the best customer service can do for me is to continue sending me replacement refurbished phones until i get one that works personally I am convinced I am never going to drop any amount of cash on a motorola phone again and as for t-mobile well problem solving and customer service is really not their specialty do not waste your money and do not waste your time,220,179
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,bought the phone more for it is size than anything else was disappointed to hear a low hum when you open the handset i thought it was defective and stopped by a t-mobile store the customer service individual said the hum was normal nice the usual teenage kid deciding to add his on spin on things he goes on to say i have 10 other phones just like this back here it is just like that nothing like that warm fuzzy feeling when you just bought a defective product and will be spending a boatof time writing emails and making phonecalls explaining why you were the unlucky recipient of a defective product before jumping the gun i decided to call on other razr users those good friends of mine who convinced me that this is the crme de la crme phone well the problem is not just with t-mobile razr but with cingular ones too issue is not everyone pays attention when they flip open the handset the hum is sort of masked when a conversation is happening but now i finally got enough people to realize that this phone is defective oh well someone has to do some basic quality assurance for motorola as they have no problem putting a defective product in the market place not surprised the phone is free after rebates because it is defective one last gripe the phonebook is soooo outdated and a pain to fill up if you ever had a sanyo samsung or nokia phone you will hate this phonebook,253,180
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,my husband and i both got the razr for christmas last year since our cell phone provider did not carry the phones we had to have them unlocked so they would work on our system i loved this phone then one day the screen stopped working it would still ring and let you dial and then it turned off by itself and would not turn back on at all i sent it back to motorola since it was under warranty but they refused to fix it since they say it had water damage it is humid here in florida but that should not affect a phone of this caliber so my husband got the razr black and gave me his silver which broke a month ago this time it was the wiring in the flip part of the phone this was covered and was fixed by motorola however i did not know this but when they fix it they relock it and now i can not use it on my system i would wait until they work out the kinks in this phone i have owned alot of motorola phones and have never had this many problems it is nice looking and has some good features it also worked great while we were traveling in europe and did not drop calls as often as some of my past phones,227,181
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i have to disagree this phone is very easy to navigate pretty much like all the other motorola phones I have owned my only issue with this phone other than the phone service is it completely died after only 3 mos so far the replacement is ok but who know how long that will last when i say died it would not even turn on fyi keep all your s stored to the sim as well as the phone it is a pain to have duplicates but worth it since you can not assign ring tones to s unless it is stored to the phone lesson learned although the phone itself is nice to look at even the blue tooth technology is another expense you have to purchase that headphone separately and i paid how much for this thing if you get an amazing deal then it is a good phone otherwise the few extra features you get are not worth it,156,182
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,used this phone it crashed then got a new one from cingular and the new one fell apart one night out partying dropped more calls than a leaky bucket if you are a poser then i guess this is should go well with your la gear sneakers k,46,183
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,looks great has blue on it which is cool but has an irritating squeal like when you put a microphone too close to a speaker kinda sucks other than that it rocks,31,184
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,this phone has a sleek design and is a marvel of engineering but lacks usablity in navigating the menu to the point that i am returning mine for example you get a voice mail if you press the mail icon on the phone it takes you to the message center you then have to navigate down from create message message inbox to the voicemail line and press a seperate button to call your voice mail box now after you listen to your voice mail you are still not done you have to delete the text message that notified you of the voicemail i have been spoiled by being able to press one button to listen to my voicemail hence te motivation for my return as far as t-mobiles quality as a mobile carrier in the austin tx area i would have to say that the call quality is much lower than cingular and sprint i have found myself repeating converations over and over and drop more calls than i did in the early 90s t-mobiles plans are cheaper than the others just recognize that there is a real reason for that,194,185
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i bought this phone two months ago phone looks very nice but the voice quality is very poor voice clarity is good with head phones earlier i had a v300 phone compared to it most of the features and menus are same except it has a bluetooth the battery life comes a maximum of three days it can not be charged while using head phones and viceversa because it has common socket for both,74,186
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is the best cell pone I have ever purchased a must have for those who love to travel but hate poor connections,22,187
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,this phone looks cool and that is about the only good feature i can think of i bought this phone because it was cool and quickly realized that it was far more than i needed or wanted if you just want a phone to make calls on do not buy this phone aside from all of the bells and whistles the reception is horrible the very first call i made the connection kept cutting out and it was extremely frustrating this phone is very thin but it is also wider than you might expect it is hard to hold the phone comfortably because it is so wide my phone came with several wallpapers some were animated and very few ringtones it came with several alarm-type sounds but only 3 actual ring tones i took this phone back the next day because i realized that it was not worth the 200 i paid for it and it was way more than i needed in a phone if you just want a plain old phone this is not it,173,188
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,the 8-year old qualcomm which my new razr replaces has much better call reception than this clunker i work in new york city and i need good volume on the earpiece the razr volume is too low and it wavers in and out the voice reception is often distorted even a block from my office i can not hear my own secretary the placement of the phone against the ear is uncomfortable and even after two weeks of use i still have trouble finding the sweet spot where volume is going straight into my ear my hand makes mini circles left right up down useless beautful things do not have to work just look at melania trump but a phone has to have audio competence i refuse to reward motorola or t-mobile for failing the 1st function of a phone I am taking it back and spending the 100 bucks on a bracelet which will also look beautiful without the headache,156,189
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,the shipment arrived on time the contents were as listed on the website and in good condition i have no complaints with the phone itself the rating is low because of t-mobile instructions are incorrect for t-mobile in the package and on the website errors in documenting procedures number portability is a pain it took 2 hrs to get thru to the rep and then it took 3 days to switch from cingular to t-mobile while repeatedly calling the rep to find out theeta given was always 2 hrs liars printed manuals have a lot of errors i guess t-mobile does not have quality as a selling point,113,190
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,jameson thottam perspective on razr v3 i jameson thottam looked at buying this phone solely because of it is form factor it is thin and it flips open it is just the right size for me and fits easily into jeans pocket sometimes i jameson thottam can even forget it is there menus are somewhat quirky to navigate but you get used to it phonebook support is average at best and will not sync properly with outlook loses additional data such as company namewhen browsing thru phonebook you can only search by first letter and it will display separatefor each phone assigned to a contact proper implementation would display name only once and then let you choose which phone no to dial display is nice but close to unreadable in bright sunlight i jameson thottam wonder whatever happened to those nice lcd screens that were readable both in low and sunlight battery life is horrible i jameson thottam managed to get 3 days maximum out of it when batteries were new and now after coupla months it is 1 - 2 days also you can not upload java apps via bt has to be done over usb cable and i jameson thottam suspect attaching usb cable somehow wrecks batteries because the phone would start charging and after that my battery life went drastically downhill sms support is bearable but you can not require sms delivery receipts this is just plain poor design gprs and bt combo sometimes breaks down and phone would not respond to connection requests from laptop via bt the only remedy is to switch it off and back on jameson thottam,272,191
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,looks cool but a downgrade in signal quality from my samsung the sound quality took some getting used to because the fact it has a slight echo i like the fact that it fits nicely in my pocket and the way it looks i feel sort of pretentious using it although serves it is purpose but i would not spend the 200 again if i was to do it over,68,192
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,the volume is low and there is no catogary to store home office and mobile numbers by itself,18,193
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i got motorola razor v3 phone from t-mobile couple of days back i noticed that when somebody calls me i get unknown call on my cell phone display instead callers phone number i know the callers phone number is not blocked when i called t-mobile customer service he is saying that this is known issue and he is going to let me know the fix for it in couple of days has anyone noticed this problem if so how did they fix it do i need to change any settings,92,194
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,my wife and i bought a t-mobile family plan coming with this phone too bad calls dropped like he shall checked the tower map of the network found several towers in the walking distance went to the t-mobile local store and called customer service no solution they keep saying that the motorola phones are bad in reception with t-mobile network and suggest us to get a nokia or samsung the only thing good is speak phone,75,195
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i simply love this phone it is too cool everyone keeps asking about it and wants to have the same phone i feel so good when i see them totally in love with this one the camera quality is decent voice is clear and it has bejeweled too,47,196
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,I have had my razr for about a month now and have not come up with any complaints i was worried about some reviews I had read prior to my purchase but none of the things i was warned about were really true i have no problem hearing people on this phone the volume is fine speakerphone works excellently as well the camera is only a fraction of a megapixel but even at that it takes photos of fine enough quality to use as wallpaper by no means a camera for artistic use but the razrs primary function is a phone right all around i love it it has a great feel and i love to hold it the metal makes it really cool to the touch plus it is the first phone I have ever had that fits in my front pants pocket not to mention the automatic wow-factor I have been getting when i pull it out every time a friend sees it for the first time they get a huge kick out of it so slim so sexy plus it works as a phone perfect for me,184,197
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i just recieved my razr for tmobile and here are some quick notes for potential buyers pros this is the best looking phone currently on the market actually made 2501 after rebate price is 12499 with a 150 rebate can not believe people paid 500 or so last christmas awesome speakerphone volume seems fine on calls read many complaints on here no problem dialing with flat buttons some cool very loud ringtones already on phone golf game ready to go as well cons tmobile razr has video capture cingulars does not but it is only 10 seconds tops and virtually useless pics from camera are below average at best internal and external screens become nearly invisible in any sunlight agree with everyone that phonebook is way outdated it is like buying a new 2000 laptop and then running it with windows 95 no external led to indicate missed calls or new voicemail well hope this helps if you can get this phone for free grab it peace,163,198
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,first i had called up t-mobile and asked about taking phone from amazon i already have a t-mobile phone and asked if i can take a new phone and take a family plan they said yes and told me all the details about it but the thing they forgot to mention is that i had to extend my phone contract for a year this was told to me when i called up after buying a new phone and was trying to make a family planthey had told me they were sorry it was their mistake they forgot to tell me but there is nothing they can do about it if i want a family plan i had to extend my contract then they said they will compensate my upgrading my phone and the upgrade phone offered to me was the nokia free phone for the other phones i had to pay around 100 - 150 dollers jus to get a family plan about the phone it is pretty good but signal is bad had a few dropped calls sometimes rest all is good,181,199
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i have had several cell phones that i have worn with a holster on my belt i find that to be pretty uncomfortable / inconvenient and inappropriate and geeky looking for office wear i keep this phone in my pants or shirt pocket with the ringer on vibrate it works great i bought the phone for it is basic features the other reviewers are correct if you are looking for superior additional features this is not the phone for you but if you need a small profile phone with acceptable to very good features this is it,92,200
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i work at tmobile and have seen nothing but problems with this phone from customers customer complaints range from very poor reception and sound all the way to poor battery and over heating the cingular version actually burned peoples faces do yourself a huge favor and reconsider any motorola purchase you are about to make class action law suit do not happen against companies for no reason motorola just does not know how to make a phone anymore forget the old phones you used to love motorola promises to bring the integrity back i have heard that for a few years now do not count on it,104,201
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,well let me start out by saying this phone is freakin cool i love the design but who does not i sell t-mobile phones and i love using my pohne as a selling point it has never dropped a call the video plaback is pretty nice at 30fps even has video recording exclusive to t-mobile the battery life rocks and the bluetooth is even cooler the only downside is the muffled earpiece i often find myself asking what i also do not like the indepth menus on the phone i think they put a little to much extra menus in changing simple tasks like switching your ringer or switching your wallpaper more difficult than other phones over all i love it and got what i expected an awsome phone and great service too good luck bpollock,132,202
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i would have been able to rate this phone higher if it had more features the best thing about the phone is the bluetooth capability the size and the great sound capability however there are several draw backs which include the short battery life i could not go the entire day without needing a charge i guess you pay the price for the size because it requires the battery to be small as well also the menu on the motorola is not user friendly if you do not use the voice command you practically have to pull over to find the number to dial also you can not utilize multiple numbers and distinctive rings for a contact unless you save it to the phone and not the sim card badif something ever happened to your phone you would lose a lot of information if this phone was 100 I had say buy it in a heart beat anything over that not worth it,158,203
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,i must admit to being a gadget-freak so when i saw the razr i just knew i had to pick one up right away i was really impressed with it is size weight and large bright display however it was constantly confused about when it was being charged and when it was not the charging indicator would light up when i unplugged the phone from the wall and would go out when i plugged it in there were other interface quirks that started to get on my nerves after a few weeks of use it also eventually would not hold a charge for longer than an hour i assume it was just my phone and would spend the time to fix it if i otherwise really liked using it unfortunately the user interface on the phone is annoying particularly when compare with sony ericssons the razr is missing profiles that is change all these settings at once when I am in my car home and more has often used functionality buried under layers of menus confusing icons and menutext and more this all might be tolerable if the phone were free with service but the hefty price tag is definitely not worth it,199,204
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,compared to the sony ericssion the razr is many times better very good speaker quality and nice blue tooth tech,20,205
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,the v3 has surprised me i have had notoriously poor reception where i live and i felt like i might be taking a chance in buying this phone after reading several of the amazon reviews but rest assured the razr is very solid in this respect calls are clear where as prior high and low-end motorolas were poor in the same spots fluid phone operation if customized right a very crisp and loud speakerphone and i would say one of the better battery lifes i have seen in a cellular the video and picture features are poor these are meaningless to me as a user but the bluetooth to a computer or external device is fairly simple to use and works well the keypad is larger than most which i very much like and simple to spot in the night / day as the phone illuminates extremely well in a bright blue i wish that all of the buttons were raised although like the center 5 or that the keypad itself was not recessed i do not like that motorola has removed the icons to place next to phone book numbers that indicate work or mobile or homebut that is one of very few complaints about the software layout of the phone overall given what is available on the market i think this is an excellent high-end choice for any professional,229,206
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i bought the razr after reading the helpful reviews here [ ] I have had it for 2 months and overall it has performed well in response to some of the concerns voiced in previous reviews here are my particular likes and dislikes likes great-looking shape and exterior finish no problems with durability so far mp3 ringtones camera and video recorder dislikes battery life only 48 - 72 hrs on standby one software glitch after trying to customize the screen saver with a photo resolved after restarting the phone,90,207
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,it is just okay it is thin very thin but very long i want a small and thin phone i have not tried anything on the phone but i guess i like it i can not complain about the reception,38,208
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,good phone okay t-mobile service coverage and signal quality i am originally a verizon customer and used the motorola c343 el brickie verizon is way more expensive but then cdma has better signal quality and their network has better coverage after a few insanely expensive phone bills on verizon I am willing to put up with the rare dropped calls and having to repeat a few words now and then on t-mobile so far customer service has been good although there is a wait and not all of it is available 24 hours unlike verizon compared to the c343 the razr is many times better and acts the part of a premium phone it has much quicker recharge fast gui response time actually has a real alarm clock takes photos and movies the aluminum / metal alloy construction is very solid and tolerances very tight as many have noted motorolas gui interface is slightly less intuitive than nokia or samsung although previous owners of motorola phones will not have problems understanding the razr gui keep in mind that motorola is about to refresh their phones the united states cdma razr is about to be released and should be very close to the already released korean cdma razr this phone features 13mpixel charge stand connector much more flash ram 64 mb against 5mpixels so that real mp3 can be played,223,209
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i just got it and i think the phone is not that bad at all i like it,17,210
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,had phone for about a week had it in a pocket when i sat down and the display broke aside from this the performance was nothing special the keys are not easy to use but it did look cool until everyone had one,43,211
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i recently got a razr v3 from t-mobile and it has a great look and feel unfortunately it makes a loud buzzing noise on incoming calls i exchanged it for another razr v3 and am still having the same problem,40,212
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,phone is good but the battery life is awefull better luck who ever buys it,15,213
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,recently switched from t-mobile to cingular just for the black razr the phone is completely worth it but I am not completely satisfied with cingular so far and it is only been a few weeks can not even imagine the rest of the 2 year contract even although they use the same network t-mobile connections are clearer their customer service is stupendous anyways back to the phone the phone rocks and once you flash it you get an extra 8 mb space as well video recording capability fyi razr that are branded cingular or t-mobile do not have video recording capability until you flash the bios if possible try to get a black razr with a t-mobile account the black one is wayyyy cooler than the silver and t-mobile is pretty good,128,214
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,i just love this phone it is really thin and light weight very nice to handle endless useful features i upgraded my t-mobile plan to t-zone and check my emails with this phone for free works great if you get additional software mobile phone tools you even can sync phone and pc via bluetooth or usb cable have not found anything i do not like on the phone camera takes nice pics voice recorder works flawless screen is amazing i just really like this phone and of course good reception too t-mobile has an amazing customer service and it was no problem to change plans to family plan or port numbers,111,215
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,my 5th cell phone in 7 years this one is not bad average bttry life good reception fairly quick processor and the bluetooth works well in my acura tl but oooh that lcd in bright light simply vanishes the keys are small and even with smallish hands i often hit more than one key the speaker function is loud enough but the clarity drops of as volume increases such that by the time you can hear it you can not understand it a tactile bump on the send and end buttons would have been a nice touch obviously skinny is cool and the silver is nicer looking than the black unusual none of my myriad of prior chargers work with the razr despite being manufactured by the same company i strongly recommend that you purchase a genuine motorolla charger esp for your car since many of the knockoffs do not allow you to charge and call at the same time i wish the text and numbers could be made larger I am into reading glasses now and i really wish the icon for battery strength / charging was large enough to see or at least have sufficient contrast to do so and they should have damped the flip door so it does not slam shut vibration mode barely perceptible that is bad lastly the lighting on the keys at night is marginal at best why can not you buy a simple cell phone anymore why the ridiculously awful camera and video function for 15000 you can get a great stand alone small good digicam by any of a half dozen brand names talk about crappy and worthless addons even with all this i do like the razr and I had give it a 375 of 5 not because it is all that good it is just that all the rest are mediocre too jef,297,216
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,have to agree that it is a great phone in terms of looks and only looks had a motorola v300 before and c650 and the interface is no different screen is of great quality but menu is same expected more for this quality phone camera is so so it is thin but a little flattened out but slip real easy into pocket and more u need to have motorola phone tools to sync and edit phone books especially if copy entries from sim to phone and have duplicate phone number showing which is not good i wish motorola could have improved on the menu it is not worth 200 or even 100 got mine for 75 as an upgrade from t-mobile which is good else not worth it the phone did not come with some stuff like all games normally advertised on other sites like billiards and more it had one full game golf and demo of bejeweled t-mobile has no clue why need to buy mobile phone tools seperately as it is not included with phone too bad btw connection quality is a lot better than v300 which always hung up and dropped calls,186,217
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,t-mobile is crippling their razor v3 they are intentionally disabling the e-mail client that is built-in to the phone,20,218
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i too was quite excited when i first got wind of this new moto to follow the very popular v600 i was expecting some crazy innovations and most of all the ability to record video and playback with sound i am in a word disappointedi have seen several other brands achieve this feat time and time again yet motorola corpis yet to develop and bring to market a phone capable of doing this simple task yet the moto v3 razr remains one of the most popular handsets out there it is superlight weight and far more comfortable than it looks at first glance i do like this phone but my lack of video recording addition does not allow me to give it a rating higher than 3 at this time harsh but true the nokia 6620 is ugly compared to this the new samsung available in europe is far superior with numerous features like optional black / white photography attachable speaker matrix style sliding facemoto surely can do better and give me the razr upgrade before the end of 2005 come on moto i still believe in you,184,219
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this phone performs beautifully do not take the number of complaints at face value it is sad that people are more likely to review anonly when they want to gripe about it the average rating does not represent the typical customer experience my razr gets exceptional reception it is very sleek and portable has all the features i need and a good battery life,63,220
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i purchased the razr from t-mobile when my contract ran out this past may i decided on the razr primarily because it is a slick looking phone and as a person on the run i really appreciated the seemingly ingenious feature that this phone doubled as a makeshift electric razor truth be told as a phone it is more than adequate it is thin although a bit wide and has a gorgeousscreen reception was a tad poor but it is generally not a consideration for me with vanity phones such as this i purchase them mainly to impress other people so i did not worry for a second about dropping calls in fact i quite like the distortion you get from a poor connection my friends tell me i sound like one of those cylons from battlestar galactica i appreciate that where the phone falls apart is it is shaving features at best the shave it provides is dull and uneven so much so that you wonder how much consideration was given to this feature at all i tried it on all the settings gprs cdma 3 g pcs but nothing improved the overall results and forget about using any sort of shaving cream with this particular model i made that mistake and my bluetooth has not worked since nevertheless it is a good phone with a solid feature set however you might consider saving a few bucks and purchasing a cheaper model with a conventional razor all in all you will get more bang for your buck,250,221
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,the customer service is great the phone and t-mobile is working better than expected and certainly better than my existing verizonwireless service which was not too bad either able to use the phone worldwide and the t-mobile one-year contract is a real plus,42,222
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,how could this be a discount when tmobile itself is offering the same phone for the same price or less that is no discount you have there it is,28,223
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,bought a plan through amazon never could get it to work t-mobile blamed the handset and amazon could not replace it thus cancel and reimbursed me for the handset t-mobile is charging me 300 for a service i never used 30 for activation 200 for cancellation and 2 months of service after being helpless they are trying to force me to stay with them by waving the the fees if you buy just pray everything works because otherwise t-mobile will make your life miserable for months,87,224
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,what a great phone reception is great in dallas and their plans are a lot better than cingulars,18,225
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i wanted this phone sooo badly for sooo long i finally got it and it is really nothing that special just another cell phone but it looks really cool if you can find it cheap go for it otherwise do not be like me and give into trendiness ugh i kinda miss my old samsung re the majority of the other reviews review the phone not tmobile half of you do not even own this phone you are just looking for a place to complain about your service with them it is annoying,88,226
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,first i would like to note that i have had excellent service with t-mobile in all the areas of the country i have traveled i have not had any problems with dropped calls or poor signal i primarily use my phone in wisconsin but have used it extensively in florida hawaii california and illinois when traveling through airports i have had no problems in detroit minneapolis los angeles memphis newark houston chicago and more however i mostly travel to metropolitan areas and not much into the countryside so that may bias my review while i agree that some of their phones are of poor quality the razr is a great phone i have not had any problems with the phone itself and is of much better quality than my old v600 the phone itself is of great quality and whether or not the reason t-mobile gets the most tech-savvy phones early or later because of testing the razr with t-mobile is great their customer service is excellent as far as my experiences i have had complicated requests taken care of within a few days like porting a number within t-mobile when phoning them with so many other compliants i would go to t-mobiles website to see the level of coverage before signing on in my personal experience i have had no problems,221,227
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,do not buy any phone or service from t-mobile their network is terrible it drops your call many times a day their customer service is very rude i would never go with t-mobile,33,228
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,i have a previous account with t-mobile with a free phone that broke down i found the best new phone and service plan using the excellent amazon website and ordered it when i got the new phone t-mobile refused to move my old phone number to my new phone and account they complained that i had bought it from an outside source rather than throught them they aggressively tried to get me to cancel my new phone and account they claimed that i had not informed them within 30 days so they would charge me an extra month on my old service it was a terrible experience do not buy a t-mobile phone or servever,117,229
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,first off tmobile service is spotty at best i just cancelled after a couple days because i sounded like i was talking into a tin can and i live in the northside of chicago not the country it took 2 wks to get my phone after i ordered it luckily i did not keep my old number you can not store more than one number under a name the interface is not very user friendly but it looks really cool,78,230
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,the main reason tmobile comes out with phones a little later then other providers is due to them wanting to test the phones to their full ability to avoid any problems with it when they get it out this is the reason tmobile waited to get the razr becuz cingular got it first and guess how many problems they had with their phones such as the keypad printing out on the lcd becuz they rushed on ordering them tmobiles razr phone is better then cingulars due to not as many known issues i like this moto razr phone and i would recommend it for people who are looking for something small sleek and updated with the newest technology like bluetooth,120,231
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i use the tmobile service in the dc / balt area and the service is really good the phone is cool however it is operating system is kinda weird it just does not feel like the gui on the old sprints i am used to using the back key feels out of place the menus do not feel as intuitive the vga camera is useless the video feature is fine although i would like the ability to associate pics with incoming calls but maybe i am ignorant the phone feels fine in my hands the keys feel ok not as bad as some would make you think but it looks cool feels cool sounds good and i like it i do not really expect my cell phone to replace my laptop or do whatever else the technorati want,134,232
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,i also wrote a review for the black one ordered this on through tmobile and ordered the black one from amazon w / cingular service because my contract w / tmobile is about to be up they are both very nice looking phones but very lacking on freatures you would think motorola would be up to date buy now but they are still lackingalso i read wear someone said they have the buzzing noise i have it too and tmobile has a new phone out to me now and i do not have the bluetooth option on so hopefully the new phone will fix the problem if not I am really going to be pissed i thought cingular would be better than tmobile with customer service but they are not could not even get my phone to work and they kept telling me the phone was defective but it was not was told there towers were not regestering new sims why the activation dept did not know this is beyond me tech support told me this so i had to wait about 2 days before i could even used had a bunch of other problems with just 1 day of service with cingular so i decided to cancel my cingular service all in all it is a very nice looking phone the black does look better than the silver but i would choose tmobile just for the 1 year contract i see where people are having a problem with the noise in this phone I am on my 3rd one from tmobile and the buzz is still there this phone sucks if i could get my money back i would if you are considering buying this save your money the only thing good about this phone is the looks features and everything else is very basic waste of money,292,233
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone i have had it for less than 30 days and the battery has already died on it the bluetooth accessory which cost me 60 bucks does not even work i have had sprint phones samsung phonesnever a problem this phone is junk motorola must be making bank on this phone it is not user friendly the buttons are not in good places for the volume and for taking photos horrible design it is a beautiful looking phone but it is function past that is zilch stay away from it,91,234
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is a great phone that has the best possible price at free the sheer size of thismakes it irresistible this is the best looking phone in the market being a gsm unit makes it very attractable due to the fact that it becomes very portable in addition i used to own a nokia and the difference in quality is enormous you can actually feel the difference in the 2 phones the motorola phone feels so much better i have had the razor for 2 weeks now and love it to death i put it in my shirt pocket and do not even feel it it is that light i also do feel that the styling on it is so far advanced that makes it the hottest thing in the market still even if it has been out there since christmas of last year my thumbs up go to this phone and recommend to everyone to try it out i just can not wait for the next generation of phones that will be coming out,175,235
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,it seems that people now in days are looking for perfect things there has never been a phone to fit in a perfect category and people do not look at the good things in the v3 but instead focus on little things that are not noticable others argue t-mobile received this phone too late bute it is not like the phone was played out not many people actually have it and it still is very appeling anyway on to the review I have had my v3 two weeks now got a good deal in [ ] the phone is deffenetly a head turner maybe about 10 times I have heard some one say or mention to someone look he has a razr so the phone is pretty much wanted it preforms well good sound speaker phone is great camera not top notch but does it is job well screen is gorgeous and the key pad is very futuristic my only minor complain is that the os in the phone is too similar too previous moto models i wish motorola would have at least created a custom one for this model but it does it job the phone does not seem too sturdy but i dropped it once and only a small scratch appeared i thought the top part would break but it is pretty srong too finish off this phone is great for people that like stylish items and feeling cool having something wanted i highly recomend this phone it is defenetly worth buying probably the best phone I have owened five stars would have been in the review if motorola would have included mega pixel camera and a better os,270,236
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,the usual motorola bugs minor issue great speakerphone and i do not think I shall need a bluetooth headset with this feature this is a cingular phone and unlocked therefore i am not limited to cingulars network and currently using t-mobile overall all style and very little substance pros design a very solid form made from state of the art material similar to apples g4 notebooks just when every mfgs heading for flimsy plastics keyboard is amazingly easy to handle and has a very good feel the best screen so far in terms of size and and technology tft for a thin phone without an external antenna and aside from service carriers it is reception is more than acceptable compared to phones with one cons smart keys are too stiff would be better if located at bottom part of body instead of on the flip earpiece volume could use a little boost say a notch lack of peripheral plug options shot images reversed taken when flip is close no software cd to coincide with computer,172,237
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,i have 2 lines of service with t-mobile and i recently recieved my new v3 I have had the nokia 6230 for the last seven months and i have been very impressed with that phone and i really like the razor as well the call volume quality and signal strength are better with the nokia 6230 however the screen is much better on the razor also the nokia feels much sturdier and durable than the razor both phones are solid but if you can only have one go with nokia 6230 it is a better phone for actual phone calls and function the user interface is quicker on the nokia as well the razor is a solid phone and fits comfortably in your pocket and t-mobile works really well for me in san diego,132,238
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,hi first things first pros the phone is a great thing to show-off it does look cool and attract attention cons coming from a non-motorola world i definitely have cons with the user interface 1 mentioned time and again the duplicate entries in the address book for different phone nums of same name is definitely an eye-sore and finger-sore too once u start searching the phonebook 2 the recently called received call list does not display the time of the call right away although it is only a click away it just displays the list of caller ids / names 3 if i set an alarm there is no icon / indicator on the home screen which tells me that an alarm is activated for xx xx time these might possibly be trivial but goes a long way in enhancing the user experience might hold on to the phone for probably a year until a better one comes by,153,239
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,this is a great phone I have had it for a little over a week now and i love it the only reason it gets four instead of five stars is the lack of a memory card slot on the other hand i have pics and voice tags for nearly every entry in my phonebook and only 10 of the memory is being used,63,240
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,pros 1 the phone looks and feels cool size and weight are about right 2 good signal strength 3 large crispyscreen 4 nice feature set vga camera video bluetooth themes voice recording and more 5 mini-usb communication / charging port so it can be hooked to a usb power source such as a laptop computer and charge the battery cons 1 only take a few seconds of video 2 does not support msn messenger in t-zone i confirmed this with t-mobile customer service 3 the shinny keypad gets scratched pretty easy bottomline this is the best phone with t-mobiles 1-year contract,101,241
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,this is a very good phone it is not perfect but I have never seen a perfect phone yet this phone gets close enough i paid 270 and extended my contract to get it so it better be excellent i love the look of the phone I have already gotten what has that and other questions like it it definately grabs attention i had heard reports that this phone is too wide however it fits perfectly in my hands plus if you get it from tmo you get video recording ha ha cingular customers the only problem i encountered was the volume it seemed a little low however when i used my motorola headset it seemed fine i say get this phone if you want a cell phone that draws attention my last phone was a nokia 6800 that drew some attention too but not as much as my razr then this is the phone for you,148,242
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,first thing first thanks to ginny mans review i bought this phone through wirefly after rebate it was free and i received a free bluetooth headset i had sony ericsson t637 with cingular for the past year when i switched to razr / t-mobile i was hoping that people could hear me better everyone complained that the background noise through t637 was unbearable i live in new york city and i make and receive calls on the streets 85 of the time so far they say they could not tell the difference between t637 and razr however the incoming volume is definitely much lower with razr than t637 my gosh i have the volume to the maximum but i cannnot hear the words of people on the other end i am not into all the gadgets and to me the most important feature of a cell phone is to make and receive calls clearly i had owned many different phones but in terms of volume nokia had it best local t-mobile customer rep said that nokia has entirely different speaker system and yes they are the best in the industry if you do not live in the city i would assume the volume level might be good but if you live in the city i would avoid this phone,215,243
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,I have heard from a few people that this phone is very prone to breaking but i find it to be quite sturdy it is a very handy little phone with a lot of luxuries my old samsung did not have it gets great reception pretty much anywhere which i know I have had trouble with in the past it is very easy to use i had it figured out in a couple minutes if you still have reservations go down to a t-mobile store and try one out i think you will be pleasantly suprised,90,244
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,do not fall into this promotional / rebate trap t-mobile has been my carrier for the last 3 years i figured what a great time to renew my contract and get the groovy new razr at the same time essentially free after amazons 200 promotional credit i followed the online instructions about transferring existing phone number i odered the new phone online it arrived pre-activated with a new cell number i then called t-mobile to cancel my old line and transfer the number to the new phone impossible they tell me to keep me happy however t-mobile cancels my new account and simply renews my old account for another year t-mobile tells me this is an error on amazons part and that i should still be eligible for the promotional credit [ ],129,245
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,5.0,positive,t-mobiles motorola razr v3 is awesome slim sexy design video capture which cingulars does not currently have bluetooth speakerphone internal antenna nice screen colors good sound quality decent vga camera for a phone what has not to like the only thing i could think of which is not really a problem once you get used to it is the operating system does not seem as user-friendly as samsung nokia or lg but once you get used to it it is fine you will not be disappointed with this phone so just get it yes razr v3x is coming out with a 2 megapixel camera and speaker independent voice recognition and 2 way video calling but from what i understand it will be a little bigger and i could not wait that long,128,246
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,5.0,positive,i bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the more i use it that is the more i get used to the interface the more i love it i use it as much as a notebook datebook camera and computer browsing web e-mail and more as i do as a phone and it does all of these things well i can not agree more with the previous reviewer that as long as you get sprints replacement insurance 6 bucks a month is not bad for a 600 dollar phone you can basically do whatever you want wherever you want with this device my only complaints are that the interface is a little complicated but that is microsofts doing especially dialing on the phone and the battery life is crappy because the device has so much functionality i just ordered an extended life battery and am gradually getting used to the interface and i must say i am overall extraordinarily happy with my purchase the fact that you can use it as a modem for a laptop or desktop to provide broadband internet to a computer anywhere on their network for a good price i might add is a genuineforward in mobile technology get it and get the insurance from sprint,210,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,4.0,positive,in a word this thing is awesome windows mobile has really come into it is own as a viable platform to run mini-apps on plus with all the features you get it is just the neatest gizmo you could have sprint may not offer the treo yet but why bother if you have sprint for wireless and want an uber gadget a few caveats 1 it is difficult to dial on the road i would not even try cool reinforces phone safety 2 the digital camera is good for everyday use but dedicated digital cameras do far better do not take this thing along on your vacation and expect it to take good pics in and of itself 3 can not do any subscription music services near as i can tell without buying buy and burn privileges to store on your ppc-6700 not a big deal with me although 4 ram is a bit skimpy get an expansion card with it to begin with fortunately mini-sd cards are cheap,163,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,3.0,neutral,this is the worst phone that i have ever purchased i have had this phone for 6 months and have had to replace it 3 times already everytime something goes wrong with the phone sprint just gives you a new one the phone never shuts off even although you think it is shut off by hitting the button on the top to shut it down it will not try dialing a number or anything using the touch screen and you have to wait a few second there is no way to get rid of program icons once you uninstall them it is impossible to call someone or text anyone while driving i know you not suppose to do it the good thing is you can access the internet but wait can not you do that already with regular phones also you can not watch tv on these phones either what has the use for this phone then if you have sprint and they tell you this phone you must purchase a different package in order to get the internetthey are lying to you call them and make them switch you back it is just a bunch of added fees that you do not need as this phone is not compatible i wish i never spent the 50000 on this phone as i could have spent that on a laptop as for upgrading to windows 6 or compatability with vista worthless,237,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,4.0,positive,been using this phone for the last 4 weeks a big improvemment over the 6601 battery life is much better easier to use it is lighter too the new version of windows mobile is much better than the previous so far i like it and i can recommend it love the integration with ms office just kind of surprised by all the bad reviews as that has not being my experience,70,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,2.0,negative,phone is not very user friendly stylus requirement is a challenge sprint stores do not sell a replacement stylus and neither do compusa or best buy memory card must be purchased separately price is way too high,37,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,3.0,neutral,i have owned this phone for 2 years but buying this phone was a big mistake using windows mobile software is a nightmare you have to go through at least 4 steps to dial speed-dial numbers on this phone although this phone is full of numerous features you can not use most of them because this phone freezes and hangs up so much you have to take the battery out and put it back to get the phone working again in comparison to windows mobile palm software is pleasure to use after having used 2 palm phones and 2 windows mobile phones i do not think i will ever go back to windows mobile based phones again palm based pda phones are very intuitive to use although not completely trouble free,129,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,5.0,positive,seriously i guess you must have to be somewhat of a techie to appreciate this phone i searched and searched to find an all-in-one solution when i came across the 6700 i knew that I had found it I have had mine for 5 months and i couldt live without now what does this phone have over any other phone on the market i realize that other phones have some of these features but this is the only phone to have them all full slide out qwerty keyboard wireless 80211 built in 13mp camera with a flash terminal services client vpn ability mini usb connectivity makes charging very easy and mobile windows mobile 5 voice activated dialing bluetooth built in you can very easily connect this phone to your laptop and get internet access almost anywhere i actually share out the connection from my laptop and i am able to allow other people to connect wirelessly this gives you a wireless hotspot anywere your phone gets data service i get unlimited data traffic for 1500 / mo compare that to the 50 bucks a month cingular wants for thier wireless internet card and you have got a pretty good deal as far as phones go this is the most advanced phone out there if you just want email text messaging and a decent phone get a treo however if you want all of the bells and whistles the 6700 can not be beat,236,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,5.0,positive,i have used non-phone pocket pc pdas before and have come to rely on them so when this was available from my alltel service i jumped to get it so that i would not need to carry a pda and a phone with me this is a very well engineered product when set properly if you chose to set it to manually synchronize the battery lasts for ever i charge it up once every three days just to be safe the voice recognition program is great after setting up your voice tags to voice dial a number or start an application you just press the record button on the side of the phone say your tag and boom the number is dialed or the application starts the computer maintains it is state when in off state and powers back on instantaneously the communications panel is easy to access and let us you toggle the phone service on or off as needed i toggle it off at night before i go to bed i installed a 1 gb mini-sd chip and loaded my library of microsoft reader formatted books and a lot of music as well as some foreign language software that i use for studies i love this product,205,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,2.0,negative,i can not say enough bad things about this device save yourself from a headache and do not purchase this product the battery does not make it through a day of minimal use in order to have this phone work properly for you you would need to purchase an extended battery with a price range from 60 80 dollars the most disappointing feature of this phone is the phones speaker volume itself it is very hard to hear conversations and it makes for many frustrating phone calls many colleagues of mine have decided not to purchase this device after they experienced first hand how poor the quality of the phone was the phone however sounds excellent when plugged into a headset the phone as it is is bulky let alone adding a larger battery onto it for the money spent I am very disappointed the manufacturer has cut many corners in making this device and it is evident shame on them,159,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,4.0,positive,this is really my favorite gadget of all time it is my bible my navigation system gps my library of pdf documents my telephone my sirius satellite radio player on and on it goes my only gripe with it is the that battery life is not that great if you do every thing with it that it can do i guess i was expecting the battery life to match the capabilities of the phone you do have to watch out when you change the orientation the machine can lock up on you from time to time also when you first boot up there is a lag between the time the screen shows readiness and you can actually go ahead with some of the funcitons this could very well be a function of how much i ask mine to do i would suggest the [ ] forum as well as the [ ] forum,151,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,1.0,negative,i bought it few weeks after launched in my first day using it i found a battery problem even in standby mode no bluetooth or wireless lan activated the phone died in less than 8 hours i went back to sprint and they told me it was not their problem i called utstarcomm the customer service was so friendly like a terrorist send us the phone i had to pay for shippment and wait 2 weeks to receive it back to new york at and hand the phone well 2 weeks later they told me the phone and the battery were ok no further explainings i bought another extend battery because i have a 2 year plan with sprint shame on me although the site says 200 hours in standby mode my record was 14 hours so if you like a cool gadget and talk is not a problem it is a nice pocketpc if you want a phone edition try the new q from motorolla or the new samsung one,171,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,4.0,positive,i have just gotten this little gadget as a gift from a friend whom i really love for it it is a funny little thing which has a little of every thing for a gadget freak like myself i have used many different products in my time all from hpcs palm pdas you name it I have tried them but this unit outdo them all by lenghts the touch screen can be a little annoying but the wifi and bt facility sort of make the pain worth it it could use a little work on the service but i guess that is a limitation from sprint and not the device itself if there is to be mentioned a drawback compared to my other pda i would say it to be the memory only 128/45 mb contra the 4 gb in my palm livedrive other than that if you want someone to really love you or if you are looking for a gift for your have it all friend this is going to be a very good choice admittedly the price may be a bit of a barrier laughing out loud almost 600 without new phone contract 18 months down the road still have it use it daily too have to say stylus keeps wandering off jump out of socket freezes too but with 4 phones on my belt who cares despite all i still think the memory is the bigest flaw not to mention sprint customer service which is no service at all to the extend that if you can try to avoid sprint all together most horrible customer service i have ever encountered,273,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FOFRSG,5.0,positive,i have this phone and love it the only thing i noticed is the same issue that others have commented on the styli just falls out i too lost both of mine inside 2 months i can live with that it only costs a few dollars to replace the pocketpc is an excellent option to carrying a laptop i can work on the road using citrix via the internet i would highly recommend this phone,75,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,4.0,positive,not a bad blue tooth headset for 20 has small ear piece that just hangs in your ear and does not interfere with glasses the electronics and mic are in a small 2 x 3/4 clip-on unit that also has the led indicator works pretty good the volume control is on the clip piece and the shaft of the ear piece has the on / off / answer / and more switch this switch is a bit awkward to use but i have gotten used to it earpiece is loud enough and have had no complaints about the microphone quality over-all not a bad unit for the price,101,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,5.0,positive,this is my 4th bt headset and so far the best I have had it is a little unorthodox with the wired headpiece but for me it works i like to keep my headset in my pocket and the smaller ones have me fishing in my pocket when my phone rings i have a plantronics 640 which i like and is now my backup I have allmost lost it several times because it is so small the itech clips to my pocket and chirps when my phone rings allowing me to keep the ringer volumn low i easily grab the wire to the earpiece put the bud in my ear and answer the call sound is very good and battery life is exceptional I am ordering a second one as I am worried it may be discontinued it pairs perfectly with my treo 650 so check itechs web site to make sure it works with your phone,152,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,1.0,negative,returning this one clickie background noise and it sounds like you are in a tunnel,15,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,1.0,negative,please check the itech website first for a list of compatible phones before purchasing thisi bought it for my treo 680 and it will not recognize it i even tried it with a sony z525 and a motorola razr and it still will not pair up so be sure,49,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,4.0,positive,the product is pretty good and the audio is also good it is got a long battery life up to 10 hrs talk and 200 hrs standby plus you do not have to wear it off your ear either clip it to your shirt jacket or hang it around your neck we use sony ericsson for our phones and it pairs quickly and fine,64,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,1.0,negative,i have been looking for a bluetooth headset for a while i like this unit simply because this type of the design eases the burden on my ear after i received this unit i tried to pair rhis unit with my motorola v3 for three hours but i still can not get them to recognize each other moreover the mfb multi-function button on the clip will not function anymore after serveral on and off i ordered this unit with amazons one day service for the reason i have to go for my christmas trip two days later the freight cost more than the unit price already it is really wasting my time sincere suggestion do not buy this if you are using motorola v3,119,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,5.0,positive,once i got it paired with my phone the bluetooth was great it was not the bluetooths problem in pairing but mine in not reading the phones instructions product works great better than any wired headset i have had,39,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,5.0,positive,the wireless hand-free from itech is amazing light little with a very good range and atractive shape andi would recommend it to anyone,25,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,3.0,neutral,do people constantly tell you that they hear an echo when you are talking to them on your bluetooth headset that is because the mike is about an each from the speaker i had given up on finding an affordable headset without this echo problem until i found this one the quality of the individual components of the headset earpiece mike are not fantastic but it is easy to put the clip on mike wherever it is comfy and keep it far enough away from the earpiece to avoid the echo too many unexplained dropped bluetooth connections for my liking but overall a good headset for the price i use it much more than any other I have had,115,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,4.0,positive,i like it often when i commute i clip it on my shirt and forget about it until a call comes in i place the earpiece without taking my eyes off the road and i am talking once when i went met up with friends at a restaurant i forgot that it was clipped to the my shirt until i seen the blue light reflecting off the table i like the fact that this device works well when i wear my glasses and even fits comfortably under my motorcycle helmet,90,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,1.0,negative,this headset is not compatible with any of my bluetooth devices be sure of the compatibility before you purchase it,20,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,4.0,positive,i wear glasses and find that the typical over the ear headset is very cumbersome to put into place when i am wearing glasses sure i can put it on first and then put on my glasses but even then the area behind my ear is crowded and uncomfortable plus you are forced to put them on before hitting the road they are virtually impossible to put on once you are driving not to mention dangerous the itech clip is a good alternative while not perfect it sure beats what has out there now the microphone is in the clip which like any clip can be used on a shirt t-shirt sweater and more the earphone is just that an earphone like an ipod earphone except that there is only one i like to clip it on my shirt before heading off to work and keeping the earphone in my front pocket or dangling when i get a call i just place it in my ear and hit the little button on the earpod call quality is excellent and folks tell me they now hear me better than my last bluetooth ear-piece which cost 4 times as much i recommend this product although it took a few attempts to get it to pair with my phone you just have to play around with it and it will eventually be recognized by your cell phone once paired it is a snap to use,243,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,1.0,negative,this headset gives a lot of static compared to the other one i have it was easy to sync with sony / ericson phone but the sound is just not good,29,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,4.0,positive,very good product easy to set up and easy to use the battery life is long simply a very good product,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,5.0,positive,nice and easy to use the talk time is reaily longgood to have one,13,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FZ4SPI,5.0,positive,works well with razr 3v good standby battery life well over a week I am not sure i like the constantly flashing blue light although since it is distracting when driving at night,30,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,5.0,positive,this phone is incredible i baught it at the store for 200 more but it is one of the best cell phones i have ever owned i baught a competitor version of the phone but returned it because it was difficult to talk on this phone is great,48,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,4.0,positive,pros 2 megapixel camera with decent video and flash micro sd card solid updates of motorola ui good looking stereo bluetooth but 100 for a stereo bluetooth headset uses miniusb for recharging sound quality is adequate cons music player has poor ui reception is not stellar but ok for city usage i principally bought this because it was on t-mobile i liked the design and it had a 2 megapixel camera with a led illuminator flash i also do a reasonable amount of texting and picture messaging so i wanted something good for that i am happy with this decision the camera is quite good for a pinhole camera phone however the maximum size i can send in mms messages is 640x480 that is likely a t-mobile limitation the music player leaves much to be desired there is enough of it there to call it a music player but if you have ever used an ipod you will not love it there is no way to keylock the phone while using it so you end up ending the music play if you drop it in a pocket and bump it the music player has no concept of what podcasts have been played nor does it remember the last place in the podcast like an ipod does it is borderline unusable as an mp3 player due to this lousy software i had a problem with the phone after about 5 weeks where the predictive text stopped working it was as if the dictionary had been deleted off my phone or the keys would not work when in predictive text mode it is under a 1year warranty and t-mobile chose to replace it anyway an annoyance but it is ok now,295,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,4.0,positive,i like many of the features on this phone with the expandable mini sd card i now have 300 songs and 10 movies on my phone which keep me busy especially when traveling if you have not already done so make sure to download mini opera onto this phone which will give you a great browser almost identical to firefox for cruising the web picture quality from the camera is decent in well lit areas but not very good anywhere else sound and video quality are ok unfortunately many of the optional stereo headsets that fit the mini usb port suck if you purely want an mp3 player you are better off with a nokia browser / internet speed is ok once again make sure to get the mini opera application or something similar the one which is supplied with the phone is horrible with mini opera i can fully access facebook hotmail myspace even outlook webmail also google has some great applications like mobile gmail and google maps that work great on this phone overall pretty good for the money,177,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,4.0,positive,I have had this phone for 7 months now and have had just a few problems the main center button and the arrow buttons have fallen off apparently the glue is not strong enough but it is still usable i just have to press where the buttons were a little harder also for about 2 months the phone would randomly restart every once in a while but that seems to have stopped otherwise i have not had any problems with the phone it looks nice when the buttons are all intact and should last you a while the battery never dies as long as you charge it every night which is not a problem,112,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone unless you like a phone that turns itself off and on when you shut it no matter how gently you treat it i bought this phone and it mysteriously turned itself on and off in my purse the source of some embarrassing moments i returned the phone of course t mobile said they would never heard this complaint before a former employee told me they are instructed to say that although i have since met severall people with the same complaint and they sent me a new phone behold same problem with the new phone when i tried to return that phone they opened the back where there was a sticker that had turned red indicating water damage i had not so much as gone for a strenuous walk with the phone in my pocket let alone submerged it somewhere so i am stuck with a phone that turns on and off by itself plus after only a few months of very gentle use the round buttons in the middle have come unglued and fall off all the time wow please please please do not buy this phone do yourself a favor,196,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,3.0,neutral,1 i have had a terrible experience with rebate on this phone from amazon i got the phone almost 9 months ago and i never got my rebate i called t-mobile once and they said they have send the check which was not cashed so they canceled it and resent it however months have passed i did not get it yet they send my bill right on time although 2 well about the phone i like most of it is features and it is very user friendly i do not like it isseems too feminine to me and i find the phone a little slow to respond last point with in a couple of months dust started accumulating behind the screen apparently there is no easy way to clean it,128,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,2.0,negative,trouble with no signal when other tmobile phones have great signal and keypad is really small causing text troubles and switching between modes of typing unless you have tiny fingers only better than average feature identification 13 mega pixels pictures and video if you can transfer them and find software to edit and update phonebook my next has to be the apple iphone for big finger,66,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,3.0,neutral,i bought this phone five months ago from t-mobile overall i think it is a so so phone pros beautiful and looks cool cons 1 camera quality is not as good as i had thought 2 it makes a sound when you adjusting the ring volume which is embarrassing if you do this during a meeting 3 voice dialing is funny it does not associate your voice with a fixed number but instead it tries to pick up a name from the contact list based on your voice the intelligence of the voice recognition is poor and it assumes your contact has an english name 4 very fragile i dropped the phone from a place two feet high and it is broken it keeps resetting and will not come up i will stay away from motorola phones from now on,137,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,1.0,negative,this is one of the worst phones i have had it for a month and i have desided to upgrade already to the t-mobile wing it is a dumb phone the music player is very slow and it is not organized alphabeticly the batery is very bad it will last 4 hrs if your using the music camara is decent if there is good lighting because the light dosent work your pictures will come out very white if you use it theis better than it looks online not much to do with this phone i would not recommend it,101,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,2.0,negative,as far as features go this is a nice phone with a 2 mp camera music player removable micro sd card and ready access from a pc however it fails to deliver when it performs it is primary function as a phone it is voice quality is much below average and the speaker phone sounds like someone just cranked up the earpiece a wee bit being on the tmobile network makes matters worse in my area where i have marked specific areas in my house to run to to make / receive calls,89,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,1.0,negative,this phone is not durable at all since purchasing the phone two months ago the screen has cracked in 3 places and now has many dead pixels in the screen i have never had a screen crack before in a phone and it really angers me that i have to put up with the phone until the end of my contract also the sound quality is mediocre at best it does have a great camera although,76,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,3.0,neutral,i too bought this phone 6 months ago because it is cute and has a lot of great features it usually works well so i have few complaints about function however soon after i bought the phone the control pad and center selection key fell off of the phone t-mobile did replace the phone quickly and without argument i love t-mobile customer service every time i call them they are friendly and solve my problem quickly but about a week later my sisters phone did the same thing and also needed to be replaced now these keys are again coming off of my replaced model and a few store models i have seen motorola suspects that they are using a glue that sucks obviously also my battery only lasts for one day now and my charger no longer works i have to use the usb cord to charge the phone from my computer a friend told me that motorola got a bad shipment of chargers / batteries as well so all in all i do like the phone and it is features maybe i just got my phone at an unfortunate time and got stuck with sucky batteries / chargers / glue,193,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,5.0,positive,this phone is excellent the call quality is awesome and the international coverage is great i spent 2 weeks in the dominican republic and i had a 5 bar signalthe design itself is stylish and interesting the mp3 is also great you hear your songs clearly unlike some other phones with mp3 that you hear your songs jumpy and annoying i definitely recommend this phone to anyone,67,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,2.0,negative,the screen scratches too easy day one i accidently put it in my pocket with my keys and i was all scratched up and the screen gets way to greasy like another reviewer was saying maybe he does not shower often either ha ha,43,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,4.0,positive,like other motos this seems to go through some sort of 1 or 2 second echo cancellations when first using a new cell tower however once it is calibrated into your location it sounds perfect the device is amazing and quite a bundle of features overall voice recognition works perfectly and promptly for me however i have to give it low marks for cosmetics the screen gets greasy from your face it does not feel or handle at all like a phone i think the only way you can enjoy using it is with a bluetooth headset i do not like the slider aspect of it at all I had prefer a flip phone by a long shot but this seems to be the best tmo subsidized offering at this date battery really does seem to last all week for me camera takes great indoor pictures / films and i have to wonder if the complainers about the camera bothered to take the film off of the lense i have not figured out how to make it beep when a message is waiting and i really need that feature get an arm band holster screen cover 2gig memory and bluetooth headset your going to want them for this type of phone not too bad,207,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,4.0,positive,I am 90 happy with the phone batteries live long standard usb slot for charging not proprietary cables any more thank god slightly improved interface love the way it slides my sliding samsung did it with less reassuring feel 10 of unhappiness is due to the fact that it looses signal in places where some of my friends phones do not also dust gets between a screen and a protective glass,69,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,1.0,negative,after one month blue paint started peeling off phone according to t-mobile this is not an issue and will not honor warranty,22,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,1.0,negative,it has an extremely slow reaction time and the keys are very difficult to operate especially for texting the screen temporarily goes white and sometimes it takes up to 7 - 10 seconds for a letter to show up on the screen while texting i have had to send this phone back twice due a slow reaction time and freezing,57,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,5.0,positive,i have had my rizr from t-mobile for a few weeks now after switching from verizon i was originally considering the nokia 5300 but when i compared the 2 phones side by side the rizr seemed more solid more durable and less flimsy than the nokia 5300 so i chose the rizr and i could not be happier the phone is easy to program and a breeze to use the display is bright clear and very easy to read even without my bifocals so far the sound quality and reception have been outstanding the best feature for me is the mp3 player with my new rizr i can transfer mp3 songs directly from my computer to my phone with a simple drag and drop the 128 mb card is not very large but enough for my needs i can then select the songs to act as ringtones being able to assign a song / ringtone to a certain phone number is a really cool feature at least for me the mp3 player included with the phone is very easy to use too my only minor gripe is the screen goes black during calls but i found pressing the volume up button which displays the volume screen temporarily brings the main screen back fast enough for me all in all a great phone and highly recommended,223,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this iphone holder is great it arrived in less than 5 days and is much cooler in person than pictured i was not sure if i would like the looks of it as the picture on the site is not great but i am so very pleased i can not wait to put my iphone in it have to wait till christmas morning o would highly recommend this product i think i am going to get green and orange as well o,78,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,great price for an excellent case and i have looked at a lot of them i liked this one so much i bought another in green they look and feel great if you use a screen protector you may have to trim it on the bottom corners because this case fits so snug,53,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,I am mostly writting this review due to my displeasure with eforcity the vendor that sells this product through amazon one thing I have always loved about amazon is the fast shipping this vendor has had my order since monday four days and it still has not shipped i was actually hoping to have it today or tomorrow i will probably avoid any purchases through this vendor in the future,68,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i purchased this case to replace a rubber case which was difficult to get out of pockets i like the soft-touch feel allowing it to slide easily in / out of my pockets two issues the screen protectors are pretty cheap just get the crystal film if you want a screen protector and thewas too lipsticky for my tastes i purchased the same case in orange / black and am much more pleased,71,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a cool sleek case for the iphone 3 g it fits like a glove and does not add any bulk to the overall size of the iphone so it still fits in your pocket or other small compartments the cutouts keep your control buttons and camera lens usable the case is very comfortable to hold and definitely keeps the iphone from slipping out of your hand so easily that in itself makes it worth the money it looks great and the ifrogz logo is barely visible so it does not look tacky one thing i really like is that you can slip the case over the touchscreen to protect it if you know it is going to be in harms way for example in the bottom of your purse or other bag for a long time the controls are not usable when the case is in that position but your screen is protected this is a great protector for my new favorite gadget,162,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is the 3rd case I have gotten for various iphones and it is absolutely the best looking case i actually got it in metallic orange seriously the geniuss at the apple store were ooohing and ahhhing asking me where i got it fits snugly and covers all areas but the buttons earphone jack and screen covers all but a sliver of the silver bezel on the front and i believe it will stop any scratches and dents happening on the bezel very happy with it and I am thinking of getting anothertoo bad they do not make them for the original iphone because my wife is jealous,107,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i do not own a 3 g cell anymore but at the time this was a good case i still have the cell and the phone but not in service,29,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it lasted me about a year before it cracked and broke it is of good quality and fit my iphone 3s perfectly the shipment was very good and quick,28,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this case offers far better protection for your device than most others two piece cases are a little bulkier but it is worth the extra size considering the enhanced protection,29,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,fit the basic need that i was looking for i was looking to replace a replica phone case this is great,21,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,looked great but broke far too easily i ended up buying 3 in total because of the looks terrible durability,20,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it looked good in the pic but when it came it was just cheap plastic i ended up buying a different case and giving this one away,27,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i was not madly in love with this product but i used it for several months the texture was good easy to hold not to sticky or gummy did not stick to my hair but it was a little thin and ultimately ended up cracking,44,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,we totally love our ifrogz covers the other ones that are marketed do not provide that much protection and for an expensive phone i want to make sure i get all the protection i can get,35,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,my old case for my iphone showed much wear and tear parts of the case were broken i lucked out to find this one to fit my iphone 3 gs looks like new and such a great price including shipping,40,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,worked well with my 3 g no complaints however i have moved on to the iphone 4 and use the ballistic case,21,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i did not notice at the time of purchase that it said the side tabs were broken they were and the case would come apart every time my husband took it out of his pocket my fault missed the fine print buyer beware i purchase it because i have the same in pink and it is practially in destructible,58,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i got this for my mom to put on her phone and she absolutely loves it the colors are vibrant and it is decent protection,25,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,most cases are not made for the 3gs since the newer iphones started coming out and whenever my case gets damaged or breaks from dropping it i buy another one of these they protect the phone and instead break themselves the point of a case it is cheap too which is the best part they do not stick in your pocket like most rubber / plastic cases of this sort which is nice,70,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i got this case one and loved it then got it a second time and it was a total piece of crap it lasted like 3 weeks the first one was great and lasted 6 months or more the second one would not stay together on my phone kept falling apart,51,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love my phone case and the timing that i received it in this is the third case i have owned and i love it,25,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i ordered this exact case when i first got my phone a year and a half ago and it was great this time around it has cracked and chipped away within days of purchasing it the fit was slightly off and overall has been disappointing,45,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i recently bought a used iphone and wanted a case the cover some flaws on the back side of the phone this case did exactly what i wanted it made my used phone look new but did not add bulk the price on amazon made this case a good buy i would not pay the price they sell for in the stores the only reason i gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 is that i have had issues with getting the two pieces to meet up well when putting the case on after a minute or two of messing with it it went together fine and has stayed in place since it is not a huge issue since i rarely remove the case but none the less was a bit of an hassle to get on,136,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this is at least the third such case that i have bought and the previous ones lasted about 6 months before the side locking clips broke this last one lasted less than a week before the locking side clips broke no longer an acceptable product even if it is inexpensive,51,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,just as described works great i would buy thisagain seller was awesome well put together and easy install on my phone much cheaper than a retail store,29,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i just started using this cover 1 week ago and the red is chipping off the corners it is a nice case but it is going to look pretty shabby very quickly I am glad i only paid a little over 3 for it one other thing that drives me nuts is that when it is sitting flat on my desk and i touch the screen it does not sit flat because of the button on the back so when i touch the screen it wobbles a lot it also does not have as much traction as my old case so it slides around in my car the case will do it is job but i would not pay more than 5 for it,118,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,I am guessing few will ever read this review as it is for a case for a phone not even made anymore i have an older 3gs which i love i bought this case a while back for over 30 and it lasted about two years it is a great case that has definitely saved my phone on a number of occasions i like it a lot it feels nice and keeps the phone looking sharp the fact you can now buy it for a small fraction of the original cost is just extra sweetness,92,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,when i got this phone case i was not expecting much from it but the second i put that case on my phone i knew that was the case for me it is awesome looking it is comfortable to hold and it is down right awesome i defineteley reccommend this case,50,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,received case ahead of scheduled delivery date my son loves the case but i am not as happy the bottom piece covers the bottom phone corners great but the top piece does not cover the corners completely like the bottom piece does great colors and on the inside of the case has a felt cloth so the case does not scratch the back of iphone which is a great feature because all other cases we have had have done just that scratched the iphone so when iphone is out of the case it looks horrible updated 7/3/12 the case comes with a screen protector which is great because we needed to replace the one on his phone,117,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i had the same case on my iphone before and it lasted 3 years real happy with the replacement although the side clip broke after 1 month not a big deal much better then all the e-bay crap cases they sell,41,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,ordered plastic pull apart cover for my 3 g iphone i got what i paid for very cheap separates easy and comes apart when i take out of my pocket not impressed,31,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this cost effective candycase was really worth buying it fits in nicely to my costly phone giving worth for money i paid to get this case really love it,29,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this was exactly what i was looking for it was brand new in the original package the price was very good and the delivery was quick i gave this 5 stars,31,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the i-phone cover is fine but slides apart very slightly where the two pieces join i had one like this in the past but think this one must be an older version the button to release the phone is larger and more convex than the other one i had and i think general usage pushes the button more and causes the slight separation it is not a major problem but just a bit of a nuisance still like the case,80,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,1is really nice to match my bag 2 the hardcase is kinda cheap material and it will not really protect your iphone from falls it is just a protective case,34,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love this case and it only had two glaring issues for me it is hard to remove because of the design has you push on piece and pull on another to get it unlatched the other issue is that it is bottom is a little thick so it can get in the way on some accessories did not work with a keyboard i found but works great with my alarm clock other then that this case literally saved my ipod i fell down the stair and my ipod flew onto hard tile / cement and came out with only a little crack on the corner of the screen it could have been way worse but the case saved it also i do like how the case looks and feels in my hand,130,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,the case came quickly it works and the quality is exceptional no complaints from me it has breathed new life into my iphone 3gs,24,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love my ifrogz case exactly what i expected the service was fantastic excellent seller thank you so much,19,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk the tabs broke off the first time i went to put the case on my phone not worth the money,26,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,good product offers good phone protection for a mid class product if higher end basic protection is what your after then this works well easily slides in and out of pockets yet has a non slip grip not for any high abuse situations or excessive pocket stress,47,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the e-mail i sent to phonenerds was never responded to the case came close to the outside of the delivery deadline the case fits on the phone and is loose,30,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this cover is very solid it fits perfectly and theis rich it makes my phone look great i would love to buy one in purple my husband recommended this brand as he had great luck with one of these covers as well you will not go wrong ordering one of these ifrogz i received my shipment very quickly,59,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,great looking and has a nice feel to it fits very snugly on the iphone 3gs maybe too snugly as within two months the connection between the top piece and the bottom piece broke off quality consturction on the top and bottom pieces except where they snap together maybe i just received a lemon,54,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,good cheap case I have it for months now and have not had any problems with them chipping or paint coming off and I am fairly abusive to my iphone I am an auto tech,31,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i bought this case about 6 months ago and it has protected my itouch from drops scratches stomps and more the number one characteristic that makes this case one of the best is the small lip it has over the sides of the screen while many hard cases out there do not have this feature it is absolutely essential when it comes to protecting the screen so many times i have dropped my itouch screen first on the pavement and gravel and surely anyone would expect to see various scratches on the screen but no not with this case i do not really write reviews but this case has been so good to my itouch and i that i hope others can benefit from it is excellent protection,125,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i liked the case for about 2 weeks after i got it then it began chipping and peeling after 3 months i had to throw it away because it was so torn up it was embarrassing to carry around i think all the good reviews were written by people who just bought the case do not waste your money,59,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i carry my phone in my pocket along with keys and other items a phone case must be tough it needs to protect the phone when i got the case i really loved it the design is nice enough and theand satiny feel were really amazing within 3 days the case was totally covered with scratches so much for the good looks within a month the tabs that hold the two halves together were broken it was very loose and came off from time to time i tossed it and bought an incase slider case for iphone 3gs metallic orange instead it was expensive but has been very durable,113,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the case itself is very attractive but cheaply made the bottom piece just under the iphone button broke off within a couple of weeks of use i replaced it with a completely different case,34,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,not a bad case especially considering the price it is a pain to put in and out of the case so if youror any cables that use daily with your phone and you need to constantly remove the case it gets cumbersome other than that not too bad,49,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,my 3gs fits in the case well not too tight or too loose case closes up and opens up easily to me the button lock on the back does not because a rocking issue when laying the phone on a hard surface to type,44,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,from the beginning this case which actually is quite good looking did not work it did not click together well and everytime it came out of my pocket it would come apart within a month the edges where the two pieces meet in the front chipped and made the bad connection even worse i would not recommend this product,57,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i had originally bought the same case from an at t store when i bought my phone about a year and a half ago the clips holding the two pieces together broke after about a year i would not buy the same case for the price i originally paid 20 but have no problem shelling out under 4 bucks for a replacement in fact i bought 2 so that i will not have to buy another one again,75,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,it is worth what you pay for cheap plastic breaks easily and I have heard of other people who dropped their phone with this case and still cracked a screen it is better than no case but I am shopping for a different case now edit case broke and became unusable after 2 - 3 months i went with otterbox impact case it is much better in every aspect feels much more secure and has held up much better currently the same price on amazon changed the review from 2 to 1 star there is no instance i would recommend this to anyone given other products on the market,102,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the case is really nice not like the cheap one sold in the market it looks expensive and feels expensive i love the case so much i have used the case for a month but it is broken now after it slipped from my hand it is very fragile not a tough case at all but it looks gorgeous on the iphone,60,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,these cases look good and are worth the under 4 price on amazon i do not think the case will be durable over a long period but at the price replacement is no problem and for now the case is just fine,40,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have 1 of these in everyfunctionality and stylish what more could a girl ask for,18,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i used one of these cases for a while and my iphone withstood many falls until it did not my phone did drop from a stage in a theater about 10 feet on to wood so I am not sure i can fault the case too much for that still disappointing,49,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case is not a substitute for the sturdy hard rubber and plastic alternatives but it does not cost as much as is much more attractive I have had mine for a couple of months and there are no scratches or dings on it so it is tougher than i thought it would be a colleague saw mine and ordered one like it for herself there are lots of attractivechoices,68,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the short story is that this completely broke after 2 months gentle use ifrogz appears to be making these more cheaply there is a huge quality difference and i would never purchase again i bought this as a replacement case when my first ifrogz case became dull and scratched after a year of normal wear and tear i had been pleased with the performance of the original although the screen protector did produce an unusual amount of bubbles between the screen and film my order for the replacement was damaged on arrival and my ifrogz customer service experience was not satisfactory it was clearly a production problem not a shipping issue and they did not want to deal with it at all my intent had been to give them a heads up as much as to request a replacement so they clearly do not care about quality control amazon took care of it but the replacement for that also appeared more flimsy than the original i was suspicious same screen protector issue too and what do you know the pieces of plastic holding it together on the sides totally busted shortly thereafter out of nowhere they were unusually difficult to put together too there are better cases out there do not waste your money on this you will just have to replace it soon anyway,221,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,not a bad product i have owned two the tabs at the side that hold the case together break after a couple of months good for the price but beware it may not last too long,36,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,did not fit my 3gs right from the get go could not get the 2 pieces to click together properly finally broke after 2 weeks,23,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i picked this up because it was on sale at an unbelievably low price the case itself does not look too bad and it is thin enough to not be obtrusive but the 2 pieces do not really lock together so they separate pretty often without even pressing what looks like a release button it is annoying enough to make the case not worth using the only redeemer is that it came with a screen protector and it was actually cheaper to buy this case then most other protectors on the site so at least i have that out of the deal i can not speak to the quality of the screen protector as i already have a phone devil on my screen but if that ever fails me at least i have a backup now i also picked up an elago s3 case for iphone 3g/3gs and I had highly recommend you skip this one and spend the extra cash for the elago update after having it collect dust for a while i finally put my ifrogz in it is proper place the trash the elago remains amazing again spend the money on a better case even if it is not the elago you will be glad you did,202,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i purchased this case almost two years ago i chose thisbecause it looks great in dark red the quality of the case is excellent it has two segments which attach at the middle-lower portion and cover the phone theof the case extends over theof the phone very slightly maybe a millimeter and this protects theand front against flat surface damage my only complaint is that the hard she shall plastic case can accumulate dust inside it and needs to be opened once in a while to be cleaned i think this is a problem with almost all cases anyways so it is nothing special I have dropped my iphone 3 g numerous times while i had this case and it protected the phone very well it is not too large and it looks slick the coloring available in multiple colors is great and the case itself is very durable provides excellent protections and beats almost any rubber case i highly recommended this case and it is brand from my experiences,172,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,great thin look and feel to the case will not fit into the case with a invisible shield screen protector on your iphone it is such a tight fit that it keeps scraping up the screen protector I am sorry but I am not going to trust this case without a screen and back protector what a disappointment,55,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,within days of using this product it began to crack and fall apart it is a terrible disappointment,18,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,when i received this case the first thing that i noticed was the awesomeit is bright and bold and beautiful but already before i had even started using it the felt was peeling off and there was an important piece chipped off so i went to amazon to get a return and within 5 minutes they had already emailed me back and shipped a new one so hats off to you amazon,73,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i am disappointed in this puchase although it was cheap and therefore not worth returning i had to give my feedback first the case does not properly fit the gs version that i have or if it does it is not an easy snap on cover as i thought it would be secondly the clear plastic shield that goes on the front of the phone came with a sticker on it that does not come off easily not worth the trouble of trying to get the gummy stuff off of it was in the trash within 15 minutes of receipt,100,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is a very nice good looking case it comes with the clear cover protectant to protect the front too a great price delivered at 350 thank you amazon this will not protect the i-phone like the full rubber case but it is fine,42,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,I am getting ready to order my 3rd one of these cases in less than a year as they only last a few months before breaking fortunately the amazon price allows these to be treated as disposable after just a few months i treat my phone very carefully and have never dropped yet yet the fragile pieces of plastic that connect the top of the case to the bottom of the case break off very easily in my experience they break within the first 12 months but i like the minimal bulk of these cases and they seem to do a decent job of protecting the phone although i have never dropped my phone to find out if you order this case perhaps just order 2 or 3 of them at a time this still may be less expensive than just 1 of the more expensive cases,146,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,the case looks nice and the material is soft but less than 3 months after i bought it cracked on the sides in the junction of the two parts of the case now i does not look that nice anymore well i guess you get what you paid for,47,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i applied a screen protector and this case has such a tight fit that it will not fit on the iphone without trimming the edgesof the screen protector and now the locking ring on the back does not function correctly also when grabbed in normal operation the case somehow squeezes the iphone in such a way that it changes the volume when music is playing that can not be good,67,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,does this cheap case work better than a 30 case no but it does not need to it has it is flaws it feels loose it does not work well with certain stands or other accessories but it is good things outweigh them dirt cheap simple to use easy to take off and on as needed felt background keeps back from getting extra scratches,60,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,stylish case with a nice texture feels like a fusion of velvet and rubber fits iphone well without obstructing the camera lens orconnector although the cutout around the volume controls looks much larger than necessary the only practical issue is the little raised button on the back of this case makes it more difficult to lay iphone flat on a table,63,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,works well and for the price it is perfect ps fits snugg and tight with my 3gs,18,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i bought this today because i loved the matte finish and sleek design after i had applied a screen cover to my new iphone i went to put this case on and to my horror it ripped the screen protector i kept trying to push the two parts together very slow so that the screen protector would not move but it kept pushing it around and creating bubbles after ten minutes of fighting with it i decided to not put it on and i turned the phone around and there were scratches along thewhere the case slides together all in all it was not worth the money i spent on it and i will probably go back to the jelly cases I have used in the past,126,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i got the red / black case for the 3gs this thing just looks killer and fits very tight the case is not meant to be taken on / off often because it fits so snugly the same kind of case for the iphone4 apparently gets bad reviews i feel like I am keeping my 3gs because the case is so cool,55,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love this product I am a super researcher nd always search for the best deal i almost went with a knock off for half the price do not do it this one is awesome and a steal at the price amazon is offering it for it is the best price i found for the name brand it is sleek feels great in your hand feels very sturdy and is super stylish in a versatile way that is great for the male or female user i would have given 5 stars but for some reason mine does not click into place that is i do not have to press the button to remove the bottom case but it fits so perfectly there is no danger of the bottom slipping off i also took away one star because the design does expose too much of the phone around the volume and mute keys but this is great you are going to be hard-pressed to find a better looking and functioning case at this price,164,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,mine is a pretty red and black case with an intriguing and novel puzzle-piece form which is why it caught my eye since i am not prone to rough handling my new iphone 4 i am dismayed to find that in just three weeks the paint has chipped all the way around the red metal part if you are constantly shoving your phone in and out of your pocket as i do then skip this phone case it seems tomore toward being decorative than being a work horse admittedly although it is a rather cool case amazon does not have the 4 yet but i thought i would warn people that the design of the new case seems not to have been improved since the 3 g case listed here,130,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,if you need something functional and fast this is the case for you it slides easily into pocket or purse it is visible and feel good in your hand i was very satisfied,33,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case has been great for my iphone3 I have loved it it is protected my phone from a few falls i only wish they made the metallica bit more durable as it looks worn pretty quickly and i wish they sent you a second clear covering as these get bubbly and worn out fast too but the does what is supposed to do without being bulky highly recommend it,70,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the cut out portions around the lock volume and silence buttons are deep enough to inhibit use basically the case makes it hard to use them,26,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,as the title indicates this a pretty colorful case at a very reasonable price it is the same iphone case you pay 25 30 for at the att store for less than half the price the only cons to these cases is the fit and finish the halves of the case sometimes do not fit properly and the tabs tend to snap off mine did the first time i put it on my phone,73,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love the case fits super well i wish that i had bought it sooner study and beautiful all of the buttons and camera are fully accessible,27,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i really like my ifrogz case i can slide it in my pocket since the cover has a smooth surface and it looks sharp too what a great value for a great product,34,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,I have had my iphone 3gs for about a year only wish i found this case sooner my previous case did not hold up very well and for 4 months I have been sans protection being a cheapskate at times i just could not bring myself to spend 25 or more for a case especially when i was fairing okay with a naked iphone anyways installation was literally a snap i found it to be well designed slim yet rugged enough for the everyday use my phone endures since i do not work outdoors and have only dropped my phone once i did not feel the need for a bulky case like the otter the screen protector is actually one of the better ones I have used fits neatly applies very easily and accurately and most importantly has not impacted my touchscreen use function at all i bought two of these cases my wifes only complaint is it feels a little too smooth and she has afraid she will drop her phone i think the case has enough texture soft velvet feel to stay easily in my grip yet not too much texture to stick to my clothes when i retrieve from my pocket update after 75 days of using the product if you carry your phone in a purse or set it down on a lot of hard rough surfaces thecoating starts to wear off and you see bits of shiny under it not a big deal but thought i would share for the price i would recommend buying a few units and swapping out every 4 6 months,276,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,very nice looking case got several compliments unfortunately i was only able to show it off for two days before the small plastic connector that links the two separate piece broke cheap price but i guess you get what you pay for,42,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,it broke even although i am a delicate handler after that it was completely useless,15,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,I have tried many covers before but this one works great it has a kind of soft texture that makes it feel great in your hand i am thinking of buying another just in case i happen to drop my phone and break the case,44,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this case broke the first week i had it the thin part of the case on the upper left side by the buttons cracked then totally came apart i had not dropped it or mishandled it save your money and buy something else,42,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have had other iphone covers and the ifrogs has been the best it protects the phone and it also has a protector on the inside that away it keeps from scratching your iphone when taking it off and on,40,89
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i have to take my phone out of the case to charge / play music so i need to remove the phone from the case at least once a day after about two weeks a side tab on the bottom piece broke off for the money I am not surprised if you do not need to remove the case frequently I am sure the case is a decent value just a word of caution if your habits require you to take the case off and put it on frequently,84,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,everything worked as expected i would buy it again if i need another one,14,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i bought thisfor 10 and i do not regret it is now available for very cheap buy it before they hike the prices,24,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i actually got this case at a local retailer after purchase i checked it out on amazon and found that several people had problems with either the case scratching the phone or the case itself such as peeling orproblems i waited about 3 weeks and have not experienced any of those problems in fact the case still looks pretty much brand new i am not too hard on things but am not really careful either anyway what i really love about this case is that it fits the phone so perfectly and mine came with a clear face / screen protector meaning that i did not need to buy it separately considering the price of the case many vendors charge just as much just for the screen protector i have the orange / black version and after 3 weeks it still looks great in fact still looks new unless you look very closely then you can see a couple of small scuff marks where i dropped the phone but you do have to look for the marks i have purchased a couple of other cases for my iphone but none of them fit or look as nice in my opinion as this case all things considered the i-frogz case was a much better value than the other cases i purchased lastly the case is designed such that i have not had any problems with docking my iphone to other devices such as my stereo and more in short this case is a great best i have found option for protecting your iphone and at a great price,270,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought this last september when i bought my iphone i love theof the case my problem is that they tab broke off on one side after having it probably a month i kept using it but since the side does not sit flat it catches on things when it take it out of my purse or if i have it in my pocket now a piece has chipped off on the side with the missing tab i wish it would have lasted longer now I am going to try a different brand,93,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i was happy with this case for a few days looks good fits like a glove but after a while i realize that it was letting a lot of dirt in and the static cling screen was impossible to clean it left a lot of scratches and dings on my iphone i would move on in fact i am now shopping for another case waste of money wish I have not gotten it,73,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i bought this case for my iphone 3 g it has good build quality and is durable i bought another knock off case that looked quite similar from a booth at the mall and right away could tell the difference the cheap booth case felt like cheaper plastic and proved itself to be junk when i had it in my bag on a hot day and the paint started to bubble off of it i then went back to the ifrogz luxe case and have been happy and have not experienced the bubbling paint or any other I shall effects that plagued the no name case at t sells these for around 20 so it is definitely a better deal to get them here on amazon,121,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i was very disappointed that the bottom of the case on the front is very thin and broke within one week of my purchase the case also does not completely close so the fit is too tight for the iphone 3 g i really like the way it looks i do not like the way it fits,55,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case is great pros durable not flimsy the colors are not to loud and bright it is not slippery like some of the others also this case has cloth lining the inside to protect the phone which is another plus cons covers the apple logo on the back of phone makes air bubbles near bottom of screen protector if you have one hard to put onhowever once on it is on it is nice and tight-if you have trouble the a1 accessories customer support team is great they replied to my email in exactly 20 mins with pics to help overall this is a great case and it protects your investment,110,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,I am on my second case so far the first one broke after four months and would not really fit back together luckily i could return it back to the at t store where i bought it for a second one but this one is starting to break as well after a few months it does not fit correctly decent protection breaks easilywears off where you hold it i had a red case and after a few months it looked orange,79,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,this case is great off the back looks good also but not to be used i purchased 2 off amazon with wear and tear after having it for about 6 months it cracked and then when i took it apart to glue it the tabs broke and stuck to the top part now it can not lock together i am now going to a rubber case my brother has one and it might be a little bulky and have the rubber stickiness but it is still in perfect condition the case and the phone after a year note a family member had the same case break bought them at the same time in the same spot by snagging in her purse bottom lip under the home button it also scratches the back did not matter to me you have been warned like the other reviews that explain this,146,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,very nice case for iphone 3gs i love my iphone 3gs for a lot of reasons it is slim lightweight easy to hold so this case let us the iphone be all those things i had an otterbox case that was waaaaay too intense i understand it is a case to protect a very expensive device but really otterbox is a little too intense for me this one is slim but offers really good protection and it looks and feels good too a,80,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,when i bought this product i went through the reviews and it was regarded very highly however when i received it i was disappointed with the quality 1 from the beginning the pieces would not fit securely and would easily come out when i pull it out of my pockets 2 after a weeks usage one of the side locks broke 3 allows dust to settle at the back which in due time leaves scratches my recommendation search if you get something better however the only caveat is there is none,89,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the case is two pieces and it does not stay securely together there are tabs that tuck from one piece to underneath the other after 1 month they cracked and broke off because it does not stay together constantly causing stress on the tabs i have two friends who bought the same case for their iphones and had the same problem neat looking and feel but does not last do not waste your money,73,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,this case is beautiful however mine has already started peeling the rubberized surface and i only purchased it a couple of weeks ago i normally carry my ipod in a leather case so i do not know if that contributed to the peeling problem but I had be curious to know if anyone else has had problems with peeling,57,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i really was hoping this would work for me within one week one of the tabs broke off after pulling the phone out of my pocket and the bottom of the case came off now both sides of the bottom portion have pieces broken off i really liked the slim fit and the satiny insides wish it was more durable,60,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,nice finish smooth surface allow access to all buttons and connectors but quite difficult to put on the lock in the back does not allow the iphone to lay flat can not put it in a chargingw / it and lower corners push out the screen protection other than that i like it and will buy another when necessary,58,106
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the bottom black rim cracked on the front side of the case there is a small ri about 1/4 that spans the front bottom of the phone leaving about a two inchmy phone got damp one evening and i found thehad bled on the counter not a good value,53,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these an orange and black case and a red and black case i put the orange one on and the black tabs on the side broke off within a month so i put the red one on and emailed amazon about the orange they promptly replaced it and within a week of having the red one on the tabs broke off of this one also i emailed amazon again and instead of replacing this one i am returning it i just think the small tabs on the sides are to small and fragile that they brake too easily i liked the colors and the feel of the cases just not the design,116,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i had this case for two months it cracked where it connects together i never took it out of the case or dropped it,24,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,horrible product it is just like other users comment it is more fragile than the phone itself i have never dropped the phone but the side of the case broke in one month one week later the other side broke then the bottom thin bar broke i should research before i bought this when i bought the iphone i should not listen to the at t sales recommendation,67,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,nicely styled and functional case my only concern are the rather flimsy plastic tabs on the lower section of the case you need to be careful installing and reinstalling the bottom portion of the case to insure that the plastic tabs are properly position or there is a good chance they may break when you push the bottom half of the case into the top half that being said if you are careful it is not a great problem,79,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,both sides of the case cracked where they come together it also comes apart really easily for example every time i take it out of my pocket,26,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case the day i got my new 3gs at first glance i liked it a lot but after the first day the button on the back that is supposed to keep it together no longer worked at all as i pulled my phone from my pocket the case came apart and my phone went for a trip that i did not enjoy while it did protect the phone that was still covered the bottom half got scratched i would not use this case again if it was free also shortly after the button stopped working the little tabs that help hold it together snapped off and the thin plastic piece above the power jack completely broke off,118,113
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the case does a great job of protecting the iphone but if you want something that will last you better look elsewhere after 3 months of normal use the interlocking tabs that lock the two sections of the case together broke the case is now not functional,47,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought my red / black case with my iphone and it was put on for me in the store i tried to take it off a few days later to put the screen protector on and it took me close to an hour to get it off it looks like it would be easy to just press the button and pull it off but it is certainly not that simple i definitely struggled with this a few weeks after buying the phone i also noticed that my white designer sunglass case in my purse was tinted pink and realized that the red from my phone was rubbing off onto it on a positive note i dropped my phone in the grocery store a few weeks ago and the case did what it was supposed to do i do love the look of it and have gotten a lot of compliments on it i imagine i will not be able to switch cases or get it off again until i am ready to break the case or get a new phone but if you are not looking to change cases this may work for you,191,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have had this case for nearly 2 months now and love it great price too purchased the exact same thing when i bought my phone except in blue and it broke because i accidentally stepped on it replaced it with this one and it is worked as it should love the boldit has not faded since I have had it and it is been around the block or two and in and out of my pockets,75,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read these reviews before i bought 2 cases one for me and one for my husband i would have never bought this case kind of a shame because we like the way the case looks but 2 months later with normal wear and tear no droppings both cases are broken the black clips on both cases have broken off my husband has a black iphone and when he took his case off he discovered dirt and lint had scratched the back of his phone what a rip off this case is supposed to protect the phone not damage it do not buy,107,117
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got two of these cases one green for me and one pink for my wife our iphone 3 g fits nicely into the case feels great when grabbing them it has a look of rubber but the case is actually hard plastic my wife drop her iphone once and the case protects the iphone very well the cons would be that the upper part colored and the lower part black does not snap into each other very well i had to press the lower part very hard to make the upper part lock into position and the case is a little longer than the iphone less than 1 mm so that the iphone would slide a little within the case this does not bother me but the snapping problem is frustrating every time i took out the iphone and put it back in all if you are looking for something to protect the paint of your iphone this is a good choice,159,118
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it is a very stylish case for iphone fits perfectly well and i strongly recommend this for iphoners,18,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,protects phone nice looking slides in and out of pockets easily the only drawback is that it is two pieces and sometimes they slide apart,24,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,bought this case along with my iphone about two months ago at first it was okay but about a month later the black clips broke off now parts of the black section itself are starting to break off even although I have never dropped the phone the case also naturally causes the bottom corners of the screen protector to bubble up pretty terrible case if you bought it full price like i foolishly did,73,121
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a great case i wanted a case that added very little bulk to my iphone this case protects my iphone perfectly the only problem is that is so snug that screen protectors can get pushed off,38,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the new ifrogz cases are junk they do not hold together and the paint wears off them the old ones have none of these problems this provider had the old variety which after two months still looks and acts brandnew I have even dropped the phone a few times with no casulties,50,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,very sleek with high utility the red is very vibrant but not the type of finish that attracts fingerprints easy to use and great price,25,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this product is simply super i was lookign for a case for my iphone whe i came thru this the desing durability and toughness are just amazing now i do not have to worry about my iphone thanx to ifrogz,35,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,we have now been through three of these cases it every one of them the side catches that hold the two pieces together break it would be a decent case otherwise in addition after a month or so the paint begins to fleck and rub off the corners,47,126
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,after shopping around for cases for my new iphone 3gs in september i settled on the red ifrogz luxe case it is definitely nice looking and protective consisting of two parts that clip together and allow access to all of the buttons and ports on the phone unfortunately the good looks and functionality of this case only lasted about a month small pieces of plastic that are supposed to clip the two halves of the case together broke off quite easily and now the case no longer stays on the phone while taking it out of my pocket I have only had the device for a couple of months now and i think I am quite gentle with it never dropping it treating it roughly or excessively removing the case this thing is just not durable it is a shame because it does look nice,143,127
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,at first i was very pleased with the look and fit of this case i have had it about 3 months now and theis starting to chip off the case and the side tab has broken off i am not abusive at all with my phone but the case looks like i have had it for over a year it has openings in all the right places is easy put on and take off it is a good price and looks great at first when typing on the phone the back release button makes it unstable so it rocks a little,103,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i picked up this case because there has an orange one nice and because it isstick up just a hair from the glass screen offering some impact protection if it falls flat also the texture keeps it from collecting a lot of lint and whatnot from your pocket the downside is that i replaced it twice in the first two months of ownership the first one started tearing in an upper corner and the second one had a chunk snap off near the clips that slide together thankfully the store where i purchased the case offered a one year warranty at no-cost so they have replaced it for free but already my third one has hadscrape off the back i baby this thing and always keep it in a pocket by itself there has really no excuse for the thing to come apart / break / chip this easily,145,129
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i purchased this case about a month ago and i have already had to buy something different there are two bits that clip together on either side of the case holding the bottom and top together within 2 weeks both of these broke off essentially making this case useless since it will not hold together thehas also faded quite rapidly and scratched off too easily the case itself does not fit flush with the screen and causes the screen protector film to bubble in the bottom corners additionally the felt on the inside has permanently discolored my brand-new white 3gs one of my friends had the same case and experienced all of the same problems i am not rough with my phone and take very good care of it so it you are looking for anything reliable then this is not for you for the price of this absolute piece of rubbish there are many more cases available i suggest you keep looking it is a waste of money and you are going to need to buy something different in a few weeks anyhow,185,130
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case should be standard issue with the iphone best form and function of the 20 cases i have seen installed on the iphone good for 3 or 4 good hard falls on concrete from my 2 year olds hands i recommend it to anybody who wants to keep their phone in original condition,54,131
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i previously used a clear skin on my iphone combined with a pleather sleeve for over a year the sleeve wore out so i decided to try this case out the case itself is a pretty nice rubberized plastic and was a nice tight fit i kept the skin on it for added protection this case comes with a clear screen protector which is pretty necessary since the front is not protected the case comes in 2 pieces bottom and top that are clipped in the back by something that resembles a big button this is the part that adds a little bulk but nothing i would object too much to the only negative i can say about this case is that the rubberized material chips easily i bought the red / black cover and i can see thechipping away at small spots that may contact any loose change or anything else in my pocket I am careful so the chips are not anything big and most people would not notice it for the price and quality of this product overall i am satisfied,184,132
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this cover with my phone at the att store i liked the design of the cover and that there was virtually no lip between the cover and the screen however i really disappointed with this cover heres the main problems i have with it 1 it does not fit over my screen protecter very well one corner of the screen protecter keeps coming up 2 it is leaving marks on my phone when i took the cover off the other day i saw that it had rubbed the red coloring onto my phone luckily this wiped off but i do not like the fact that it is rubbing against the phone 3 this is my biggest problem with the case it does not stay on this case does not lock together and it is constantly coming apart i find that if put my phone in my pocket that when i pull it back up i end up pulling just the case and not the phone what good is a case if it is constantly coming off i do not like this case and would not suggest anyone to buy it i would suggest finding one that either slips over the phone like the gel type covers or one that truly snaps around the phone,210,133
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i bought my ifrogz case for my iphone 3gs in late august 2009 i loved the look glossy red with the matte black lower case it seemed to protect the phone well however about a month after i bought it i noticed that the clip that holds the black and red parts together had broken on one side the phone has never been dropped nor do i just toss it in my pocket it lives in a leather protective belt case last week around the first of november 2009 i noticed that the other side was broken and that the black part had cracked from the side of the round dot that connects it to the red part all the way to the bottom of the case it is now just held together by the sticker on the inside of the case i tend to baby my electronics my iphone replaced a 20 gb ipod photo that still works and looks nearly new so after just over four months i have to say I am not impressed with the way the ifrogz case is made nor with the way it held up i do have to say it is one of the better looking cases on the market and you might get lucky and have it last longer than i did,221,134
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,sure it looks nice the red and blue both great colors thescratches off easily the thin black part has broken the button that clips the two parts together has stopped holding now i often find one part is still in my pocket it lasted a couple months for me but heck if i start putting my 25 away every 2 months i can just keep getting new phones -p,71,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i find this to be an excellent product looks great without taking much away from the iphones sleek design gives good protection to the phone without adding much bulk if you want great protection which looks good with less sexy i find the speck products perform very well,48,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i paid 2999 for this at the att store at first i absolutely loved it after a couple of weeks the bottom black started to slide down frequently the black part was not interlocking properly after continuous movement the interlocking piece broke i purchased another one and the same thing happened i emailed ifrogz and they were great to send me another one but the same thing happened so three cases same thing I am done maybe it is not made for the gs oh and the scratching thing everyone talked about happened to me too,95,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought this case when i got my phone and was pretty happy with it until i took it off to clean my phone the back was scratched and the back of the phone was covered with dead skin and hair it was pretty nasty the bottom of my case broke a few weeks ago and the case was pretty useless after that good case for the first few weeks but now I am going to try a different one,79,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,it is a nice case and it looks really good but it broke several times i never dropped it or anything i would just take it out of my pocket and find that it had broken along one of the narrow bits near the volume button or theconnector superglue fixed it the first few times but eventually it broke in two places and a big chunk fell off i emailed ifrogz and they offered to replace it for free but i worry that if i do actually drop it it will not do much to protect the phone i bought a blue one of the same model as a gift at the same time and it is still in one piece so it is possible i got a crummy one judging from the reviews this is common although,136,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case looks works and feels great it has an attractive metallic look to it but a smooth grippy feel and it fits snugly and perfectly on the phone and offers pretty decent bump-protection for such a slim-line case the only negative I have found is wear I have only had the case a few weeks and the edges are starting to show some wear to the finish now i tend to put my case through a bit of wear-and-tear pulling it in and out of my pocket my bag and and a strap case on my bag several times a day but i would have expected the finish on this case to hold up just a bit better than it has all-in-all although it is a great case very attractive and very functional,132,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case because i wanted to purchase a sturdy reliable case for my iphones 3gs this case is terrible it not only let us in dust and dirt that will scratch the back of your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to fit together always come apart the plastic that the case is made from is also very brittle it eventually begins to chip away over time thus leaving areas of your phone exposed it is a terrible case and a waste of money,88,141
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is a great deal the case is stylish and feels comfortable in your hand i owned another case prior and wish i would have bought this one first,29,142
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,this case has a great feel to it it does not add any bulk to your phone but the case opens with just a little pressure for example when i plug in the charger it would open and if i take it out of my pocket at a slight angle it will open also one of the tabs that keeps it closed has broken off i will be buying a different case soon,72,143
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought both my wife and i one of these and we had a lot of trouble with the bottom portion coming off if the button on the back had a slightly more definedit would probably stay on on the other hand it did keep both of our phones 1 - 3 g 1 - 3gs well protected and looks nice if only the dang thing would stay on,66,144
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i got the ifrogz case when i purchased my iphone from att i was happy with it for about a week before it started to break like many of the other reviews mine also chipped away the pieces that are suppose to hold the case together broke off and scratched the back of my phone i am extremely careful with my phone but it did take a small fall to the ground 2 days ago about a 2 foot fall and the ifrogz case did absolutely nothing to protect it my iphone screen shattered i took the phone in to att and of course they did nothing besides sending me over to apple apple actually told me my phone broke due to the flimsy ifrogz case and they actually do not sell the case for this very reason it sucks to prove a point the apple guy took his iphone out of his pocket and hit it on the counter 4 - 5 times in a row to show me that a case should absorb impact and protect your phone he also shared his opinion that att should cover the cost to fix my screen since they sold me a faulty product I am still trying to work through that no luck yet not even after getting berated by the att employee in the middle of the store he did not like this,231,145
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i am a huge ifrogz lover so i am never disappointed with any of their products and this one is no exception it is sleek in design and pleasing to the eye very nice and dresses up my iphone nicely thanks ifrogz,41,146
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i have this case for little over 2 months and the front corner between the two colors has come apart i am disappointed this is the first case i have that last me less than a year,37,147
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,exactly same as they sell in at t store but at half the price strongly recommend,15,148
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,with all due respect to the people who said this was easy to put on i just can not get the two halves to fit together right absolutely no accompanying directions and the ifrogz website does not have anything either very frustrating,40,149
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this case is a complete piece of crap it looks pretty but the plastic is thin and it does not actually fit over the phone i tried to get it to work but the plastic is so flimsy that eventually it just bent it barely stays together even without the phone in it it is absolutely a complete waste of money if you are looking for a case that will actually work snap on and stay on try the inspiretech cases i have one and it works well,86,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,1 it is not actually metallic but a cheap plastic with a coating if i thought thewould last maybe but it just feels cheap 2 the hardshell requires you to slide it apart hence the big black button on the back to put the iphone in it this would work great if the case could not be pulled apart with the slightest pressure making keeping the case on the phone an issue i spent way more than amazon is charge on this thing and I am dumping it as soon as possible,88,151
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i had the case for two weeks before it broke it consists of two separate plastic pieces which never stay connected correctly every time i reached into my pocket they came apart causing me on multiple occasions to drop the phone eventually it broke completely when a tiny plastic piece that holds the two plastic pieces together broke i was able to return it to amazon,66,152
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love the red and black of the ifrogz luxe case it has a nice feel and grip to it without being at all bulky it allows you to see everything on the phone and keeps it quite safe i have not had any scratches or dust under the case and it is done a great job keeping my iphone in good condition my only issue with the case is that after having it for about six months it is gotten several dings in the red finish i think this is going to be common with any case after months of use so really it is not even a huge deal at this price I am happy to buy another one when this one is looking old and worn i have a few friends who have the ifrogz luxe case for their iphones as well I have seen pink blue and silver in person and the silver seems to hold up best against the chipping and scuffs all in all it is a great case that i have already recommended to friends,175,153
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got the cover in july right after purchasing the new gs iphone the plasticbelow the home button has broken off on the front side after three months other than this the case was great,37,154
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,I am a bit perplexed by some of the positive reviews of this product i have had my new iphone less than three months and in that time i have had two ifrogz cases being extremely careful and caring of my iphone i noticed the coloring / paint of the ifrogz case began to wear-away after only about one month my hands are never sweaty when handling my phone so I am not sure what would account for such quick wear other than poor construction and/or design my primary issue is with how these products break so very easily the first fell off the arm of my chair about two feet down onto a rug but cracked the corner of the casing completely and so i purchased another one as with the first i noticed how the bottom portion does not slide effortlessly into the top when fitting it onto the iphone the little wedges on either side which appear to be to help guide the black bottom section on break almost immediately i have one friend who repeats the exact same issue the second never did fit completely onto my iphone and again has begun to wear and discolor after only about a month / month and a half this is not a product for the iphone it does not give the phone either protection or a problem-free casing resolution purchase something else until ifrogz begins to offer better quality in their products,238,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i bought this case and it fits looks great the only thing is the plastic screen cover develops bubbles and gets filmy but easily wipes off good purchase although,29,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is the exact same case sold at the a and store for apporximately 3x times more than here it is the best looking case I have seen so far i like it a lot and have no problem recommending it to anyone that said it is not perfect dust and dirt can still get between the case and the phone and you should take it off every few days to clean it off else the dirt gets embedded in the black plastic back of the phone i wonder why apple did not continue to use aluminum like the original iphone also the bottom half of the case comes off fairly easily and the little tabs will break off before long one of mine did in the first week but it does not affect the performance of the case at all,134,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied with the ifrogz case for my iphone 3 g and would absolutely purchase another this is a hard she shall case not soft gel-like but it has a smooth almost velvety feel the smooth surface allows the phone to be easily pulled out of my pants pocket without sticking the case is composed of two pieces upper and lower that slide together and form a perfect fit to the iphone 3 g one of the reasons i wanted a case for the iphone was that the phone felt a little to slim in my hand this case adds just enough bulk yet the phone is still sleek and thin,110,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i like this case and have used it about five months i have dropped my iphone a handful of times with no damage last week i dropped my iphone while it was in this case and my screen cracked i am not sure if this case has enough shock absorption i am getting a new iphone and will get a new silicone case for it hopefully with better shock absorption,71,159
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a strong elegant case glides on and fits evenly and snugly some may even feel it fits too snugly the benefit of the snug fit is that helps prevent most dirt from getting under the case to be ground into and scratch the finish of your phone there is also a velvet pad on the inside back of the upper and lower pieces that keeps the case itself from scratching the phone this case is slim enough to fit into a holster and it is matte finish makes it easier to grab and comfortable to hold i can also say from experience the case also protects the phone impacts if dropped while the finish of the case remains pretty durable please note i can say this even after clumsily and most embarrassingly dropping my phone on tile concrete and asphalt the only negative i could see is that this case was nearly impossible to remove initially and is still truly difficult to remove this however is not much of a problem if you do not use ai remove my case only to clean my phone because i use a cable to charge and sync even video cables apple branded and generic composite cables work well with this case i am actually considering buying a second of anotheralso note that generic video cables no longer work with the iphone after os upgrade 30 but that is another review,242,160
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,nice case while it lasts i liked it until the finish started chipping off then little chunks of plastic fell off where the pieces came together finally after 4 months i had to put it in the trash where it belonged i am not a heavy user i never use all my monthly minutes and most of the time my phone was in a zipped pocket of my purse,69,161
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the good simply the best fit and texture of any case not too sticky like my solid rubber case but not too slick the bad after 2 weeks the finish silver one started to rub and peel off in various places 1 month after purchase the thin piece of plastic that spans above the charger port broke off 3 months later the top left portion of the case above the volume controls cracked when i pulled it from my pocket i never drop or abuse my phone it usually stays in my desk at work or pocket has potential to be great but uses very poor quality materials,112,162
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,pros this case looks awesome i have the blue and the metallic sheen it has is very cool i wish the whole case was thisinstead of just the top third it has a great feel to it too a slight velvety feel that sits in your hand nicely i also like how a thin strip of the chrome bezel shows through cons 1 the button on the back where the two pieces of the case lock together makes the phone rock when it is sitting on a table making it harder to type and navigate the touch screen 2 on my case the two pieces do not line up exactly when going on the bottom part and the top part do not sit over each other exactly as they should so i have to press one part down with my finger this also seems to prevent the button from locking all the way this issues has not limited the functionality of the case yet but i assume the it will get worse the more i take the case on and off if they offered this case without the button on the back allowing it to sit flat on a table it would be a 5-star plus product,205,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case in may and first the bottom part of the case broke about 2 months back and then the top developed a crack a couple of weeks later i do not throw around the iphone am very careful about handling it have been careful not keeping the phone with sharp objects keys and more in fact the phone is in my pocket book in a separate section so do not know what could have caused the case to break so soon disappointed,84,164
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i got this case when i bought my iphone and absolutely loved it i thought it was the best case since sliced bread i loved the way it looked and felt after about a month i went a bought one for my husband a few days later my case started falling apart literally pieces of the case just started falling off i am extremely careful with the case have never dropped it and even put it inside a sleeve inside my purse so it does not bang against other objects my husband was the first to notice little pieces chipping off only after a month and i could not believe it i called ifrogz and they agreed to replace the case after about 2 weeks and additional arguing with ifrogz the new case finally arrived but it was defective a piece on the back of the top part of the case that should lie flat is flipped up making it impossible to put it on my iphone and fit together at first i just thought it was fluke and maybe i had gotten a bad case but with the new case that does not work and my husbands new case starting to chip after only a month i am convinced it is a very shoddy product i have wasted 60 and have 2 cases that are terrible one that i can not use and the other beginning to chip what a waste,240,165
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,product exactly as described comes up higher than the screen face allowing you to set the phone screen-side down to prevent accidental damage from falling objects but without sitting on the screen itself easy to get on and off easy to clean grippy surface but without sticking to your clothes when putting in and out of your pocket would highly recommend,61,166
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got this cover in april for my new phone absolutely love it very slick thin fits well can access all button and ports i never take it off people ask me how i got a red / black phone it is so thin it does not look like a case very thinon the front does not wrap around and cover half the phone like others do very classy professional looking a mat finish not shiny i have dropped my phone a few times in the 5 months I have had it and the back ring around the button has broken off half of it so it is now a half moon and there is a chunk missing on one side where the 2 pieces come together only taken it off once when i had to take the phone in to be repaired the button on the bottom stopped working from dropping it maybe when i took off the cover 2 little pieces of the case fell out the tabs on either side my phone however was not scratched at all the back and sides are beautifully pristine not a mark or scratch the case is much easier to put on and off although now that the tabs and the ring are broken off still stays on the phone tight no slipping i would like to get another case since this one looks broken i have been searching and do not see any others that are as thin and upscale looking will probably just get another ifrogz in red / black,253,167
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love this case it is pretty nobody else has an iphone like mine it is super protection I have dropped this a few times with minor scratches the phone is just fine luckily i put the screen protector on because after the first time being in my pocket with house keys the screen protector is scratched better that than the screen the big draw back I am not actually sure how to get this cover off it is been on since the week i got my iphone the rigidity of the case prevents it from docking in the griffin am / fm radio charger i ended up getting a cheaper uglier version so that it docks okay I am very happy i got it,118,168
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the issue with the case is that the bottom half and top half do not actually click together so if it is in your pocket and your pants are even moderately form fitting when you pull out your phone half of your case will stay in your pocket not much use of a protective cover if it is not even on the moment you need it pulling the phone out of your pocket is the time that people accidently drop their phone the most it looks really nice but what has the point if it can not stay on,94,169
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,if your looking for a case that keeps you iphone completely protected you just found it easy to put on easy to take off who could ask for anything more,30,170
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this case is the best it was easy to install and it stays on i can put my iphone on my cars dashboard and it does not slide around but i can also slide into my pocket with ease plus it looks great highly recommended,44,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,very good cases one of my favorite but wish they made the same one for the 1 g iphone,18,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i replaced an older clear plastic agent 18 case with this one and am very happy this case fits snugly and the overall form of the phone with the case is almost exactly the same as the bare iphone 3 g so it is much sleeker than my old case the metallic-looking finish is not quite as glaringly bright as shown in the photo thegoes well with the iphone 3 g it comes with a screen protection film but i am not using it so i can not comment on how well that works very nice case,96,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the fit is very tight maybe too tight but the phone does not slide around at all in the case i tried a different case that was a little loose it broke during shipping and i bought one of these the button on the back that clips in is just a hair shy of being flush the case seems just a tad too small vertically but it stays put the case is hard to remove but i do not see myself removing it often it comes with a plastic screen protector it looks okay i suspect it would get scratched up pretty quickly i bought an invisible shield from zagg and put that on instead the case is a little grippy which is nice but it does not attract lint or make it too hard to pull out of a pocket access to buttons and ports is easy a buddy of mine bought two of these for him and his wife they enjoy them as well nice metallic finish to the upper part a flat black to the bottom,176,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,was really happy to find that amazon carried this product as i could not find it in the phone stores or mall vendors selling cases thewas a little darker than i anticipated but love the new one and the newhope you continue to carry these as i much prefer this case to any of the others as i can remove the lower section of the case for ease of inset into my i-phone player linda,79,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i do not know if this is any more than an okay product because i gave it as a specified gift i have not gotten any complaints yet so i assume it is okay,32,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,it is okay my son lik it and like theblue is hishe use it all the time,22,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i was looking for a 3gs case and not finding any that i thought were worth the money i am glad i purchased this product,25,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this case was everything that i ever had expect proects the phone pretty well i even dropped my phone in this case and it still did not break the phone,29,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,when i had my 3gs this was the case to have in my eyes it was nice thewas great and boy could it take a fall tumble out of the lap or just a slip of the fingers drops after several falls and the thingdid start to wear but what could you expect against concrete i loved this case 2 things i did not like was it allows dirt to get in the case and once it was on it was very very hard to take off but other than that loved,95,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i purchased this case when i first got my phone and i loved it when it broke two years later i decided to get the same one because the first had lasted me for so long they changed the durability of this case for the worse I have only had it a couple of months and it does not stay on my phone and has already cracked in two places it has not broken to the point where i can not use it anymore but considering how long my other one lasted it should not be broken at all I shall be getting my phone cases from a different manufacturer from now on,107,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i love this case i ordered it for my boyfriend who had a green one but wanted a change the blue is beautiful the case fits great and he used it for a long time with no issues before he gave it to the person who bought his phone when he upgraded i would recommend this brand to everyone the case feels so smooth and soft too and did not wear at all over time,75,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,I have owned two of these cases and i love the look and feel of them theis nice and dark and it has a nice texture that just feels nice it provides a decent grip but is still easy to slide in and out of your pocket unfortunately after a few months the paint builds up scratches and starts to peel off it can also be annoying to open and close the case if you need to remove it and the edges of the case sometimes push on the screen protector causing it to bubble up around the corners still I have tried several other cases and this is my favorite,111,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i have an older iphone and it was difficult to find a hard she shall to replace my really old one that had finally taken it is last drop it was so protective i wanted the same kind very happy with the pretty blue and am confident i can continue to be such a clutz without paying extra good deal,58,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,aesthetically i really love this case for my iphone it looks good and most importantly it is really smooth and does not tangle with whatever fabric your pockets are made out of the only downside is that parts of it chip really easily however even although the part that keeps the 2 pieces connected is chipped it still stays together with no hassle furthermore I have dropped my phone plenty of times and no damage yet to the phone all in all i love this case,83,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,impressed with customer service the case i wanted was out of stock so they contacted me and ended up sending me a more expensive case,25,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,between my daughter and i we have owned four of these cases in bluethey are very pretty at first with a rich deep blueand velvety soft texture however within a couple months of use they show scratches and the blue part has irregular fading to a lightermy daughters first ifrogz case cracked on the top left corner without being dropped both of ours were replaced at the cell phone store where we purchased them under warranty but they no longer have them in stock for the 3gs with that said i still like the case and if i can purchase it inexpensively i would just keep replacing it each time it fades out since i love the texture originaland two-part design,127,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,my wife this case for a year from when she had the iphone 3 g till the 4 came out absolutely no issues with it,24,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i was pleased how it looked on my phone and the price was good also but you get what you pay for the damn thing fell apart in less than a month it is a very flimsy case do not waste your time or money buying it,45,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i bought this ifrogz case december 2010 and now june 2011 the paint is coming off the case and this is the second 1 i bought the first 1 the paint was coming off and the bottom bar broke and 1 of the clips that hold the case together broke now all I am trying to say it is not worth 10 dollars,61,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,my iphone came with an ifrogz case when bought used but the case has always felt new and I have bought a second one missing one star because as others have pointed out theis painted on although i see only the tiniest of losses 2 mm in size around the headphone jack i particularly like how wide open the bottom is better for docking than many alternatives that are very thick around the 20-pin connector on the phone it is worth giving up a little bit of protection for a whole lot of convenience,93,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i bought one of these a little more than a month ago it looked and felt great when i bought it but it has already broken in 2 places from mild regular use I am ordering a new case made by a different company stay away is not it interesting that you have to give all these items at least one star in order to rate them please remove my mandatory star,70,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this product is excellent it fits the iphone 3gs like a glove looks stylish and feels great it make holding the iphone feel secure and comfortable this is the second ifrogz luxe case i have purchased for my phone this one is to have a different,47,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,had this case for a year now am in the market for a new one it will not be this model again had the blue / black for my 3 g thestarted to fade on it within the 2nd month the blue is now a dull blue gray and there are parts where the paint has faded / peeled down to what looks like a silver base protection was pretty good it did not break or fall apart the few times it fell overall gets a 4 for protection a two for retaining it is,91,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this is the only case I have ever liked loved the price and it is not fading like other cases I have seen,20,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i was fairly disappointed with this case first off i found that the case was more delicate than the phone itself preventing it from performing it is function very well less than a month of use one of the tabs that hold the two parts of the case together broke off just from taking the case off because of this it sometimes comes off when i take it out of my pocket also part of thenear the tabs began to chip off as well the case seems to be much more flimsy than it seems theis pretty nice but at some spots does not match it looked purplish at one spot but it seems cheap the paint around the circle on the back started to also chip off after less than a month one positive thing i can say about this case is that i got it for a cheaper price it was about 5 when i got it this case is good as a back up or temporary case if it is cheap but as I am writing this the price for this case is 18 at that price it is not worth it but if it drops again then it would be worth it if you do not intend to use it for long periods at a time,219,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,my daughter really loved this case in the picture however it never really closed tightly over her phone but the worst of it came later the lateral edges of the case where they hook into each other both cracked off i plan to return it if possible,47,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i ordered two of the blue frogz cases and one was broken when received being they were so cheap and it would cost more to ship we made it work the other one was fine,35,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,good cheap case I have it for months now and have not had any problems with them chipping or paint coming off and I am fairly abusive to my iphone I am an auto tech,31,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,well as other reviewers showed the tabs on mine broke a month ago it is however the brilliant nice blue as in the photo,24,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,it appears as although it is scratching the back of the iphone I am not very impressed i know for the money it is not much but you want to at least keep your phone in good condition,35,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,I have had thus now for only a month and just noticed that this cracked where the phone locks into the case,21,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,very effective case i have dropped several times and not done any damage to the phone one side of the casebroke off but i think it got snaged in my pocket not the cases fault well worth the price,41,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,so i bought this case because it was really inexpensive then what the original retail price was which is 3999 i believe but when i got it it would not stay on my phone it is supposed to stay together by the locking button mechanism on the back of the case but it did not so every time i took it out of my pocket only one part of the case would be on my phone and the other part would still be in my pocket so aggravating,85,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,the case itself is nice and good looking but as stated by other reviews the pins on the side are very fragile and break easily i have used the case for 1 month and both pins have already broke the good thing is that the case is still usable although i have to keep checking that it does not separate,59,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,a little hard getting installed until a teenager happened along to simplify beautiful blue admired by many i do not recall dropping but doing it is job and a great price,29,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i got the same case i had before at a cheaper price on amazon thanks,15,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this is a great it has an amazing but simple design it is simple to slip on and off it also makes my iphone 3gs look smaller this is orgasmic,30,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,the two pieces of the case do not snap together the button in the back is not tight at all you can easily pull the two pieces apart without pushing the button down I am still using it because it helps to protect the phone from scratches I am not so sure the case would do much if the phone was dropped accidentally,61,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i was initially very happy with this case it installed easily fit my iphone 3gs snugly and looked gorgeous the blue metallicwas nice and deep almost purplish but since I had consider myself a heavy iphone user particularly while i was nursing my daughter and stuck in one spot for hours at a time she would invariably fall asleep in my lap and any movement would wake her up i soon started to see a wear pattern in the metallic paint appear after only a couple of weeks the paint began to discolor to a gross yellowed tint around the portions of the phone where i tended to grip it most often mainly the sides after a few more months some of the paint began to chip off entirely revealing the ugly silver metal underneath i could not have been more disappointed for 30 I had expect a case to hold up better than that that said i give it three stars because it is protected my iphone reasonably well I have dropped the phone a number of times and there has nary a scratch on it I shall probably get another one when i hit the year mark since i see that amazon is selling this case for a fraction of the price I had originally paid for it,215,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,works great with the 3gs i downsized from the otterbox as i was having too much trouble getting it in / out of my pocket not a super-protective case but does it is expected job admirably the included screen protector is average but not outstanding all-in-all an excellent case for 5,48,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this clicked right on love the look and feel extremely happy with this all ports and openings are completely accessible no need to take the cover off except to change or put on the screen protector i am using this on a 3gs,43,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,these are great for the price but they do tend to break where the tabs hold the two halves together i barely had it a month just too long to return,32,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,the case may look aesthetically pleasing but it is a little too tight the case and it is awkward little bubble do well to protect the phone short of suffocating it after only a few weeks of use my case broke at the bottom front near the docking area by an even split after using it like that the bottom front portion just plain broke off i would recommend instead to use a soft rubber case that elastically fits and protects the phone also not using a case at all is usually fine because the most fragile part of the phone the front glass can not be covered because that would make it useless,111,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,the case is strong and sturdy but there are three issues 1 the case left a blue trace on my phone 2 putting it on makes the corner of my screen protector come off 3 it is heavy which makes your phone look big the only upside of those case is that it protects the silver lining on the sides of my screen from scuffing which most cases do not i am not very happy and have stopped using it after a month,82,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i bought thisafter seeing it in the retail store for much more however upon receipt of this ifrogz case i discovered that it is either an old model or a fake i ended up buying the more expensive retail one after all and this one is not the same it is very hard to close the case around the phone the tabs on the side of the case are nearly impossible to interlock do not buy this product,80,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this is the worst case ever in the past i ordered my ifrogz case from ifrogz directly lasted for about 6 months this time i ordered from amazon cost 75 less but the quality was horrible returned mine the same day it seemed that the thickness was cut by half shame on you amazon for selling such low quality goods,61,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,nice looking case until several weeks later when thecoating bubbles and rubs off not worth wasting your money on,21,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i bought this case when i first bought my white iphone 3gs in nov 2009 this case will protect your iphone from falls there is no doubt about that unfortunately thefades and the grip on the lower section has been worn down to smooth plastic the really bad thing is the case scratches the metal lip around the iphone and does leave blue marking on the back of the phone i am only recommending a 3 because of the protection from falls otherwise if you like your electronics to keep that nice new look like i do this is not the case for you,106,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this case may be fine if your never going to remove the bottom piece toit but this case is designed to be docked but is not able to withstand even modest repetition of the docking process i have had two of these and on both the wings on the bottom section needed for docking broke off in less than a week because they are so flimsily designed save your money look elsewhere for a dockable case,77,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,both my husband and i have this case and both of us are missing complete chunks of the case the bottom piece near the charger splintered off almost immediately followed by the pieces where the case comes together after only a month the case would not even hold together anymore it would be one thing if i abused my phone but all of this happened and I had never even dropped it and my husbands case broke in exactly the same places,81,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i had actually bought the blue / black case at best buy for 30 only to see online that they were going for 4 now on amazon when the cases arrived today i ordered two different colors with the intention to return the expensive best buy one the cases did not fit at all the little tabs on the side that are supposed to lock the phone in did not fit at all and the ifrogz case i bought at best buy actually did not have those tabs at all and it fits perfectly and has yet to give me any problems I am not sure if these are older models but the ones from here do not fit my 16 gb white iphone 3gs i was very disappointed and will be returning them tomorrow the one i did get from best buy however is wonderful except for the price no problems sliding it on and off there is a little bit of blue dust on it when i checked the phone after reading the reviews on here but nothing that has stained my phone yet,179,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i got this for my wifes iphone 3 g it snaps into place and then stays secure the blueis very pretty incredible price too compared to 25 in stores,30,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,nice looks for the blue and grey case however the very thin pins that mate at the edges both broke within a month or so then the latch began giving way when i pulled it out of my pock and ended up holding only half of the case with the phone bouncing on the sidewalk i bought something else and threw this away,63,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this case definitely deserves a higher rating than the 3 stars it has no it is not perfect but it is the best case I have found yet in terms of style against function first of all i want to note that this is one of the few iphone cases that does not have that stupid hole cut out in the rear to show off the apple logo that hole completely ruins the aesthetic appeal of most cases around the apple logo really is not that important the fact that this case does not have that hole single-handedly prompted me to get this case before any others as far as durability the other review are correct in that the two small tabs on either side and the thin lower plastic bar across the lower front of the phone are flimsy and break off quickly this is my second ifrogz luxe case the first one i had those pieces broke off but I have had this new one for a month or so and they are still intact even so this case is still worth buying especially at the low price on amazon,185,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,like many others have said this product has 2 side prongs that are supposed to brace the case when it has a phone inside of it these little prongs break very easily and when both break you are done one was broke upon arrival but with some super glue and a gentle hand i was able to place my wifes phone into it since she does not change cases at all this will do for her me on the other hand i change cases very often and this just will not do i like frogz but case crown is a better case,100,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i was really happy with the cellular phone case it was just what i wanted it came very fast,19,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i purchased this product and i got what i paid for a few months of decent service just try something else,21,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this case causes cosmetic damage apple store to the back bezel of the iphone it scratches up the corners of the phone and instead of protecting damages the phone,29,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,nice sleek case but i wonder if the people that design this case actually even use it slowly i have discovered that with this case on a lot of the peripherals do not fit for example will not fit in my docking station chill pill mic will not fit kind if irritating as i really like the case i have had several mp3 players down the years all with cases and this is the first case i have ever owned that had this problem please test your product before selling it,88,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i would not bother with this case this was my first case and within one week i noticed that thestarted to come off of the front surface where it is handled frequently it started leaving blue marks on my face when i talked on the phone i read another review of a user who purchased a white iphone and noticedtransfer on the white phone itself not good if you wanted a white phone the case fits well and is easy to remove if you want to but because theis painted on and wears off i would not bother with this one i wanted a more protective case than this one and ordered an otterbox defender case for iphone 3 g 3 g s black i highly recommend it it does make the phone larger but i have dropped it twice from about 5 feet to asphalt / concrete and have no problems i also like the rubber cover it keeps the phone from slipping out of your pocket and getting lost,176,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i really really liked this case until the plastic tabs on the side broke once that happened if would not stay properly in place and then completely broke,26,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i love so many things about this cover texture aesthetics protection port accessibility are all perfect however i have two of these cases and on both the little tabs underneath the black portion of the case have broken these tabs are supposed to help the case fit together which they do until you take take the case off a few times to switch colors and then they start to break once they are broken the case will barely stay on I am very disappointed because i paid full price for these cases in the at t store do not waste your money even 5 is not worth it,105,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this product is pretty cool but it is kind of wide at the bottom part of it,16,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i bought this case for 3gs the shipment was on time and the quality of the product was good,18,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,product came very quickly was an almost perfect quality but a few little glitches overall really great,17,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,slim case that feels right to the hand and fits easily into pocket or purse very durable and shock resistant have inadvertently tested on paved surfaces with no damage to phone,31,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this is my second ifrogz luxe case the first one faded over time i paid a fraction of the cost on amazon for this one compared to what i paid at the at t store i like the case so much that i recently purchased one in green,47,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,case fits and protects well but now after five months the finish on the outside is wearing off around all the edges very unattractive also the button / snap on the back prevents it from lying flat which means that i can not just lay it down to check the level of our camper i have to hold it up ongood looking for a while pretty ratty looking now,67,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,while this may not be the best case you can get for your iphone it is certainly the best case you can get for your iphone for only 800 I have had mine for about four months and my phone which gets relatively hard use is perfect no scratches on it is back notransfer one review said thewas painted on but I am pretty sure my red cover is molded out of a red material it looks great it works great it is great,85,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,okay so i love the look of it with the metallicand the black and i like that it protects the corners but the way that the two pieces connect to each other is totally flawed within the first week of having the case one of the tiny fragile plastic pieces snapped off the side and within a week later the other one did making the case completely useless please note that i keep my phone in my pocket and i am very gentle with it as well also after taking off the case i had scratches on the phone that were not there before using it boo the cost of theis cheap and unfortunately so is the make,122,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,when i saw this case i knew i wanted it but would not pay the 30 at the at t store and i am glad i did not this case looks good and with it being the same company that the at t store sells i thought it was a no brainer however everytime i take it out of my pocket the bottom portion the black comes off especially when wearing jeans i had this problem since day one i do not know if anyone else has had this problem so if not and i just got a lemon then i would say to buy it protects the phone well and looks good but if this is happening to other people I had say stay away,119,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i bought this case about 8 months ago and have been using it ever since the case is good in many ways great design goodgood material good protection and great price thewears off a little bit along the edges over time but not a big deal there is only one major problem the two pieces does not lock tightly the top piece keep sliding off from the phone and this is getting worse over time whenever i try to get my phone out of pocket i grabbed the case and it is sliding off this also creates another problem since it constantly coming off-on a lot of dirt and dust will go between the phone and the case every now and then i have to remove the case and clean my phone and there is a lot of dust on the phone i finally decided not to tolerate it any more i ordered a switcheasy vulcan and waiting for it to replace the ifrogz i hope ifrogz can make a improvement over the locking mechanism otherwise i will suggest not to touch it,187,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i really liked this ifrogz luxe case for my iphone when i first received it unfortunately it did not take long for scratches to appear on the upper half of it on the back also after about three months the plastic started to chip away where the top meets the bottom on the front of the case and i had to replace it,62,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i ordered an ifrogz luxe case to replace my original after 7 months of use this one lasted about 6 weeks it did not fit my phone perfectly out of the box and the thin plastic tabs on each side of the case snap off easily exactly what happened to my original i should have learned the first time the thin plastic tabs just do not seem to click together the way they are supposed to and once they snap off the case is useless this has been with normal use no drops nothing unusual i purchased an otter box to replace it and so far 2 weeks in I am much happier,110,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i never received theand waited longer than the allotted time to receive it however i was refunded the money promptly,22,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,my wife and i both have the ifrogz case for iphone 3 g it fits well and provides good protection i would buy it again,24,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,fantastic case light and thin very sturdy lovely bluegreat price phone slips into my pocket and is very protected i love it,24,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,I have had my ifrogz case for about 4 months from an at t store piece of junk plastic chunks chipped off of it within 2 months and the entire piece on the top side just above the charger is gone also thepaint has worn off on all corners the two pieces of the case keep coming off due to plastic chunks breaking off where they join total piece of junk do not buy good luck,78,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,very poor product I am going to after a few days use the metallic finish began rubbing off from being carried in my briefcase after 6 months the plastic case broke in two places the phone and case were never dropped and typically carried inside of a briefcase the only good news is that it is relatively inexpensive,55,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,this case is nice overall the feel of the case is smooth with just enough texture to keep it in your hand the film / texture is beginning to come off the top of mine near the headphone jack but it is hardly noticeable the only issue i have now is the bottom piece no longer secures tightly to the sides of my phone and it does not feel as sturdy as it first did when i bought the case a month ago,80,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,worst case ever it was the because of my iphone shattering it is made out of cheap plastic and has a poor design so that the clips that hold the two pieces together cracked then it would not stay together very well until one day i pulled my phone out of my pocket and the pieces separated sending my phone to the ground i was left with just half of this crappy case in my hand and a shattered iphone on the ground total cost of this case 13 for the case and 200 for screen replacement 213 dollars for a broken piece of junk i should have listened to the other reviews that warned of it breaking at the clips and coming apart do not make the same expensive mistake as me look elsewhere for a case that actually protects your phone,142,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,do not even bother i have had this case for 4 months and where the case meets when you close it pieces broke off,23,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,these look cool and fit the phone nicely but the thin plastic bar along the bottom of the phone between the jack and where you speak into is prone to cracking and snapping off i tried crazy glue but it kept coming off currently shopping for a new case,49,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,these cases look and feel great but they break relatively easy i am on my third on in 6 months everything about them is great just wish the tabs that hold it on were more durable that was the first thing to break also dropping the second one irreparably cracked it,51,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this started chipping the moment i put it on and came loose all the time most recently the top flew off as i was handing the phone to someone causing me to drop the phone onto a tile floor needless to say i would rather have no case than one that comes off all the time trash,57,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,loved the case but it connects with two very small tabs that fit very tightly into the top half half the time the tabs slip outside when closing the case and a little too much pressure and the tab breaks lasted a couple of months and the case is now useless highly recommend incase cases which slip together with a much more secure connection,64,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,when i bought my iphone 3gs in july i ordered one of these cases because a friend had one it was great that case saved my phone on a number of occasions after taking too much abuse the corner cracked and it started to hang up in my pocket i bought a new one to replace it and the new one stinks it is a looser fit so the case wiggles around the phone and the plastic is not as rigid contributing to the loose fit in addition the side fingers that locked the upper and lower pieces together are gone so the corners of the lower piece now grab my pocket every time i take it out without the locking fingers the pieces are not tight together anymore ifrogz took a wonderful case and improved it so much they ruined it,141,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,this is a great case if you only want it to last a few months i have been very careful with it and it has started to come apart i have a friend who has the same case and it also is coming apart the bottom plastic covering is thin and just can not withstand the test of time the snap that holds the two piece cover together has fallen off i do not recommend this case or any product that only last a few months,85,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this case is just aweful within a week of purchase it was broken it does not fit the phone well at all the two halves never quite fit together with the phone in it the case is also very fragile i am not hard on my phone at all but this case is completely distroyed the pressure tabs on the sides that hold it together have broken off both sides top and bottom pieces as well as on the back next to the tab that clicks them together also theon the top half is painted on and yes it rubs off plain and simple this case is junk,109,89
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i have had this case for only 3 months two other family members also bought this case none of us abuse our phones-they are usually in a padded purse pocket or a slot on a car dashboard all three of us need to replace the case for the same reason-the bottom portion of the she shall broke along the side where it is designed to click into the top portion not just cracked-splintered in long shards,75,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,at first this cover may seem great but do not be fooled I have owned two covers of the ifrogz covers for over 4 months the first one cracked on the side where the bottom fits to the top piece i thought this may have been a fluke since i dropped the phone a few innocent times i bought a 2nd one and the same thing occurred without dropping it the cracks make the cover slide off easily and not fit properly also the way the bottom piece fits on the front of the phone the corners that cover the edges because the screen protector to lift up allowing dust and dirt particles to collect on the screen and scratch it save your money and buy a better cover,127,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,this case is terrible it has already broken in two places it barely stays together and i have not dropped it once there are much better cases i recommend a gel case,31,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i purchase this case as an alternative to my current case i like the sleek design and ease of use it has protected my iphone beautifully so far,28,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,the frogz case for iphone 3g/3gs provides a thin layer of protection that is more cosmetic than structural I have had this case for six 6 months i handle my cell phone with significant caution I have dropped the phone once maybe twice with this case on the phone landed flat not on a corner still the plastic tabs on the side of the case broke i hoped that the case would have survived more than just a few drops theis cool i get comments and for a pretty cautious user this is actually a pretty decent case in the past my biggest problem has been that the lens of the camera gets scratched as the phone jostles in the pocket this cases is just thick enough to have prevented damage the real test is whether I had buy this case again in fact I am disappointed enough to shop around for another,151,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i purchased this case for my iphone 3gs and it has never fit correctly the corners of the case put pressure on the screen protector causing it to bubble and lift up this allows dust and debis to get under the screen protector which if you are ocd about dust and imperfections like i am will drive you nuts the worst part is the two pieces of the case do not hold together well now every time i take it out of my pocket i leave half the case behind there are tabs on the side that are supposed to hold the case parts together but those broke off in short order and now the case falls apart when you try to plug in to recharge or put in head phones my husband has the same case in anotherand his is doing the same thing,146,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,great look but the design of the two pieces breaks rather easily and it allows dirt into the case that scratches the phone i have never had my case off the phone other then to clean it and there are scracthes on the phone the pieces come apart when pulling out of your pocket and the tabs that lock the pieces together have broken on my wifes and two coworkers we spent 30 on it had i spent 9 i would not be writing this review,85,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i bought two of these covers one for my iphone and the other one is for my hubbys they both broke after a month of use or so but because they look good we decided to give it another try the second i got is okay so far,48,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i first saw these when someone in our office bought one for their personal iphone it is a very sleek looking case not like some of the cheesy plastic or silicon ones it is got a sheen to it that looks very classy all of the colors are very nice and come across very classy my problem with the iphone has been that while it needs protecting i hate the usual cases as they either add too much bulk or they do not slide in and out of a pocket easily i think these offer a middle of the road solution to both not too bulky and while not slippery are not as sticky as the silicon types overall if you end up getting one of these expect a lot of ooohh that is cool where did you get that reactions from people,138,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i was uncertain about the durablitiy at first and the screen locking into place but it has proved to be very pleasing very timely and in great condition,28,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,sleek and easy works great not overly flashy and barely changes the size of the phone all buttons are easy to access highly recommend,24,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this is my first time using an ifrogz case i was somewhat surprised the colors blue / black has a nice luster i love the grip feeling to it the case was precisely cut to fit the iphone the only negative comment i have is the button to release the case you have to press down on the black and pull up on the blue to take the case off other than that I am happy with my purchase,76,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i purchased this with my phone in late august it lasted until mid-october before both of the teeth on the bottom half broke off which basically makes the entire cover come apart on it is own whim this is not worth the money and i will definitely not purchase this again,50,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,love the look and feel but I have been through two cases now because they break so easily they also because the protective shield to bubble up in the corners and the case causes wearing on the corners of my iphone again love the look but I have got to get something that will last more than a month or two,59,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i initially really liked this case a lot it fit very well and did not add much bulk to the phone plus it looks nice it easily fit in my jeans pocket however after about a month it is seems to come apart and fall off much more easily even for the price that is a pretty short time it also looks pretty worn i never dropped it but only kept it in my pocket and on my nightstand I am going to look for a better case,85,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,very cheaply made the blue coating scratched off after less than 2 weeks of use after one month the two pieces do not stay together very well and I am constantly pulling the phone out of my purse missing one half of the case even worse because the case keeps coming apart both connecting tabs have broken off and i pinch my fingers in the gaps they left i treat my phone very conservatively and i do not see how i could have prevented this if you buy this case remember to keep the box you can claim warranty but only if you have the original packaging,104,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,I am particular about iphone cases i really like this one as it has the right combination of accessibility to the screen and the iphone functions and is very attractive and protective that said the beautiful bluechips easily not just from dropping i think but from regular wear and tear the paint seems to be wearing off along theof the case next to the screen where i touch it all the time that began probably in less than a month it was really inexpensive on amazon although so i think it might be worth it to me to buy a new one from time to time to replace it in fact for the price of most comparable cases you can buy three of these,128,106
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,after looking at many options landed on this case for under 15 i think it is great and after reading some bad reviews felt compelled to speak out I have had my iphone for 9 months now i am a extremely hard user i have dropped my phone several times and the case has always taken it constantly in and out of my pocket the case took the abuse and shows it there are scraps and scuffs all over the black plastic clips have broken off that attach the 2 halves together but they still stay together it is now time for a new case and while I am at it a newi think for 10 these are a steal in fact maybe I shall get 2 it only gets 4 stars because the black clips broke,134,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,so i read through all these reviews and was concerned about all the problems people were saying that the tabs on the sides break thefades that the bottom slips off easily so i was a little wary to buy however the case is so great looking and cheap that i decided to buy anyway and the case is great I have had it for a couple of months now and have had none of the problems others have possibly the manufacturer fixed the flaws nofading no tabs breaking and the case stays snapped together pretty tight i also take the bottom of the case off every night tomy iphone and everything still fits tight and snug also i was fumbling with a bunch of bags the other day and my phone dropped right out of my hand onto the hard floor the case came apart when it hit the ground but it did not break chip or anything and my phone did not have a scratch on it would definitely recommend great looking case and it was able to protect my iphone from a pretty hard fall,190,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,nice cover i always wanted this cover but it was so expensive luckily i saw it on amazon and bought it for just 10 dollars protects my i phone really well,31,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this case protects and is beautiful some of my friends have the same case and it stays looking great and protects well,22,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,but it offers protection from dropping be careful when you put it on because if you break the clip on the bottom / black portion then it will not stay on very well i like the texture and it slides in and out of my pocket well i bought this one because my last one was a pain in the neck to get on and off,63,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the case is nice and slim and attractive it adds about the minimum bulk and weight to the iphone that you could expect the blue metallicis nice and since it is not rubber it does not attract lint i searched everywhere for the advertised included screen protector it was inside the cardboard that looks like a skeleton of the iphone,60,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,this case is very good looking and fits very well at first but after 4 months of standardl use being kept in a pocket byitselfthe blue started to fade scratches began to surface exposing the silverish gray plastic and the thin strip that runs below the home button broke off along with one of the tabs on the inside that holds the two halves together iit worked great while it lasted but now i find myself shopping for a replacement the quality of the materials is just not seem to be durable enough for even casual use over a moderate period of time,105,113
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i am really impressed with this cover not only does it look great the blueis beautiful but it fits like a glove and does what it was made to do protect my phone my phone took an accidental fall onto the sidewalk from chest-hight and while the cover did not survive the fall got a nasty crack in the bottom black half the phone survived the accident unscathed and at the price i paid for the case I am absolutely buying another,82,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,overall this is a very nice case it is sleek fits the phone very well and i do think it helps protect it additionally it does have a nice feel too it and helps me grip the phone however after a few months cracks started appearing all over the case especially around where the two halfs connect now the case is starting to fall apart and i have had to look for a new case in case you are wondering what kind of owner i am i had an original iphone that i kept for two years no problems never had to replace the case i do take my phone everywhere but i have never dropped this phone it has fallen off my nightstand a few times but that was it the case does what it does it protects the phone but it is not made for the long-term,148,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i suspect that most of the glowing reviews of this product were written within a week of buying it i loved this case when i first bought it after a month or two the two pieces would not hold together i bought a new one blaming myself for the first problem thinking that i was too rough with my phone after another month of having a second one of these it too has fallen apart fail,75,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,I have had three cases for my iphone this is the worst of the three the only pro it is cheap cons very poor fit it slides on sloppy and you have to be careful all the little tabs fit in together correctly one of the side tabs partially snapped off the first time i put it together the plastic was so thin it almost seemed like manufacturing scrap rather than integral to the case the black paint began flaking off after about a month of pocket use the thin piece at the bottom of the phone by the home button snapped because it did not fit snuggly against the phone due to the poor fit sometimes when grabbing the phone out of my pocket the case would separate the poor fit let us in a lot of dust and lint i never once dropped the phone with this case on so all of those issues were just normal use as there are some good reviews for this case it appears they might have very poor manufacturing tolerances because some people seem to get a snug fit while mine in particular fit horribly take a look at the seidio case it even comes in a similar blue and for 10 - 12 more it will last a lot longer and look a lot better,218,117
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,when i received my blue ifrogz case it fit greatstunning and i loved it after about a months use one side of where it connects broke i thought perhaps it was just from pushing the case on wrong in my pocket well then the other side decided to break and i was keeping it in my hoodie instead of jeans pocket so i knew the case was not coming on and off at all so now i currently have a piece of black electrical tape holding the bottom black piece to my phone and then slid the blue top piece over top of the tape so far so good but I am still disappointed with the cracks and missing pieces on both sides of my case new case ordered different brand sorry ifrogz but durability is a biggie and you just do not have it,146,118
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,when your talking about a 300 dollar phone the money should not really be an issue when it comes to the case if you can not afford the extra 20 - 40 dollars for a good case then do not buy an iphone this case worked well for me for a while then my phone fell out of my pocket and hit the concrete now it has scratches on it and the two little pegs that hold the case together snapped if you are going to buy a case for the iphone i recommend getting something of quality,92,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i really want to like this case it looks great and protects pretty well it is also a fairly reasonable price but as several other reviewers have pointed out the design is terrible the case never slides fully closed it always seems to be just a hair short of locked it also does not cover the chrome ring on the phone but the worst thing is the thin fingers on the bottom of the case that slide into the top usually to keep it locked they are beyond fragile and unless lined up exactly right break when you try and slide the case closed I have tried two cases now and this will be my last because of this you do not even have to slide the case all the way off if it even slips open a bit since it never fully locks and then gets pushed closed the fingers will break if the manufacturer would beef these up a bit or change the mechanism this would be the best case around update i contacted ifrogz and even although i had not purchased the case directly from them they offered to send me a new one best of all the case has been redesigned and does not have the fingers to break off and it fits much more tightly I have only had it for a few days but it seems to be a much better design thanks ifrogz,235,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i bought this one with my iphone 3gs and initially i loved the case it has an inner pad that protects the iphone from being scratched from the case slim fitting pretty good i thought but then i noticed after getting the case wet it was in my gym bag the paint on the case started cracking i was surprised thewas just painted on kind of cheap if you ask me although it is only 10 then a part of the case itself cracked off i am very careful with my iphone so this was due to normal use I am looking for an alternative,106,121
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,it serves it is basic purpose and looks cool 1 i am using over 2 months and the blueis still there i did not expect it to last 2 for the protection factor i am not very sure of although it keeps the back of the iphone from scratches a protective cover for the front also comes with the deal that makes this combo really cheap 2 such front covers itself cost 15 at apple store where this is 10 some shipping cost 3 it is size and stuff are perfect for the iphone that is the cuts and holes are properly made so that it is easy to work with the iphone buttons 4 for the looks it is definitely beautiful and by far the best looking cover for the iphone I have seen,131,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this product is not worth your money it broke on me in one week it broke on the black part on the bottom side because it could not take the pressure of the case on the phone so it crack in three places and it did not work anymore so i would advise to look for a different case that is not made in the same way as this one,68,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i purchased this case a little over a month ago i had read reviews on theprior to purchasing but was not too concerned when i received the product i simply decided not to use the screen protector because of what others have posted i have had absolutely no issues with this cover in fact i dropped my phone and rather than the phone catching the scratches the cover did i also had no problem with the fit of this product you will not be disappointed if you decide to purchase thisi purchased the pink / black cover,97,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i got this case when i purchased my iphone i loved theand how tightly it fit however i had the case for a week when i noticed it was starting to almost peel on the sides it was very strange i returned it and the person said they had never seen that happen before they gave me another one no peeling this time but i have noticed thehas faded so much and now it is a weird light blue / green / goldother than the two issues i had with this case I have loved it it has really protected my phone given it a couple scratches on the back but that is okay,115,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i upgraded to an iphone 3gs and picked out this case for the way it looks it is a nice design i like the colors and it feels good however i quickly found a few issues with it 1 the screen protector is a film that is placed on the screen i had issues getting it on without a lot of bubbles but finally achieved that but when i put the outer she shall on it caused the corners to bubble up plus i did not like how the screen looked with it on so i ended up removing it 2 the case comes in two pieces that lock together in the back with a round button like object it is raised up slightly so when i lay the phone down it wobbles a bit not bad but just enough to be annoying 3 on the back of the case where the case comes together there is a small plastic lip that bent up slightly and made the case difficult to get together i finally got it on but the bottom lip is a little chewed up 4 possibly because of 3 everytime i go to unplug my phone from the charger or computer the case comes apart and i have to wrestle the ends back together and run into number 3 again overall it had a nice look but after a week of using it I have already discarded it and am looking for another case,242,126
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i bought this case when i bought my iphone early this year the case broke a couple of days but still provides adequate protection I have ordered a new one just like it i looks good feels good in my hand and does not cost much meets my expectations,47,127
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i bought one of these for my new iphone 3 g a year ago since i am likely someday to be reported for cell phone abuse between my pockets poor juggling skills and children entertained by the phone i knew this thing would not last long the case looks pretty nice a kind of a muted metallic sheen with good access to buttons camera headphone jack and sync port the ifrogz logo is understated black on black near the bottom of the back surface and much less blatant than some other cases i found it has a somewhat rubberized texture that does not slide around when you set the phone down the screen protector was ok nothing great and it did not seem to mess up the screen input so what happened one year later it is been dropped on concrete scratched by pocketed car keys and tossed by kids it is got scratches on the back and a few small chips of coating have come off the screen protector keeps getting more bubbles in it and looks a little smudgy but the phone is still unscratched and generally seems to work there has some battery discharge problems so apple tech support is switching out the phone for me barely under warranty and I am buying a new case for it that does not have scratches I had probably list it as 45 stars only slightly knocked down for not being indestructible but really a great case especially for the price I had recommend checking it out,246,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,nice neat clean not too thick not too sticky for pocket looks like it protects phone well enough while maintaining relatively easy access to function switches and it is pretty only drawback is that the case snaps are not too positive so the two halves separate too easily i super glued the flimsy tabs and i might break the case when i have to remove the phone,67,129
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i loved the original 3 g iphone cases by ifrogz inexpensive easy to use great tactile feel and solid feel they maintained all these aspects except now the solid feel and finish is gone replaced by flimsy poorly finished plastic so sad try the marware sportshell as a much more capable replacement although significantly more expensive,55,130
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,since may i have had to replace these twice they crack easily at the connection between the parts and break too easily I am buying something else,26,131
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,when i first bought this case i really liked it is matte finish however the small piece of plastic on the bottom of the case is not strong and broke off after only two months also the two halves are not very tight so if you are pulling your phone constantly out of your pockets one half usually slides off in the process i would definitely not recommend this case because even although it may seem nice at first it does not last long,81,132
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed when this case broke off less than a month after i got it even although i took care of it very well it kept opening up everytime i pull it outta my pocket the colors faded away and all of that happened without dropping it a single time in a nutshell very poor case skip it,60,133
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,the case fits perfectly and besides the fact the inner paint wears off eventually it is quite great i have had this case for at least 7 months and my phone has hit the ground several times and still works perfectly small parts have broken such as the side grips and the lower bar close to the speakers but it is probably because of the damage it has received which has been quite big i highly recommend it for someone who wants to keep their expensive phone safe i just ordered case from another brand and i will check if the reviews are correct casecrown iphone 3 g 3gs soft polycarbonate slim fit case blue,115,134
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i bought one of these at a local frys and within the first week there were small scuffs on the back where thescratched off i have not carried it in a pocket with keys or change it mystifies me how this happened today while removing it from my pocket the small piece of plastic below the home button snapped i guess I shall be looking for a new case,69,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,the case is very nice looking and the paint seems to be lasting but unfortunately the case comes apart all the time the button piece on the bottom does not snap into place correctly due to it is depth it will crack from constantly being put the back together avoid this purchase,50,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,if you have a iphone and want to get this case buy it from amazon the same case at [ ] cost [ ] [ ] case fits very well on the iphone but the cool colors are not molded into the plastic it is a painted on finish that can / does rub off over time for [ ] that is not acceptable but for [ ] bucks i could live with that,65,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,you can spend a lot more on a iphone case but why would you great protection snug fit easy to put on and off and full screen access theis not common as most of the major stores do not carry these,42,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,looks good but it was broken in only a few days the connection was pretty week i do not want to spend time to return for 10 shopping but i will never use this cover forever,35,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i am now on my third case I am glad i got it at the at t store so i can just keep going back for exchanges until they let me have something else these cases fit great they look so nice then thewears off and then the black rubs off the front the one before this one even had pieces break off if you want to carry it in your purse it is probably fine if you want to continue to slide it in and out of your pocket then expect the same trouble I have had,96,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i have had this case for about three weeks now and the tab on one side that holds the two pieces together is already broken also the textured part of the black case is coming off leaving some shiny black portions that really do not look that good the case is more or less serving it is purpose but there are better cases on the market,64,141
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,if you are interested in this product then be sure to read the 3 star reviews i made the mistake of not doing that i do not know why they gave it 3 stars when they state obvious flaws that make the case not worth having my case broke after 2 weeks and i never even dropped it it is a snazzy looking case and looks nice on the phone but it has to many flaws it comes in 2 pieces and when you put it on your iphone it connects in the middle that is the biggest flaw most people hold their phone by the middle not the ends so when you grab the phone or move it around in your hand / pocket you tend to disconnect the pieces the other issue is the connecting flaps that plug into eachother to complete the case they are flimsy and will break easily after reattaching many times my right side flap has already broken off and now it is chipped where it was also theblue is wearing off on the back of the circle already do not buy,186,142
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i am very happy with this purchase like the case much better than the silicone case i had previously you would not believe all the compliments i get on this case people like it especially the blue,37,143
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i bought this case after reading reviews for a number of cases and taking a look at ones in the apple store and the att store it is true that the screen protector bubbles up at bottom corners but it was not a big deal to me i clipped off the edges of the protector and problem soved it really was not a big deal also make sure you pay up and buy the power support crystal film set it is worth the money it is super clear my friends could not make out that i had it on,99,144
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,the bottom half of the case comes detached way too easily the slightest tug or pull at the bottom and it comes apart really really poor manufacturing tolerances it is nothing a dab of superglue can not fix but it is still poor my old inspiretech case was much better in this regard but cracked after too much abuse,56,145
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,well it does the job of protection and adding colour to the phone my only con for it is that it does not lock in at the bottom as a result the case can easily fall apart even when trying to insert your headphone jack without holding it tight,49,146
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the case is great i do not use the screen protector because i can not get the no-bubble technique down but i read the glass is pretty durable the case barely adds width to the iphone and actually provides a nice gripping surface the paint knicked on the red version i alsobought but the effect is pretty cool the underbelly is a shiny silver and looks nice i would recommend it highly,70,147
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,loving my ifrogz case good grip not too much bulk great colors and provides sufficient all around protection just be weary of moisture getting trapped near the lower portion of the case my case when showering or in tropical climates thinking about buying a black and orange one also niiice,50,148
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i love this case while it does add a few millimeters to the thickness of the phone it has a sleek look and fits the phone snugly i was always scared of the phone slipping off my fingers and the synthetic material of this case almost sued like provides me with a nice grip the only cons that i can think of is and this would be the case with all cases it dampens the vibration you may not feel the phone vibrating as well when you have it on silent,91,149
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this case offers good protection for your phone i dropped mine a few times and never had a scratch or any damage to the phone the case does not add a lot of bulk or weight to the phone the case does not easily slip from your grip the only problem i had with this case is that the circular locking ring on the back of the case broke off after 6 months i contacted the customer service for ifrogz and they happily replaced the case free of charge after i sent in a picture of the broken,99,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,this case is by far the most annoying piece of plastic you can wrap around you iphone every time i pull it out of my pocket either the top or bottom gets stuck in my pocket the plastic locks on it are not tight at all,46,151
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i liked this when i got it it looks good has a nice grippy feel and protects the iphone but there are several problems the tab on the back prevents much use when it is lying down on a table it is after two months starting to wear at the edges and removing the coloring and the two halves will not stay together anymore after being in my pocket most days I am throwing it away,73,152
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i bought this case because the guy at my local apple store said it was the best he was aalthough the case is a good fit and looks great on the phone it is made of crappy plastic or something the bottom piece came off within a week and the side where the volume controls are was gone soon after then the hole that holds the case together in the back cracked in half but i can not complain about that because seconds later the tabs that keep both sides attached snapped off if you want a durable case this is not for you but if you just want something too keep your phone from getting scratches from keys or something this could be ok also sand frequently got stuck in the case and made scratches on my phone i attributed this from my work with sand but be sure to clean the case out once in a while if you decide to purchase it,166,153
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this is my second of these cases the case looks great and is incredibly slim compared to most other cases the first was dropped more than a few times and it did it is job the case eventually cracked however the phone is untouched the only gripe i have is that the case sometimes comes apart if i grab it right in my pocket my first did not do this in addition the corners are a little tight and lift the film on my screen protector would still recommend,87,154
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this case works fine and is a rather brilliant blue however if you plan to use the included screen protector or any other screen protector you will need to trim back the corners on the lower corners of the protector so that the corners of the case do not push the protector back making bubbles under it,56,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i liked the product fit well and looked good but have had it 1 month and already cracked and showing wear i do not treat my phone rough so i was quite disappointed since i already need another case,39,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,okay so this is by far the best case you can get well maybe some of the higher priced griffin cases are good but for the money this is it this case fits like a glove and has a nice grippy feeling to it even although it is a made out of a very solid plastic material no rough edges clean design greatchoices i get comments on this case all the time and i could not be happier myself with how well this case has held up it has survived 3 foot falls onto concrete and suffered only minor scratches but the more important part was that my iphone was completely protected and was not damaged in any way get this case i know you will not be disappointed,130,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this is a snug fitting case that protects the iphone well I have dropped my 3gs a few times with no problems if you decide to clean your phone the case requires a little effort to take off but it is not that difficult i keep my phone in my pocket most of the time and I have noticed that some of theis chipping off around theof the case the back of the case has a sticky texture that makes it easier to hold securely overall I had recommend the case especially if you do not keep it in your pocket where it is going to get banged around with car keys and loose coins,113,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,it is ok i brought this product twice because of thehowever the bottom base is extreamy weak and flimsy it broke after a couple of weeks,27,159
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,pros this case looks awesome i have the blue and the metallic sheen it has is very cool i wish the whole case was thisinstead of just the top third it has a great feel to it too a slight velvety feel that sits in your hand nicely i also like how a thin strip of the chrome bezel shows through cons 1 the button on the back where the two pieces of the case lock together makes the phone rock when it is sitting on a table making it harder to type and navigate the touch screen 2 on my case the two pieces do not line up exactly when going on the bottom part and the top part do not sit over each other exactly as they should so i have to press one part down with my finger this also seems to prevent the button from locking all the way this issues has not limited the functionality of the case yet but i assume the it will get worse the more i take the case on and off if they offered this case without the button on the back allowing it to sit flat on a table it would be a 5-star plus product,205,160
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,i love the luxe case in general but the backing has peeled off the bottom portion of this particular case it started about 2 - 3 days after i began using it the other case i had previously just like this one did not peel off but it pinched the bottom left corner of my phone and caused the protector to bubble up and not stick smoothly around thei like the gripe and feel of the case but the build quality is not that great my first ifrogz luxe case lasted about 6 months before i ordered this one which lasted 2 - 3 days before developing problems i wish the build quality was better,113,161
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i have had this case little more than a week and already one of the two tiny connectors on the side has broken i did not fidget with it i do not remove the case it was just living the sweet life until i noticed the case warps aroun the iphone it is a I shall fitting case and protects very little try any of the incase line of cases for a more complete fit for a far cheaper price avoid at all costs,81,162
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this was recommended to me by a friend after i purchased my iphone and i am so glad i followed his advice everything they say about the case is true velvety-smooth touch cool metallicand perfect fit,37,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,well i really liked this case it has a nice darkyou can not really make out in the pic and it just feels good it slips right in a pocket yet it has a good grip in your hand the slider style is nice because you can remove the bottom to place your iphone in it is cradle however in my case this is where the case failed from what i consider normal use the black plastic near the connection between the 2 halves cracked and broke off i found the extra piece in my pocket the case would not snap back together after that I am still giving it 3 stars because maybe it was just an odd event and from a usability standpoint i really liked it,128,164
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this is a great case it is slim and protects very well however it is a very tight fit if you are using in conjunction with an invisishield i had to trim the bottom corners on the front of the invisishield as they were getting peeled up however after doing that the case is great just be careful with the tabs on the side they break easy no problems holding the case together although,73,165
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i do not understand why this case has so many good reviews I have had it for about three weeks and already i find that the case just does not hold together it slides apart with almost no pressure which has made me almost drop it more than once also the bluehas already rubbed away substantially I am going to replace this case with something else today again really do not understand all the good reviews,74,166
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,the ifrogz luxe case blue / black is a great looking case unfortunately it is ultra easy to break it lacks in overall quality and durability i was plugging in my iphone 3 g to charge and the case slid apart i thought oh ok simple enough I shall just slide it back together and all will be fine while attempting to align the case and slide it back together one of the tiny tabs that creates tension to hold the phone together broke off and rendered the case completely useless I have had this case on my phone for 8 days that tab is sliver thin and about 1/6th the size of a pinky finger fingernail i do not recommend this product at all and ask that apple reconsider it is approval of this product and suggest to ifrogz to work on much needed improvements in the overall quality and durability of this product,148,167
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,i made the mistake of purchasing one of these at the at t store for a ridiculous price compared to amazon perhaps for 10 it is worth having but my cases has already worn away thearound the edges of the screen from playing games and using the phone i have not had it for much longer than a month and the wear started to show very quickly now instead of looking like a cool metallic case it looks like a cheap while plastic case that was once painted a cool metallicnot good quality,95,168
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,the case fits very snugly on the phone in the beginning it is almost too snug but it does loosen a bit over time getting it on can be tricky due to two little tabs on the side of the lower black part of the case they are supposed to go under the top part but often have to be held down ackwardly to make it work this discourages me from using my phone with docks but that said this has been the best looking and overall favorite of the several cases I have owned,92,169
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,the two pieces come apart frequently thechips and the side tabs chip also i have had it for two weeks and am already looking for a replacement lame,30,170
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,looks snazzy but breaks easily first thing that broke is the ring on the back of the cover not a big deal then the side near the volume control split in two because it is the thinnest part of the case had my iphone since april now it is july so it lasted 3 months had not been dropped nor abused fyi,59,171
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,had this case for less than a week it is a nice case that provides nice form and function can not speak to thefading issue but in less than several times used i have broken a tab on the side so be very very careful with how you insert the case parts together have used this case with a cozip the cozip is easier on and off and provides similar but better overall protection with some face covered unfortunately although i like the design of this case the tabs on the side are prone to break with light use if you are not extra careful with them i only noticed it was gone after putting it on used it maybe three times screen protector seems to be a casemate brand had those on 2 g and 3 g but for some reason even applied perfect will create a bubble on a corner somewhere with the ifrogz added you get two additional bubbles to go 3 for 4 casemate seems to be slightly off here if you apply it good luck it is a good screen protector but seems hard to work with a case like this,193,172
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this case looks amazing the pictures definitely do not do it justice also the price is half on amazon as it was in the at t store making an online purchase a no-brainer as others have mentioned the blueis really much darker and more metallic than it seems in the product shots the only issue I have run into is that the blueon the sides is starting to fade after only about a month of use this is no doubt where my fingers hold the phone while using it,91,173
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,fits nicely and looks very nice but after monthstarts chipping away and looks very cheap already looking for a replacement my husband has the blue one and i have the red one the red one is chipping away faster than the blue,43,174
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,this is a nice durable case which is perfect for the iphone 3 g or 3gs which is what i have i had a tough time sliding it on in the beginning in fact i almost bent one of the pieces that it almost did not fit that said once i got it on it seems to do a good job of keeping it protected the plastic film screen protector is kind of a pain i could not really get the corners to fit so i ended up cutting the bottom pieces so it would stay put the bottom corners have a little bit of a triangular fit so it makes it hard for the film to stay on it is decent although i hope this case lasts for awhile because I have seen people go through may different ones because they keep it in their pocket please note if you plan on taking your case off a lot i would advise you get something else this one is a pretty snug fit and I had imagine it would be hard to take it on and off a lot,182,175
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,used this case for two months before it cracked at the thin strip of plastic above the power connectors I am ordering another great case that will not slip off a table or slick surface it has a rubberized feel and offers good protection I am glad the case cracked and not the iphone,52,176
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,it is been about 2 weeks now and the case looks great similar comments on the look and finish with the other positive reviews but the blue portion of the case is easily scratched and i can see the silver underneath the blue which the previous review eluded to maybe got a bad batch,52,177
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,1.0,negative,after just 2 days of normal use the blue paint begins to peel off silver-metal material is showing it looks ugly i would never buy it again,27,178
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i put this ifrogz case on my 3 g s and i am completely happy with it i have spent some time looking for a case for my iphone and after some searching came upon this one this skin is harder than the picture might suggest and it adds very little bulk to the size of the iphone it does cover the apple logo on the back but that does not bother me one bit the case is good looking and feels like it might offer some good protection for the iphone although i am sure that there are other cases out there that offer more protection i have no problem reaching any of the buttons or charging the iphone if you are confused on what case to get i would readily recommend getting this one with the variety of colors that you can choose from you will not be disappointed,150,179
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i had a couple of different iphone cases and this one is the best by far,16,180
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i love my iphone and i wanted a nice case for it to protect it from scratches and which also looked and felt nice of all the cases i could find to look at this one was the best it looks great and has a nice quality feel to it that enhances the iphone experience i got this case and a leather horizontal belt case to contain it for wearing while at work and knocking around off-work i never want to be apart from my iphone this setup works out well,91,181
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i have 2 of these and my wife has one we get nothing but compliments about our cases the blue is almost a purple but nice looking,27,182
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,i been using many cases that i can not count now this is the only one that i been using for more than one month straight the only thing that i wish to have it is a clip to hook it to my belt other than that this thing is great,49,183
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i have the blue luxe case it snaps on securely looks really great does not show fingerprints feels great and even comes with a screen protector that is easy to put on it does have little bubbles on the bottom corners but i do not see that as an issue it is hardly noticable i definately like this case more than the silicone cases costs 1999 at fryes so amazon is a good deal especially if you ship with other items and get free shipping,82,184
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,usps lost my package then amazon resend my package with usps i was glad with the service and how fast i receive my package the product is also great i would recommended this product thanks,35,185
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the ifrogz case looks great the pictures do not do it justice it is much more metalling in appearance it fits the iphone well and feels secure it came with a screen protector which is also nice this is my 3rd cover for iphone and i definitely like it the best i am thinking about buying it in multiple colors,58,186
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this is a two piece case with a dualmatte finish the internal component of the case is lined to protect the case from scratches the dark blueis pleasing to the eye and is not too flashy the case has a nice feel and keeps the iphone secure it is accompanied with a screen protector to keep fingerprints and light scratches off of the device all of the buttons ports and camera lens have openings for easy accessibility the weight and size added to your iphone is minimal overall this is a good value in the dozens of choices that iphone users have to choose from update 8/24/2009 i have bumped my phone too many times to count and the phone has dropped from a table top 6 or so times on the flat surface of the case the case is durable and has protected my phone other colleagues have dropped their cases falling at oblique angles which has caused cracking in the bottom trim of the ifrogz luxe case i have been very happy with my purchase and i plan to use it for back up when i do not have my phone in the mophie juice pack air,202,187
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,highly recommend this puppy looks great and fits tight well worth the,13,188

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i used to have one of the soft rubber cases for my iphone and one day i got a little tired of looking at hot pink so i bought this case i got to say i love it when i took the old case off there was so much crap dust and what not on the back of the iphone but this one fits snug and i like that it has a little padding so if i drop it the phone will survive worth the money,85,190
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i bought this ifrogz brand case at a nearby mall for 2999 it looks great however after a month now i noticed that theis fading on both sides of the phone where i usually have my fingers when holding it just wanted to share,46,191
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,very well done i love it it will also fit into a leather belt carring case i highly recommendsolid black rubber feel soft grip case cover for brand lg voyager vx10000 vx-10000 protective cell phone hard snap-on,40,192
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,bought this product for my fiance and he loved it i also bought a red one for myself ifrogz iphone3g-st-rb luxe case for iphone 3 g red / black and i must say that this is way better than the gel one it is sleek and stylish love the velvety look and feel plus it does not pick up pocket lint or pet fur / hair like the gel case snapping this product on your phone is a breeze plus the corners keep the clear screen protector in place as well the corners do not peel off i highly recommend this product,99,193
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i had a soft rubber-like case which i really liked unfortunately the soft case was not firm enough to stay on an the iphone squirted out when i was carrying my iphone and suitcase in the same hand and my iphone screen cracked so i got a replacement iphone and decided to try this case this case is not going to come off i do not think it is too tight but it fits just right once you snap the two pieces together this is a harder case i think it is aesthetically pleasing and the button piece on back that snaps the two pieces together is just a tad annoying the unit laying on it is back will wobble a bit barely but it is enough to lose a 1/2 of a star in my rating this case loses 15 stars for a bigger problem i had a screen protector on my iphone 3 g and i put this case on for the first time and both bottom corners of the screen protector immediately bubbled up i tried to push the bubbles out and took the case off but the damage was done i do not feel like wasting another screen protector to try again so I shall live with it and the case but i might look for a different case when it is time to switch to a new screen protector perhaps,230,194
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,i like this case so much better than the first one i had i like the slim snug fit i also like that i can get to all the buttons on the sides easily not to mention the rainbow ofoptions i am very happy with this product,49,195
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,i do not know how much more this case could take my husband accidentally threw his iphone across our hotel room during an emphatic gesture with his hands this past weekend the iphone survived the finish on the case is nice sleek and psuedo metallic access to the ports and buttons is readily available it fits nicely snug not having much give and the case does not add too much to the dimensions of the phone the only problem i can see is the screen protector not included you have to have one of those specific-to-the-iphone screen protectors gets pushed up a bit at the bottom corners not a big deal seeing as there has been a slight bubble in the area for couple weeks now and it has not caused us to pull up the protector the only way i could see this case being improved is if a screen protector came with it it would have to be of similar material to the stick-on protector the case should slide on over some sort of protector other than that it is great,177,196
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,after a lot of research on amazon and other sites i ended up with the combination of this case with a zagg invisible shield when i received my case a month ago i was thrilled the fit is superb and allows access to the original buttons everything worked flawlessly and the combination of the shield and case was excellent it preserved the form factor of the iphone while providing some protection from impact the blue is a very classy shade and is not ostentatious at all i did notice that the metallic finish rubbed a little bit and the plastic is not as heavy duty as i had thought the button on the back was actually quite nice for grip and was not an issue at all the fact that the case has felt inside is a plus and prevented scratching only where there was felt however i noticed that when i took the case off today that the unfelted areas had allowed buildup of some lint and dirt and because the dirt was trapped between the case and the phone actually scratched the finish a bit other than those things i loved the case and would have given it 4 - 5 stars until i noticed that the thin plastic had broken on one of the sides and was cracking on the other while slick looking these cases are not very durable i would recommend them for very casual use but not for what i see as normal phone / personal assistant usage i never put the case under any abnormal stresses never dropped it or put it under any pressure by sitting on itthe cracks in the plastic were just from normal handheld wear and tear,286,197
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,after 2 months on the left side if your phone is facing you the thin part of the skin cracked and broke the best part is that my phone is not cracked but i expected better,36,198
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this is probably my fifth case and now third phone I have had two of the 2 g phones and now a 3 g this case has a good tight fit and has so far kept lint from collecting on the interoir of the case like other cases have all buttons of the phone and connectors are easily accessible the screen protector that came with the case is ok I am not a big fan of screen protectors but I am using this one to try it out i thought the case was more of a rubber material than it actually is and I am glad that it is not it would be too hard to slip in and out of your pocket if it was however the case does have just enough extra grip to it to give the phone the extra grit that it needs to not be slippery,144,199
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the ifrogz cover is very nice i had a rubberized one that was too sticky to go in and out of my pocket,23,200
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,very nice case my only complaint is some spurs along the mold lines which need to be smoothed out case fits tightly but is not difficule to put on or take off colors are great and feel is soft with traction enough to give a stable grip i bought the blue and orange and i have the red on order case is sleek enough to allow phone to be inserted into a leather case with belt clip for carrying on the belt,82,201
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,this two-piece case is very well engineered the two halves snap together snugly be careful that the little side tabs mate properly and the satin finish gives just the right amount of friction in your hand a thin-film screen protector is included in the package as well distinctive look solidly built but low profile natural feel,56,202
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,slim perfect fit it gives the right amount of protection without making the phone bulky easily gripped yet still smooth enough to slip in your pocket exactly what i was looking for,32,203
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,I have had both hard and silicone cases for my 3 g and this case shares qualities of both the finish is smooth enough for the phone to slide into a pocket but has enough texture to stay firmly in your hand it looks great and is priced reasonably great product,49,204
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the case slips on very easily and feels very solid but lightweight it makes the iphone a tiny bit bigger but still small enough to slip into a pocket easily the surface adds friction to make the phone feel slightly nubby to the touch but still slides into a pocket without a problem all of the buttons are easily accessible as is the charger connection port the back interior is felt-lined so you do not have to worry about the hard case scratching the back of your iphone if you decide to remove / replace later the picture makes it out to be a rubberized appearance the actual product looks more metallic and is more purplish but is still blue than the picture shows ordered thisand the orange,127,205
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,ifrogz iphone soft touch for iphone 3 g blue / black is a nice and functional iphone 3 g cover,19,206
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,5.0,positive,the case is very nice and provides reasonable protection with minimal added bulk it came with two screen protectors which are not as nice as an invisible shield but will do for starters i was surprised that there were no instructions on how to apply the screen protector but i found instructions on their web site,55,207
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,this is a nice skin for the iphone 3 g I have gotten many compliments fit is a tiny bit tight,19,208
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,5.0,positive,i first ordered another product for my iphone 4 and returned it due to design flaws buying this instead it is great i have one by the same maker for my android phone as well it is great too good gripping material that is sort of a matte rubber which feels good and reduces slippage fits well on the phone in terms of leaving ample access to the buttons stays securely in place i have not dropped my phone yet so have not tested that performance but all signs pointing to turning out well,91,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,2.0,negative,I have had several products from seidio and was always pleased with their quality however this time i was disappointed and returned it i have an iphone 4 and bought this case in a greatbut the case did not fit well it slipped on fairly easy but also slipped off about every time i attempted to use the phone i would not recommend this case for the iphone 4,70,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,1.0,negative,this case is horrible the smaller bottom section of the case does not fit snugly into the top section causing the bottom piece to constantly wobble when you are holding it there is also a smallbetween the pieces that is not shown here but exists when you install the case on the phone also this case is bulky and adds what i consider to be significant size to the phone garbage,73,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,5.0,positive,just got this case and i love it fits the phone very well and feels very secure theis beautiful,21,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,3.0,neutral,i had bought seidio cases for my iphone 3gs in the past and their quality is ok i recently bought 2 seidio innocase ii surface for my iphone 4 i noticed the quality now it is much better but the iphone 4 fits kind of loose not to happy with this product,51,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,4.0,positive,i bought this case along with the holder about a year ago i dropped it and the holder cracked but the case protected the phone without any damage i also like it because it comes apart easily i have a bosein my bedroom and it will not charge with any cell phone holder on it other cases i have tried are to tight like there are stuck together with super glue-a really pain when you want to remove the case the phone has a sleek design light and not bulky like other brands especially the defender I have received many compliments and i highly recommend this case nicechoices as well the green is as it appears on the screen when viewing and considering to make a purchase,128,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,5.0,positive,best iphone case clip i have owned if you despise the bulkiness of the otter box and especially if you like to clip on this is a terrific phone case,30,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,1.0,negative,i bought this for my 4s because i had been pleased with my previous seido case after about a month of use the case started to come apart very easily instead of securely protecting my phone this actuallyto an incident where the phone slipped out of the case while i was talking on it and my iphone fell onto concrete after that i taped the case withtape to make sure that did not happen again after six months of mytaped seido case the corner broke off and i finally replaced it avoid,97,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,2.0,negative,the surface case will washout out any pictures you take using a flash the divider between the lens and flash is causing this issue be forewarned,26,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,3.0,neutral,before anyone says it i know thedescription clearly says for at t and verizon however i had thought maybe this was listed before sprint got their version and i did not expect there to be any major differences so i figured it was worth a shot so the fit was actually great i really like seidio cases I have purchased them for years and the build quality on this one did not disappoint it fit like a glove was easy to put it together and take it apart if you actually follow the directions and it looked great the reason i only gave it three stars was for some reason this case made it so i could not take pictures was the flash i guess the way it was designed the flash would reflect off of the case and all of my pictures would be extremely washed out i was quite disappointed because i had read that this particular case was designed to prevent that as it had a separate hole for the lens and flash so they would not impact each other sadly that just was not the case I have since got a nice otterbox commuter case and it did not have this same problem this might have just been my experience so you might want to try it for yourself it is a shame i had this flash issue because i really liked the case but honestly the otterbox commuter is just as good and no flash issues so it is up to you,249,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,2.0,negative,i have used seidio gases and holsters for three phones now and always been very happy but this one is unusable i have an at t 4s and the case is just loose I am guessing quality control issues in any case the phone moves within the she shall making it pretty much annoying and useless the spring-clip holster i bought it in a combo looks like it is up to their normal standards hopefully i can find another case that fits it,79,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,5.0,positive,we already have the black uploaded version so when we got a second iphone for the family www jumped right back to the same brand i love the feel of the case that provides a terrific grip and easy handling on the phone i sometimes wonder why the original phone is not made from this material love the sagei had no problem with sliding the two pieces apart you should read the brief instructions that come with it which basically tells you to press down on the centre of the lower half and then pull easy once you know how not disappointed and not sure i have the issues experienced by previous reviewers we r a repeat customer,121,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,1.0,negative,this case is fine if you never plan on removing your case but since i have never met an iphone user who has not needed to remove their case i do not see how thisis a good investment i am still trying to remove the darn thing,47,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,1.0,negative,I am mixed between two and three stars this particular case the first time i put it on my iphone 4 snapped on so hard that i almost could not remove it there has an internal plastic snap to keep the bottom piece of plastic from coming loose and it is so stiff initially the removing the case felt almost impossible in addition to that the case is so-thick that any picture using the flash will have halos caused by the case interfering with the flash-area myself I had vote to stay away from this one modded review based on somebody else seeing the same problem 1 star avoid this one,107,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003XDU0C4,3.0,neutral,i was looking for an iphone case that was slimmer than the otterbox defender case i was currently using this case is slimmer and i like thetexture however if you need to take it off for any reason good luck it is not easy also i am a tad nervous about the protection factor it just does not feel as although it protects the phone enough if it were to be dropped,72,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,2.0,negative,works fine as a dual charger juices up my blackberry and ipod at the same time with no problems it does however emit a faint high-pitched electronic buzz not loud enough to merit a return but definitely annoying,38,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,2.0,negative,i was looking to get a dual usb charger that works with my nokia cell phone and my wifes htc phone this works with htc phones but does not work with the nokia the nokia phone requires a usb charge only port which has a shorted d and d pins they are not shorted with this charger,60,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,1.0,negative,the first unit i received was defective and amazon promptly exchanged it the second unit simply will not charge two devices i attempted to charge two droid incredible phones and got no response the retractable usb charger works well but the dual charger does not,44,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,2.0,negative,pretty much everything i have charges via usb these days and rather than take up pc ports these ac-usb adapters work great i use the two ports to charge two wireless headsets off one wall socket update 10/5 worked for 10 months now dead worked fine for off-and-on charging of wireless headsets moved to another room 2 months ago switched to using for a single cellphone every night phone needed 750mah,71,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,4.0,positive,before i found this product i was searching amazon and other websites that sells a charger that features 2 usb ports for charging and with the size of an apple ipod charger the current one i like to just use usb chargers because i do not want to bring separate chargers for my gadgets when they can also charge via a usb port i would just need one to two wires when i saw thison amazon i immediately bought it because at first glance it was what i was really looking for when thewas delivered i was a bit surprised because i was expecting a smaller charger just like the ipods but with 2 usb ports instead it was a bit bigger the prong can be folded although and it comes with a free retractable micro usb charger i guess you should really read thoroughly before you buy but even although it is big it lives up to my expectations it charges every usb powered device i have and i still absolutely love the fact that it has 2 usb ports i am planning to get another one just so i can use it for travelling,198,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,5.0,positive,with the battery life of my smart phone lacking big time the need to walk around with one of these is very necessary love it,25,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,5.0,positive,the dual usb plugs is a good space savingi use the regular cables and keep the included charger at home and charge both my blackberry and htc aria at the same time no error messages or problems with charging I have also plugged in the usb cable for a iphone-3 and charged that as well without errors i use the smaller oem charger and retractable cable for travel i feel the retractable cable will fail sooner than the dual plug charger but have not had any problems thus far i also have used the retractable cable in this travel kit for tethering my htc aria to my laptop for internet I have also used the same retractable cable with the newer blackberry for demonstrating tethering capability i will also admit that I have abused the dual usb charger by using it to power the fans on my laptop cooler it does have enough power to run the fans and charge the phones at the same time a nice charging kit that i have also recommended to others,176,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,3.0,neutral,having two usb plugs on such a small unit is great it works well the retractable usb cord is not so great mine just gets jammed up heres a tip you have to pull on both ends to get it to go in and out if you pull just one end it will start to retract one end and just get jammed up pretty horrible design I had still buy it for the plug hub thingy although,76,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,4.0,positive,purchased this product as a road warrior looking to be able to charge my phone and other devices at the same time the cable works just as expected both charging and syncing with my pc the wall unit however is the downfall what it will not do is supply power to two devices at the same time it will charge every device i have by itself but i have yet to find another device it will charge at the same time as my phone a current model blackberry I have tried another phone and mp3 player and a small rechargeable battery after just a few moments the charge begins to flicker on and off somewhat rapidly the entire reason i purchased thiswas because it had two ports update contacted seller of product who immediately issued a replacement replacement works exactly as it should would now recommend the seller wholeheartedly still a little leery of product with the first defective one although i do think i just happened to get the one bad unit,173,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,5.0,positive,so my idiot co-worker got his motorola droid x and noticed that if you plug the usb cable into your computer and attach it to the motorola droid x you can see the file system on the droid this is against company policy as heaven forfend i actually download something from the corporate network and put it on my droid x and take it home my doofus-co-worker then contacted corporate security to let them know that this was a potential issue and informed me that i should immediately disconnect my phone from the computer now i am left with no phone charging option at work hence i had to run to amazoncom and purchase a solution that allowed me to keep my battery-draining-but-awesome-as-heck droid x charged while at the office i picked this solution and I am glad of it i also plug in my ipod touch via the second usb port available via this charger therefore I am able to have both my droid x and ipod touch up and running full time and neither of them are connected to the dreaded and sacred corporate computer and network i feel excessively safe and happy if you have the same problems i have with idiot co-workers and even if you need a solution that involves charging your droid x or other phone or possibly an ipod touch or such this product is a decent solution i have not had any problems with charging both devices at the same time,247,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,1.0,negative,i had to buy three 3 of these units in order to find one which would actually work and only one of the units would actually charge however it would not charge two things at the same time which defeats the purpose of having a dual usb charger,47,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,5.0,positive,i have looked for awhile for a double usb charger that could handle charging 2 ipods or a ipod and my blackberry at the same time this charger does it no problem recommend it to all,36,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,2.0,negative,thisseems to be rather haphazardly constructed or possibly just poorly qad either way the usb ports are extremely tight and it was difficult to insert the included usb cable into them it works but i think for the price it is a rather disappointingconsidering good chargers can be had for a fraction of the price of this one,61,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,1.0,negative,will not not charge 2 smart phones i bought 10 of these for everyone in the office after the first 3 failed to charge 2 phones at the same time i returned the unopened 7 to amazon,37,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,1.0,negative,i just bought this one and tried it out i can not charge 2 smart phones at the same time i learned that you need to pay very close attention to the original chargers and also need apporximately 1000ma per port to ensure that you can charge a smartphone,49,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZC425E,4.0,positive,it is compact and every usb device I have plugged into it charges including picky devices like my kindle dx and ipad 2 this is the first one that I have had that is been so compatible i highly recommend one additional note it turns out that charging the ipad 2 and another unit can be problematic i found that if i plug in the ipad 2 first then plug in one other unit both units will charge however if i do the reverse especially if trying to charge a smart phone then the ipad 2 may not charge fortunately the ipad 2 does indicate that it is not charging so i get a visual indication if i messed up update one of the two units i bought is now picky about how it wants to be connected to the wall outlet while the other still works great minus one star,146,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,they have a comfortable fit awesome sound and just perfect for handsfree driving they are actually a better quality than the htc headphones that came with my phone,28,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,these ear buds reaaly work well i use them with my android phone as well as my kindle i did not order them with the intension of ever using the microphone but i have found it useful with my phone,39,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,the headset have a nice look to them and sound pretty good it was delivered a bit slow but it was worth it,26,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,3.0,neutral,the headphones sound good with my music and cancel noise the bad part is the answer button does not work when trying to pick up calls on my droid x,29,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,got wrong ear buds not what i ordered,9,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,the wores were stiff and the buds were trying to fall off of them after a day of having them they make my ipod mess up i tested it with my vousins headphones and it was indeed these they made my ipods music stop or start randomly and acted like they were about to go out and stop working,59,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,the sound is awesome and it fits in your ear and does not hurt like some headphones it was well worth the money,22,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,do not let the price fool you they perform well all around mic works clean sound and just an overall great buy also showed up much faster than expected,28,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,2.0,negative,cheap priced because they are cheap i only got these so i could talk and hear but the talk part works well but it really lacks in sound quality,29,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,for the price they are great earbuds good sound and fits snug in the ear i would buy a few extras just to keep on hand for i am always in need of a spare pair for my car house and office i also use them to talk on my iphone 4s works well,54,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,3.0,neutral,i ordered two of these and both looked just like what was described online have to keep a close eye with cheap things like this first off thisgot to my house before the estimated shipping date so that was great it was in good condition and looks like a quality product the wires do get damaged easily so be carful when handling them the microphone works alright and the jack plugs in firmly again they look great but looks only get you so far when it comes to the listening experience that is when the cheap price comes into play the sound coming from the ear buds to me is above average quality but with a trade off you can hear a faint buzzing sound in the background the louder the audio the louder the buzz to me i could not stand it so i just gave them away all in all this is a good buy if you are a true music lover who can not stand the tiny irritations in your audio like me then look else ware,181,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,headset that work is the best the issues is when you live with others that take them and brake them for you hahaha,23,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,i lost one broke one this is my third one i keep losing my headphones and this cheap one is the best money can buy since the quality is decent and i use it when i need to make calls at the gym handy,46,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,2.0,negative,the headsets i got 2 of them do not match the picture other than that they are mostly black and have some silver parts i specifically ordered these to replace one identical to the picture and also by eforcity that my wife broke i ordered another for me because i like the way they sounded and also like the mic / switch it is operated by squeezing so you do not have to find a tiny button the ones that arrived very quickly i might add sound terrible they are like listening to music in the background of the other end of a phone call or holding cans over your ears i wish that were an exaggeration when i brought these facts to unitedintegrals attention they quickly arranged a refund so i am very happy with them and would order different headsets from them if they had some,144,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,this headset works great for phone calls and is fine for music for the price it was a great purchase the product shipped very quick and was in perfect condition,30,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,2.0,negative,the product is not good quality but is expected for something as low price as this one the sound was poor overall i was disappointed with it thte service and delivery was good,33,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,these ear buds are of very low quality purchased for my husband to use with his phone and he could barely hear anything would return but not worth my time,30,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,works great for the price and have held up well too i just use for a cheapo mp3 player i have did not even realize it had a mic o I shall have to try it with my droid as well,39,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,i do no recommend thisone ear plug wire is longer than the other making it impossible to ware both at the same time it was not worth my time to return since the postage cost more than theitself next time i will pay more attention to the reviews on anbefore i purchased if i had paid attention to the reviews on thisi could have saved myself time and money the merchant should pay more attention to the items they sell to the customers before shipping and then again some merchant no it is not worth the time and money for some customers to return knowing they want i guess i got what i paid for,123,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,after the oem ear buds with mic began to fail the search for a replacement set landed on these they worked with the samsung moment and now work well with the samsung galaxy sii I am getting a couple more sets one for the car and one for another person,49,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,the audio quality on these is not the best i have a couple of different models of these headsets and these have been the only ones where i have been very disappointed with them the y where the microphone is hangs way too high almost against the side of my face and the audio is tinney at best,58,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,1.0,negative,the sound is absolutely unbearable i have used some pretty awful headphones in my life these ones despite their far superior appearance are easily one of them you might think I am being picky and for a coupla bucks this is not too bad no it is go buy a sandwich seriously they are that bad they are not usable they look great no doubt about it but the actual sound is terrible you literally only hear mids no highs or lows whatsoever you hear random tick and clicking noises every now and then all this is only if you get the damn thing to work because one side keeps cutting out i threw them in the garbage and asked for my money back immediately i did not get to actually try the mic,129,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,i would highly recommend using this right now to make this comment so you can tell that the microphone works just fine sound is also above average i would buy it again in fact i think i will,38,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,3.0,neutral,i got the headset to use with my atrix 2 phone so far it have been pretty good the sound is kind of muffle not as clear as i thought with phone to phone conversation have not use it to listen to music yet the ear pieces are way to big for the ears it keeps dropping from my ear the headset did come with two extra soft gels,68,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,3.0,neutral,you get what you pay for i received my headset and the left ear played alot lower than the right side i maneuvered the wire a bit and it starting playing at the correct volume but for 190 what do you expect really,43,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,2.0,negative,the sound quality is good microphone sounds good when calling but the ear buds are too big so they do not stay in your ear propertly good if you are standing / sitting still,31,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,5.0,positive,i got this product after trying several headsets that did not work with my droid 2 global in most cases i was able to hear but the other party could not hear me i was so relieved when this headset worked i use it mostly in the car so i can talk hands free if someone calls while I am driving the only way it could be improved is to have just one ear piece instead of two i do not think it is safe or advisable to drive with both ears blocked at first i just let one of the earpieces dangle but that sometimes got caught up in my seatbelt so i used a little tape to tie up the unused earpiece a minor inconvenience although I am just glad to have a headset that works,134,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,3.0,neutral,the mic pickup for phone calls is good the buds fit the ears fine but poor sound quality when playing music overall it is okay for the price,28,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RL6QHE,4.0,positive,pretty good for the small price mic sounds nice and clear on phone calls ear buds are comfortable in my ears souund could be a little better but for the price i am not complaining,35,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i ordered the black flower phone cover it came quickly however after a week the print started peeling off the hard case i ended up taking the cover off i am super disappointed because i was really excited about it,41,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,nice looking case had to make an adjustment to get it on my phone have dropped the phone a few times and it has fallen off,26,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,good price and good case but two days after receiving it the case decor started to peel on the bottom,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,if there has anything rubberized about this i can not see it flimsy cheap plastic comes in two pieces paint easily scrapes off I had say you get what you pay for but once you figure in shipping you can get a solid hard case that will actually protect your phone for the same price or a few bucks more,57,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i love this case cover it is durable enough to protect my phone but the design on it makes it a little more girlie than just a plain rubberized case great product,31,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,it is thin and looks like crud do not buy this product you will be sorry that u wasted your money,20,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i would recommend this case it looks good and is tough i dropped my phone this morning in the garage and despite having landed on a cement floor my phone was fine the case came quickly shipping and handling was great,42,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,it has saved my phone from breakage and taken the hit when i dropped my phone reasonably priced as well,20,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,the design is nice but the pattern rubbing off already i have only had it on for a short time,20,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,the blossom represents spring and hope for me but the black theme is classy and perfect for the winter months,20,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,i bought this case because i like the design first impression cheap flimsy plastic since I am not one to waste money i went ahead and use it it snapped on and fit perfectly and protect my phone well I am happy with it as it slips in and out of my pocket easily and the rubberized feel helps keep it from slipping out of my fingers the problem came when i had to remove the cover there was no way for me to do that without damaging the case a couple hook pieces broke off and the case no longer hold together very well upon removing the cover the first time i noticed a few scratches on my phone from it but the scratches were minor compare from the scratch i got for dropping my phone without any cover so i cover my phone back up some of the blackaround the rim got rubbed off over the year after more than 15 years I am not ready to buy new phone yet but i certainly need a new case because i do not want to start usingtape to hold this 3 case together still i certainly got more than my moneys worth with this case,206,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i like this phone cover it came in a reasonable amount of time the price was great i recommend anyone get a case for their phone when they are this cheap,31,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,it is not the sturdiest my wife dropped it and the corner clasp broke use some tape for a month till i got her another one but what do you expect for 4 worth the price paid,36,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i liked this when i first got it and was very happy but after awhile it started to fade and in less than 6 months it broke maybe i am too hard on my phone but i was disappointed,39,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i really like the design but it only lasted me a few weeks and i am not rough on phones,20,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,when i received the product the design was different kind of an inverse annoying but besides this obvious mistake the case is good kind of a strange texture although it is rather hard to describe but it grips and slides around less,41,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in thisthe first day i put the case on it never fit correctly the top right corner was missing a piece so i could not click in not happy at all and will not be buying anything like this again,44,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,love this case so much it is by far my favorite i love the texture and it stayed in good shape for a long time exactly what i expected no complaints,31,18

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,it is good to make your phone look different that is about it one drop and the case is broken at least it was inexpensive,23,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,maybe i could rate it but i never got thissend me thisso that i will be about to rate it right,25,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,it is a cute case but it was not for a droid incredible 2 it was for a motorola phone so i can not even use it,25,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,it is very cute but does not fit right front and back tend to separate does not snap together properly i would not recommend this,22,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i love this case cover it is made of very thin plastic so it does not add any bulk to my phone i was skeptical because of the price but it was well worth the small amount i paid definitely recommend this,41,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,from the pictures it looks like it is going to be a classy black and white case however this is not the case th cover also has brown vines which i was not thrilled with as i wanted just a black and white case the case as other viewers mentioned is not study it broke within a couple of months and i do not drop my phone ever the case broke because it was thin and just with every day usage of handling the phone makes the case break i received this as a gift because i asked for it for the holiday season however i was very disappointed,109,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,it looks nice on the phone but it is not really secure it comes off easily price is cheap cheaply made,23,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,i am pleased with my purchase of this case for my droid incredible 2 it is priced very low so there is not much room to complain about anything as with all cases that i see people complain and give low ratings over it feels very flimsy and cheap when you first take it out of the package but it fits the phone well and does not come loose and the design is not fading away or peeling off i also really like that it has a smooth rubberized feel to it the only part that concerned me was when i dropped my phone the case popped right off but then again every case i have ever had does that at some time or another i got it to make my phone look pretty not completely save it from being mishandled,141,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,love this case cover i get compliments all the time on the unique design cover has been great and protects phone well as i have dropped it a few times so no marks scratches,35,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i do not know if it just this type of cover or this particular cover but the first time i dropped it the cover snapped in 1/2 and jacked my phone up the cover itself broke and is no longer usable i wish that i had spent the money on the silicone one to begin with,55,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,perfect fit durable and picture perfect definitely would order again thanks true toand more will refer my friends to your products,21,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,this cover is beautiful do not get me wrong but it is a 2-piece cover and the snaps are very flimsy i would not feel comfortable leaving my expensive phone to be protected by this case the plastic is fairly thin you would be better off with another product after all if you are going to spend the on a nice phone I had spring for the few extra dollars for a nicer case the snaps feel like they would break if you removed the case once or twice to clean it I had go with a tougher case,93,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i guess you get what you pay for this is a cute case I have had many compliments on the design however the bottom two tabs broke after one slight drop of the phone granted the phone was protected but i do not think it would have broken even without the case the point is the case is not very durable but like i said you get what you pay for,67,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,1.0,negative,the ear piece starts to loosen as you wear it and the sound gets really bad and it does not take long for these things to happen i would not buy this again note would i recommend it it is not worth the money,43,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,2.0,negative,i bought this headset recently and to be frank i did not like it is performance at all there is no voice clarity at the other end and also the audible voice is to week it is just like other normal headseta which is available at the lower prices than this,50,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,3.0,neutral,this headset is good and inexpensive my only complaint is that it is complicated you have to stand on one foot hold the other behind your back while rubbing your head and having a detailed conversation anyway you get thecomplicated,42,26

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,3.0,neutral,got this phone to replace my samsung vibrant got tired of android phones yup i can not believe i went back to a windows mobile platform i needed a physical on / off button to hang up or dial people as strange as it may seem the android on / off button would not work during a call on my samsung vibrant i bought this unlocked phone for calls and text i carry my t-mobile g-slate tablet for internet functionality the phone that arrived was an at t branded phone fortunately i could slip in my t-mobile sim card and it worked although it kept rebooting the first 20 minutes after i inserted the t-mobile sim also I am not sure if this was a refurbished unit the outside casing looked new but when i removed the battery there was this white sticker that looked like it was placed there by a 3rd party refurbished team regardless this was well worth the price again i needed a basic phone the earpiece and speakerphone is loud on par with the samsung vibrant it boots up in about 45 seconds it receivesinternet only on t-mobile ringtones are not very loud and there were not a good selection of ringtones update 12/18/2011 i downgraded my review of this phone from 5 stars to 3 stars the issue is dust collected under the screen there is no way to get rid of it also can not see screen in direct sunlight battery lasts an entire day 24 hours again it is not android and it does not multi-task that is why the battery lasts so long overall i give this phone a big thumbs up,272,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,it has only been two days since i got the phone so rating this product is a little premature if you have been using a blackberry this phone might frustrate you a little bit the keyboard sticks a little you have to add a period at the end of all sentences instead of the software doing it for you the comma is actually not featured on the keyboard but as a symbol that you have to access from a symbol list having said that all of this is very tolerable the track wheel seems very sturdy but you are better off clicking instead of dialing reception has been really good everywhere i have gone the sound tends to be soft and so are the different rings i like the display overall it seems like a very good but simple smartphone when you buy this article make sure they include a data cable with it it should come with it but it was not packed with my order it is a proprietary samsung design so finding it would be difficult they did not even have it at the at t store best buy or radioshack around where i live i hope this review helps,201,16

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,i was excited to purchase this product to take notes during class at university it arrived a day before promised making it seem like an even better deal despite reading other reviews on this product i decided to chance it i opened the package to see it contained a rubberized bluetooth keyboard and about 4 pages of instructions i opened the package and found no usb mini-usb charge cord for the keyboard luckily i had a spare laying around the house once charged admittedly for only approximately a half hour i turned on the keyboard the keyboard was recognized by my samsung galaxy s ii phone and pairing was as simple as following the onscreen instructions and inputting the 6 digit password here is where things went awry the product is small as warned by previous reviewers however i could have been able to work around that i immediately opened quickoffice and created a new word document the bluetooth keyboard only picked up intermittent keystrokes sometimes it would pick up the wrong key entirely i although this may be a problem with quickoffice but when i tried it in a simple text window i had the same results i thought it may have been the result of a low battery so i allowed the keyboard to charge for 4 more hours to my dismay i yielded the same results i am returning this product as defective / not working as advertised it did not work with my samsung galaxy s ii as a previous commenter has noted better luck to anyone who takes a chance on this keyboard i do not recommend this product,272,37

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,5.0,positive,this keyboard is great i use it with my samsung galaxy s ii connection pairing was easy and the keyboard has rubber keys with tactile feed back and the whole thing is weather proof and rolls up small enough to fit in a pocket actually the whole keyboard body is soft rubber except for the battery holder the usb charging cable comes on a spring driven roll up spool and is very small to store and works just like it should i have big fingers and typing anything more than a sentence or so on the s ii keyboard is a real problem with this keyboard nearby i can compose a long document or email just like on a notebook computer i even used it to type this review i really like this keyboard especially for the price,138,40

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,do not advice any1 to buy the same and i wish i listed to other reviewers that it is not practical and easily fall off table,25,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,had some difficulty getting the cord attached but it works fine and looks great the only drawback is that you can not have a protective case on your phone when charging the case keeps the phone from making a good connection to the charger you have to take your case like an otterbox off your phone,55,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,the base is too light so that s4 in theis very unstable prone to fall over it looks nice and works if you have a case on your phone however it really needs to be heavier so that my phone does not topple over when i do not balance it right while putting it down,56,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,although it does look cool note thatbecome top-heavy when you place your device in it so as soon as you touch the screen the whole contraption is liable to tip over,33,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,for under 20 dollars this docking station is an excellent alternative to the higher priced name brand more so it accommodates the newer larger phone cover that i recently purchased,30,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,fits my phone but it does not work unless i take my phone out of the case and put it in the charger now i us it for my small 7 tab but had to glue down the front of the stand for it,44,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,works like the manufacturer promised it would this stand will the replacement for my other stand when it finally self-destructs,20,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,this device is made only to be used without the protective cover on the phone not very good it is not worth the expense,24,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,nice and original aesthetic cable and support are delivered separated some assembly needed ans this is not easy support is ok for slim phones with thicker units putting the phone on the support is very limit,37,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,very good stand but it is not very strong but as long as you are carefully you should not have any prolblems,22,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,tips over too easy and will not charge phone with the case on the phone like the samsugi have at home i have to take the case off every time,32,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,a little frustrating to assemble will only work with the cord provided and it is a little short charger is usb so have to aeperately buy a converter to use it in a power outlet,34,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,phone stands up and shows me the time when i use an alarm app and charges at the same time it is an excellent and attractive product i keep it next to my bed fantastic,34,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i had a heck of a time putting it together i felt like my fingers were too big to snap the pieces in taking phone on and off is difficult as well the whole thing pics up wish it were a little heavier and sturdier,45,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i like thisthe only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the phone is propped by the connection I am fearful that over time the connection is going to become damaged having said that it is fine so far nicest thing is that i canmy galaxy s3 in the case which has been an issue for every otherI have tried,64,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,works fine without my otterbox but does not work with it the stand really relies on the microusb plug to keep it upright the provided microusb is not flush with the otterbox case in the way so it will not connect and even on it is side it is not too stable on the stand if i did not have the case on the phone it would be fine but i do so I shall have to find some other use for it,76,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,this is a very handy devise to keep your battery sucking smart phone charged and at hand it keeps the phone in the upright position for easy screen viewing thisis great,33,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,I had hoped based on the design this would be a charger stand that does not require one to take the cover off my phone but no the connector is just as short as the samsung and the power cord will not stay in place would not recommend to anyone much less my friends,53,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,the celphone never stays up is an unstable base and the charger does not lasts that much i hate it all,20,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,it is not the bestfor a phone but it is good the design is different from others and looks nice in my desk,23,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,great stand snug fit on the stand wish it has come with plug as well as a charge cable had to spend additional money for a plug,27,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i purchased thisconsidering other reviews claimed that it would fit a galaxy s4 with case i have a very thin case and it does not fit at all,30,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,great product quick shipping does exactly as advertised i do wish it had the ability to activatemode but there are plenty enough apps to make that happen,29,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i do not know exactly what i expected or why i expected something different but this is less i do not hate it but i would not buy it again,29,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i thought i read the customer reviews before i purchased this docking station but i did not read closely enough warning this docking station will not work on phones with cases i have a ballistic protective case for my samsung s3 the charging cable is shaped like those for apple products so once the docking station is assembled it does not extend far enough into the case to make a connection i was disappointed since i was hoping for something to place my phone upright instead of it laying flat on a surface i gave the docking station to my teenage son since he does not mind removing his case to charge his s3,111,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,i purchased this with one prime objective to charge my galaxy 4s with case installed never happen and the connection of cable to base was very insecure i sent it back kudos to amazons return policy this product is no good at all unless you are going to use it with a smartphone without a case and at that the usb connector will not stay in place without a generous dab of super glue do not buy this,79,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,i purchased two of these docks for one they shipped clear docks instead of the black ones that i ordered one of them is defective the cord is separated from the actual charging end and there is no usb / power cord which like some of the other reviews i read after the fact is not included i thought the usb was an extra not so much,64,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,no need to say more small fancy cheap i recommend it you will not be dissapointed for this product at all,21,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,we bought 2 of these a year and a half ago and we are still using them they are great for charging the phone but it is true what other people say about stability if you move the table where is sitting thedances and the phone can fall so you just have to be careful when using it for the price we think is a good product and we would buy it again without hesitation,76,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,use 2 from it one in work and one in home find it difficult to extract the device but it is usefulness is very large in charging and standing to see alerts,31,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,article worked two weeks and then stopped working poor quality components i regret having made the purchase of this,20,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,we purchased 2 of these cases and they look very nice on the desk but they are useless main complaints connector is too short to fit a phone with a case usb cable is way too short my s3 has a typical snap on case from zazzle the connector is too short it will not charge my phone unless i remove the case if you have anything other than a basic bumper case it will not work if you have something like an otter box do not even waster your time the usb cable is very short it will not reach from the top of the desk to the back of the computer it had to be plugged in to the front of the computer just to have the charger in a somewhat convenient location on the desk,137,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,as stated in my other review on this product as it will charge the phone if it breakes you can not put another charger in it and use as it is useless once it breaks and i can not see how you could put the phone in sideways being you could break the charger so no i would not buy again,59,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,not much to say except that thefunctions as advertised i wish it had rubber feet so that it would not slide as much across my desk,28,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this cradle works well for my galaxy nexus it is small and sometime it can be hard to get the phone off the cradle when just waking up but that is not the cradles fault I had definitely recommend this if you use your phone for an alarm or need it by your bed,52,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,it is not the best very light weight can not touch it while it is on the stand good for alarm clocks but if you want to use your phone u have to take it off,33,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i like this charger if you have it in a place where you can actually see it it makes a very convenient stand the only thing i do not like is that the phone makes it top heavy so when I am charging overnight and my alarm goes off in the morning the barest brush of my finger can just knock it over and when it falls it falls hard other than that which I am learning to work around propped my nightly water bottle behind it laughing out loud,85,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,base is very small for a samsung galaxy s3 and it is top heavy which is just asking for an accident i was looking for a base that would accommodate my extended battery pack and this one did not work the connector is so short i doubt it would even work with any case other than stock,56,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,glad to see that this was just what i wanted and expected the only thing is i wish it had the wall extension on the end of the usb cable other than that it is great,36,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i like this alot i use it alot more than my charger it is very helpful and convient espically in my car or using it at other places,27,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,the phone when installed tipped thestand over what a poor design i would not recommend this product to anyone,21,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,i was looking for afor my galaxy s2 for my living room and came across this one it looked cool and was a fair price so i purchased it little did i know that all it was is a charging wire and a small flimsy piece of plastic never did i expect i would have to assemble it not that it is difficult to do but litterally it is a wile that u clip into a piece of plastic come on really so i clipped the wire into place and hooked my phone to it nothing so i took the phone off and put it back on it now it just beeps over and over and over again what has happening is that it charges for a second then stops then starts then stops and on and on and on not happy and very annoyed this is a very poorly built product i actually thought i was going to break it while clipping the wire into place i do not recommend this to anyone i have previously bought 2 rnd power solutions deluxe 2nd battery charger and data sync cradle desktopstation for samsung galaxy s ii and loved them but i thought this one looked better and would serve better in the living room i was wrong i will be purchasing a third rnd charger and will be very happy about it,235,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,thearrived quickly it looks nice on my night stand and it looks sleek this was a great purchase,21,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,thisallows me to use my galaxy s3 with or without a protective cover on it it supports the phone very well,23,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,i purchased this charger for my desk at work the phone sits perfectly in the docker the cable that is provided is white so it looks more like my apple chargers overall very happy with this purchase,37,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,wish it had a better direction on how to open the small pouch inside for it to be hooked it took me two days to figure this out but nice stand,31,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i picked this because it look elegant and allowed me to charge my phone on my night stand while using it as an alarm clock it works great,28,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i like the modern look it holds the phone nicely and firm enough to touch the screen with one hand a little hard to plug the phone in i need to hold the stand in one hand and flex the phone in but that makes for a very secure,51,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i like this product but i am bummed that i sometimes have to take the case off to charge the device and it does not seem super sturdy,27,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i originally bought this for my husband who had switched from an iphone to a galaxy phone worked great for what we wanted after having invested hundreds in iphone accessories i wanted to make sure he liked this phone before we did the same it worked great for him while he had the galaxy but eventually switched back to an iphone i use it now and i love it really like that it is so small you can barely tell it is on my nightstand my only complaint is it can be tricky to get your phone hooked up sometimes i actually have to pick up the stand and look at the connector to hook up the phone makes me miss the ease of simply sitting your phone in athat guides it in correctly for the connection minor inconvenience for the price although,145,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,every docking station should have the ability to put your phone in a docked mode this stand is ok if you only want it to charge your phone and hold it up because the stand is very light it is very easy to tip over,44,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,i love this littlevery smart cleverinexpensive and attractive and very transportable if you choose looks great on my desk,23,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,given as a gift to my brother and was well recieved and very useful i would recommend thisno problems,21,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,just a heads up i have an otterbox commuter series on my samsung galaxy g3 the cases thickness makes it so the micro-usbs end will not reach in far enough into the case to make a connection i thought i could maybe just use the stand to hold the phone in the landscape position it works sort of but the hard rounded hard plastic of the case and small footprint makes it a precarious perch I am going to take a file to the connection and see if i can modify it enough to make a connection I shall report back I am sure it will work fine with no or a thinner case edit okay i modified the plug using a flat file with a little ingenuity and crazy glue i was able to get theto work with the otterbox still I had look elsewhere if you want something to work as aif you have this type of cover pete,161,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,it is a bit pricy for a simple piece of plastic however what the heck that said it does everything that i need or want it to do it takes litte space and charges quickly with the suplied charging cord the only drawback of this device is the need to take the phone out of the protective case in order to fit onto the charging stub,64,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i like the charger but I am not in love with it it works fine after getting it set up but the process of doing it is very hard i guess it really was not what i was looking for but it does what it says it charges,46,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,i love this chargingas it makes my samsung galaxy s2 stand out in the crowd my colleagues really envy my phone,23,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,while the concept is great the large connection required at the bottom would not allow a charging connection for my nexus when it is in it is case i would have had to remove it every time to use it so i think the description needs revised to advise can not be used when the phone is in a case,58,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,pretty cool product and very stilish you would think it would look cheap with the great price but very nice,20,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,i was attracted to this design because it looked like it might work with the phone in it is shell-holster and that was true turns out that my kindles can also sit on this not quite as well which makes a convenient chargingfor them when power runs down,49,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,access on time excellent packaging new as in the description good good good good good good good good good good,20,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,not what i expected at all the opening for the cable is for a computer usb port only so you can use the standard electric charger at all total waste of money,32,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,nice stylish little things got one for my girlfriend and then my self she has gs3 and i have lumia 920,21,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i wou would not recommend thid device as i had a hard time removing the connector to plug into so i am sure it may work for other but i could not get it to connect,36,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,not as cool as it looks online not worth 20 also the cord for it could be a little longer,20,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,it is functional while being easy on the eyes and not take up lots of space i used it at work and it was great for attaching to my pc comes with a usb cable and the stand promptly delivered and well packaged,43,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i was expecting something a little better but the mount could break if you pushed it too much with your finger honestly i wasted my money on this thing the only thing that seems to be working to expectations is the data cable on this,45,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,once i figured out how to put it together so that the plug fit properly not upside down it works great in the photos it looks like lucite it is clear plastic and the reason i gave it four stars was that from the pictures and description i was expecting something a little sturdier although as it is it does it is job well,63,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,i love this charger set with it is unique style however i had to give it to my friend after i purchased an otterbox defense case for my samsumg ii with the otterbox i can not set the phone on the charger it is now too bulky i wish the charger prong was long so i can set the phone on it with the otterbox i can still use it but i would have the remove the otterbox casing everytime however the product is strudy and cute as soon as one of my co-workers saw it on my desk she immediately wanted to know where i got it from and then she ordered one too,112,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,at first thisis likable because its strait forward and very universal over time you will start to hate it because its tricky to seat the phone right to get a good connection if your phone vibrates at all while docked it often comes unseated and stops charging i have woken up many times to have a dead phone used with galaxy nexus,64,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,i had high hopes for thisstation i had read reviews complaining if instability but since my main intent was to simply sync and charge my galaxy s2 i figured this was a good option i wanted a simple and stylishthat would fit my phone with a hard case this ended up not being it theuses an awkward plastic piece that the usb cable fits into as stated the us cable included is white which clashed with the style of the black station the little plastic holder snaps into place but is an awkward fit the little plastic tabs broke right off of it while trying to juggle the piece this resulted in one cut thumb a lot of inappropriate language on my part and an unusableI am returning it and giving up on finding athat will actually fit the phone with it is cover ultimately the cover is way more important to me and no one seems capable of what i would think would be a simple design feat a uswith an adjustable plug and base,187,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,the product is as advertised with 1 big flaw it is so light and top heavy that unless you hold down the base in some fashion pushing on the phones screen causes the unit and the phone to tip backwards and fall over needs to have a wider and heavier base to prevent that from happening other than that it is a decent,62,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,three stars only because it does not work with the new galaxy s3 i purchased it for birthday present i tried it with both the tpu gel cover on and off and it does not change the amount of contact with the cable end at the bottom of thea good thing meaning you can use thiswith some covers when it did not work with that phone i tried it with my galaxy nexus with a tpu gel cover on and it works fine both phones have the same charging cable and wall adapter so it does not really make sense I shall keep it for my nexus buy something else for the s3 it is an otherwise nice-looking functional charging1 star for galaxy s3 5 stars for galaxy nexus 3 stars or something like that sinjimoru sync standcradle holder with usb cable for iphone 4 4s 3 g 3gs and ipod black,158,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this is exactly as it looks and will hold up your phone i have a galaxy nexus and i wanted a stand for work so i could see it better my only complaint i do not think you can remove the cord it comes it the part that hooks into the actual phone is encased in plastic this means if you want a longer cord you need to work with what you got you can not simply replace it,77,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,do not waste your money stopped charging after two months when you place the phone on it it becomes top heavy and falls over easily does not come with wall adapter so you have to supply that yourself,37,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this stand is stylish the base supports the phone well in portrait and landscape orientations the charging cable fits snugly in a quick release type of holder so it can be disassembled and used to charge the phone when it is laying in landscape mode my only gripe is that the charging cable for the black stand is white i would not recommend this stand for people with thick cases like the otter box since the case thickness prevents the cable end from reaching the phone,85,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,looks fancy and very efficient to use as galaxy nexus docking and battery charging device it is a must-haveif you are galaxy user,25,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,a little unstable in portrait mode i only use it as a bedside holder as i use my phone as an alarm clock so it is no problem,27,89
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i bought this charger for the new galaxy 3 the charger is great looking as portrayed in the photos and cool to use a a night side side so you can easily use as an alarm clock in the morning unfortunately beyond that the functional is a bit lacking the charger will not charge the new galaxy with a case on because the usb connector is too short it also tends to topple over frequently since the phone makes the charger top heavy it is also difficult to take off the charger with one hand which in cumbersome when you are running out in the morning it seems to work a little better with my older galaxy since it is smaller but still does not really get the job done,129,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,the device works fine and is very stable but it is a bit hard to seat the phone as there is no guide to direct the phone power connection to the chord connection,33,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,one might wish the sinjimoruto be heavier and i do find myself picking it up in order to use my phone while it is docked but then again the galaxy s ii is extremely light itself what i find odd is the claim that you can watch a movie in landscape mode yes but in the illustration you may notice that the phone is no longer plugged in it can be done but one must disassemble the charging cord first having a white phone and sinjimorus white power cord the combination looks quite geeky on my desk for maximum effect consider plugging in a pair of headphones,110,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i really expected it to be a lot more it is much smaller than i although it was and when the phone is resting on the charger it tips over very easy the chord was far too short and i found it hard to find a nice place within chord length to put it it looks nice but is not the best,62,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,do not buy looks good but it does not last had for only a week and the housing broke and charger quit working,23,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,have been using this about a week now and it was worth every penny i only have a single negative thing about this the part the usb cable docks into is a bit tight if you are on the move a lot with your phone and need the cable for more than just athis may not be the best solution for you as the cable is a tad bit troublesome to get out of it is home when fully setup,81,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,the box says it is made in korea but the cable says it is made in china then the cable does not match the stand it is not possible to place it and i finally broke mine,36,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,this stand looks nice but tips over easily i think there should be more weight added to the bottom overall the case accomplished it is task,25,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,theis very nice looking and works as advertised in combination with locale andclock software i use it as an equivalent to androidon my desk,30,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,a gift for my brother-in-law that is so great I am ordering one for my sister now so she will stop stealing his quick service and quality product I am very impressed with this seller,32,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this a stylish looking stand that can be used not only to charge but as a usb connection to your computer it fits all styles of phones with a mini usb connection the cord in the stand can be placed facing either front or back i canmy phone with it is case on galaxy nexus but i sometimes feel the stand is a little unstable my phone is taller than most 465 in screen so this may not be an issue for most i never worry if it is just sitting on the stand but when i try to use it while docked the stand will either slide or start to tip aesthetically it looks very nice near my computer setup it can be used even when i upgrade my phone as long as it is not to an iphone and it was cheaper than thedesigned specifically for my phone i am happy with my purchase and would make it again if the product could be improved to provide more stability it would definitely be 5 stars,179,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i personally do not care for this stand nor would i recommend it if all you want is a nightstand to charge your phone and keep it off surfaces then ok but that would be the only reason i recommend it i do not hate it but i do not like it either the main complaint i have is that it is just too unstable with your s2 in it it is pretty much at risk of being knocked over with any touch or brushing against the cable and more honestly so if you simply want a nightstand and charger and you will never plan on touching it while docked then go ahead but i like to interact with my phone more often when it is docked so for me this is a pass you decide based on your needs but I shall be looking elsewhere and selling this ac,141,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,meant to buy the iphone version but got this by accident decided to keep it for chargning my gnexus at night so far works well pretty easy tothe phone a little hard to undock with one hand although no major complaints although,44,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i bought this product expecting to have a safe place to charge my s2 but it is not safe at all it moves a lot and it may damage the charging slot i stoped using it after 5 mins not recommended,41,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,product did not come with the usb cable returned the product and will never buy anything from this company ever again,21,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this charger is good for the office but just so everyone knows it is not the smoothest connection to your galaxy s2 i think that is peanuts compared to having a charger ready on your desk for a phone that does drain pretty quick,44,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,purchased this for a galaxy nexus usb charging cord did not charge and the stand is very lightweight causeing the phone to fall over with any slight movement purchased toat my desk for easyand removeal on a day-to-day basis but wayyy too lightweight and does not charge,51,106
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,does not work with the samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket cheap looking flimsy hard to insert phone intohad to return,20,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,since the gnex from verizon is so new it is hard to find a lot of options for docking chargers fortunetly even with the bad reviews this one works great yes it is a very light flimsy plastic with a short usb cord but it holds up the gigantor gnex and charges it no problem been using it for 2 months now with no issues can not beat it for the price,69,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,the aesthetics on this stand are quite nice unfortunately it is cheaply made and only lasted about a month before it took a spill and plastic snap thingy for that holds the wire in place literally exploded into tiny bits it was not a huge fall not even 2 feet from the coffee table to the floor so i threw the stand out but still thought i had an extra charging cable but this last week that crapped out too all in all this product did not even last 3 months it is a shame i really dig the design overall but do not waste ur money,106,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,first this stand does not include a wall charger the description does state a usb cable is included which i took to mean it came as an addiitonal feature a regular micro usb wall charger will not fit into the base so you will need a cube wall charger that a usb cable will fit into also for a stand charger the usb cable is kind of short as for the design it is clever in it is appearance but really unsuitable for the nexus galaxy the phone is too tall and as a result top heavy for this relatively small stand making placing and removing the phone a delicate two handed operation the stand should be twice as big with a weighted bottom for such a small phone,128,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,thisis an abomination to man it is horrid the people that made it should be put out of business it is not meant for the samsung galaxy s ii the phone does not sit in it well at all the connector has a bump around the base of the micro usb port such that the phone wobbles the entire while it is docked this gives the feeling like it i damaging theconnector on your phone this is a complete waste of money the company should pay you to use it,93,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i purchased thisfor my samsung galaxy s ii skyrocket 4 g android phone at t theworks the cable works however theis made for thicker phones this means that the only thing supporting the phone when it is docked is the usb connector it is also difficult to pull the phone off of the connector which means that something will likely get damaged over the long run it has not happened yet but,78,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,came in just in time for christmas to give to the person i bought it for looks great and i might be planning to buy one for myself,28,113
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,i just received thisand i found it very unuseful very sensitive and extremely lite you can not push any buttons unless you are using two hands but i like theof smcdonald in az who glued the base of this stand i might try that,50,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,i leave it at work it is small and does not take up a lot of space on my desk glad i purchased it,22,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i purchased one of these and was reasonably happy initially i purchased a second but it had a defective usb cable which is integral with the docking connector the first one lasted about a month but the connection started getting sloppy it no longer reliably connects to the phone unless the phone is sitting perfectly straight and remains undisturbed making it useless for operation while docked i do not recommend this product i suspect this issue will show up eventually in any unit due to the design it simply needs more support than is designed in,96,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,this product is currently the only one of it is kind for the samsung galaxy s2 so i bought it by default i like theof it but it is poorly engineered only the usb jack holds the phone in place this means that when you try to interact with the phone while it is docked it wobbles badly having so much weight and tension on the mini usb port is a tremendous engineering oversight and will likely become trouble some day soon the curved design is nice but it is made from acrylic so it is exponentially lighter than it should be this means that when you try to interact with the phone while it is docked it likes to scoot around all models of this phone are black and the base is black but for some reason the included proprietary cable is bright white it is an annoying incongruence as soon as someone comes out with a sturdier model I shall leave this one behind,164,117
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,the design of this device is cool but the device itself is extremely flimsy and it is difficult to sit the telephone samsung galaxy s2 on it it needs more weight in the base part of the problem is that the micro or mini-usb port that it utilizes requires that the phone be speared onto it but again if theitself had a bit more weight one would not have to chase it across a surface to hook it up i suspect there are better alternatives,85,118
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i had hopes for this little stand i was 30 cheaper than the samsung stand i do not mind that the included cable does not allow data transfer it only charges the phone the bigger issue for me is the stability of the stand with the phone and the fit of the connection to the phone the design of the plug does not allow the phone to fit all the way down and sit flush with the holder this allows the phone to tilt left or right very unstable also the size of this phone for this stand is to big it wants to fall over backwards if touched this is not worth 20 999 maybe is a better price for it i give it 2 stars because it actually does charge the phone and it will hold the phone in place if you do not touch it i am sure i can modify the stand a little but if you pay 20 for something as simple as a phone stand you do not expect to have to modify it to work as expected,179,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this one stays at my office and charges my phone while I am at my desk it goes great with the phillips fidelio docking app for android i should probably mention that the phone is a little wobbly in the stand,40,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,it does what it is designed to do charge the phone like others have stated the base is too light so if you are charging the phone and need to work on the device the base will move or tip over otherwise it is fine,43,121
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my new samsung galaxy s2 and it is just ok the plastic is so lightweight that the slightest nudge will knock the whole thing over since the phone makes it top heavy also plugging the phone in is not the easiest as you have to guide it in every time putting the phone in landscape mode on the stand makes it sit precariously close to theof the lip that holds it in again a slight nudge on top and it slides right out thanks to this stand my phone has fallen to the floor once already if you do not plan on taking it out of the stand often then this may work for you otherwise i would suggest paying the extra money and getting the official,132,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,pros stylish good looking cons 1 short white cable 2 cable is not compatible with data access and communication with your computer will only charge it gives both my windows 7 computers error messages that it does not recognize the connection note i bought 2 of these units 3 m phone the samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket had to have the protective rubber case modified for it to fit properly in the cradle i suspect most phone covers will not allow a proper connection so you must remove the case or modify it as i have since the phone cables do not communicate with my computers windows 7 and samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket having them used with your computer is useless they should have supplied an ac adapter and advertised to be used without a computer this would have been far more honest and accurate i would not rate these items very high,152,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i was drawn to thisbecause it is stylish and not your everyday phoneit charges the phone fine but as soon as you want to interact with your phone it tips over due to the small footprint and the angle of the phone some here mentioned that it slides around mine has a silicone strip on the back foot that keeps it from sliding but unfortunately it creates a pivot point when you push on the screen it just tips over i like theenough that i will not send it back but will get a clear or black piece of plastic to glue theto that will widen the base and stabilize it and as the others mentioned why the white cord when the rest is black edit i did add a 3x5 piece of plexiglass to thei pulled of the silicone strip and super-glued it i also added 4 low profile silicone feet and now thisis usable,168,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,after reading some of the reviews here i decided that this littlewould be great for my sg2 especially because it would let memy phone without removing the case well i was wrong this might work with some cases but not with all of them if your case is thicker than 15 mm to be specific eg d3o sold by tmobile this will not work so please do not be deceived by the you canyour phone without removing the case statement from other reviews pros cheaper than the samsungnice looking easy to assemble lightning fast shipping cons half the price but also half the quality compared to the one by samsung phone with cases which are 15 mm or thicke can not be used with thissgs2 with large screens seem to be a bit unstable,146,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,i bought this liking the style of theand i must say it delivers that it is cute that said with the samsung galaxy ii skyrocket it is a bit too top heavy and the connection does not seat comfortably onto the connector it appears the connector is perhaps too long for the phone the audio given that the speaker is at the bottom of the phone sounds good it echoes back the sound reasonably well i realize others have pointed out that it is only a usb connector i do not have a problem with that i have enough usb blocks laying around that i am never at a want for a place to plug it in my recommendation is if you have 20 laying around and you like style this is a nice generic device but if your phone has to be placed in portrait mode rather than landscape be prepared for tipping,153,126
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,this is a very unstable for the galaxy s2 with the larger phone if you have a smaller phone it might be ok but not pleased with it at all,30,127
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,1.0,negative,at first it worked fine easy to place my sprint epic 4 g touch onto the charging connector although it takes two hands to remove the phone but after 1 week i started getting weird notifications on my phone when i put it on the stand mtp initializing mtp connected and the phone would not charge the charging cable was plugged into a usb ac adapter rather than a computer so the mtp media transfer protocol should not have been activated i am returning thisto amazon for a refund,90,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,this stand is very attractive but i could not get past it having a white cord that you have to use otherwise it is very nice and seems to work well,29,129
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,it really works great for me you can use it on your desk and take a quick look to your agenda emailsusing only one hand while the phone is charge it also looks very cool and you do not need to much space,45,130
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,5.0,positive,works with my galaxy s2 just like the product pictures show charges when placed in vertical position so if you want to watch a movie horizontally while charging you will need another cable but i knew that from the product description so not a prob only con is the cable is white but that is not really an issue stylish and sturdy i would recommend this,64,131
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,i ordered this as it seemed to be a good charging stand for the galaxy s2 and reviews indicated that the phone would fit with a case on got it quickly and the phone does fit with a case no problem the only problem the phone does not charge when the usb cable is connected to the computer not sure what is up with that edit it turns out that the cable was defective it appeared to work for connection to the pc but not to charge i borrowed a blackberry microusb cable and it really did connect kies could find the phone unlike with the defective cable and also charged i have returned the defective unit to amazon,119,132
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,do not get me wrong the stand worked once it was modified however it does have a few serious flaws first and foremost the micro usb cord wrong it is too short you can not reach the floor without buying a usb extension cable the cable can not be easily swapped out because of the micro usb adapters unique shape it is also a white cable which looks cheezy with all my other black cables you have to use your own power adapter because one is not included with the stand that again makes this product incomplete for 50 the better product is the samsung kickstand for the galaxy sii it includes a solid stand an extra battery and a place to charge the battery while it is not in the phone it is not perfect either but is a much better value and looks professional in short i had to add to the sinjimoru stand to make it functional it is not a good value at 20 because there has no more that 3 to 4 cost in this thing,174,133
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,I shall echo some other comments here this is a stylishand one of the very few that you can use with a case on the phone however it is very light which works against it if you actually want to interact with your phone on thepushing on buttons or the screen will just slide thearound you almost have to use two hands to perform any actions while the phone is docked due to the design when docked it becomes very top heavy as well also would prefer it used a standard usb cable instead of a proprietary one which is white ugh and very short so not the most stablemust use included cable and you still need a usb wall charger if you want to charge with ac even with all that it is usable and works with cases i use this one at work and will continue to use the evo powerat home which is a bit heftier but required case removal to use galaxy ii s edit 2 days later i have to make an additional comment thisworks fine if all you want is a stand to charge on or to display your alarm clock in the am but if you want ayou can interact with this is not it i can not even touch my phone in thewithout it sliding tilting toppling twisting and more if you need to actually interact with your phone on ayou will need to pony up for one that has more heft like the evo power or oem version,273,134
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,I am using this for my epic touch 4 g samsung galaxy s2 it works just fine but the phone can be knocked over pretty easily since the base is not very wide the phone slides in easy although I have had other charging docks that were a pain to get the phone into and i have no complaints really,56,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,3.0,neutral,it needs more weight to it feels like the whole phone will tip over when in portrait postion but when you put the phone in landscape position it does not feel like there a secure place for it the mini usb cable that comes with it is way too short it is hard to install and the connectors that secures the usb end to the base feels cheap my biggest gripe is when you try to pick up the phone you will pick up the whole base you will need to use two hands to pry the phone off the base and sometimes it will feel like the thehas a fraking death grip on it,112,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,the stand looks nice but it is not sturdy with the phone inserted it can easily tip over if you place the phone horizontally a tiny movement the phone will slip off the stand it comes with a usb cable it will be great if the cable can be detached from the stand,53,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,4.0,positive,good price and shipping was fast got thein 2 days i happy with the product but i must say it looks better in the picture maybe it is the differentphones,34,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,battery life is roughly double what the stock battery for my electrify offers us cellular model of the photon easily lasts a solid 24 hours of moderate-heavy use during my initial complete discharge cycles it seemed as although it would not die with light use in a battery saving mode this battery could probably last me 5 to 6 days without recharging very pleased on that front because the battery is about 25 times the size of the stock battery it ships with another back cover as another reviewer says it actually makes the phone have a better fit in my hand the only things i find that could be improved upon are that the kickstand is completely inaccessible to me now if you have fingernails this may not be the case for you but i have difficulty also i notice that this backing sticks a bit more than the stock backing in that the stock cover is much easier to remove I am a power user and find myself switching batteries occasionally and I am always nervous that i might break this cover while removing it from the phone it has not happened yet and i doubt it will since it feels pretty solid but there has a chance also the phone itself is having a hard time realizing it has more battery life now i have not found an app or setting yet that helps with this and can give me a solid reading of how much time or what battery percentage i still have left i just know that even when the phone says 5 i still have several hours remaining before the phone dies,273,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,the battery is of course twice as big as the factory installed battery so you need a new back for the phone which is with this purchase with my complete battery saver app installed i have battery all day my stock battery went dead around lunch time and my car charger or another charging source was necessary not with this battery good company also totally warrantied if your not happy with the product at first i just need a cover that protects the phone if it is dropped when u are using it i gave up my otterbox and tried on other design that just did not fit properly,107,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,you need to root your phone and use a battery calculation app or choose to recalibrate the battery i originally was very upset with the upgrade this battery gave me i moved from the stock battery life of 4 hours to about 5 - 55 hours of battery life this is with very heavy usage twitter and facebook constantly syncing gmail pushing notifications and me playing games taxing games like gta or super monkey ball with sound up to a high level after installation i mostly followed the instructions up to 4 cycles not the 5 it asked for not that came with the battery but within about 5 hours i was down to 5 battery life again i came here to complain originally but decided to wait out the 5 full charge and drain cycles while doing so i searched the web about this battery and phone and found out that motorola phones and a few others needed to be calibrated to show an accurate measure of battery life in the status bar i tested this by turning on every radio leaving the screen on at maximum sure enough my phone sat at 5 battery life for the remaining hours of the work day before it died i have not calibrated it yet i will either update or comment on this review within a couple of days after I have successfully done so i just wanted to give this initial information and to confirm that this battery is an excellent investment the other photon extended battery also had some information on this that i am following through with now just know that the other reviews are spot on about the build but were probably written by people that knew to recalibrate the battery or did not pay much attention to it,298,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i use my cell phone a lot and really needed a battery that could last me all day this battery does a great job of that the stock battery would only last me half a day at best but this will last me the entire day the back cover it comes with is also of decent quality which i was presently surprised by,63,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,fits perfect makes the phone noticbly fatter and heavier which is not all bad as it was pretty thin before battery lasts so much better than the original one let us just hope it keeps going and going and going,38,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,i received the package in about 3 days opened it up the case had a slight brokenbut it is ok my problem is that when i tried the battery my photon can not recognize it it says it is an unknown battery i do not know if this happened to any of you or any tips maybe it is a faulty battery,61,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,before i was barely able to run from 7 am to 5 pm i kept gps bt and anything else i could do without turned-off with this battery i now able to run my phone for 26 - 28hrs before charging i used to start sweating at 40 but now at 40 i still have 8 - 12 hrs of time left to play with now i can start taking advantage of the power of android only thing i miss with the extended battery is a case that would fit if anyone reads this and knows of a case that fits the photon with the extended battery please let me know,105,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,it does just as you would expect it too extends your battery life the reason for it being 4 and not 5 stars is purely cosmetic due to the bulk my otterbox cover is essentially useless and it will not fit onto the hd stationwithout removing the back cover i insist on using both so the hyperion will just be my secondary battery the good part about the bulk is that it makes the phone itself slightly more ergonomic battery was received 80 charged and ready to go overall i love it and would recommend it to anyone,101,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,does not hold a charge get a new phone you moron,12,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,the phone does not recognize the battery it goes dead within an hour it looks good and fits well but it is not practical for use,25,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,battery will not charge while inserted in the motorola photon 4 g message reads battery will not charge because this is not a motorola photon approved battery replace with a motorola battery,31,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,ordered this hoping to get extra life out of my phone when i am away for a long day does not work with my car charger which is a window mount holder it does not fit the thickness of the phone doubles with this I am back to a regular battery might use this to carry around as a backup battery,59,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,at first it lasted a little longer then the factory one the factory one already a year old this one slowly declined and a year later it is completely dead will not take a charge at all put the factory one back in that is now 2 years old still going strong your much better off with the factory one,58,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this is a must have product if you own a motorola photon it provides a longer lasting battery charge and gives a more weightier and and solid feel to your phone it is really like getting a completely new phone,39,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,after about 6 months one day i opened my phone and I am glad i did because i seen that this battery was bulging out as if it was going to pop like a balloon it never really performed much better than the standard battery anyway i switched back to the tried and true method of alternating between 2 standard batteries using an external charger to charge one while i use the other i recommend this method as opposed to cheap so called extended batteries,84,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,the battery is better but it should explain better why it should be over charged because i have been taught not to overcharge it also i am not happen that the case is so cheaply made it already cracked and the only way to get a replacement is to order another batter offer replacements,54,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,the battery works better than the oem battery and the back that comes with it fits the phone with the battery installed it could use some foam padding like the oem back in case the phone gets dropped / jarred especially since phone cases for photon / electrify will not fit with the extended battery and back installed,53,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,battery and cover came as pictured it adds a decent amount of thickness to the phone but it is usable the back cover is pretty flimsy the bottom section of the plastic that goes underneath the kickstand broke off almost immediately after the first two or three times removing the back cover luckily the rest of the cover still snaps onto the phone despite the lack of plastic under the kickstand the battery itself starts off great and has a long life i think a lot of the negative reviewers saying it had no effect just did not recalibrate the battery meter however after about a month or so of moderate to heavy phone usage the battery life deteriorated quickly daily uptime ends up being approximately as long as the stock battery it is replacing or slightly longer,137,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for a replacement battery this is a good option but I am not noticing much improvement in battery life i am still required to kill all apps if i do not want a dead phone within a couple hours,41,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,battery does not give me any additional charge rooted my phone as suggested and still no improvement just a big bulky back which loses contact causing phone to power down,30,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,I have only had this for a few months and it already overheated and expanded inside the case breaking the back i went back to the factory battery i honestly can not tell a difference in capacity anyway,36,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,i need to retirm it for another one it does not last as long as my original worn out one,20,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,I have had other extended batteries in my phone that just did not work that long this battery fits and holds the charge for at least all day with other batteries I have needed to recharge in the middle of the day sometimes more than once very happy so far with hyperion,49,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,the product works but not like i expected i thought it last much longer but i gave it a try,20,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,battery arrived as advised by amazon battery operating perfectly fine and i can usually get a full 2 days out of it with minimal use on days when I am heavly using my phone during the day and evening i do not have to recharge it until almost 10 or 11 at night i recommend buying this extended battery if you need one the case provided is made from plastc so it will not protect your phone as well as other cases and the tabs do break really easy if you are not careful when you have to remove it,96,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,the battery does increase the life of the phone and the added bulk to the phone is not terribly distracting but the cheapness of the back cover voids the positive aspects of the extended battery the camera / flash area is susceptible to additional dirt and the interior sides because a lot of additional glare that ruins any photos where the flash is used the back cover is made of cheap plastic and snapped in half when switching out the batteries was not able to repair the replacement cover which makes the extended battery unusable if you can avoid breaking the cover then this may be a good value but you will need to use extra caution,112,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,i was better off with the original battery maybe it was just this one i do not know zero lemon batteries are much better i recommend them,26,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i can not believe how fast i got this and it definitely more than doubled my time between chargings and yet takes less than half the time to charge compared with the original battery even when that was new the new case back that came with it cracked the first time i took it off since it is so thin by the phone stand by the design of the phone overall i would definitely recommend this to anyone and when i change phones i will immediately by a new extended life battery from hyperion and recommend them to my friends and relatives that need new batteries,105,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,i bought this battery as a replacement for my motorola photons original battery which was beginning fade the battery life with the hyperion lasted a shorter amount of time than the nearly 2 year old original battery this battery only got worse over the few weeks i have used it the battery will suddenly dive from 40 life to dead i contacted the seller who agreed to accept thefor a refund they did not provide a return shipping label the cost for me to ship thisback was nearly the cost of theitself update shortly after the writing of the above review i was contacted by dan at hyperion who refunded my purchase and shipping costs this is an example of exceptional customer service the best I have experienced with this i would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again thank you due to this i increased my star rating from one to four,160,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,for being double the size and weight it lasted 1/2 the stock battery would have returned it but after putting the cover on and taking it off the bottom lip sheared right off,33,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,ordered two both back covers fit as they should but one of the two batteries did not last more than three weeks while they seem to have just a little more life when new than the stock battery it did not extend the life worth the extra weight of the over sized battery to me,54,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,this product arrived earlier than expected this battery when i received it in may of 2013 was the perfectit charged good it was healthy and show no physical signs of defects about a month later the battery has been shorting out my phone and cutting it off it will provide the extra battery life it does describe but your phone can not read it accurately without an battery app i do not know maybe i just received a bad battery the battery case that comes along with the phone is ok it will fit the phone but god forbid you take it off the case will reattach fine but the bottom lip where the kickstand is not stay on although i can not recommend this product i ask that you do not dismiss it,132,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,it is nice not to have to plug my phone in every few hours or deal with a dead phone since smart phones use a lot of battery so this helps a lot,32,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,ordered in aug 2012 worked ok for 6 months lasted much longer than stock battery i did not use the phone for about 6 weeks so the phone battery was completely dead plugged it into the charger overnight and in the morning the phone would still not turn on opened the back cover and the battery was bulging out in the middle like it was about to pop this battery is junk,71,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,my husband purchased this for his phone loves it his phone is for work and he uses it 24 hours a day so he needs a long lasting battery and this is a great product he is very happy,39,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,this battery is just as bad as the original battery no reason to buy and waste of money on this,20,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,i had got one for my s3 and it worked great unfortunately the photon is a battery hog so it did not help as much as i had hoped,28,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,works better then stock battery i can now make it until mid afternoon to charge back up major thing making this a 3 star for me is the cheap crapy new back that is included / required the reviews i read before purchase warned of this problem so i was careful in putting the new back on and it was fantastic nice and snug fitting unfortunately less then a week after getting the hyperion battery my photon 4 g totally crashed no surprise worst phone ever i had to remove the battery to reboot the phone and now the cover will not go back on correctly the bottom will not snap back in it is extremely frustrating now when i hold the phone there is a clicking noise as the bottom moves around i really hope that hyperion / amazon does something to remedy this situation i am to the point now that i am going to go back to the lousy stock battery also i have tried all the tricks mentioned to have my non-rooted photon recognize the new larger battery but have not been able to accomplish it as of this time not a real problem although because i have been getting phone to last at full functionality for approximately 3 hours after 5 battery warning so no harm no foul obviously the fact you need the new back will render all of your cases for the photon useless and it does make the phone thicker and noticeably heavier i personally like the new feel once again the battery life i have gained is 5 star if only hyperion would have increased investment in the new back from the 2 cents to say a dime it would be a total 5 star in my book,294,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,sorry but this product just add bulk and it keeps the phone at same time that a oem battery i do not like it,23,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,battery lasted for a couple of months and started losing charge would not buy it again never got great charge out it either,23,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,with the original battery on my motorola photon g i was lucky if i got a day very worthwhile purchase,20,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,the shipping was super quick and the battery is working very well great product as long as you are ok with either not knowing exactly when your battery will die since the battery gauge is based upon the normal size battery or are savvy enough to change the root files so your battery gauge recognizes the extended battery,58,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i do not normally leave reviews but this time i had to 2nd time I have bought this samefrom hyperion a factory battery averaged about 15 hours runtime i get about 32 hours runtime with this battery the first time i ordered 3 business days later it was in my mailbox everything correct worked great this time when i ordered i received the right back cover but the wrong battery one email to customer service and the correct battery was on the way 2 days later i received the battery along with a prepaid label to return the mistake i do not think you can ask for anything more a quality product and great customer service,115,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,i was very excited to get the extended battery but i feel that i did not get much more extension than what i was getting with my regular battery even after completely draining the extended battery it would also make my phone cut off randomly my phone started restarting itself all the time i could not even put it down on the table without the phone restarting i took it to the sprint store and tried reseating the battery myself but to no avail,83,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,i would not suggest you buy this unless you are rooted and on a different rom stock 235 does not play well with this,24,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,i do not think the bigger battery gave me any more battery life then a new little battery word one two three,21,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,this battery lasted a few months and it was a great battery while it lasted then one day i noticed a black circle in the middle of my screen and if i pressed on or around it would distort the screen so i took out of battery to discover that it had expanded inside my phone pushing the back of the phone against the screen causing the damage,68,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,the battery lasts longer than the standard battery it was a very simple installation and charging routine i would reccomend it,21,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,battery worked pretty good for the 1st 2 - 3 months except you were not sure when the phone was going to turn off since when it got to 1 battery left in my new battery app it stayed on for another 1 - 2 hours after the 90 day warranty was up i noticed my phone starting to turn off or resetting randomly at 1st i thought it was my phone but the sprint store tech told me to try seeing if it turns off / resets with the original phone battery sure enough i tested it out and it never turns off like with this extended battery i learned that extended batteries sometimes lose ability to make good contact due to the contacts becoming loose so i started putting a small piece of cardboard paper between the battery and back cover to make a tighter fit for battery contact and that seemed to significantly reduce the of power off / resets but now the back cover is starting to become loose and no longer makes a good clamped seal,173,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,decent battery worked well for a few months ended up expanding physically and losing a lot of life after about 6 months of use,24,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this extended battery turns your phone into a work of art this device works fantastic i highly recommend this product the frustration of charging your cell phone is over,29,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,not happy with battery and case have sold phone battery makes phone too bulky and battery life does not respond properly,21,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,effectively doubles the life of my photon make sure you recalibrate the battery properly or it will not read the charge right opening the kick stand is difficult with the included back cover,32,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,i really wanted to make it work because i had a terrible time getting through the day on 1 battery went through the whole circus of conditioning the battery to give it a real chance but i could not get much more out of this one than a new one of the standard size i did give it an extra star because it was as good as the original battery but for much cheaper and the new back cover fits pretty well it just did not peform for me like i thought it would have,93,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,lasted about 2 months and then died would not hold a charge at all the cover that came with it broke when i removed it from my phone to take the dead battery out stick with oem batteries,37,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,although it does make it heavier and larger the cover is sleek enough that it seems like it could have been how the phone was made stock battery life is no longer an issue it can two full days with moderate use,42,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,i thought i was going to have longer battery life so not the case only lasts about 8 hours about a 1/3 less than the standard batter when i advised the company they are sending me a new battery to replace the obviously defective one and have advised i need to charge / discharge 5 6 times before it reaches it is full capacity how cool is that,68,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,i wanted a longer run time for my phone i found this extended battery at amazon thought I had give a try maybe I am running many apps but i really do not see that much of a difference maybe after a little longer trying this out for the price it is alright,51,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,insatallation battery conditioning and reliability are all easy and excellent i am a bit miffed how doubling the size of the battery simply does not give you twice as much battery endurance sure there are a multitude of factors but i used to get 17 hours per charge with my stock 1750 mah battery but i only get 28 with the 3500 mah battery even with identical settings anyway 28 is still better than 17 so i am whining a little the other thing i do not like about this battery is that there are no phone cases that are available this is a huge issue for me as I am a bit overprotective of my phone,114,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,godo battery life better then oem by a long shot the back cover is not very flexible and it is a bit bulky makes the phone twice as thick pretty much overall well worth the money if ya need more juice went from 4 hours charge at work to 8hours while at work if you do not use it as much this battery can last a while,65,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,after a lot of patience and trying various things mentioned in other reviews i came to conclusion that this product is down right useless does not hold charge more than a six hours with 3 g on and super light browsing my year old original battery worked well i tried to contact seller to replace hoping that it was a lemon and there was no response from them my friend owns a similar phone and he was planning to order the same battery i asked him to avoid this company i am looking to other alternative big capacity batteries for photon will update the review when i find one which works,110,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,this battery let us me go from 9 am to 10 pm on moderate to heavy business use my stock battery only lasts about 5 hours without a charge a lot of people mention needing to root your phone which is not true if you buy the right app go to google play and search battery monitor widget pro i paid less than 2 for the app and it let us me setup battery profiles for my stock battery and my new hyperion battery and sets the appropriate percentage of life you have left pros essentially doubles my battery life works great when paired with battery monitor wiget pro cons if you use aor caryou will not be able to use it unless you put your stock battery back in the included cover is a bit tricky to remove,139,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,i thought this was for the photon q but it is just the regular photon realized my phones battery is actually good as it is so i did not need this but if i did have the regular photon i would have loved this to protect my camera better and longer battery time mistake on my part,55,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this product works great more than doubled my battery life when you first install and charge the battery the charge indicator will show it discharging just as fast as your old battery this is because you must train the android os to read the battery correctly the charge will go down to 1 and then stay there for hours before running out of power you need to completely charge and then completely discharge the battery until the phone turns off 5 or 6 times after you do this the os will update the battery file and the charge indicator will give a true reading of the battery be patient and follow the procedure you will not be disappointed,118,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i wanted to correct my previous review i previously said this battery life was the sane as stock battery when in fact it is been going strong all day and still going strong very happy indeed with this purchase,38,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,phone lasts over a day now it does require you to calibrate which is far easier if you are rooted so keep that in mind,24,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this battery is probably 3 times longer duration than the stock battery followed the instructions on running it down and recharging got stronger / longer till about the third time now it seems that it lasts about 10 hours for talk time and 24 - 30 hours just idle new back cover works fine and i have had no problem with breakage although it is a bit difficult to remove at times,68,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,battery life is not much better than the standard one hard to tell if it is better without recalibration i wish i did not waste my money on it,28,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,i just received this battery on saturday and completely charged it after having it for 4 days i would have to say this battery does not work any better then the one that comes with the phone i do not use gps or anything that will run down my battery all i do is talk on the cell phone or text I am very disappointed,61,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i was skeptical at first about buying thisafter reading all of the reviews about how horrible the quality is of the back cover but I am proud to say I have owned this case for a couple weeks now and after taking the back off multiple times i have yet knock on wood to break the back cover also the battery lasts 2x as long as the original and that is with running pandora facebook and plenty of other high battery-draining apps i highly recommend this battery to anyone who is looking to add extra battery life to their photon the only problem i have is i have yet to figure out how to calibrate the battery with the phone os I have watched a bunch of youtube videos rooted my phone and still can not figure it out so if anyone knows how to do it please let me know,148,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,i purchased this battery to upgrade my stock battery which i found to die very quickly I am a android power user and i needed some extra juice to keep my phone on when i wanted and needed it and this battery does just that some complaints however the back cover is not as solid as the stock cover the internal clips break easily but the overall quality is decent this adds a lot of bulk to the phone for me if i need life over design i swap this battery into the phone however i try to stick with the slim battery when i can just because of personal preference overall a very good product which meets my needs as a power user,123,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,a two-toned phone just get this it is listed for my phone but my phone comes in only black and the back is medium graytape works better,26,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,i bought this battery six months ago it did a good job of extending my phones battery life it is not working as well as it used to but it is still a big improvement i would probably buy it again tried another brand of extended battery it was dead on arrival so this is probably the best one for now,60,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,yeah these guys are awesome i ordered this and asked for 2 - 3 day delivery i did not get it for about a week i contacted the company and let them know they refunded all of my shipping costs after 35 days i was not getting the performance from this battery that was advertised i contacted the company and explained what was going on they said no problem and shipped me a new battery they did not fight me on it and the package came quicker than the first round now a while later i can say that this product performs as advertised if you do not have a rooted phone let your batter go down to 5 you will see if will stay there for hours,124,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,the battery was shipped fast and i got it fast but the battery does not last any longer than the 1700 mah that came with the phone i charged it just like the instructions said but i can not tell any difference in it and the 1700 mah battery,47,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,it seems that too good to be true is just that i was excited to find such a great price on an extended life battery the vendor was prompt on shipping and the product was in new condition as promised i followed the exact instructions for charging included with the battery however it seemed to exhaust very quickly i charged it again but just as before the battery held no power i took it to a local electronics store to run a diagnostic test the battery could not even complete the diagnostic and the message came back with a critical fault it appears that the battery had a problem internally and i had no option but to return it the vendor was prompt in refunding my money and they were very good to deal with i like to think that this was a one-off situation,145,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,the battery for this product is awesome they say to kill the battery a few times after the initial charge that was a challenge after all day running bluetooth streaming music checking the interweb and making calls i was forced to open nine programs turn the screen on 100 brightness and leave it on until 6 am when it finally died the battery lasts forever the cover is great unless you try to take it off the section underneath the kickstand is rather fragile and will snap off easily,87,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,this battery easily doubled my battery life i get about it 15 to 18 hours a day with heavy use i i waiting to see if it will get any better some of the reviews I have read said they did not charge their phone for two days straight I have had mine for exactly one week and that has not happened yet but hopefully i will get those same results,67,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,read the review about these batteries about a year ago and bought a pair i should have just bought a factory motorola battery before i bought this garbage completely a waste followed their charge instructions to tee yet these batteries last 35 - 45 minutes while just using pandora i even have an app killer and removed every program on my phone that i could still this battery lasted 1 1/4 hours tops horrible product from very misleading company,77,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,i know people like to get to the pros and cons the most so I shall just put that first pros adds a lot more life to your phone obviously you do not have to charge as much if your phone is rooted you can calibrate the battery to give a accurate level cons you have to let your phone die 5 - 9 times before it manualy calibrates you may get inpatient waiting for it to die over and over and over great battery to buy if your not ready to upgrade and you want to prolong your phones life and with a few modification you can emulate the photon q after you root it and use the jelly bean rom and add this battery and over clock it you have a whole new animal hope this helped,135,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,I have had this for a week now and it consistently lasts over twice as long as the stock battery did the only quirk is that the phones battery indicator does not know how to measure the remaining power left in this battery so it goes down to the lowest level red and then sits there for a good 10 - 14 hours of heavy usage afterward about 24 hours total in my experience i can assure you this batter will last 2 - 3 longer than your stock photon battery at an amazing price but I have only had it for a week so i do not know what it will be like ina few months but even if it stops working after a few months 16 is still a bargain,124,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,others have said they are not getting a good battery life out of theirs but mine has been excellent with the exception of streaming music all day but i still get longer life my battery will last most of the day i will generally have to recharge around 6 - 8 but i use my phone quite a bit texting phone calls looking up info playing a few online games it has gotten weaker a bit over the last 6 months but not by much the battery quality i would say is a 45 the replacement back is another story this thing started breaking within the first week or two first the tabs that hold it into place and now the entire bottom piece that goes around the kick is completely broken off and since no tabs are there to hold it on i need to be careful i have no means to get a hold of customer service to find out if i can order a new back my battery is fine so i have no need to order another battery not sure what the best option is will add star if can get another back cover,196,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,after receiving this extended battery i followed the instructions and charged it for a solid 12 hours and then tried to drain the battery each time as much as possible without allowing my phone to go completely dead the first few days it was getting very low by the time i went to bed but i thought it just was not broken in yet however it is been a few weeks now and this battery is still almost fully drained after 1 day and I am a moderate user i might be on the phone for a total of 10 minutes in a day i only have a few apps that are auto updating like gmail and facebook but this battery just do not last any longer than my old original battery that came with the phone,133,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,the extended battery i received really does not seem any different than the original phone battery not sure if it was worth it,22,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,so the battery has been in my phone for a few weeks and it is little better then the stock battery by maybe a halfthia one does not get super hot like my old stock battery but do not take the battery out when u remove the cover it will break 1st time a few mind after i installed battery n cover i took off cover and it broke cover is not reinforced near the kick stand now i have tape holding it together can not anyone make quality merchandise,88,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,excellent extended battery so far it looks like it last for ever battery cover is hard plastic and could be a problem but the company is very reliable and if any problem the fix it right away so i will buy again without hesitation i give them 5 stars because the company stand by is product and it last a long time note phone battery meter will not read this battery life lost half the power after 4 months,79,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this battery works great i bought this for a friend who uses her phone a lot and the battery holds up all day,23,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,purchased this with high hopes was very disappointed as it did not last much longer than the original battery i have done several charge / deplete cycles without any real improvement i have contacted this merchant and still awaiting a reply and hopefully an exchange as the majority of users are seeing large improvements in battery life edit 08/20/2012 hyperion has reached out to me and will be sending me a new battery without asking for the original battery this is great customer service and have added a star to my rating,90,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,during the week my stock battery would only last 6 - 7 hours before needing almost a full charge part of this maybe due to the fact that i work in a sound booth my phone probably used a lot of power searching for 3 g i bought this extended battery pack and on my 4th day am happy to say i have not had to charge my phone at all during the day i charge overnight everynight i have not yet rooted my phone or found a battery monitor to account for the increase in battery capacity so my phone stays at 1 charge for a few hours it has not yet shut down on me due to a complete drainage i am a heavy user checking email some calls facebook online apps movies / music over wifi at home and picture taking / video i definitely recommend this product if you have a motorola photon good quality and price considering i almost bought an extended battery through seidio for 69 the expanded case actually makes the phone easier to hold and if you must use a protective case the silicone gel cases work well,189,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,when i received the extended battery i was very excited but quickly disappointed the battery did not last longer than the manufacturers battery that came with my phone i notified the seller and they immediately sent me another and told me to just throw the other away the 2nd battery came in record time but unfortunately it was no better than the first I am not happy with the product but i commend the seller for responding so quickly and trying to satisfy me that goes a long way i still have the battery which i do not intend to return it is just not worth the hassle for me,106,89
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,advertised as a 3500mah battery performance during charging and use proves this to be a 2200mah battery labeled as 3500mah 33 better than a 1650mah oem battery but far short of the 3500mah that is advertised disappointed by false advertising if they had advertised it as 2200mah i would have been happy i hate the bait and switch the cover is good quality and fits well,66,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,i ordered this extended battery but it does not have the extended battery life i was expecting it is jus as bad as any other droid battery,25,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,it is a great battery for the money i had problems with the first one i got but i messaged there customer service and i got a new one fast and the new ones been working great i do not need to plug my phone in during the day anymore oh and it comes with a 90 day warranty so if you get a bad one hyperion will take care of you,70,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this battery is awesome for the price you can not go wrong after properly charging and discharging the battery per instructions it will last anywhere from 16 - 20hours of heavy use in my experience my stock battery would only last about 8 i have the motorola electrify and i needed to download the battery monitor widget app to get a proper battery without the app the phone will only register 1650mah the amount of the original battery so even when the phone says you have 0 you will really have half the battery left with judicious phone use this battery will easily last 2 days the battery and extended case do make the phone a lot thicker but i feel the trade off is completely worth it i do not have to worry about keeping a charger with me everywhere i go anymore i highly recommend this battery to all motorola photon and electrify owners,152,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,i received the battery faster than they had estimated and installed it in my phone it fit fine with the new back they provided but the phone did not work as long with the new battery as it did with the original i used amazons report damaged or defective material to tell hyperion about the problem and they quickly sent me a new battery which has been working fine the phone runs appreciably longer than with the original which is why i bought the new battery,85,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,i have ordered several brands of the extended life batteries these two have lasted 4 - 5 months and are still going both phones do not appear to have any excessive services running and were used by salesmen who were on the phone many times during the day,46,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,the first battery i received did not work battery working time even shorter than motorola battery which come with the phone i wrote email to customer service and they reply the email in few hours they sent another battery to me the replace battery i received works very well give 4 star just because the first battery i received did not work,62,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,was good for about 3 - 4 months then my phone would not recognize it any more could reset phone for a while and would work then it just would not recognize it at all,33,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,1.0,negative,this is total crap the battery gave me little to no life within about 6 hours of using it it was dead i followed all the steps calibrated just as a should and still nothing of course i tried to contact hyperion about my frustration and they have not contacted me back yet it is only been 3 days when they should reply immediately horrible constomer service horrible product never wasting my time with this company again,74,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,3.0,neutral,twice the talk time and i can play angry birds until I am tired of playing it witht he extra weight and new back cover although it is a little bit of a pain to make it fit into protective covers and holsters i can no longer use the charging hdmi stand with the new battery installed so i still need to keep the old battery charged in order to use the functions and items i bought the photon for,79,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,for the price it is a fantastic product especially for the price the new phone cover closely mimics the original material something i did not quite expect and is welcomed overall life has been excellent still have not run it dead over the course of the past two days only downside is the battery gauge becomes useless in stock form as it will sit at low battery around the half-way mark but that is more the fault of the phone and not the battery,81,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,2.0,negative,per instructions i charged to 100 left it on for an extra 3 hours let it completely die did this four times even did it a fifth time for good measure I have had it for about a week now and it is already dying by 230pm and by dying i mean it powers off around 300 it does not just say 5 I am charging it to 100 and leaving it on an extra 3 hours too that is only 6 hours I am pretty sure that is what my oem battery was getting also i never calibrated it because the only way to do it legitimately is to flash a new bootloader which inadvertently disables the 4 g function of your photon i kinda want that so none of the market apps work even if you are rooted oh well at least my phones more ergonomic i really like it that is what my second star is for,151,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,this battery lasts all day long whereas the original would only last half a day i get about 13 - 15 hours and i would say i am a moderate to heavy user of my cell phone i read the news on it a lot thoughout the day text and email multiple times an hour my phone is no longer constantly needing to be plugged in this is the 4th day i have had it and it has 8 hours to go today at 945am when i stopped charging it last night around 930 it could last litcherally all day for light users fyi the first battery i received was doa amazons return process withis awesome and i received a new one in two days that works perfectly,128,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,4.0,positive,still breaking in the battery but everything there as expected the case itself could use a bit of improvement i cut out some of the microphone holes below the kickstand so i could open the kickstand otherwise the kickstand would be useless just a knife 5 minutes and centering the cut was all it took but is not this something that should have been considered when making the case otherwise product just as expected,73,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,1.0,negative,looks very nice but poor quality clips at the bottom that hold phone in case broke the second day i attempted to glue it back on but a no go,31,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,5.0,positive,for the price this case is great the magnet is strong and the case the case is durable it gets a little dirty but if you use a baby wipe it comes off i would recomend this product to any friend the phone looks the same as it does in the picture,52,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,great prdouct and recieved on time the only down fault is that it is uncomfortable to speak on the cell phone when the case is on,25,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,the hard case inside the leather broke when it fell but it still works i thought this was what i wanted but after a while u get annoyed flipping the case good for the price although,36,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,5.0,positive,i what i expected the case does smell but nothing overwhelming that can not be handled you get your moneys worth i like the case it protects my screen but the magnet is a little on the weak side other than that it is a good deal,46,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,this is the type of cover i like to protect all of the glass parts of my iphone i have received many compliments on this cover and have both black and red covers now,34,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,1.0,negative,i should have listened to other reviewers instead of purchasing thisi am returning it today first of all it is cute but it is made of really cheap material it is definitely not leather and it is very flimsy however i sort of expected that based on it is price so that is not what bothered me what bothered me and why i have to return it is that the iphone 4s camera does not work with this case the hole cut for the camera is not large enough and all pictures have a pinkish hue because the red from the case gets in the way i tried taking many pictures and it is all the same there is no way to work around the fact that you will not be able to take a picture with your phone in this case i use the camera for different things so i need a case that does not need to be removed for the camera to work if you do not use the camera than this case is probably fine for you but just know that it is a cheap case and it will not last forever I am going to go order a belkin case i had one for iphone 3 g and it is still in great condition so I am going to find one of their cases for a 4s,224,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,I have been using this case for almost a month and i like it negatives i wish it had a little more protection on the corners the iphone still sticks out a little bit over the hard part of the case the red part of the case still protects but i would have liked a bit more from the hard black plastic positives it is cute and that is one of the reasons i picked it looking close up in person it appears to be well made and has held up very well through it is first month of use I have dropped it twice and my phone and the case are fine the magnet clasp / flap is not terribly strong but it is working for me the front flap flips behind nicely when I am using the phone overall I am very satisfied and would recommend this case,139,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,it was love at the first sight when i see the case within the box my iphone fits in perfectly but the only down side is the magnet the small ear on top of the flip that is supposed to stick does not stick it feels like if my iphone were thicker than it would have fit nicely and the magnet would work better so far as the magnet does not really work well the flip of the case is just loose hanging there otherwise it still looks cute considering the price and the look,91,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,good quality but not as red as i was looking for more deep pink overall nice case quality is ok,20,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,2.0,negative,this product gets dirty extremely fast due to the material it is made out of the magnet does not clip the way the description says it is not a good buy at all you will be better with another purchase or simply just going to the apple store,45,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,pro i like it it folds all the way back which makes talking on the phone easier it is cute con it is a little flimsy even although i feel it would protect my phone if i was to drop it I am just not sure if it will wear well time will tell it took too long to recieve it i wish now i would have ordered more than one overall great deal for the the low price,75,25

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,this is a super cute case but within 2 weeks the magnet has fallen out of the top flip part and the seam on the crease where it folds at the bottom has come apart would not buy again unless to only use it on occasions not the primary case,51,36

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,wanted to try this style of case without spending a fortune to experiment case must be open to charge when you close case it does not automatically turn off the phone the redfrom the case reflects on certain pictures taken great for protecting the screen but still not sure if it is worth the little inconviences,56,38

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,so far so good the case came much earlier than expected that is a good thing my phone fits snug right in and it is a perfect fit I have already dropped it once and my phone never came out of the case the only thing i dislike is that i have to keep the case open to charge and it flips down instead of up my fault for not fully looking at the pictures i got order happy but i have the quality of the materials seams are all even over all win,91,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,5.0,positive,i have a defender otter box for my iphone 4s but it is so bulky saw these online and loved the price and the concept it works even better that i would have thought,33,45

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,5.0,positive,phone fits well inside and is actually hard to get out which is a good thing price was perfect could be a little more sturdy as it does not always stay closed straight,32,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,i thought that the case was going to be brand new but some of the polka dots are faded and it seems as if it was used before,28,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,3.0,neutral,it is really hard to rate this case because it is cute and it works well but the case even when you want it to will not come off and then it scratches the phone but has saved my phone from some bad falls,41,49

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,2.0,negative,for the price this is a cute little case that will protect the front of your iphone the material is vinyl and the case itself fairly sturdy 2 problems although unlike other flip cases which are designed in such a way that allows you to plug in the charger when the case is closed this one does not the biggest problem with this case is that when you take a flash photo the redof the case floods the photo with redwhich makes it worthless if you use your camera in flash mode it ruins your photos you get what you pay for,107,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,1.0,negative,still have not received it it is taking a very long time i wanted to give it to my wife before valentines day but it looks like i have to look for something else in a regular store,38,56

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,4.0,positive,this is a nice case but a little awkward to use when actually making a traditional phone call however i really like the case and it is definitely protected also charging leaves it vulnerable as well,36,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,5.0,positive,you can flip the cover all the way back and lock it in place with the magnet while watching a movie or talking on the phone,26,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0067R70GC,1.0,negative,the case looked really cute in pictures it arrived well in time too however i can not stand the awful odor makes me sick i can not point what kind of smell it is but certainly close to rotteni am returning it,42,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,the case fits the galaxy nexus gsm model just fine althought it is not specifically listed in the specs the gsm model is 053 mm thinner than the sprint and verizion models the case is decent i wish there was a higher quality version where the rubber attaches more permanently to the plastic she shall the kids like to pull it off in the 15 price range but the nextup is an otterbox defender which costs 5000,77,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,cheap rubber the case would not let you charge it with case on rubber deformed not a recomended case but you get what you pay for,25,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,this is kind of a cheap imitation of an otterbox defender i had an defender on my wifes phone but a few of the plastic clips broke as well as the lip that holds the rubber she shall on since the phone is 2 years old i was not going to pony up the money for another otterbox so the price was right on this pros it is cheap my wife likes the pink accent without it looking like an all-pink barbie phone it is relatively sturdy for the price cons the rubber she shall does nt attach quite as securely as the defender it is not a big deal but you just have to keep an eye on it the side buttons are not raised although they are marked with a small groove coming from the defender or the seidio case on my phone you kind of fumble looking for the buttons the rubber started to tear around the headphone jack and usb port flaps right away i cut away the protective flaps the case is not at-all waterproof anyway and it has not gotten worse the oem usb cord was a little too wide to fit into the charging plug although other usb cables fit fine i took a file to the plastic around the usb port and in a few minutes the oem cord fit fine too to sum up I had give it a 3 stars maybe 2 if this was for a brand-new phone and i had to live with it for 2 years but it gets an extra star for free shipping and costing less than a fast-food lunch,271,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,2.0,negative,they looked better than they were quality of plastic felt like something i woud find at a flea market but for the price i guess i should have expected it,30,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,a little bulky and rubber is already coming apart after one day it does protect the entire phone although need it for a teenager,23,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,1.0,negative,really thick case that made it impossible to plug some adapters into the headset port like my square credit card reader,21,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,1.0,negative,satisfactory serves the purpose not impressed with the black rubber portion because it fits loose on the corners,18,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,overall great product only problem is the little side flaps that cover the headphone jack and the charger port tear really easily so i opted to cut them off after the first day,33,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,it was what i expected the soft rubber does not hold in place it is not the good quality of trident or otterbox,22,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,1.0,negative,it is not good at all pieces broke the day i got it it is cheap plastic and rubber that rips easy,21,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,probably would not buy again the hard pink plastic she shall hurts your hear to talk too long and the black rubber does not fit snuggly against the pink she shall i did like that the case comes up above the screen so if it is dropped screen-down the case hits the floor instead of the screen,52,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,5.0,positive,this was a great price for thisthe quality is great and came just as described thank you i would buy again,23,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,2.0,negative,when taking pictures with the flash on indoors i was getting a pink hue on my pictures i took it out of the case and took a picture in the same setting and the colors were fine so i stopped using this case and bought something else if you are not big on taking pictures than this case should be fine for you especially for the price i have only used it a couple of days before i discovered the issue with the camera so i am not sure how truly durable this case is i am big on taking pictures so i can not have all my pictures with a pink hue or take it out of the case every time i want to take a picture with the flash,129,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,my daughter dropped her phone and the screen cracked the whole purpose of a case is to protect the phone the edges of the case looks like it prevents it from even touching the screen when the phone falls but that did not make a difference,45,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,2.0,negative,the cover was tight and the hole for the charger was the wrong size had to remove the cover to charge phone which frustrated my daughter also the cover was broken within 2 weeks not sure what happened as it was broken at school by another student,47,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,wish it would have stated whether or not there was a screen protector built in to the case overall it is not a bad case works well and serves it is purpose,30,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,3.0,neutral,i was delighted when i received the case however as days went by i realized the case does not have the snug fit i wanted,24,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,it is a dual purpose case pink plastic and black rubber great combo and received it in descent time would of been faster but there were snow storms in different spots preventing it to get to me faster only one problem it is raised from the screen to protect your screen from getting scratched but because of being raised you can not have it flat on your ear the ridge is felt while on phone,72,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,1.0,negative,case fit phone fine until i tried plugging in my charger i had to take the case off to plug it in,22,27

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,4.0,positive,when i initially bought this product i did not really know if it would work with my 9 android tablet i had previously searched on amazon for a screen protector but could only find ones for the ipad samsung galaxy or the other pricey tablets so i am definitely glad that a company took the time to make screen protectors for all the other no name type tablets that are often just as good as the pricey ones i also wanted to say that the screen protector although very good in protecting the screen also was too short for my 9 widescreen tablet i tried to cover the full screen with it but a part of the top or bottom of the tablet was still exposed but that was really the only bad part of it otherwise good product for the price,141,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,2.0,negative,got the 10 ematic tablet and screen protector does not fit only covers the actual screen but leaves the border without which looks odd i like the anti-glare,27,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,i feel totally ripped off first it took forever to get to me second it is not at all as represented in the description it is a completely different size i saw this in the other reviews that mentioned that but i thought it would not matter for me as i was planning on cutting it down to use on a 7 inch tablet the big thing is that i bought this for was to reduce the glare on my tablet when i use it outside this is not anti-glare although it explicitly states that it is in the product name if anything it increased the glare also nowhere on the packaging does it mention iessentials it comes in a very generic package with a picture of a tablet on it and the words screen guard filmset on the back of the package are some poor instructions with bad translations from chinese yes we also have made in china printed on the back terrible product stay away from iessentials if i could give it less than 1 star i would,178,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,4.0,positive,they were great did what they were supposed to do i have no complaints,13,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,unfortunately the merchant sent me a defectivethe sticker part was on the wrong size of the screen protectors in addition the screen protector was too big for my android tablet the merchant could not send me a newbecause it is no longer in stock,48,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,it stuck to my pronto tech89 in tablet just fine also it is does just fine for the touch sensitivity,18,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,3.0,neutral,bought this for my mother in laws 9 inch tablet i had to cut it to size with a pair of scissors it comes with a lined film to make this easy but it is not as good as one made specifically for the particular tablet thus the 3 stars anti glare is good also it would be better if it came with a tool to smooth out any air that gets trapped underneath when applying it to the screen but it does not,82,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,3.0,neutral,i really did not like this screen protector all that well i am used to a clear screen protector and this was not that,23,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,3.0,neutral,i had a hard time cutting to the correct size figuring out how to apply it with all the bubbles glad i purchased two one i screwed up so i had use the other one,35,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,i chose it because very clear and protection on your tablet so i would buy this product again this is why i gave it a great rating,27,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,4.0,positive,only one side will stick to the screen and no instructions or clear markings to determine which one it does reduce glare and fits well but did not give 100 coverage at the end of the screen but it does cover the active screen area well,45,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,exactly what i was looking for easy to apply works amazingly well keeping screen protected would highly recommend thank you for this high quality product,25,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,2.0,negative,i had no problem with cutting it down to size but when i attempted to separate the layers three that is where my problem began it was very difficult separating them and i ended up with a thin adhesive layer that i could not line up with the tablet screen on top of that after about 3 tries there were a lot of bubbles and particles that stuck to the sticky part that added to the bubble surface i wish there had been detailed instructions of how to separate the layers and tabs to help separate them i gave it 2 stars because it was not user friendly and because I have used screen protectors in the past that were with much success,119,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,you do have to cut to fit that is not a problem because there is a grid on the protector that i laid the original shipping cover from the tablet on top to make a perfect pattern unfortunately this does not stick to brand new tablet surface pulled off the factory shipping cover and replaced with this it is very very flimsy and not completely clear so everything looks very fuzzy after final film is pulled off the protector with installation,81,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,impossible to get it in place and get it to stick we had to trash it i never had problems putting any others on,24,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,fits perfect other stores were selling this onefor 30 dollars and was not as high gloss finish easy to apply to the tablet and it looks great,29,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,3.0,neutral,i have to give this a medium rating since i can not use it and i wanted to give a warning about this to others if places that sell these would give the dimensions this could be avoided these are only 228 mm wide which is far too short for a 10 169 tablet which is what they show in the image on this page a 169 ar tablet faik the image may be of a 9 tablet the height of these are only 156 mm which is also still too short for a 169 ar 10 tablet but not as bad as the width is i also do not think these are for 43 aspect ratio tablets but since i do not have any 43 tablets i can not be sure of that looks like they may be made for some oddball aspect ratio all you can do is measure your tablets screen then see if these dimensions will work well for it again these are 228 mm x 156 mm if you do not care that part of your screen is unprotected then they will fit on a 10 169 tablet but not without exposed unprotected edges on all 4 sides,194,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,2.0,negative,i bought 2 of these i was not able to install either one without creasing and bubbles i own 5 tablets and several phones that i have put screen protectors like this one so this is not my first rodeo i have never had one that was just impossible to successfully install until now maybe there is some special trick to installing this one i will never know because they included zero product description or instructions as others have noted it is hard to even tell which side to apply i thought maybe i had just made a mistake with the first attempt so was super careful with the second but still did not work i think if you can get it to install without creasing or bubbles it looks like it might work well so i will give them 2 stars but for me it was just a big waste of money,151,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,i was nervous about not getting the product on the day the tracking said i would get it when i reached out to the they reassured me that i would get the product and the very next day i did,40,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,not sure what this product is it came with a stiff piece of plastic with xs on it and i removed the clear sheet but it would not cling to my screen at all either i did something wrong or this does not work,43,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,works great on my 9inch coby kyros did not need to trim it for it to fit properly i will order more of these,23,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,1.0,negative,first off let me say that i have installed over two dozen screen protectors without any problems this is the first brand / screen protector that I have had problems with let me caution you the product i received was not the size that is stated in the description it states that it is 104 x 8 the product i received was barely 95 x 6 not even close to fitting a 10 tablet very disappointed with this product,76,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,5.0,positive,i love this product it is totally easy on the eyes to read and play games i did catch one hair under the screen but it is nice tuff plastic it did take a little bit to get from the shipper but i love it great buy,45,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,4.0,positive,it is hard to get the bubble out but it protects the screen but i like despite of the bubble that do not seem to want to come out,27,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0072LD4TY,2.0,negative,i bought this because it said it was compatible with 9 - 10 tablets i thought there would be 1 for 9 and 1 for 10 but there was only 1 that had to be cut while trying to measure it i must have done a wrong measurement somewhere because i ended up cutting it too small rendering the product basically useless would never buy from that manufacturer again the dealer however did a good job delivering the product on time,78,30
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,this should be 0 stars but i have to give them at least one i had ordered the globe home delivery once before in 2004 with bad results but they have definitely stepped it down a notch if i do actually receive the paper which is normally 2 out of every 3 weeks the delivery people enjoy throwing the paper into puddles or in the roadway for other drivers to run over i called several times to request a box to put up for delivery twice i was told it was on it is way yet i never received it they promised to credit me for the ruined papers but that never happened either after my calls to the hotline expect 10 to 15 minutes waits my coupons were picked out of my sunday paper so then i would have to go down to the store and buy it again just to get them I am really not sure what is going on over there but i have had enough do not waste your money here you are much better off with the herald or your local paper,184,0
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,paper ok but very disappointed that there were no comics otherwise i would subscribe full time,16,1

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,does not have all parts of the paper it is 2016 get with it not worth it,16,13
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,the boston globes kindle version is still carrying the story of trumps criticism of fiorina as if it just happened does not give me a lot of faith that all the other stories other than the front page are current,39,14

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,the globe provides me with a broad perspective on both national and international news it also offers well written and detailed news of all of new england as a resident of new hampshire i especially appreciate that it provides a section specifically for our state and most importantly it supports it is staffs research in areas of legality that test social and political integrity for example it is series called spotlight on the abuse of children by the catholic hierarchy,78,18
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,i love the reporters i wish the new home delivery carrier understood the delivery instructions aim for the front door but i enjoy it when it gets here,28,19
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,recently there have been 2 changes in the software used to deliver the globe one is worse than the other not consistent cumbersome frustrating nonresponsive are a few of the words that come immediately to mind at times i just stop reading the article because the program is so bad how many times can you try to turn the page or to increase the print size or scroll down the page i have been a faithful reader and subscriber of the boston globe for over 50 years and they do not even respond to my emails,95,20
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,even although it has an anti catholic point of view such as investigating abuse in the church as if it was the only organization with the problem their desire to denigrate the boston public schools is evident in their reporting they get stars because they are the only game in town,51,21
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,although i live outside of the boston metropolitan area in western ma spfld area i find the boston globe to be very informative for national and state news the features that are included with the news are interesting and informative as well it is true that there is a void of local news and i do wish that the globe could expand it is coverage of western massachusetts as there is certainly a need that is not being met included with my boston globe subscription is the electonic version which i do enjoy when traveling or not at home to read the paper edition,103,22
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,i truly enjoy reading the newspaper and want the kindle distribution of reaching the public to thrive as such i have kept my subscriptions going for as long as i have owned my kindle apporximately 6 years now but I have had it 1499 was an exceedingly high price to pay in my mind for apporximately 5 years i subscribed to the la times while living there for 999 it is still 999 that is the right price point in my mind for this kind of subscription but i have a soft spot for the newspaper industry and the globe after living far away for so long so i justified the 1499 cost to receive a notice that the price was incurring a 100 increase to 2999 was untenable what additional service should i expect formatting errors on a daily basis the same paul krugman quote in the editorial section every day months after the baltimore riots actually took place oh i can keep my old subscription rate until april i do not know if amazon or john henry are to blame but either way my money will not support this outrageous price increase,191,23
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,although we should always engage our critical thinking skills while reading about current events i believe the boston globe has one of the finest news departments anywhere the globe is the paper to read if you want to stay informed and develop perspective,43,24

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,overall a good presentation of the globe there are still a few minor glitches to work out around how things are displayed for example the sports section tables are next to useless because the columns are not lined up on the kindle screen and it takes serious investigation and time to read them properly but overall the paper is well laid out and easy to navigate as for the content if you are from boston you will like it but it is not the nytimes,83,51
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,the globe has good journalism and a wide and interesting variety of news articles it is a top notch paper thanks for allowing me to evaluate it,26,52
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,i have been a subscriber since the 2d generation kindle i recently purchased the hdx and noticed an error in the top banner which appears whenever you touch the screen to get to the article list also font menu at the left corner the banner lists the wrong date for the paper but the correct day of the week for example todays banner tells me i am reading the boston globe wednesday may 6 2014 i checked all the settings for the kindle and they were correct i called kindle support and tech said the problem was with the globe the globe said the problem was with the kindle great then i noticed the same problem with my magazine subscription which is not published by the globe this time kindle tech said he could not fix it on my kindle it was a software issue that would need to be addressed he also said that amazon would not sell subscriptions to the globe until it was fixed this was weeks ago same error still appears every day and i see that the globe subscription is still being sold although the error is certainly not the fate of the nation it is nonetheless annoying and seems to be pretty basic,207,53
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,an ok paper it s totally liberal bias is so infuriating at times that i am so close to dropping it truly a liberal rag also our home delivery service has a lot to be desired from no paper to the wrong paper this is a function of the individual carrier and not the local supervisor she has been great in correcting the carriers mistakes,65,54

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,i used to consider the boston globe to be the finest newspaper in the universe but that was back in the day when newspapers were beautiful things big and broad and full of news opinion classifieds and comics today newspapers are increasingly irrelevant we get our news pushed to us all day long from thousands of sources and being informed no longer is a requirement to participate in society in the past 30 years i have watched the globe shrink in size and quality and I have been troubled by some of the facebook posts of news items I have seen since the change in ownership you listening john henry all that said the globe still remains the best source of local news for greater boston there really is nothing else out there and the electronic version for the kindle is quite well done it contains most of the news and features in an easy to read format it is actually my preferred method to read the globe,169,58

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,the globe has become a third rate paper under the ownership of the new york times it provides good local news but lacks any credibility in being politically objective or relevant in world news,33,65
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,in order to read the articles of interest you must scroll through everything else to get to what you want why bother with this when you can get the boston globes own online version,34,66

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,the boston globe is one sided just like the rest of the media in this country i will never read the globe again to damn liberal,26,74

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,but at least you can get a nice digital newpaper version the new york times has discontinued the ability to purchase individual dailys with your kindle with a new kindle version that does not compare,33,80
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,the boston sunday globe for the kindle is one of the best sources for new england news available electronically it is a modest 49 cents weekly and it is well worth it I have relocated in the deep south and there is no world national and new england news source equal to this version of the globe it is one of amazons true bargains,63,81

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,the boston globe is one of the best newspapers i have read i try to read major newspapers for in depth coverage of events the writing is superb and on par with the new york times,36,85
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i was on vacation and decided to buy the app to read of the boston bombings it is okay i just do not have time to check it out very often it is laid out well and i enjoyed other articles rather than just the one i bought it for,49,86
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,got it to look at ads for rentals of course in the kindle edition there are none but even in scanning over the news i almost got sick with the liberal news,31,87
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,half of the newspaper does not show up on the kindlewhen i am home and purchase the sunday globe for an example there is usually four or five pages of obituaries on the sunday globe on the kindle you get 4 or 5 death notices usually they are the 4 or 5 death notices of only prominent people i guess the globe and kindle do not care about the 99 people,70,88
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,left leaning inaccurate biased liberal paper pushing the liberal and socialist-democratic partys agenda way too gun control way to open boarders way to pro blending of the sexes and the defeminazation on the male species i grew up reading the globe it used to be good but those days are long gone just like the rest of journalism you want fair and balanced go to fox news,67,89
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,the online edition is all right but it does not measure up favorably to he print edition it is very brief and not very interesting,25,90

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,believe it or not i am still a subscriber but only because my wife likes to read a print copy of the daily news and unfortunately the boston herald has become nothing other than a glorified scandal sheet lacking any later evening news or sports coverage because it is printed by the boston globe the globe long ago abandoned any semblance of journalistic objectivity it is far right liberal / progressive one-sided bias and promotion is not just limited to the editorial section but permeates the entire paper,85,93
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,i can only assume many of the formatting issues of older reviews have been resolved because i found navigating through the paper very easy and intuitive on my kindle i have a kindle white there seemed to be plenty of stories much of the non-news content is removed but things like classifieds movie and show listings in general can be gotten on the web so not really needed if you are sitting down to read the paper would have been cool if they had the comics but i get why they are not there issues with electronic rights i assume and file size that is only a guess but the stories were easy to read visually and going through the sections a breeze it is still my parents paper just without the inky fingers,133,94
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,as a frequent visitor to boston i love finding out what is happening as well as good places to eat visit tour,22,95
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,the columnists all seem to take in the many aspects about which they are reporting other periodicals / papers seem to be somewhat shallow in their coverage / opinion but not so with the globe both sides get their fair share more than meets my expectations not always purchased on kindle since i pick up the paper daily locally love it,58,96
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,the globe is getting more like thehearld with it is emphasis on sensationalism it seems to be engaging in muckraking it seems to find corruption where it does not exist it is not like 1935 - 1960 where corruption existed and they coulnot findit,41,97
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,this is not the same as the paper version i would like to see local sections in this online version,20,98
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i like it well enough it is quick toand easy to find articles however jumping to the next article brings the headline to the top of the page good continuing to the next article leaves the headline wherever the current article leaves off bad the text is full of hyphens that do not belong there are arbitrary hyphens between or at the beginnings of complete words and more or less where they may have been hyphenated in the print edition but are not needed in the app display like this and a gain like this if you know what i mean annoying and dif ficult to read,111,99
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i am glad i can save money and paper on the kindle version but the boston globe editors could make this more user friendly for example when they do movie reviews on fridays it does not necessarily point at as a review but sometimes seems like just a regular article if you blink you miss it,55,100
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,having lived it new england and moved away this is the best way to keep up with the news and events without the ads and coupons,26,101

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,this is not a good paper my kids who love comics were made because it has no comics iwould by it only if the paper was my best friend,29,103
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,a great paper with alot of reading material a good price to download on the kindle the sunday paper for 49 cents against buying the paper version for over 400,30,104
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,i love the sunday globe sports page if yu are fan of boston sports it is a must read you will get all the boston sports news in well writen manner these writers are knowledgeable about the sport and are still great writers,43,105
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,this product can really use an overhaul i use it about 300 days per year and it continues to amaze me that they can not seem to fix some basic stuff subscriptions are 1495 / mo or you can buy the daily for 49 cents why would anyone buy the subscription if they charge 11 or 12 99 for the subscription they would have a lot more subscribers the columns are in no particular order so I am jumping from baseball to football and back to baseball again then high school sports then the celtics and back to the red sox again charts and graphs are horrendous and usually unusable amazon can also fix a little basic stuff too everyday i have to go to newsstand then type the whole word boston globe to get a chance to buy it you would think there would be a way to save that or that the fire would remember it,154,106
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,i purchased this issue of the boston globe because other newspapers were more expensive i found that the writing and coverage were of high quality and at a good price i will buy future issues of this newspaper for sure,40,107
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,i do not subscribe to the globe but buy it when i have time to catch up for half a buck you get most of the content from the regions leading newspaper right on your kindle can not complain about that an improvement would be to get all content including comics crossword could be done on paper from the grid and the sunday magazine five stars because i appreciate the globe and a little critical feedback because we all want to see the best get even better,86,108
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,the kindle version needs work too many silly mistakes poor proofing and mixed up headlines are two that really bother me otherwise still the best show for boston,28,109
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,out of all the newspapers I have looked into the boston globe is the most jam packed of any that I have seen if you are from new england this paper is for you on a kindle,35,110
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,if you buy the globe paper edition you get the online globe free i like the kf edition of the globe but would like access to the online version of the globe too i called the globe and they said they would if amazon only would inform them of who their subscribers were come on amazon let them know so i can get my free online access sometimes i want to forward articles to other people and other times i would like to copy or comment on articles which i can not do with the kf edition hope you read this,100,111
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,when i read the globe on kindle i like to scroll through the titles of articles to see which interests me the regional section with 150 - 180 titles in sundays edition usually do not identify the town where the news is coming from often the article will not name the town either for example regional article 8 march 182012 is titled competition for town seats obviously the title fails to name the town and it is not named in the article either,81,112
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,for an e-newspaper that has primarily local interest news little international coverage sub optimal national coverage and insipid editorials the price of the boston globes kindle edition is disproportionately high it seems that the newspaper is limping trying to find it is way into the world of e-papers but it is limp is very noticeable,52,113
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,so much cheaper and easier to read than the hard-copy delivered one plus it fits in my jacket pocket and i get it delivered where and when i choose a lot of whiners and haters here either nitpicking or with unreasonable expectations for e-ink versions the other low-rating reviews make outdated points which have been addressed by the globe for example complaints about no box scores been getting a hard-copy paper delivered for the last 25 of my 43 years of my life and I am never going back great job boston globe and amazon,93,114
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,no longer worth the price increase a 50 percent increase to get sports stats i do not think so,18,115
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,for a first-class newspaper to produce something this pathetic is a disgrace not to mention that from time to time it is delivered late the formatting is essentially non-existent headlines are repeated for example one might look like man bites dogman bites dog items are in the wrong sections for example local man wins lottery is in the obituary section words are broken up hyphenation is messed up items in the business section are prefaced with the words market movers charts are scaled so percentage change is comparable their capitalization when there are no charts of course the new england in brief section is a collection of small stories that the printed edition shows in a narrow column with labels for eachbut the kindle version just runs them all together with no formatting to distinguish onefrom the next in summary it is doubtful there is any review made by a human being they just feed the newspaper into one end and some sort of text vaguely related to the original content comes out the other considering that their globe reader edition delivered via adobe air is beautifully done this product is a disgrace,193,116
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,the boston globe has over priced this horrible electronic edition you will find typos and the the same article twice with different titles the boston globe customer service department did not even know that they pushed a kindle edition sometimes the paper comes late or it does not come at all because it was not delivered right you were able to read it on your iphone before and you can not even do that know they only send it to one of your devices not all of them and that one device has to be a kindle the price of the subscription is ridiculous 1499 and you get no weather no stock updates and not even an 18th of the pictures in the paper edition I am telling all of my friends with kindles quite a few not to get the globe I am getting the nytimes or the washington post i really wish you could buy just one issue at a time rather than subscribing there also needs to be a sunday edition only,169,117
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,i have subscribed to the boston globe kindle edition since 2007 while it lacked box scores and weather reports to name just a few lacking features i stuck with it figuring that sooner or later they would improve the offering it seems that has finally happened but at a 50 increase in cost from 999 per month to 1499 per month this is simply not worth it,67,118
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i first dropped my print globe edition for the kindle version and was thrilled yeah some of the articles ran together / there were some typosnothing particularly major but my favorite feature was that i could download the globe to my kindle reader app on my phone while i was waiting on the t randomly with no warning several weeks ago the globe became unavailable for reading on kindle reader apps only on actual kindle devices themselves when attempting to inform the globe about this change i could not figure out the right avenue i ultimately decided on the delivery customer service page only to find the customer service form does not work so now i have noif this was a calculated move on the globes part or if this is just an oversight they continue to overlook regardless random feature changes are a great way to piss off your customers and I am now one pissed-off customer,155,119
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,i ordered the globe to be able to read the new england section it does not exist i live in maine and this section is the only reason i would get it,32,120
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i would love to see an option to buy just todays issue i do not read the paper every day and some days i choose to read it in print others on-line why can not i just buy todays paper for a small mark-up on what it would cost on the street would not that be easy to offer save paper and be more convenient for your customers,65,121
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,great for travel wonderful for the beach unfortunately way too much is missing obituaries stocks tv listing movie ratings globe west section pictures ads and more just way too little content i will try again in the summer since it is the way to go for outdoor reading please improve it and give us the entire globe would also like it for the ipad it is the future it just is n't there yet,72,122
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,I had like to have the option of subscribing to the sunday globe only i have another daily paper but would really enjoy the sunday edition of the globe when i have time to do more than one will probably cancel the trial since it is so expensive,46,123
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,thank you for your feedback on the boston globe kindle edition we hear your concerns and we are working to incorporate more content into our kindle offering and enhance it is display you will notice in the next few weeks several new content available to you,45,124
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,i was excited when i received my kindle getting the boston globe digitally could not get any better unfortunately this format cost more money and i feel as although i got less this is especially true about the sports section there are no standings or box score information,47,125
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,the globe on kindle minus sports scores comics television and more was priced perfectly at about 10 / month i was a loyal subscriber but this price hike is ludicrous and poor judgement on their part the financial times and new york times while overpriced at least had additional redeeming qualities to justify being a bit pricier than the globe now that the globe has gone to 1500 / month they can kiss my subscription goodbye too bad,73,126
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,i began receiving the globe on my kindle in october for 999 / month i subscribed not only because it is the regional paper but also because this represented a cost savings over other papers such as the nyt i have enjoyed it and consider the 999 to be well spent but the globe for kindle will now jump to 1499 / month a 50 price increase for anything is customer-unfriendly but especially for the globe kindle version on the kindle you do not get certain content such as comics classifieds or even the majority of photos in the paper it is extremely unwise for the globe to effect this sort of price hike without beefing up the kindle content for the newspaper at the very least the comics which most people enjoy reading daily because of the new disparity between price and content i will be canceling my subscription when my 6-month grace period under the old price expires it is unfortunate and i will miss receiving it on the kindle but the cost-benefit analysis does not pan out with a 50 price hike for the same pared-down content,187,127
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,a 50 price increase on 12/9 is ridiculous sure it is still cheaper than a paper subscription but this is too much i have a 6 month grace period and do not plan on continuing my subscription i will instead read the articles online,42,128
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,no box scores for the price it should have box scores i get those for free on bostoncom no wonder the globe is financially unstable they are not very savvy and this is one more example why pay 999 monthly if i can get more content on their free website wicked disappointed I had happily pay if they provided more content until then I am forced to be a freeloader,67,129
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,i was never able to see or find the newspaper i want to cancel it before i get charged for something i never got how can i do this,29,130
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,no decent index no comics might as well go to the globes free web site instead,16,131
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,i was hoping to be able to discontinue my paper delivery but no g section and most of all no comics when it is complete I shall reconsider meanwhile if i want to go paperless i can always use the globe reader,40,132
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,I have been getting my boston globe on kindle for a week now and love it it took me a day or two to get used to the format but now i would not go back to the paper edition i used to read my daily paper at the kitchen table with my breakfast and often it was hardly read because of time constraints now i begin it at breakfast but find myself picking it up again and again during the day it is portability is a big plus another big plus is the cost difference i am saving 30 / month over the home delivery method money i can spend on buying kindle books also there is no recycling of the kindle edition of the globe i do miss the g section and it is tv listings i also miss the weather reports the pictures are disappointing too small and unclear to be of any use however the pros outweigh the cons and i do recommend the kindle edition of the boston globe over the paper delivery,173,133
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,I have been subscribed to the globe on my kindle for 3 or 4 months i do not download every issue i keep my wireless off most of the time but a few days a week i download the latest issue and I am quite happy with it I am a daily reader of the globes website amazon will not let me say what that website is and had never subscribed to the globe before i just would not read the physical paper enough to justify all the recycling ink-stained hands and high subscription cost now the kindle version is what it is i can get most of the globe daily whenever and wherever i want to read it in a nice clean portable form it is not the entire paper you get no comics crosswords classifieds or even baseball box scores but then the kindle subscription price is less than half the price of even the 50 discounted globe delivery rate and it does not have ads looking at it that way i think it is well priced at 999 / month other info a number of stories usually front-page ones have photos i like that each story tells you the number of words at the start so you know what you are getting into you can quickly browse sections and stories by going to view section list and then selecting the number of articles in parentheses after the section you want so if you enjoy reading globe articles away from your computer but can not justify buying the physical paper regularly this is probably the version for you,259,134
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,I am not a fan of the kindle and opted for the ipad instead I am very disappointed to learn that you can only get newspaper and magazine subscriptions if you own a kindle providing this service is one key area amazon can outshine apple and keep or grow market share since amazon already has a deep list of titles,58,135
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,do not waste your money no pictures comics sports schedules in other words the only stuff worthwhile reading in this ultra left-wing pile of crap is not included the only good thing is that no trees were sacrificed and thus the globe reduced it is carbon footprint,46,136
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,it is good enough that i was able to cancel my physical subscription yes it is missing some content but most of what i actually read in the paper is included in the kindle version navigating is a little weird at first but once you figure it out it is quite easy overall this is very good and at the price it was definitely worth it to me i suspect that this type of delivery method is the future of newspapers within the next 5 to 10 years,86,137
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,newcomer to kindle / globe subscription received first issue on 12/26 can not get ttodays issue what gives,15,138
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,i absolutely love to read the boston globe this way it comes to my house in the early morning i do not even have to get out of bed and it never requires recycling i can skim through the paper quickly to decide on what i want to go back later and read and i get all the news without the analog paper i admit i miss the actual look of the newspaper and the way it feels and all the ads but really it is a small sacrifice plus you can not beat the price i added the new york times news blog and it is a total 5 star,109,139
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,i purchased my kindle and subscribed to the boston globe a month ago since then I have found this way of reading newspapers very easy the options of going by section or article to article is very intuitive and easy to use it took me all of one minute to get to know how to browse a newspaper i love it and will use it for many years,67,140
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,4.0,positive,i start every morning with coffee and the boston globe on the kindle very convenient being able to read the paper with one hand i scan all the national stories first always first rate writing with no obvious media slant but to be honest unless a story catches my eye right away i head to the sports section which includes all the print writers as well as the sports notes for baseball football basketball and more the kindle version does not contain all the pictures and graphics of the print version but there does seem to be more than a year ago and i have not found the lack of graphs and pictures to be a detriment i do subscribe to the local paper but i get my national news from the globe i have had a globe subscription since i got my kindle last summer and have been very happy with it,152,141
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,this newspaper is well worth the price and well done some may feel that it should be 5 a month but that is absurd the price is right in line with what is offered and the paper delievers the goods get this paper on your kindle of in any way you can but do read the boston globe,58,142
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,the price is expensive for the content included although i am continuing my subscription i do not feel like i am receiving the value for the price paid at the most 500 / month is more in-line with the value received,38,143
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,I have lived in massachusetts most of my life I have long since stopped reading the globe as it is news and editorial emphasis is too liberal for me that being said i decided to try the kindle edition for the two week trial largely to get some local news coverage the boston herald a slightly more conservative competitor is not available for the kindle the globes kindle edition was decent i still hate the slant of the paper but having local news was convenient but bias aside it would be much better if it includes small blurbs for all of the articles not merely some approximately 60 of the stories are only listed by their headlines often it was impossible to know what the article was about and i found myself having to open an article and often reverse my path if i did not want to read it more details in the article listings would have helped in sum if you like the nytimes little bostonian brother for news the globes kindle edition is ok but if you do not need local news there really is not much reason to subscribe give the trial a shot although no harm to try i did cancel before my 14 days ended as i did not want to pay for the paper,213,144
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,2.0,negative,the boston globe if you are looking for the real boston globe unfortunately you will not get it here the boston globe is my local newspaper so i want the local news and reporting not just the major articles I am used to seeing local high school sport information box scores and more in the sports section unfortunately you only get a few parts and pieces of the newspaper thanks but that is not offering me any real value if you ever change to offering the real newspaper then i may be interested in subscribing,92,145
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,3.0,neutral,really is great to get my globe without having to go outside or playing head games with the delivery clown who delivers it yes it does need some improvements in missing items and navigation hiderences but overall it is very coolto get the paper this way,45,146
Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,5.0,positive,the boston globe is an excellent newspaper and the kindle delivers it in an ideal format it is wonderful to have access to a paper with substance since there are no decent papers in the baltimore area the globe provides insightful and well-written articles on national and international topics in addition the local articles are interesting even for someone who does not live in new england the kindle edition is easy to navigate and always ready for me when i turn on my kindle at 515 in the morning i do not have to worry about rushing out in the bad weather to search for a paper and with a click of one finger i can read through the articles and still hold my coffee mug i can not imagine going back to reading a print edition of a newspaper with all of it is cumbersome sections messy ink and ads,146,147
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,I have been checking periodically to see if the freep was available on the kindle and noticed yesterday that it is if there was a big announcement about it being available i missed it anyway i read todays paper entirely on the kindle and find i prefer it to the e-edition there was something about having to click on the article and then only seeing that article in the e-edition that caused me to skip over a lot of things i would have at least skimmed in the paper edition and i was going days without reading it because i simply forgot about it it was disconcerting to so quickly lose the 30 year habit of reading the paper each morning this morning i just grabbed the kindle from my bedside table clicked it on and read the paper without leaving my bed there were no pictures or graphs but i did not really miss them in other papers I have read on the kindle there have been pictures so perhaps that is still coming the only problem no comics i hope that is remedied because it was one of my favorite parts of the paper,192,0
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i am glad to have a newspaper from closer to home but the formatting needs work sometimes the next article is actually the next article but frequently a bunch of articles are just all jammed together under one heading without even a paragraph break i am hoping for better things in the future,53,1
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,the free press was supposed to be on kindle at the end of march they finally got it on in the middle of june reading the articles on vacation was great but there were no comics i guess they expect everyone to lug a laptop around to read the digital version,51,2
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,i live in florida now but i miss my hometown free press the detroit free press as interpreted by kindle helps me keep up with the goings on at home without the filter of the national media,37,3

Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,I am living in va but I am from detroit i like reading about my home-city in the detroit free press i will always miss my hometown reading about it is heart-warming,30,7
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,i worked at the free press as a young kid working in the advertising dept as a messenger boy delivering advertising around the downtown area that would have been somewhere between 1954 and 1958 worked full time in the summers and on saturdays in the fall winter and spring months as i played sports for my school during the school year but i loved the free press the people who worked there especially ken anderson my boss a great guy and of course i became a avid reader of the paper and have been to this day i could never betray the free press after they were so good to me as a kid when i really needed it i had lost my dad at 10 years old mpm was working two jobs that did not pay much and because she worked worked from 9 in the morning to 10 at night i rarely saw her during the week so i was pretty much on my own from the age of 10 the money i was able to earn at the free press was pocket money i could never ask mom for and it helped me through high school hanging out with my buddies being able to buy a letter jacket so i am a life long fan of the detroit free press and will die reading this great newspaper,229,8
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,2.0,negative,i purchased the sunday edition only one section downloaded onto my kindle if there was a way to get my money back i would have asked for it,28,9

Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,the kindle version has been inconsistent often the articles can be repeated 2 3 or even 4 times in the edition this has no photos and appears to be inadequately copied from the text version do not subscribe until they improve the quality,42,13
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,2.0,negative,the kindle edition has far too many duplicate and triplicate articles someone editors certainly are not doing their jobs properly it is disappointing to see such a famous newspaper excellent over the years in the print edition to perform so poorly in the kindle edition,45,14
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,the free press has the best sports page in the mid-west if not the country it also has an excellent editorial staff,22,15
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,at least once a week we suffer problems with downloaded content today we received all sections except the life section we are paying for two subscriptions even although we should theoretically be able to share them between devices this never seems to work articles are often duplicated this problem occurs across both kindles and both iphone apps originally i blamed the detroit free press but now i think this might be on amazons end it is frustrating,76,16
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,very disappointed on last issue bought half of the sections were missing not even the business section nothing to read unless you like sports,23,17
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,I am a resident of michigan i typically buy a copy of the newspaper to read while having breakfast on a day off there is very little content lately they they have been duplicating articles as in you read something and it shows up again nearly half of the kindle version is repeated content previous weekends they were not able to label sections correctly and also doubled on articles out of frustration i started buying the oklahoman on kindle I shall admit that politically the oklahoman lines up with my politics but hey it has news in it local state nation world I have sampled a few kindle papers this one is the worst as far as execution wes,116,18
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,I have had this on my kindle for less than a year i used to live in detroit and wanted news that reminds me of the city the people the sports when i lived there i admit i usally get the detroit news but since i no longer live there i think the freep is the right choice for me now the reason i give it 3 stars is because lately the format changed for the worst the sections are mixed up and some coluums repeat i would upgrade the rating if the errors were fixed update 5/10/2013 they fixed the sections but i have to say the repeating articles are getting annoying it is as if someone is inflating the content sorry it is not enough to change my rating i still like the free press i would recommend it as a good news source update 6/10/2013 i have to say the repeating articles are not fixed yet it is as if someone is trying to see if anyone is paying attention it is getting very annoying that I am considering switching to the detroit news I shall wait 1 more month if there has no improvement then I am switching,194,19
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i have been a subscriber of the free press for sixty years so i am committed to it and it is excellent journalists however it still focuses on three counties when many of it is readers live in the surrounding counties i do not always want to hear about detroit about wayne oakland and macomb counties except when it is in context to the whole a lot goes on in the surrounding cities but the paper does not focus on them do you want to be the same paper you were forty years ago,91,20
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,the kindle edition of the free press is an embarrassment columns do not line up the sections are not labeled some articles are listed multiple times and others are missing altogether today only ten total articles showed up I have been a free press subscriber for many years but I have had enough i stuck with the kindle edition for a couple years in hopes that it would get better but instead the formatting has gotten worse it can not be that hard to make a presentable kindle edition i wonder if they anyone at the free press even looks at the kindle edition,99,21
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,this used to be a nice kindle paper but now it is awful sections are no longer defined except with an a b or c articles repeat themselves in the section and the listing of any type of statistics sports related makes no sense and is impossible to read,49,22

Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,the detroit free press was one of the best news papers in the country but the economic pressures have taken it is toll the home delivery was reduced from 7 to 3 days per week and we were forced to settle for an on line edition 4 days a week or try to find a store to pay for an over priced under size paper i tried the tablet edition a was saddened that some of the best of the remaining paper was missing no pictures no graphics no comics just dry text no thanks after subscribing for forty plus years i am considering quiting,104,26
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,the free press is a must read for all tri-county residents this paper has all the essentials news world state and local as well as what is happening in local and national sports world class writers such as mitch album contribute to this fine paper,44,27
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,i think it is important to note that many of the reviews here are from 2009 so they are out of date if you are reading on a newer device like the fire you get the entire paper every picture sidebar ad and more you can see an entire article with one touch and another touch shrinks it back so you see the whole page again you turn pages back and forth with another touch it is very slick and easy to use the only reason i did not give this app 5 stars is that there seems to be a technical problem with it sometimes it starts paging through the whole paper just flipping pages from front to back and to the front again I have contacted the free press tech support and they have told me it is an amazon issue still waiting to see if it will be resolved if it is I shall come back and bump this up to a 5 star because it is great to be able to read the freep like this much nicer than the laptop version and more complete than freepcom,178,28
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,2.0,negative,i bought one copy of this out of curiosity i wondered how a newspaper would read on my kindle it seemed very short and it was frustrating to read i hope all newspapers do not have to close but i guess they might have to i do not think i will buy an e-newspaper again soon,54,29

Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,i never liked the print version of the freep i was always a the detroit news reader tdn always seemed to have more national and world news in it i just finished canceling my dn subscription due to an apparent lack of content the sunday download had all of two articles in it the freep gives me my detroit sports info which is my number one reason for my subscription you also can not complain about the convenience of being able to simply delete your old issues instead of finding another grocery sack to put them in being able to download them instead of fetching them or going on a scavenger hunt to find them as for the other complaints I have read about no comics or puzzles they sell those books at most drug stores and supermarkets i do not miss the pictures or graphics by not including them the size of each download is much smaller and quicker to finish the four star rating is for the sparce international and national coverage,169,34
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,was excited to try out the kindle edition overall it is really good and i consider it a great value it is so nice to have the paper downloaded in seconds every morning again and not have to trudge out to theof the driveway to get it it is also nice not having to deal with all of the old papers laying around navigating between articles is a breeze and makes the reading really enjoyable the only reason that i am giving it only 4 stars is because there are occasional formatting errors that can be a bit frustrating however i have noticed a decline in those since i first started getting it overall i would definitely recommend it,121,35
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,as a long time reader of the free press the kindle version was a total failure in my eyes why should i pay 699 a month for 1/2 the content i would get for free on their website please drop it until it can be done right,47,36
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i have yet to find a good newspaper on the kindle the freep is worse than most too few articles too many sports articles not organized well for gods sake people please include all the articles we want them and comics and maybe puzzles too how hard can it be at least give us all the stories and some photos,60,37
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,i love this newspaper because it let us me stay informed about what has going on in michigan without having to get my fingers dirty from the ink the articles are plentiful and generally well-written I had love to see some graphics included but i think this newspaper is definitely worth the money,50,38
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,5.0,positive,i live far away from access to the print edition of the free press and having access to the journalism of the freep is a treasure regardless of it is delivery mechanism i had followed the web version until i got my kindle last year and while the kindle edition misses many of the graphics and local features for example weather it is still a convenient way to access one of my favorite newspapers the price is a good value and i love reading it when i want where i want on the kindle there are better renderings of newspapers available on the kindle the freep on the kindle may be a disappointment if you also get the nyt or wall street journal nevertheless i am pleased with the continued access to this beacon of the midwest,136,39
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,4.0,positive,i just got my kindle before taking a trip to us virgin islands i subscribed to the free press and it was great having my hometown paper available everyday now that I am home i will keep this subscription in addition to my 3 day a week home delivery with daily e-editions i actually found this kindle version easier to read than the e-edition also at work they frown on us surfing the web so i will take my kindle to lunch and read the paper and access the other mobile news websites to get my news fix i think this is great and I am sure things will improve as time goes on,112,40
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,my dad was bummed when he found out that the paper will not be delivered to his home anymore so he got a cheep laptop and used the online version that he has access to the online version is nice but on a laptop it is kind of a pain in the butt but it does have the entire paper including graphs comics and pictures the kindle version has none of this i think it is also missing most of the stuff that the paper has as far as articles no pictures no comics no ads nothing i know the kindle does some well greyscale graphics so i would expect to see that i just end up using the pda version it is the same thing and i think it does have some pictures that show up i understand that it is not that fast but i miss a lot less untill they bone up and unstrip this subscription i am ending it at the 14 day free trial mark it is not worth more then 99c a month to me,178,41
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i am getting used to the format on my kindle but would like to see pictures movie times and death notices i will continue to read the free press but look forward to improvements,34,42
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i have a difficult time understanding what people expect from a kindle newspaper do you get the graphics and photos no because you are viewing it on a e-book reader do you always get every story in the online paper probably not but really who cares what I am looking for is a quick and convenient way to read the newspaper on my kindle with the detroit free press edition i get that i can read it in probably 30 - 45 minutes perfect,80,43
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,1.0,negative,this has to be the most half hearted attempt at providing a polished professional layout and content that i have seen since high school do not waste your money,28,44
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,2.0,negative,i was pleased when the detroit free press was made available however very few news articles 4 - 5 articles in various news categories but then would get 20 sports articles love sports but not at the level of these articles,38,45
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,3.0,neutral,i was very excited to get the freep via my kindle every morning for a two week trial period but this version of the freep needs improvement there are no pictures at all and related articles are not grouped together so you might read a story and then five stories later see a related article to story 1 that is a minor point to be sure but the lack of photos is a deal-breaker for me I have read other kindle papers like the washington post that have terrific photos included not sure why the freep can not do the same I shall check back in a few months with the hope this is a work in progress,113,46
Kindle_Store,B001XCWUSO,2.0,negative,i was very excited about getting a michigan based paper on the kindle sadly this paper is just not much more than an ap dump and there is not much in the way of analysis i was mostly bored by the articles this is not a problem with the kindle edition but the paper in general is not something I am willing to subscribe to,64,47
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,I am baffled by the reviews for this it is two very short stories at best and they are not very good in my opinion complete waste of money and time glad it only cost 99cents not very suspenseful not very thrilling just horrible,40,0
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,this book was one heck of a thrill ride hitchhiker is extremely well written dark and twisted it has an intriguing concept the main character is a serial killer who runs into another sadistic psycho that has a partner i do not want to admit it but i actually started feeling sorry for the guy i think it was very clever for the author to show a serial killer who is a bit frightened disoriented and even panicked obviously there is no character to root for in hitchhiker since all main characters are evil but i still rooted for david because he has to fight for his life alone hitchhiker is a fun exciting book i did not want it to end i have never hitchhiked and after reading this book i will not even try i will also think twice before trusting a sheriffs deputy if you are into crazy serial killers and enjoy battles of wits then this is the book for you it will definitely give you chills the ending is a cliffhanger which probably means we will meet these insane murderous guys again,186,1
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,i was looking for a horror book by an author that i have not read before tim kizer is a new name and hitchhiker must be his first offering on amazon kindle i am glad i bought this book i thought hitchhiker was disturbing and very entertaining it was a fast paced gripping easy read even although i am usually able to predict twists in horror / suspense books hitchhiker caught me off guard the author knows how to pull the rug from under his readers feet i especially liked the trick with state quarters that tim kizer used to reveal who the second serial killer was my only complaint is that there is no sequel yet which would tell us what happens to these serial killers afterwards the book has three serial killers a loner and a team of two twisted psychos who battle each other there is a lot that can happen between them after the events depicted in this book I am hoping the author will write a sequel I am a fan also there is a very interesting bonus story intoxication which is more subtle but riveting nonetheless i can not wait to read new books by this author which will hopefully include a sequel to hitchhiker,205,2
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,was just the same as many other stories just names changed and very minor differences no really detail images to hold your interest,23,3
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,this book was in my opinion poorly written there are several stories in this book all equally unbelievable all of the characters are superficial and generated no emotional reaction for me,32,4
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,3.0,neutral,the stories were all right but they were too predictable especially the first one with hitchhiker still not bad for what it is,23,5
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,3.0,neutral,hitchhiker is a decent and different short story if you like horror this is worth a read if not do not bother well written but short stories and horror are not my favorite styles or genres,35,6
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,an enjoyable book a must read if murder is your interest,11,7
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,i think it is a story about something I had never thought about and i love thrillers / mysteries it is an easy read,21,8
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,i love a good thriller and this was right up there thank you can not wait to read intoxication tim kizer is on my radar,24,9
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,3.0,neutral,good story line could have been written a little better but it was good enough to make me purchase his other book days of vengeance worth the read if your in need,32,10
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,i was expecting more but it fell flat i was hoping for more about the killers not this weird cat and mouse at the beginning i had no time to embrace the characters,33,11
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,the premise of the main story in the book two killers meeting one a hitchhiker and the other giving him a ride was not new it was done and really well in 2010 before this book was published in the story serial by jack kilborn / ja knorath and blake crouch but since i found the premise interesting i figured I had read another authors take on the same thing i really did not like it at all and I shall just describe the big reasons why first in addition to not being an originalfor the premise the author for some reason added the laci and scott peterson case into the story he used different names and such but it was detail for detail that case made me wonder if anything about the book was the authors own original thought orsecond was dialog it was bad as if the author were struggling to keep true to proper english but that failed because no one always says i am rather than I am or we are instead of we are just as 2 examples it felt and read disjointed and un natural third is it never made the two main characters seem at all like the big bad guys they were supposed to be i realize there is not a lot of room in a short story for character development but there should at least be some the author basically has to tell the reader these are big bad killer guys which kind of defeats the purpose they were 2 dimensional and flat the same problems came up on a much smaller scale with the second story which was ok i did not read beyond that i wanted to like this story but just two many issues with it to work around,299,12
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,i really liked these samples they peaked my interest enough to get the entire book the more books i read from this author the more i like him and his books,31,13
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,sorry could not get into this book it was not up to what i like hitchhiker was not my cup of tea,22,14
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,it was an interesting book it had more than one story but they linked together making it very good reading,20,15
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,i think the twist in a few of these is astonishing you definately need to read this book and not put it down,23,16
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,one good thing the style is good so the story is easy to read the anti-hero however is not believable i have to admit that i like a modicum of logic in a plot however thin a plot may be so i am rating this book two stars,48,17
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,this is a book that contains two short horror stories and several sample chapters from a horror novel i am only mentioning this because it is not really clear from the preview of the book a hitchhiking killer flags a car and catches a ride with well another killer no really a spoiler anymore i saw something about it in the reviews so i suspected this would happen still the original twist aside this is just like tarantinos earlier works it is not really about the premise it is about the tension as the story unfolds multiple points of view switching timelines pretty much everything is there the second story is more subtle and that is perhaps why not so many reviewers talk about it however i found it more involving than the first one leslies character is better developed than the characters in the hitchhiker and her doubts about her sanity keep propping the story forward an attentive reader will notice the influence of the genre classics in this story as well however it does not really make it predictable the book would benefit from a real table of contents and a more detailed upfront explanation of what has included however that is an easy thing to fix both stories make for a good reading even although they are somewhat mismatched in their premise the execution with multiple twists and revelations does demonstrate this promising authors style rather effectively good read for suspense thriller horror fans,243,18
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,i do not understand the bad reviews on this short book i thought it was a good quick read and a novel view of the serial killer genre maybe I am weird but i actually laughed at the story ending it was a great entertaining read and i sometimes think some readers would find fault with anything just to be negative give this book a try when you want to be entertained for an hour you will not be disappointed,76,19
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,this was the stupidest book i have ever purchased from amazon and let me tell u i have over 2000 kindle books writer did not even have correct grammar let a lone anything good to say i could have done a way better job of writing then they did i am soooo disappointed that i will request a refund ridiculously bad do not buy,64,20
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,like one other reviewer i read most of the first part of the first story i just could not get into the story for me it was too unbelievable the dialogue between the two main characters had this same problem they spoke to each other like they were friends or trying to explain themselves for simple things even after they both realized they were both killers and one asking the other to turn over his girlfriend to save himself maybe i will go back later and give this one another chance or read something else by the author but at this time i can not recommend this title i gave it two stars because i got it for free,117,21
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,just by reading the title i thought hitchhiker was going to be just like every other hitchhiker movie i saw about some girl hitchhikes across country and has to escape from some deranged lunatic but this novelette is completely different it is about when one serial killer meets another and what can happen when they are both itching to kill it is such a cooland the author tim kizer is very creative he put his own spin on something that was done hundreds of times he made his own niche and it works not only is thegreat but kizer really captures the readers with his colorful word choices but he also keeps the excitement and entertainment throughout the whole story i was hooked from beginning to finish i highly recommend this story to anyone looking for a new fresh author to read or anyone looking for a new horror / suspense story that will have them wishing for a sequel,159,22
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,hitchhiker is a suspenseful compelling read that really keeps the reader grasped on every word it is simply written but very fast-paced i felt myself unable to put it down as i got further into the story the plot itself had me hooked like a serial killer against another serial killer the concept is just really entertaining and i could not wait to read more i really enjoyed this quick but satisfying story but the only thing i disliked was that i wish it was longer because i really enjoyed it and i wished there was a sequel the bonus story was awesome as well and i look forward to reading more from this author,113,23
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,4.0,positive,the title is a bit misleading but the stories and writing are great i really would like to buy the last one,22,24
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,i only read the first short story about the hitchhiker but it was so uneven and odd that i barely got it finished i did not take the time to read the second short story in this the dialog was off the descriptions lacking terribly and the narration was just plain odd i did not like this at all,57,25
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,this was the first selection on my kindle that i have not enjoyed to some degree i rarely do not finish what i start but this is one book that i could not bring myself to finish,37,26
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,hitchhiker is entertaining and thrills come to mind with expectations really this book is interesting to read and also the author pointout some subjects happening under curtain in the world this kindle in low price is and could be recommended to all of my friends and people who love to read crime stories,53,27
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,3.0,neutral,i was somewhat disappointed with these short stories i thought the premise of the hitchhiker had a lot of promise what would happen when a hitchhiking killer catches a ride with another killer maybe it is because of it is brevity but the story never grabbed me and i just did not see the twists and turns noted by other reviewers actually i enjoyed intoxication more but again i felt that a good premise was wasted on a superficial story both great ideas but the to me execution on each was disappointing,89,28
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,the worst thing I have read on my kindle so far both stories started out with intriguing ideas but tanked in the execution the events were highly improbable and even editing to fix the misused words and awkward sentences would not have helped that much it just would have been that much more boring the preview to the novel was the very worst waste of my time unfortunately it was impossible to stop until the end i was just that curious to see how much worse it would get i truly believe a 6th grader could have done better,95,29
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,have to agree with valpal just two mediocre short stories and a few chapters of the next book complete let down,21,30
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,2.0,negative,like my title says just alright the first story was blah it was okay a killer running into another killer while hitchhiking how ironic is that the killer ron set out a trap for david beating him to the punch the rest of the book was a yawn i could not get into it and never got the understanding to the storyline 2 stars because the first story was alright i guess,71,31
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,the story was very well written however miss hilda needs her mouth washed out with soap there is a difference between being wicked and being nasty i know it is fantasy but please let us see the nice side of hilly bad witch i did like theof the story if you like this type of story forever neverland is a great read ps bad snow white too only for another reason you need to wonder if price charming ever asked her hey snow you ever notice how much junior looks like sleepy,92,0
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,if you can overlook the lack of proofreading or maybe it is a translation to english problem this is a fun read i even went to his website and downloaded the complete series of hilda the wicked witch series and they are all very good it is interesting to see the writing develop and greatly improve do not do as i did and mix up the sequence do read them in order i would recommend reading snow white first although i guess this is the second in the series although the writing seems to be the start then hilda the wicked witch the challenge then hilda and zelda i look forward to more hilda she has definitely shiny,115,1
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,while this book is no literary masterpiece it certainly kept me entertained which i believe is the authors purpose i love the way he was able to insert different fairytale characters into his book so effortlessly hilda is a great character i do not believe i would call it raunchy at all you could definitely make your own interpretation with regard to the dwarfs and snow white which make the book that much more interesting i can not wait to read his further works also the typos were barely noticeable,97,2
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,obviously not a kids story anymore this is a delightful but wonderfully twisted take on the whole fairy tale setting yes bad language some typos some suggestive and perverted comments all in all a fun read just keep in mind what you are reading,44,3
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,while better than the original hilda it still was not a good book poorly translated to english and to kindle i expect some mistakes in all books i read whether print or e-book but this book was just over the top with too many wrong words glad it was free but still wish i had skipped it altogether,58,4
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,the story is all right the egregious sex is tolerable the writing is only acceptable for a teen-age non-native speaker of english who is vanity-publishing and thus forgoing an editor the book is filled with grammatical errors peculiar word choices and tortured idioms even a spell-checker would have lessened the pain a bit skip this one if you have any fondness for the language,64,5
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,the story itself is kind of cute but oh my god the writing and the lack of editing the sheer volume of typos is astounding to behold please please please get someone to proof your work prior to publishing,37,6
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,hilda is short for hilarious i love her attitude i also loved that boneylegs makes an appearance in this book come on you got to love a witch that lives in a hut with chicken legs i would have given this a 5 but i thought it was a little creepy with the snow white / dwarf thing,55,7
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,hilda the wicked witch is back i loved the first one and enjoyed this one as much that hilda is such a clever clever girl and those dwarfs are hilarious you will find out why they really enjoyed having snow white stay at their cottage mr katers writing is laughing out loud witty he has definitely growing as a writer i recommend this book highly although it is inappropriate for children under the age of 17 it is a fun easy to read twist on a fairytale classic that shall make you look at the snow white story in a whole new way congratulations paul,99,8
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,it took awhile to get through not award winning but cute just okay but it was free if you have time to kill try it out,27,9
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,we downloaded this for our 7 year old not familiar with it big mistake had nothere was language like hate and b tch and now after reading some of these other reviews i am sure there would be more objectionable stuff,42,10
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,good for reading to children they will enjoy it nothing like snow white as we used to know it as children ourselves,23,11
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,what a page turner can not wait to read more books by this author thank you for a exciting take on snowwhite,21,12
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,i am reading this seriese because it is free have a few more to get through the author is an ok writer,22,13
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,this was not the most exciting book I have ever read but it was entertaining i find I am beginning to like hildas outlook on life laughing out loud have only read the first two books so far and liked them both,38,14
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,i read this book on airplane rides and it kept me entertained the story is funny and silly and at times odd but i enjoyed it an easy read,29,15
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,i know i put 5 stars but a little venting first i am an avid terry pratchett fan bordering on obsessive and i am peeved that paul kater would dare suggest that his story is based in discworld he mentions three witches from terry pratchetts world involved in this story and that is absolutely absurd in katers world suck an elf is a common expression and in pratchetts world you do not even say the word elf if you are magical and sucking them would be deadly being in the presence of an elf is deadly in katers world there are socerers and in pratchetts world that is not allowed it is also deadly same with dragons in pratchetts world the big ones do not exist basically pratchett fans would understand only little ones the size of dogs this in not by far the only mistakes the two worlds are completely different and kater made a tremendous mistake here that being said this book is the only one of eight eight so far that even tried this so i guess i will cut him some slack because i did love the stories they are not well written i will agree but the story is great if you have any imagination you can easily forgive the unprofessional writing and enjoy the story many people expect too much from kindle free books this is a venue for amature writers to get their stories published they do not have editors and teams of people working behind them the stories are pure and unedited that is what makes them great this story is from his mind and no one elses and it is a good one i spent two days reading all eight and i would not hesitate to read another even if i have to pay for it enjoy,303,16
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,the most beloved wicked witch ever returns in another volume the language problems that ran rampant in the first installment is still here although it does seem less pronounced and in no way detracts from the great story being told fair warning this is not exactly a fairy tale for kids instead it is gritty unique and at times a bit racy although there is nothing explicit any actual sex is just mentioned in passing,74,17
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,a very entertaining read it would have been apt for older children who have known of the classic snow white but with the not too subtle sexual scenes it is r18 at best it must really be the authors writing style but i really find myself frowning at a lot of redundancies example snow white had eaten and drunk from the food and drink on the table really what else would one do with food and drink another thing and i might have probably missed it did the queen get to realize that snow white was the bride or is the answer in the third book in the series oh well as i mentioned it was very entertaining i really enjoyed it,122,18
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,this book was entertaining for a casual novel the main character was well written and had an attitude that amused me the plot stayed true to the original story with details that spiced up the open spaces do keep in mind that there are mentions of inappropriate behavior even if it is never described graphically however i found the editing to be poorly done there were several spelling errors missing words and poor transitions between scenes i do not believe that whoever wrote edited this really cared about quality work rather just getting the book finished,95,19
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,i downloaded this because a I am broke b i love fairytales and c i have yet to meet an updated fairytale that i could not love at least partially until now this work is absolutely packed with typos terrible syntax and inane dialogue particularly excruciating is the habit the legendary baba yaga has of calling the main character girlfriend and vice-versa like so many other characters the main purpose of baba yaga seems to be to tell hilda how cool and superior she is giving the whole thing the feel of an amateur fan fiction that someone mistook for an original work and published i was also infuriated when the author introduced three terry pratchett characters granny weatherwax nanny ogg and magrat garlick i tried to believe that maybe this was a crossover but when the three highly distinctive characters behaved in opposition to their established modes of behavior and the payoff was once again one of them magrat telling in excruciating detail and with the kind of over-explaining quality exhibited by fifth graders in a creative writing class how cool and superior hilda is while also conveniently identifying hildas favorite characteristics pair these faults with other deliberate features that make my head throb see repeated references to the mean queen awkward inside jokes like king louie who wrote a book about the jungle the removal of power from traditional characters to give to hilda and the over-sexualization of snow white within the frame work of the original story in which she is a child and you are left with a vaguely plagaristic self-aggrandizing pointless piece of schlock that belongs on a fanfiction site not amazon,275,20
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,where do i begin this book is awful i only got it because it was free but now i do not know if i can bring myself to finish it there are tons of errors and bad sentence structure abounds the plot is pretty lame and the author tries in vain to tie it to the original fairy tale but fails miserably i also thought the drunken orgy between snow white and all 7 of the dwarves was in bad taste this book is just lame i did not much care for the first one either but I am a sucker for free books now i can see why it was free,109,21
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,i love hilda she is my new hero hilda is the type of wicked witch who has her own agenda and follows it she is not horribly wicked i found her to be more fun wicked it is an amusing book that answers the question why did 7 strangers let a woman they never met stay on in their house the answer of course is they were horny little men and snow white was not so innocent i know the editing was not always great but look past that it really was an entertaining read,93,22
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,i do not think that I am too far off the mark when i say this is a cheap knockoff of terry pratchett the early chapters of the book read like a piece of discworld fan fiction and the author appropriates by name three of pratchetts characters in one scene and i think that katers writing has more in common with fanfic than any other genre it is highly derivative and the writing is stilted and choppy the writer also resorts to fanfic trick of making previously known characters more profane or promiscuous as opposed to some creative twist on them finally the text does not appear to have undergone even the most rudimentary editing which means there are abrupt shifts in tense misspellings and grammatical errors galore sure it is a free download but you will still have to spend time reading the thing you would be much better served by picking up the real thing in the form of a novel by terry pratchett say wyrd sisters or reaper man or tom holt snow white and the seven samurai,175,23
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,thefor this book is wonderful sadly the results do not live up to the promise the grammar is atrocious the tense ridiculously inconsistent the humor heavy-handed and the editing severely lacking someday paul kater may well be an excellent writer certainly he has the creativity he just lacks the skill i felt like i was reading a novel written by a twelve-year-old with a dirty mind,67,24
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,well she has back this is one of the most likeable witches to be sooo mean she reminds me of alexis from dynasty i can not wait for further adventures of hilda the stories are captivating and fun i like that she is not excessively cruel but just to thein this book she comes to the aide of snow white simply because she does not like the wickedmother she has a talking house with an attitude a taste for unusual sleepwear and a twisted sense of humor i do recommend this book to anyone that likes to read a good story with fun characters i believe that mr paul kater has stumbled upon the right combination of storytelling and writing skills i know that i want to see more of hilda,132,25
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,this book seemed as although it would a fairy tale written from another point of view similar to the books written by gregory maguire not even close it became quickly apparent that the author was not a native english speaker or the work had been poorly translated that was the first distraction the second and fatal distraction was a lack of development in both characters and plot lines hilda has jarring quirks of language shiny cool puppies that while commented on by other characters is never brought to fruition or given an explanation snow white turns out not to be so snow white after all but no discussion of why or how this came to be is ever bantered about other sub-plots are also left undeveloped who are the broom sellers and why exactly are they so intent on exacting revenge on hilda who in time-honored wicked witch fashion merely did not want to buy a broom the witches annual meeting on scary mountain a name brimming with lack of imagination seems so important but why what is causing the undercurrent of suspicion and dislike among the witches who are these witches and what do they bring to the tale and why oh why is rumplestiltskin there why is the house fixated on being painted the dwarves are unhappy with one another the king is a milquetoast the wicked stepmother is a bumbler but never do we learn any more other than these surface details there is never a reason to feel invested in any of the characters and therefore the story itself one dimensional characters subplots with no context and a strained use of language made for a disappointment from what promised to be and could have been a fun and thought provoking twist on an old fairy tale,300,26
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed reading the short tale because there were some funny moments i thought the foul language was not necessary and the portrayal of snow white as a hoe was un-expected however i did enjoy seeing it from hildas point of view,42,27
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,it gives you some basic words but not in a very useful context if it was much larger and organized in a useful manner it would be much better might even be worth paying for however for free what the heck,41,0

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,i am not attracted to this book so much but it will help some to learn new and possibly relearn some words and more,23,5
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,2.0,negative,if you are really looking to learn german this book will not be much help it does not teach common verbs or grammar and even having not taken a german class in several years i could spot mis-translations if you know absolutely no german this may still be helpful but someone looking to really speak the language would do better elsewhere,58,6
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,despite the structure and the kind of examples are well done the are few words to know or remember you end upwaiting more,23,7
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,simple way to learn some of the basics but if you know no german then this may not be the best it does not teach you hello goodbye please and thank you a must for me wherever i travel even if i can not say anything else,45,8
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,i chose this book to try and regain my german vocabulary after years of neglect i did notice several mistakes herein the chapter on numbers is missing the number 6 with the number 5 repeated where the sechs should have been also the book only gives the familiar pronoun usage du never sie that is used for children and animals never with strangers as you would encounter on a trip several translations were incorrect with one even repeating the german where the english was to be this book is good for reviewing your vocabulary but whoever did the proof reading should have done a better job it let me know i remember more german than i thought i did as for the beginner they would be served better by taking a course,133,9
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,i like the way it is set up for learning,9,10
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,2.0,negative,first no definite / indefinite articles how frustrating it it to learn the nouns and then later have to go back and spend the time again on the same words to learn the articles or worse having to carry a dictionary around with me pause the player and look up the gender each and every time so i can practice the article with the noun from the beginning or worse having to carry a dictionary around with me come on people have some sense other than that it is useful to build a very basic vocabulary and get a sense of word order some of the words they use however are not in my dictionary and do not match the words that actually are given in the dictionary so is this some dialect east german maybe and some words were just to indistinct to make out at all an accompanying written text of the sentence examples and words would be helpful,157,11
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,right on the first page on the how to use section it says the book is a collection of key spanish vocabulary the publisher should have reviewed it better and change the spanish for german after the copy and paste other than that i found it too basic and for someone who already has some german knowledge it really does not help,62,12
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,5.0,positive,finally got a chance to take a look at this book helps a lot when used with language learning software,20,13
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,excellent publication worth having in the german learners library,9,14
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,i was looking for something more toward vocabulary building rather than the basics of the language so it did not really live up to it is title that aside it is a real failure on grammar i gave up on it when i saw that it categorized the german equivalents of possessive pronouns her his our as adjectives fail it also said that frau was a neuter noun wrong,68,15
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,this is fine if you want to know animals and body parts but actual conversation words are not in this book,21,16

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,2.0,negative,well in german one needs to know how plural is and how the masculine feminine or neutral nouns are made and one can not find that here,26,26
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,just a list of words and their translation can be useful for a low price,15,27
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,it is a great method but i really think he attributes a bit too much to himself essentially is the same method that has been used for millennia but with a few minor improvements no need really to buy more than one of this books for every language is a matter o creativity rather than different methods,56,28
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,5.0,positive,it is great and helps immensely to my ongoing learning the german language,12,29
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,3.0,neutral,between my friends who speak and use the language in their lives it was fun for me used it as a game from me to them but it has not helped me learn nor encouraged to study german on my own,41,30
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,it was ok good supplement for those already have a background on german,13,31
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,extremely helpful if read again and again then you are prepared a little for germany but needs more words such as taxi hotel and much more,26,32
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,i really liked this book there is a couple of english grammar mistakes although,14,33
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,this book was no help whatsoever my mom teaches me some german and i could see lots of wrong words it teaches the basics but if your going on a trip to germany do not rely on this book the germans will give the weirdest of looks if you say anything from this,52,34
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,5.0,positive,it is pretty good for a free book,8,35

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,nice book the vocabulary and methodology have worked for me,10,46
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,are they serious it is lucky this was free because it is utterly useless I have flicked through it once and yet i can remember every section it covered animals body parts colours food and numbers yes each word has a few example sentences but that is a terrible way to learn a language without any grammar rules to help learners comprehend what they are actually learning as a result by the time anyone has advanced in their german enough to not be overwhelmed by all these different sentences they will know most of these nouns anyway i hate to be so harsh the description should have just been honest about the books purpose instead of praising it as containing the most useful words in the german language what use are nouns without verbs to make sentences anyway,135,47
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,an excellent recourse for the tenses you can not use it for a dictionary because you already have to know how to spell,22,48

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,5.0,positive,this teaches many words and phrases very quickly by building sentences around a single word associated with an image it imprints into memory on many levels simultaneously i have been self-teaching german for a week or so and had some basic understanding of the language and some vocabulary up front which certainly helped but i have not found a better system to help me along at my current of learning beginner but with some experience especially in pronunciation,78,56

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,1.0,negative,this was not what i needed the frases were not fit to a usable theme and there was no dictionary follow up on the chapters perhaps a picture type of teaching would be better for to learn a language that way you have sound and visual reference,47,65

Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,4.0,positive,it has a lot of basic vocabulary for german but there is a misspelled word and a grammar mistake which could be a typographic error,25,70
Kindle_Store,B006OIUCR8,2.0,negative,a simple book to help memorize some words it has each word in english as a title then the german translation and sample sentences in german and english there is also a photo below the title big negative the articles der die das are missing i consider this as a fatal mistake in a book for teaching new words in german therefore only two stars otherwise this is a good add-on to my methods to learn new words in german reading word-cards mnemotechniques,83,71

Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,the book covers the substance of the letters of mary todd lincoln but the letters themselves are not included needless to say it did not take me long to finish the book overpriced for the content and a must skip,39,1
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,this was a quick read that did not get into the subject with much detail i was not aware of marys insanity but this left me with a lot of unanswered questions was she actually insane or was there another reason for being locked up i was left with the impression that no one knows for sure what was the actual relationship between mary and robert it is something to do some more reading on,73,2
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,this was an interesting overview of the mary lincoln mental problems story it does not however contain the lost lettersthe whole story really read like a preface to a story or the letters themselves I am glad i got this as a free selection,43,3
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,i was able to download this book short when it was offered free and for that i am grateful the synopsis will entice you to buy the book thinking there are revelations to be revealed in some lost letters that were indeed found however the only thing the book does is to tell you some brief things that were supposedly found in the letters the letters however are no where to be seen all that is in the book are suppositions and conjecture of what is really in the actual letters any of this information can be obtained on the internet if you get it free go for it i would just be really upset if i had paid for it,121,4
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,there have been many many scholarly works about mary lincolns mental health that is great for scholars and hard-core lincoln buffs but for those of us that want to learn more without taking a master class this quick read is ideal,40,5
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,i was able to obtain a copy of this book when it was free selection that is good because there was no preview of the book available before i ordered the book i did an online search regarding the lost letters the author did find the lost letters so i had assumed that they would be in this book not so further if you had no prior knowledge of robert lincoln then this would not provide enough information to truly understand either mary lincolns alleged insanity or what robert lincoln was attempting to do i did have some knowledge of robert lincoln and his career and i was aware of this incident with his mother i had hoped to have a more thorough understanding of mary but this book did not provide any more of an understanding than what i already had it is a short read the formatting is done well and if there were any typos they flew over my head I am disappointed that the actual letters were not included and not enough of the back story was provided to put what was presented in context,184,6
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,i had never really investigated this topic however i felt like i did not get anything new from this i gave it one star because i appreciate anyones effort to write this proved nothing and improved nothing boring and i am sorry waste of time and money do not bother,48,7
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,i find it so interesting i can only read it online when i get time and can not wait to get to it it is excellent,24,8
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,while this is an easy and moderately interesting read it disappoints one would hope to see at least a few of the actual letters,24,9
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,this book has two sections the first is the story of mary lincolns insanity and the steps robert lincoln took to protect her from herself the second section is the transcripts of mary lincolns letters the author does an excellent job of using excerpts from the letters in the first section but it is nice to read the letters in their entirety the worst part of this book is the realization that taking advantage of the mentally I shall is not a new thing so called advisors and friends of mrs lincoln tried to help her but it is easily seen they were manipulating her for their own gain,108,10
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,nothing new in this book really quite boring do not waste you time or money was really disappointed in this,20,11
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,interesting read this book provides a much less sensational view of mary todd and I am glad i read this book we all know that marys perspective was a bit off-kilter but one can certainly understand why and how she got that way given that she experienced such great loss and so many times over such a relatively short period of time she has been historically portrayed possibly somewhat earned as a complete fool which now after reading this book seems richly undeserved frankly I am not sure very many of us would be able to withstand the very bright light of such public exposure to which she was subjected both before and after mr lincolns presidency and murder and after all mary todd was as human as the rest of us a tad too proud maybe but human nonetheless,140,12
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,was not much of a book snipets of letters that is all i felt cheated and wish there was a way to get my money back no real story or insight into her life,33,13
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,bless her heart having your husband killed right before your eyes must because unusual actions perhaps she was a big spender all of her life and her son did not know that i understand he was worried about her financial condition but to send her to a hospital for several years was a bit of a much appaarently the author did not have permission to quote from the letters which would have made it more interesting why is there no information about her years in europe who paid her bills who was her traveling companion surely she had one why come back to the united states the book left me with many more questions than before that is why the score,121,14
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,a useful piece of the puzzle was she insane or not i have recently read other books about mary lincoln and found it difficult to determine facts from fiction these letters will helpful,33,15
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,i just did not like it all i thought it would be fun to learn more about mary as the world still is not ready to deal with mental illness,29,16
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,although a few have complained in their reviews that the author does not quote line by line the lost letters i disagree with their thoughts that this book is worthless quite the opposite if one takes the time to carefully read the book you will see just how the lost letters fit in i had no problem at all following the theme and found quite a bit of new information contained within the pages the letters are constantly although informally sited within the context of the storyline i think perhaps the complainers did not take the time to slow down and read the book i suggest that readers find a quite moment uninterrupted where they can concentrate on the page i hope you come away with a more rounded view of mary lincoln and all that was done to her mainly by her manipulative son robert as well as by her in an attempt to gain her freedom from the asylum i highly recommend this book as a means of rounding out your viewpoint of mary todd lincoln,181,17
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,this was some new information mixed with some old information and called it a book i did not learn anything new about mary lincoln the person just confirmation that women were subjected to social injustice,34,18
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,amazing insight into her insanity into her fight with her last living son and how she felt well i will let you read the book i found it very insightful into her life a great read into a beloved womans life,39,19
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,a fascinating book i have wondered what happened to her after the assassination of her husband the letters and where they were found is a story in and of itself,30,20
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,good read for lincoln fans many people just as interested in lincolns wife and children i recommend this very short read,21,21
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,there was a lot i learned about mary lincoln i had not read anything about what happened to her after lincoln was shot it was sort of sad how she spent the remaining years of her life,37,22
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,i have always been interested in the lincoln family and this goes a long way in helping to understand a very complex lady,23,23
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,seemed a little strange wonder how so much went on in the white house and all the duties a president had to do,23,24
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,a well well written story too short for book status relating mary lincolns mental illness following abraham lincolns assassination it uses the accounting of news articles letters and stories told by both sides of the question concerning the need to have her committed,43,25
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,there is nothing in this so called book of any value do not bother reading it i wish i would have read the reviews before i bought it,27,26
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,to this day even although there have been many different accounts mary lincolns story remains on of the greatest political scandals I am forever amazed at the disdain held by the public on poor mary lincoln the woman american apparently loved to hate her lost letters are further confirmation of that fact,51,27
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,poor mrs lincoln she really had a hard time after president lincoln was assassinated it is shameful how her son treated her in the latter years of her life she is what in this day and age would be considered bipolar,40,28
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,it was a fair read i would have known a little more of robert mrs lincoln just seemed sad sad,20,29
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,this was a rather dry account of the discovery of some lost letters written by mary todd lincoln regarding her insanity case there were some interesting background facts regarding the emotional problems of the widow of abraham lincoln which seemed to escalate at the time of his assassination a peak into the lincoln family and relationships with friends as well as family added to a rather boring description of just how these lost letters came to be found very short but seemed much longer disappointing,85,30
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,this book is elementary at best and ridiculously short and not informative at worst i began to read it and i was led to believe that the pages i was reading we are introductory to the letters themselves however there were no letters to be seen i feel like i have just read a childrens primer poor mrs lincoln still being treated with no respect,64,31
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,was not enough of what i expected literally an extremely short book with no letters just talk of letters when i came to the end i was surprised as the reality of the number of pages was 19 that is right nineteen pages on kindle showing one page at a time this book and it is contents were not worth the 199 that i payed for it the funny thing is the pages were numbered 9 24 10 37 50 22 64 77 91 104 119 52 132 146 159 172 75 186 199 214 93 which was the end of the story then the extra pages 218 95 which was titled other great reads 223 97 publishing info then a reviewing page unnumbered i would pass this little one by not worth it in any form,140,32
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,a bit of a look into the years of confinement although the letters are referred to they are not presented in any form in this book,26,33
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,2.0,negative,i was a little disappointed in this book thought there would be more story behind the letters instead of just the letters interesting to read the letters and see what was going on but would have rather had some more story explaining what was happening at the time of each letter,51,34
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,did not give any real development of the character of mary lincoln would liked to have seen more introspection of her personality fast read,23,35
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,not a very long book but gives some insight into the mind of mary todd lincoln and how she and mr lincoln managed a marriage during the problems of the civil war,32,36
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,now that my interest is piqued i hope more will be forthcoming on this fascinating topic was mary a spoiled manipulator or a wronged widow,25,37
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed the history and background but was really hoping to read some of the letters the title was a misnomer,21,38
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,not as good as the book elizabeth keckley wrote about the emotional side of mrs lincoln that is just y opinion,20,39
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,3.0,neutral,their book does not contain copies of the letters or state how the letters can be accessed very important to historians,20,40
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,5.0,positive,i really love reading anything about lincoln and his family i think mary was a little misunderstood she was just a little eccentric how many other people are great read and i recommend this one,36,41
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,4.0,positive,very informative and factual as the origin teh letters are indesputed factual records particulary interesting as the film on lincon is about to be introduced to the screen the back ground of his family life adds to the interest,39,42
Kindle_Store,B0072ECPVY,1.0,negative,waist of money there are no letters included in the book this should have been a free selection as it is misleading,22,43
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book the characters were very vivid the plot was interesting but not so complicated that i lost track of what was going on this is not the most historically accurate highland romance that i have ever read but it was a lot of fun lachlan macrae is one of my favorite heroes i hope that he is in the other books recommended,65,0
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,this book has potential but does not deliver the story line is good characters are fairly well developed but there are numerous repeated phases and grammar / spelling errors also love scenes are unrealistic and boringly repetitive,34,1
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i do not usually leave reviews but i wanted to mention what a huge improvement the second edition of this book is over the first the author finally did an edit and cut out several of the non-essential sex scenes with this newer and more professional version it makes it easier to appreciate the plot and characters who were somewhat buried before,61,2
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i loved this story it was moving and had a little bit of everything but oh my god i could not believe this was released to the public without editting seriously what 10 year old let this pass their desk without serious red penciling there was not 1 sentence that did not have an error of some kind and make up your mind is it muira or muria appalling that said this would have never passed with a d in composition writing class due to the extensive errors but i did like the story and on that merit alone i gave it 4 stars because i could not reward a 5 due to the lack of edit read the next in the series although another lifetime still had some errors-but by far better in that department although not in content it takes place 30 years later shorter at 229 in comparison to the 564 pages of this book but worth the read,156,3
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,i almost never write a review however i felt compelled to do so with this book the sex scenes are raunchy and all but one of them are f scenes without any emotional depth whatsoever just do it fast and hard the dialogue was modern and american rather than old fashioned and scottish the grammar had many issues parallel structure improper word choice punctuation and tense the book lacked consistency in it is setting it was impossible to tell what period of time the book was set in there were references which made the setting seem to be in one period recent fighting with england but then this is contradicted by references to whalebone corsets bonbons and hot house flowers i have trouble imagining a small scottish village having a hot house fine gown maker and fine jeweler in a time when scotland had recently been embroiled in english battles additionally the tanists former mistress portrayed in the book was not typical of the place described a rich mans who are described as wearing fine jewelry in excessive amounts and having a fair amount of control in the lairds castle she sounded more like a woman from regency england the plot was okay but had many cliches even free this book is not worth your time or money,220,4
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,the story itself was good and i would give it more stars if it were not for 2 things 1 it is unfortunate that every five pages there is a lengthy and extremely explicit sex scene i suppose that is what some people want but i honestly believe that a good romance should be able to stand on it is own without the sexual play by play skipping through all of the sex scenes probably cut out a third of the book 2 this book is badly in need of an editing job there are so many typos i can not believe it was published like that,100,5
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,i really enjoy this genre and the story is a good one the one negative thing is that there are a lot of typos definitely in need of an edit,30,6
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,this is a looooong book but it was such a fun quick read that i did not notice it until i got to the end lachlan macrae is such a dreamy hero i do not know how historically accurate the kilts were okay i do know and they totally are not but it was fun to think about those kilts definitely made for easy access for some of the books racier moments and there were several of those lachlan and muira seem very well matched contrived conflict between two main characters is my pet peeve but this book managed to avoid that flaw this was a very enjoyable read I am definitely looking forward to reading more by this author,116,7
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,as soon as i finished reading this book i checked to see if there was a sequel i was very pleased to discover that that this is the first novel in a series seven books so far although there are a few formatting / editing errors which seems to come with the territory of self-published books the presentation was quite professional and easy to read the story itself was delightful although some of the twists and turns ex a forced marriage are common in romance novel plots the well-drawn characters made it seem fresh and fun there are a lot of love scenes in this book i was not expecting it to be quite so steamy but that is not a complaint the scenes seemed organic to the story and were more romantic than hot overall this was a great book i have already bought the next one,144,8
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,it came on a kindle how much more can you say about it la alall lal al ala ala ala,20,9
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,good grief muira is crying throughout this whole book i did a search for sob in the book-six pages of muira crying in the search get a backbone woman and lachlan thinks she is brave and strong she can not lie well but she certainly does it a lot this sat on my kindle so long i forgot what it was about and finally opened it and read it i had to force myself to finish it was that bad i had forgotten the names of the hero / heroine by the next day everyone went from one end of the emotional scale to the other in the blink of an eye definitely a bunch of bipolar people running around had promise never delivered,121,10
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,i had read the other comments and they did say that the story was good i just could not get over how the whole thing started with the lie perpetuated by the stupid heroine she just stood there and lied by omission so i was not impressed by the heroine from the beginning of the story then the flavour of the whole story was just too contemporary american for me this was supposed to be historical scotland this is supposed to have been a second edition but it needs another round of editing and i could not understand how one dapped for a kiss i did not think there was such a word but I have just checked and it means 1 to fish by letting the bait fall lightly on the water 2 to dip lightly or suddenly into water the bird dapped for the fish 3 to bounce or skip as on the surface of a body of water the stone dapped along the surface of the pond read more dap meaning and definitions nowhere does it relate to the act of kissing anyway i tried to finish it and i gave up after her failed attempt of leaving his place on foot told you she was not smart i have no yearning to find out about what happened to lachlan and muira,220,11
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this story it was a good page turner i loved the characters and the editing issues did not bother me either i especially liked how the hero protected the heroin throug out the story his honor he held proudly and i really enjoyed that about him he let her family believe the worst and endured it until the end i can not say too much about the details because i do not want to give the story away enjoy this book because i did,84,12
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,the storys theme and characters are great but the editing is atrocious and made it a bit difficult to read at time many many many errors in writing,28,13
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,i have tremendous respect for anyone who can write a interesting story and i did enjoy this story but i could not get past all the mistakes i spent twice the amount of time reading this book because i had to keep rereading and trying to make sense out of so many sentences i have to wonder if the author has taken the time to reread her own work i understand this is a second version but i this book still needs another round of editing the author has a good story and likable characters but this book just is not ready to go public,103,14
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i downloaded the original version of this story before the final editing and before some of the lustier scenes were reworked there were typos missing words in that first version but i did not let it bother me it was a free title after all i knew what she meant even if the words were not always there the story itself was way too capitivating for me to care one little whit about a missing verb now and then this is a beautiful story mesmerizing even it is got everything that a wonderful historical romance should have a beautiful strong-willed heroine a strong powerful hero conflict tragedy triumph and finally a love so true that nothing can get in it is way what more can you want laird mcrae alone is worth reading this book oh my goodness be sure to continue with ewans story a year and a day,148,15
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,the story was really good but the book needs some massive editing i do not mean sentences and paragraphs i mean spelling grammar tensesused no instead of know just as i would get into the storyline a mistake would pop up and bring me back to high school english class i did love the story although and hope to see more from this author,65,16
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,i so wanted to like this book because i thoroughly enjoy the time period setting and more however the old adage you get what you pay for definitely rings true-it was a freebie i could not get past 11 struggling to see if it got any better i got to the first sex scene notice i did not say love and the dialogue ended it for me too modern not scottish enough an historical romance should be able to stand on it is own without a generous sprinkling of the f word i see from the reviews that after i purchased it an actual editor was used the fact it was put out for the public before the editing nightmare that i began reading completely turned me off i did give it an extra star for the beautiful cover,135,17
Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,a romance set in the past two rival clans brought together by a young couple who learn to love each other even although their love is based on a lie also a traitor in their midst nearly causes outright war this could have been a great novel except for the fact there is not much substance and so much more could have been written about the clans instead the author is mesmerised by the couple with page after page of their erotic lovemaking which eventually becomes banal as nothing is left to the imagination i skipped loads of pages to find the story but sadly was disappointed nothing was there,110,18
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,do not buy it is a waste of 800 there has no ending sad the story keeps stopping in the middle of the story what in the he shall was this want my money back as soon as possible bullshit do not buy do not buy do not buy,39,0

Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,be prepared for the fact that the book has no ending and ends mid-sentance i assumed this was a glitch until i read the reviews and realised this is how the book ends very disappointed not one of the best tyree books I am afraid,44,2
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,4.0,positive,typos i just can not stand a publication that has not been properly proofread no wonder it was only 399 i expect more from omar tyree i was such a fan of his early writings before he changed direction and adopted a harder style he and eric jerome dickey went from romance writers to urban noir authors anyway the point is i like this novel but the typos are just not ok,70,3
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,how can you write a book with no plot no ending no excitement i was soooo disappointed in omar tyree for writing something like this he was bored and just decided to put some words on paper i want my money back,42,4
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,4.0,positive,it seems that ms queen is crazed in both worlds of what a woman needs wants and desires are for herself and a man ready for part 2,28,5
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,what can i say the book started out great it had me hook from the first page now with that being said i hate how the author ended the book i called amazon thinking i did not get the full download but to may dismay that was the end of the book omar tyree could have done better than that very disappointed,61,6
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,i have always been a fan of omar tyree but this insanity was just insane the main character was shallow and the book just stopped mid story so that i would buy the next book who stops a story mid sentence it is extremely unfair to the reader to leave mid story not even left with a cliffhanger it just stops needless to say i was so disappointed i would not recommend this poor excuse of a story to anyone you let us all down tyree,86,7

Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,it left me feeling duped I have loved omar tyrees work in the past so i was happy at this e-book offering the issue is that it is not a book however since that is what we are calling it then it is not worth the aggravation there are grammatical and spelling errors galor and then it just ends as it is getting interesting i would say that equates to unedited chapters and not a book and upon amazon review there are apparently parts 2 and 3 with a 4th pending I shall pass on the rest of the story I am sooooo disappointed,96,13
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,3.0,neutral,i did not like the way the book stopped it did not end it left you hanging there were some typing errors also that the editors should have caught it was ok although i want to get the rest of the story,42,14

Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,3.0,neutral,enjoyed the storyline but i looked for more and did not like the way it ended there was a lot more between queen and bryant that was left to the imagination i was definitely disappointed with the ending,37,21
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,4.0,positive,i started this book and it has the ending at the start then goes into the story what is not said is the ending is 4 books down the line and the 4th one is not out yet,36,22
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,1.0,negative,what the he will the story never ends we see her in the beginning having sex for money and then it is at the end we do not know about the other two kids how it even ties into the plot this was a horrible story it went to fast and left a lot of gaps shacking my head,54,23
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,3.0,neutral,so as i read the intro to the book i was very intrigued to see what pushed this woman to this point and obviously i was disappointed i can deal with a sequel but it ended awkwardly and furthermore i did not realize that my book says part 2 did i miss a part 1 I have looked everywhere and it seems that it starts with part 2 does anybody know if that is accurate and yea the typos shacking my head,74,24
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,2.0,negative,i have always been a fan of omar tyree in the past but i hate this new format I am a working busy mother who rarely gets a chance to read for leisure and this is a pain once you try to get into the story line it stops and you have to go search for a new book if this is his new format i will not purchase again,69,25
Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,3.0,neutral,the book it self was a good read even with the miss spell words but i did not like that the book ended in the middle of the story i have never purchase a book that ended in the middle of an story did not like that at all,47,26

Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,2.0,negative,grammatical errors were a big issue for me at first i thought it was because i got in the ebook version but they even were saying he when a female was talking who ever edited this book seriously needs to be fired as the others stated how do you end a book mid sentence i just wanted to know how she queen got to the point of murder two books in and we are not even close to finding out,82,32

Kindle_Store,B008GN0H6K,2.0,negative,the novel is a slow read I am disappointed i was a huge omar tyree fan but his work as of late has been lacking in content i hope that his future work speaks to what had me hooked in the beginning,41,38

Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,4.0,positive,the writer has numerous tips on how to select plant even rotate crops in your garden and which veggies are not compatible with others when planted together this is a big time saver and beneficial if you are planning a raised bed garden he has suggestions on how to lay our the containers where to locate them regarding sunlight feeding and watering frequency and care for the developing plants,69,3
Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,2.0,negative,not only not ultimate guide to gardening it barely gave some basic information a beginner would be clueless and even an intermediate gardener would be left wondering where the information was given the title,34,4
Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,4.0,positive,easy to read more for beginners but i liked it the section on companion planting was very helpful recommended for sure,21,5
Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,3.0,neutral,i suppose for free i should not expect anything more this is just basic gardening information that only served to whet my appetite for details that my poor old brown thumb needs guess I had better get a serious gardening book that will assist me this may cost me more than zero dollars haha,50,6
Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,3.0,neutral,this short but direct gardening guide was an excellent review of some basics so easily forgotten and also has good tips for fooling mother nature perhaps mostly i found it to be an ideal reference book for newcomers to the wonderful world of gardening really-the books only down side may be that it is so brief,55,7

Kindle_Store,B009J6185C,5.0,positive,this book is far from being an ultimate discussion of home gardening but it does contain sufficient information to get a beginning gardener headed in the right direction plus a few topics for the intermediate level gardener who wants to expand his or her skills the most important basic topics on gardening such as locations and preparation are in here as well as starting points for some useful information on companion planting container gardening hanging gardens and growing and preserving herbs i found the section on choosing plants to attract birds and butterflies especially helpful since that is something i am just beginning to do in my own garden the companion plants to repel bugs has several ideas I am going to be trying as well overall this book is especially well laid out for those relatively new to gardening but even an old hand such as myself can find new and useful information to add to my gardening enjoyment for in-depth coverage of specific gardening or problem solving topics you would still need to seek additional information sources but this book is a good resource to have on hand to get you started and for future reference recommended,198,11

Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed reading this it is difficult to read almost as if an attempt to write a modern story in historical ideas there is more description given to what has being served at every meal then actual development of a interesting story line if you are into boring and mindless this is a perfect book,56,0
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,4.0,positive,i found this book to be predictable but good no profanity or graphic sex scenes these are a plus for my taste and it does not leave you wondering how it ended,31,1
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,5.0,positive,i really love this author great heros heroines that are smart and more i finished the tuscans revenge loved it so i went right to this one i love this author she writes a good story no heavy sex scenes but you do not really miss them as the story progresses well without it this one is taking place in new orleans and the bayous in the area lots of historical facts thrown in from time to time that just add to the story little brother gets his friend to agree to a fake engagement to get his big brother off his back however big brother is smarter than he thinks and in discovering the real facts he falls for the girl i could not put this story down i spent all day reading it because i knew something great was going to happen soon and it did i highly recommend this book and probably all the rest of her books really enjoyed it and continued to think of the characters after finishing the book great read,175,2
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,3.0,neutral,i get the feeling this was originally written in the 80s for print and then this book got rereleased in digital format there is no mention of the use of cell phones or email the entertainment system of the wealthy maleis mentioned as consisting of records no mention of the presence or lack there of of cds i would not have minded the lack of current tech since that has no reflection on the story but the sexual attitudes of the 80s seems present it was just a little too constrained in the physicality between the male and female leads to end on a positive note great description of the environment the femalealmost always struck me as smart okay with the exception of the timing of her escape and outspoken i would definitely look for other books by this author to give her another try,149,3
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,i could not make myself finish this book i wanted to find something to like about it but i could not,21,4
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,i rarely review books especially free ones and a romance novel i grab for 0 comes with varying expectations what i never expect is a modern story where the heroine is abducted her words and sexually assaulted by our hero seriously he bruises her when she struggles to get away forces himself on her despite her clear refusal of his advancements things like please no I shall give you the occasional passionate bodice-ripper where there are sparks between characters but they learn more about each other come to understand that they have more in common than they thought blah blah blah that i will read with nary a comment about no-means-no and rape culture here we have only the female protagonists point of view and her point of view is that she has afraid angry and on the verge of tears for the majority of the book the protagonist even goes so far as to tell her that no one will believe her when she threatens to report him for kidnapping excuse me while i swoon we never hear any reason for her to fall in love with this man all i read was evidence for kidnapping sexual assault and battery spoiler alert they end up living happily ever after how,212,5
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,5.0,positive,this book was one of my favorites i loved the two main characters they sere perfect for each other from the momment they first meet you could tell they were going to fall in love,35,6

Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,4.0,positive,an enjoyable read without too many surprises but a nice ending recommend read to others who enjoy romance and tempers,20,8
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,2.0,negative,even given the time this book was written i just do not get how it is romance the hero kidnaps tries to intimidate and control the heroine he never professes or shows any real love for her that he wants her yes he even deceives her as to the meaning of a tradition he convinces her to be part of that it is only a game but he in turn takes this tradition as having real consequences he intends to hold her to without her knowledge how is that love by any stretch of the imagination his actions show a desire to control her not love for her this book would send a counselor at an abused womens shelter into seizures that being said i do like the authors writting style but i need to question the judgement shown in her storyline,140,9
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,3.0,neutral,not a blockbuster but great writing non the less very different type of story for me would read more of jennifer blake,22,10
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,a very disappointing romance surprisingly there is no sex other than kissing the heroine sherry is incredibly naive to the point of appearing pretty stupid it was impossible for me to understand how she fell in love with lucien after he kidnappped her and treated her with extreme harshness and disrespect also the kindle version had some completely unexplained typos in it for instance a boat is fled to thewhen i think the author meant tied to thethis is not even a malapropism it is just very poor proofreading that makes it difficult for a reader to figure out what is meant at the end of the book are synopses of some of jennifer blakes other books and hmmmm sounds like they are all pretty similar in tone and even plot no more for me thank you very much,140,11
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,4.0,positive,well written book only one or two typos a great saturday read i know the author has other great reads too,21,12
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,3.0,neutral,this story had pluses and minuses one plus that kept me reading was the fantastic descriptions of new orleans and the bayou it became in my thinking a most beautiful place however the sentences went against every writing rule i have studied there was too much use of be verbs had has been was were there were also telling verbs such as felt and begun to throughout the book the over-abundance of these really hurt the story tremendously the plot itself was a bit vague i was confused at times by the language as to exactly what sherry or lucien were saying to each other especially in some of her personal thoughts the romance itself was very clean which i appreciated there was not as strong of an attraction between the characters as i like but this was again probably because of the poor sentence structure overall a so-so read,149,13
Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,3.0,neutral,i felt like the plot took too long to develop it was tooo predictable as well i loved however the tension between the adversaries,24,14

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i like everything about this game except for the fact that i have to pick a category i think it should be completely open to anything also it is weird in the very hard category i had the word possible but at the medium level i had crazy 12-letter words that I had never heard of either way it is still a great way to pass time and i can play it with my daughters which is nice,75,0

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i use this when i tutor children teaching them to spell,11,22
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the game works exactly as one would expect the only problem is the number of guesses allowed although I am very good at word games i have yet to succeed even once with this game a major improvement would be to make the number of guesses allowed adjustable that would of course mean that the hangman image would be broken into more pieces,62,23
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this game is pretty fun but it does cheat like on very hard i thought the word was gorilla but the word was zorilla what the at is a zorilla pretty fun to play but it cheats so i think it should only get three stars and they should make it free so people dowaste money on a game that cheats,61,24

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in this game in my opinion it is not like the real hangman game on paper at all the original hangman game allows the players to interact by giving clues to the guesser this game does not give clues regarding the word other than giving one letter to the guesser how boring in addition it is virtually impossible to guess the word without asking for a clue which ends up being a letter and defeats the whole spirit of the game also the words that are to be found are very unusual which makes the guessing even harder there is not challenge in this game there is only frustration i want my 99cents back,116,27
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the categories are incorrectly named under animals they have fish same with veggies and more,14,28

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i bought this hoping for a cool game but this version of hangman is really disapointing one of this games flaws is when you click on the letters the cursor disapears i say unless you are willing to face this games problems do not by this game,45,52

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,some folks will say that this old game can not be compared to a computer game i am going to tell you that it can be betterwhy now do not gett me wrong i love playing a good mystery or jewels but these games do not have an aha moment when the word you are trying to discover pops into your mind then the little wiggle of pleasure you get as youj fill in the blanks a sense of pleasure is a nice reward you do not get blowing the heck out of something good day to you,94,78
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i know hangman is not the most engaging game but seriously you would think gameblend studios could at least make the game into exactly that a game not a cheap imitation of it when i bought this i thought there was no way you could possibly screw up a game like hangman but they found a way it is not that it does notanything it is the setup that is horrible you choose to play choose a category and difficulty and start the game one of the worst things about the game is that when you get the last letter in a word it does not show the completed puzzle it just starts the next one you would be better off getting a piece of paper and playing with someone,125,79

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i have not had this long enough to give it a thorough review upon first usage of it i was not really impressed but that opinion could change with more use there were some really strange words so it might just be me,43,109

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this game is fun we used to play this on long travel trips with the family the only thing is it does not display the winning word after you get it like it does when you lose it is nice to see the finished word,44,111

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is not what i expected i can not put my finger on what exactly maybe the categories and the items in each one like in the veggie category most are vegetables I have never heard of ever i like a challenge as much as the next person but i like to win sometimes too,52,115
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,it is a nice layout of the game with a lot of choices my 8 year old granddaughter enjoys playing too,20,116

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i really like it the only thing is that i wish it had longer words to solve and more catagories to choose from,23,118
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this game is really fun i can spend a lot of time playing this i really like all of the different categories the easy mode could be a little harder as all of the words were only 3 letters long i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves to play brain games and loves guessing games,58,119
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,my granddaughter and i played in the car when we went on vacation kept us busy all the way to the black hills,23,120
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,seriously what is up with the design it is downright ugly and way too complicated for my kindle it has to refresh the screen every time i hit wrong because the hanged man is too large to just refresh on it is own i thought it was going to be simple and fun like every word or the grid i would not reccomend this to anyone who has the ability to see the kindle screen but if you want a hangman game that will torture your eyes and the kindle screen go ahead and waste a dollar,95,121
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i bought it assuming i would need it to help pass the time away the only fun i have with this game is seeing how derpy the guy looks whenever i get a letter wrong,35,122
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this is a good learning experience I have learned a lot not five stars because maybe less fun than expected only five levels 6 subjects and different words on each one,30,123
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,this game can be used to pass time mindlessly the hint just gives the missing letters not what i was expecting there some of the category answers do not make sense eg bugs in the animal category a bug is an insect not an animal otherwise it was easy to use and maneuver thru,52,124
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game is good for what it is i suppose but they could definately have made it better atleast it does work on my kindle paperwhite as expected making it worth the purchase price,34,125
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i like to play hangman but having a face on the man is creepy also i think when you get the word correct the word should appear written correctly before the word completely disappears and the game tells you it is right this makes it seem kind of cut rate to me thirdly the letters do not always clear when you press them sometimes you have to press a letter several times for it to register at times i have had the same word come up with only one word between and lastly it would help to have the used incorrect letters showing along the side of the picture,109,126
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i have always liked the hangman game as a kid and now even more as an adult i too like the challenge of the game,25,127

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,all children learn this game fosters competition love of words and most important spelling correctly play alone or with another pairing up fun with learning is the name of the game,31,129
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i always enjoy playing word games i had hoped this game would be a little more of a challenge to play,21,130
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is not what i expected some words need to be longer and maybe hints provided and also meanings of obscure words after solving,24,131
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the easy ones are too easy and the hard ones really get you thinking fun to watch the man complete and incomplete,22,132
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,after playing a great game like every word i find the game very boring very easy level is more difficult than very hard glad it was only 99 cents,29,133
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is too simplistic it does not maintain or hold the players attention i occasionally play it usually only for a few minutes i would not recommend it,28,134

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the categories for words are pretty vague and I had prefer more of a marathon format allow you to do 5 words at once or maybe 10 or 20 from each category and then give you a score before the game over sign pops up an overall score option would help make it feel less like that is it when you finish a word,63,138
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the categories are not sharply defined enough and i feel like giving more than one word in a row would make this more entertaining give us the option to do a 5 word or 10 word block and see how we do,42,139
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i love this game for myself but it is teaching my granddaughter how to figure out the word and it is spelling on the very easy and easy she is a first grader I am so proud,35,140

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i guess i just do not like hangman i originally bought this game because i like the wheel of fortune and the description of wheel of fortune is that it is like hangman this is not close enough although but if you like hangman this is a great game haha,49,147
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,gwen senior citizen 69 years of age i love the game of hangman because as a senior citizen it helps with my memory and it brings back younger days of my life with my children when we played hangman together it is a great game enjoy it immensely,48,148

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,the game is a complete waste of time and money the words are short and the words are the same there is no fun to this game waste i say wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaasssssssstttttteeeeedo not buy this game,34,150
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,it would be so simple to make this game pretty decent there are 2 major problems 1 when you finally solve the word puzzle and put in the last letter it does not show you the word it immediately says you won but you do not get to see the word it is especially a pain if the last 2 letters in the word are the same it will catch you by surprise as it blocks you from seeing it and now you do not know what the word was 2 it repeats the same words too frequently i played this for less than 15 minutes and it was already repeating the same words in the category pathetic you are better off throwing your 1 purchase in the toilet it is more fun watching it going down the drain than to play this game,141,151
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,wish the letters were a bit larger and easier to read but fun to play anyway I have always loved to play hangman,22,152
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i thought this would be more of a time killer or at least last a little longer it is full of short words and there is not much difference between the easy and hard words,35,153
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i would like to have a view of my answer right or wrong and the letters from which I have selected before the rather large pop-up at the end covers everything that pop-up is annoying can you downsize it,38,154
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,I have played other hangman games and thought they were ok what makes this one stand tall are the various selectable levels they are not as easy as you may think the easy level is probably the hardest to master you will see i have been enjoying this more than any of the others the only reason it did not get 5 stars is the low quality of graphics it is a word game not a picture game you will be happy you bought it,82,155
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,my son recently got a kindle 20 and found this game he absolutely loves it so glad we found it,20,156
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i would like more options also the harder levels are actually easier since they have longer words with more letters so you can guess them easier go figure,28,157

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,it is ok i wish the letters were bigger because they do not use all the screen but it is a nice change from other word puzzle games,25,159
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,too simple no clues except categories which are v-e-r-y broad could offer african animals for example instead of the entire animal kingdom,21,160
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,this is a fun game with lots of levels to keep it interesting it entertains all of my children who range in age from 9 to 16,27,161
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game works okay you can gets clues to start the word manipulating the letters is good enough the bad thing is that when you win the rectangle saying you have won pops out and covers your word before you get to see it only solution is to take your time on the last letter and absorb what the result will be because you will never see the word you have created that seems to have won,72,162
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,we have only played it on easy so i am not sure how tuff it gets my 7 year old plays it most it was his purchase,27,163
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i bought this game for my grandchildren 6years old even the very easy are not so easy and once answer is found the same word is repeated over and over should use more common words,34,164
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,we have not quite conqured this one yet but we are working on it we only have 1 kindel but my husband might have to buy one our kid got me this one for christmas,36,165
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my grandsons to play they seem to like it better than i do i think it would be better if the game would show the last letter for the word that solves it instead the screen disappears quickly and in bery small letters indicates that you won and what the word was it would be better for kids if they could see their last letter appearing in the complete word,74,166
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i enjoy this game but i need to be in the right mood i would prefer more categories from which to choose,22,167

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,the game is good overall the only criticism i have is that when we used the foods and vegetables category some of the answers were ways that food could be cooked for example smoked to me that is not a food or vegetable and that was misleading other than that the game proved to be a great distraction on a long car trip it is worth the 99 cents,68,171
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,it is quick easy to operate and fun i can quickly play a game or two while waiting for something or someone,21,172

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i had hoped for a good hangman game when i got this but that was not the case first the guy you are hanging looks really stupid also you are hung after fewer missed letters than the classic game another weird thing is the words in the category are not always in the category that they should be and it frequently repeats words i would return it but it did give me a hangman game but it is definitely the lcd if i could go back to before i bought this i would not have made the purchase,98,177

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,while i have played this game as a child i thought it would be something fun for my nieces and nephews it does not work well at all and it includes in animals things like lice and moths which makes no sense to me,44,184
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game is definitely geared for kids the easy words are just short and the very hard words are longer but not too complicated the graphics are fun and in a pinch I shall play a few words just to pass some time but it does not keep me,47,185

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,if you remember when you played hangman on a piece of paper with your father you will love it five levels of difficulty six categories of words animals common words food human body office and business transport and vehicle i took one star off because it goes through only eight steps of execution two for the gallows and six for the hanged and i would sadistically prefer a slower process maybe ten or eleven steps i also would like a better and more humorous image of the hanged unfortunate one but it is all minor in comparison with the joy of feeling yourself a child again this time playing it hi-tech style with your own kids edited later some reviewers correctly pointed out that when you got the word correctly the game does not give you a feeling of satisfaction by showing a completed word instead you immediately see a half screen that covers the word and a question whether you want to play again it is idiotic on the part of the software creators and they should fix the problem as soon as possible actually i have to take another star for this reason but i will keep four for mentioned above nostalgic feelings,203,236

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,this is the worst game ever it freezes up a lot and you have to do a complete shut down to get it to completely stop the freeze it also repeats the lame words it uses,36,258
Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the game is played like traditional hangman-try to guess the correct word for each wrong letter guessed a limb is added until the man is hung the little man is unimaginative and looks the same every time the words that you guess are divided in to easy hard levels and into categories animals transportation and more there is very little difference between the levels and the categories are very broad for example the animals category uses every obscure dinosaur name it kind of takes the fun away when the word in question is not really something you recognize even if you happen to guess it additionally when you do get the word correct the screen flashes to a box that reads would you like to play again you never get to read the finished word the box pops up as you guess the last correct letter this simple game could be lots more fun and better thought through try again jared,160,259

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,only minor gripe is you can not see the word if you have won it seems it should not matter but when you are playing with a child you can not show them the right answer if you lose the right answer appears in small text you have to look for it it would be better if you saw the right answer where the blanks were it may be a minor point but you do not get to have the satisfaction if you win of seeing your correct answer with final state of your character often i might get three good guesses in a row with my last chance,105,268

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i could have ordered the hangman specifically for kids but i figured that they can start on the super easy level on play hangman and grow into it the only reason i rated it four stars as opposed to five is that we still have some lag time until the kids are truly into this game the oldest is doing fine with the game age seven but the youngest is still fixated on pairs,73,273

Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,very straightforward and just like the way it was played on paper no need for instructions just start filling in letters i would say it would have been more fun if the jared co had expanded on it a little bit and made some twists available like high scores or progressive levels if your man does not get hanged or a stay of execution if you get three in a row something screwy like that it does offer very easy easy medium hard and very hard levels plus different categories to let you focus on what the word could be i liked it because my kids and i can play together at bedtime or while waiting for the chronically late doctors,119,282

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,while the subject of the story was great it was clear less than half a chapter into the book that this book was translated from another language stumbling through the murky writing i found myself correcting word usage and grammar on every page not fun when reading as a teacher i can understand what the author meant however found it a struggle to read,64,13

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,the reason i have you only is because of the wording at 25 per cent the immediate thing to do to find what why was coming from kingston and many more instances it w as like reading two different authors very confusing excerpt on double cross written differently,49,31
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,i agree with the reviewers who state that this book is utterly confusing in addition i have to say that it is deadly slow mind-numbingly boring and extremely poorly written does no-one do any editing or proof-reading before allowing such grammatically incorrect rubbish no other word for it to be published shame on you writing a book should be an art a labour of love and even if you are not english mother tongue there is still no excuse for it to be so dreadfully grammatically incorrect and I am not even an english teacher i just do not appreciate that my beautiful language is trashed to the extent it is in this book,111,32

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,a confusing plot written in the style of a 10 year old the two main characters are completely unbelievable demonstating a range of emotions that no experienced government agents would display far too many inappropriate adverbs used a disappointing read,40,38
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,story was good but obvious that english is not the authors first language needs major work to be readable,19,39

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,sounded like a good mystery but the dialogue was so unnatural and slow that it seemed like it was translated from a language other than english,26,42
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,the title was a bit attractive so I have got this book for free as i love detective stories a lot while reading i got a bit confused as the storyline is messy and i could not follow it properly got that missing something feeling lost interest after few chapters some phrases sound funny obviously english is not a native language of the writer,61,43

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,the story line was good i enjoyed it but did not enjoy all the typos would pay to proof read before releasing,24,48
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,i really struggled with how i was going to rate missing link i thought the storyline was intriguing and played out pretty good but the lack of editing really peeved me it needs more i did enjoy the characters kiara was an interestingshe is strong willed stubborn and has a good sense of morals jake played the part of a partner pretty well between the two of them they were a formidable team i will read more of the davenport mysteries,83,49
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,this book written in a steady pace and the plot involves corporate coverand kidnapping the two main characters slowly develop as the story goes along my only problem was that a characters internal dialogue was written in quotations alongside their conversations with another person this hinders the flow of reading because the reader has to separate a characters thought from what they are saying aloud to make sense of what is going on by way of interaction it would be better to write the internal thoughts in italics and the spoken words in quotations,96,50
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,4.0,positive,enjoyed reading this book however there were several chapters that contained grammatically incorrect sentences especially towards the end of the book,21,51

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,the basic story was ok but the story often became confusing due to the poor grammar i often got lost in the confusing wording it is as if it were written by someone not too sure of the english language maybe someone who spoke english as a second language,49,54
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,story line is ok but needs serious editing would not recomend to anyone until corrections are made it is just plain hard to read trying to guess the correct words,30,55
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,i do not know how i managed to read the whole thing but i did i felt like i was reading a story written by a child that was smart enough for advanced class but socially immature maybe it was just a bad translation but the dialog between characters was painful,50,56
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,although free i wanted my money back it was poorly written poorly researched and the story just plain unbelievable the fbi does not have an office inside of a private company especially one it is investigating agents sent undercover receive an per diem allowance and do not have to give up their homes in the city they are assigned english obviously is not the first language of this author however i have read indian writers before and their use of english is impeccable if more based on british english and indian english in any case it is understandable and in it is own context that is the story is set in india this author obviously did not do any research on the fbi it is procedures protocols and personnel policies not to mention little if any research about the united states and americans save your time and avoid not only this book but this author as well he added a short story to this one and it was as poorly written and amateurish as this was,173,57

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,the story had some potential but it was written very poorly which made it very hard to read there were so many errors as to which verb tense should be used that it made reading almost painful a junior high teacher would probably grade the grammar in this book a low c at best this is why stories should be proof read before being published,65,92

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,as a former technical writer i found the book entertaining as a thoroughly bad example the author can not even properly conjugate the verb to be the author also does not understand american eating habits the storyline is a disjointed mess that i finally gave up trying to follow because the effort was giving me a headache as a thoroughly bad example of terrible writing it did become entertaining for me because of my background experience and education,76,123
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,it becomes apparent early on in this book that the author is unfamiliar with american idioms and grammer the nearly uninterrupted use of the phrase as per and the constant confusion of the differences between the use of will and would make reading confusing even more than the confusing story line this author needs a better editor,57,124
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,the book started well but as it went along it deteriorated spelling mistakes unforgivable these days poor english which at times and it became clear as the book went along that the writer needed to improve their language skills the plot was a bit weak too that could have been crisper a little sloppy over all it read like a first written book more practice needed and someone else to proofread it a shame this was not done a little more care next time would not go amiss,88,125
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,overall plot ok but more often than not i had to re-read sections to figure out what must have happened for the characters to get where they were story did not flow well characters appeared out of nowhere for brief appearances dialog confusing at times not a good read,48,126
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,several times i almost dumped this book because of poor grammar and imprecise word usage however the storyline was interesting so i stayed with it and finished the book the author appears not to have english as a first language and needs a good editor,45,127

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,it was okay but not great i just wanted to finish it,12,129
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,either english is not the authors native language or it is written by a 14 year olds imagination and vocabulary nothing in the book makes sense how police operate is way unrealistic nonsense and childish you can easily understand this from the ridiculously childish and unrealistic premise a company entering the market doing electronic work then switching to chemical and in 3 months they conquer the market and make billions wait what i bet the author tried to come up with a conspiracy plot about corruption and politics but laughing out loud my 12 year old niece could have come up with something more realistic than this dialogs are terrible characters are extremely unlikeable and they do not act or talk like real people do there are extremely cheesy and cliche lines which will make you roll your eyes grammar does not make sense most of the time it reads like the book is a poor google translate rather than an original work besides the terrible grammar mistakes the formatting is also very poor the author should have tested in all devices before publishing this it is unacceptable in this day and age there are huge spaces between letters in some sentences overall do not waste your time with this even although it is free i guarantee you that your free time is much more valuable than this garbage,225,130
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,very poor the author must not be a native english speaker poor syntax no character development terrible proofreading and more etc,20,131
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,this book has so many grammatical errors it made the book difficult to read without cringing the characters and plot were well conceived but needed a little more attention to detail,31,132
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,this book was readable but only barely the story flowed very oddly first of all was my pet peeve authors who do not use contractions after awhile it starts to sound like a first grade reading primer it also sounded like it was written in a foreign language and then translated to english but did not translate well there was not much of a plot it seemed like the author was just making it up as they went along and it was very confusing at times i would not read another book by this author,92,133
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the characters and the story i would have given the book 5 stars if the editing had been done well i could not tell if the problem related to a language translation or just really poorly done editing either way i will buy the next book in the series with the hope that it will be easier to read,60,134
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,there actually is a fairly good story buried in this book but it gets lost in the poor english spoken by the two obviously non-english speaking authors much of it looks like they used a dictionary to get a lot of the words if these two authors who clearly can create a story want to continue to write they need to secure a talented third party who can render the english readable,73,135
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,the book was terrible it was obviously translated into english there were errors in sentence structure subject-verb agreement and vocabulary the characters were not well developed and the plot was weak,31,136

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,i found the reason for this story to be relatively unclear or i am not good at reading between lines the author also tends to narrate the story and the principles never get to take over making for dull reading characters not plumped out adequately leaving many questions tried twice to read this before giving up,56,138
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,the lowered review is based on the appearance that the author is not an english speaker there are numerous missing words and idioms that are nit common in americanized english,30,139
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,poorly edited mystery story incomplete sentences mismatched noun-verbsno chemistry between characters no cohesiveness of thought or deductions character names just appeared without information as to how they related to the story at that point i stayed with it hoping it would improve later in the story but it did not terms were used that i was not familiar with and had no explanation ie cabins work offices made understanding more challenging i will pass on further stories in this series,83,140
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,the plot was so convoluted and the characters had no depth would never read another book by this author,19,141
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,2.0,negative,this could have been a 4 star book as the plot is good but the editing is terrible words are juxtapositioned sentences do not make sense some parts of the books do not make sense the writer should read the book before it is published,45,142
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,1.0,negative,poorly translated gramatical errors change or confuse meaning adding an unintentional comic tone i may not be wiling to read to the end,23,143

Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,4.0,positive,a different approach to the fantasy and adventure story the flow is nice the suspense builds gradually and keeps you engaged a nice read that is meant to test the readers in thinking about what is going to happen next a must for those who love fantasy and adventure a little bit of romance is also kept as a hook for subsequent novels nice read,65,147
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,5.0,positive,a story that i bet you have not heard earlier and one which you will not anticipate while reading more than a story it is a journey a journey that starts with eric getting cured and as he tries to explore the reason for it more characters start joining each character has a back story that ultimately brings a common thread between all of them the truth about erics cure will shake you up and will bring so many questions in your mind that will make you read it till the last word a great way to start the first novel and hope the series remains as interesting as this one,109,148

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,the story line was interesting i do not think there was much of an ending it just sort of closed up the typos are absolutely pathetic it seemed like there was one on almost every page most of them interrupted the flow of the story not sure how so many were allowed but an absolute turn off to reading book 3,60,1
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,mixed tenses poor grammar worse spelling unfinished plot lines and an author who can not be bothered to remember what they typed less than a page before as painful as it was to read it was obviously even more painful to edit as the person in charge of doing so clearly quit 2 pages in i would expect more from someone old enough to write,65,2

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,there were some very good points in the novel but it was a bit all over the place my biggest distraction was the grammatical errors typos and errors in general having to translate on the fly took a bit away from the plot i did enjoy the characters and the setting however it seemed to meander around a bit this is the second if you can call it that that i read the first seemed more like a long trailer for the main book which was ok since it was free I had have liked more detail on the design of the shoes instead of the basic description of her job if it is her passion it should have played more prominently in the plot,123,5
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,story kept me wanting more can not wait to read the next one in the series hope it is just as entertaining,20,6

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,i love a good mystery / romance novelwhat i hare are the nuisance of having to deal with all the grammatical errors and out of sequence events that had me flipping back and forth trying to make sense of what was actually happening she had incorrect names for some of the designers characters names incorrect it was a hard read for me and for heavens sakes how many coffee spills can you actually have in one book overall the story had me intrigued i did finally finish the book,87,10

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,this glamorous thriller is perfect for fans of jackie collins rebecca chance victoria fox and anna-lou weatherley the characters are larger than life with realistic personalities angie and melissa in particular are extremely entertaining the sort of friends you had love to go for a cocktail with-funny gossipy and not to mention the hilarious one-liners throughout the whole book no spoilers but a murder takes place and you are left with the whodunnit question in your head the book is not predicable so you may have nowho committed the murder i like angie and melissa so i am rooting for their happily ever afters and i really hope that they both find love or at least contentment with their lives both personally and career-wise i would read the other books in this authors series for sure ps this does end on a cliffhanger but you will want to know what happens sometimes it never comes back into style like lindsay lohan your sex life has not been in the mood since hilary clinton was sexy identification rather masturbate with a cheese grater,180,14

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this book is full of typos and grammatical errors i thought it would be a good chic lit read to fall asleep to but it was not worth the hours i spent reading it no story line and the ending was just there really was no ending the book just stopped do not waste your time or money on this,57,20
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i have been waiting for this review at times i thought i was the one writing this book the reader is left in a fog characters are introduced but not fully told to you how they are incorporated into the story the author and amazon seemed to put everything into the last chapter in hopes that you would purchase this series of books no thank you I shall stop at this one if you are the type of reader who likes to correct spelling / grammatical errors and confused character development than this is the book for you,95,21

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i do not care what anyone says this is a brilliant book it has so many twists and turns and i like that in a story who wants to read a boring story that focuses on one thing which takes forever for the author to explain i thoroughly enjoyed the plot as i am a plot person it is a page turner every time something happens at the end of each chapter so i want to know what happens next i have really bad concentration levels so i can not get into a book easily however i got into this one very easily i recommend this book to readers who want excitement it does have an abrupt ending as to you wanted to know what happens next,125,26
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,rant warning i received the book free through one of the many sites that offer a few titles a day that being said i have gone back and bought other titles to support a good author they do aof faith to offer the book i reward that risk but to end a story in mid-thought feels like coercion and i will not go for it sorry scott i do not waste my time on previews and this was even worse because it was not labeled as such i do like series but this is not fair and i feel so wronged that i do not care what happened,105,27

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,it is the sloppiest writing i have ever seen it is obviously poorly edited and has not been proof read the only reason i kept on reading was to find out where is this scattered brain author going with such a uninteresting story,43,31

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i would be even more disappointed if i had actually paid for this i can overlook a couple of grammar mistakes if the story is good this story is horrible and full of grammar mistakes good luck following a storyline because it bounces around more than a five year old on kool-aid will i be buying book two not getting that one even if it is free,66,33
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,i would have given it five stars if it did not end before the story was finished it is a trick to get me to buy the next book which i will do because it was a good read but i was on vacation in aruba when i read it and did not want to buy from an internet provider i did not know,62,34

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,this boot had a decent plot line but after the first couple chapters it seems to bounce around a lot it is hard to keep up with what has going on there is not enough supporting details to support events that happen the tense constantly changes from third person to first person even in the same sentence it is very sloppy and hard to follow I am not impressed and will not be wasting my time on book two it is too bad because the basic storyline is ok there just is not enough detail and explanation and i kept feeling like i skipped pages somehow,99,38

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this was the worst editing of a book i have ever read it constantly jumps from first to third person sometimes in the same sentence or paragraph grammar and spelling horrible it could be a great book but the time line is all over the place and there is no end to the book just an abrupt stop so you will pay for the next book to find out what happens,71,43

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,the typos and grammatical errors are numerous and it does not appear to have been edited or reviewed at all just a cheap hokey story,24,47
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,who writes a book that leaves so many things with no ending just so you will buy the next one at least have something that finishes very silly,28,48

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,this started with an interesting plot but became disjointed the characters had unrealistic prior connections i hated the non-ending stopping abruptly in the middle of a crisis is unfair to the reader who expected and paid for a book with a beginning middle and end,45,51
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,this is a nice summer read the characters are not quite relatable and there are a number of typos in the book however for an easy read it is a good book,32,52
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i had just finished reading a book that was both well-written and a compelling thoughtfully developed story so i was going to read high heels for a quick sweet diversion instead i wanted a red pen to correct the thousands of grammatical and editorial errors which most 4th or 5th graders could have corrected someone should be very embarrassed for allowing this book out in the public when it should not even be published as a high school project the story line is almost as weak as the writing while there are a couple of clever connections among the characters the final chapter destroys any reader curiosity that may have been developed by attempting to blackmail readers into buying the next book not clever not well done simply lazy writing,130,53
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i thought this was one of the worst most poorly written stories i have read in a very long time i purchased the first book in the series thinking i would eventually read the other books in the series but no way the story jumped around from character to charter with none of them being developed to a point where one could even begin to like them it is a book that i should have just stopped reading but i kept thinking it had to get better definitely not a fan of this one,93,54
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i did not enjoy this book at all the storyline was all over the place there were three murders but none of them seemed to matter the main character had far too much bad luck in a very short time which did not seem feasible the book ended on a very abrupt cliffhanger and I am not in slightest interested in finding out what happens next,64,55
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,oh my god i recommend this book to everybody it has so many twists it is crazy you are constantly on your toes wondering what has going to happen next the book totally leaves you breathless and has a greatto the next book,42,56
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,although entertaining at times this was probably one of the worst books I have ever read there was no resolution to the problems in the book it was as if the author created all of this conflict and then did not know what to do with it so she / he just left everything unresolved in addition to it being poorly written the conversion to kindle caused additional issues all kindle versions have errors but I have never seen this many in a book probably at least 1 per page does not anyone proof read these books after converting them for the kindle,97,57
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,the basic plot line while being choppy can be followed and that is the best thing i can say events within the text could not reasonably be accepted a major illness that takes 48 hours to recoup the flu takes longer apart from the choppy story telling grammatical errors with verb tense and phraseology make parts of the story a distraction from just trying to figure out what sentences were supposed to have been too many plot possibilities with little or no resolution make this piece painful advise get a strong editor to improve transitions correct grammar thin out the plot list in favor of resolution to many problems while peaking the readers curiosity this piece could make a good series if it were not so underdeveloped,126,58
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,this book is a good read if you like two women that run into so much drama i would read av scotts books again,24,59
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this is one of the most poorly written books I have ever had the misfortune to read i would have given it zero stars if that were an option it is derivative completely unoriginal drivel it appears to have gone to press unedited full of misspellings and misused words my only recommendation for this book is that amazon delete it from their catalog,62,60
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,there were so many grammatical mistakes in this book no one must have proofread or did any editing the story was good but kept getting sidetracked with all the mistakes had to give less stars because of that,38,61

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,this book was good but it is not the type of first book in a series that leaves you waiting for the next book i can easily forget i read it although it was interesting and somewhat entertaining with a few surprises,42,63
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book i felt entertained and captivated throughout the book i did not want to put it down two hundred plus pages flew by the book ended with a cliff hanger so now I am waiting for the second one to come out high heels and lip gloss my only complaint would be for ms scott to either hire an editor or fire her current one the book is filled with punctuation errors misspellings and the use of added or incorrect words in the sentence the main characters name is even misspelled on occasion i was shocked other than those pesky little issues i loved this book and i can not wait to start the second one,117,64
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this book may have undergone many recent edits but the plot line is still confusing and unnecessarily dense i could barely finish it,23,65

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i really liked this book it is good in all ways i would recommend this book for readers like me who like reading stories from new york and people who like pg 20 books laughing out loud i admit it this book is very good one of the best i have read i also like it because you get to know the relation from one character to each other the more you read,70,70

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,ridiculous story line so much potential but the author went about it in an unrealistic way that makes you hate the characters rather than empathizing with them also screamed is used for basically any dialog louder than a whisper get a thesaurus,42,73

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,as it is fashion week and the paired kindle book and audiobook were very inexpensive and i had some house chores to do i started this book as a native new yorker i am particularly sensitive to getting the background correct one reviewer mentioned how cheap a 300 comforter in a 2 million condo i found the monthly rent on a suite at the carlyle 10000 totally delusional it has to be at least twice that i have no love for the main character a self centered narcissistic child of rich parents and yet the book has some amusement value suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride,106,106
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,i liked the book until the ending i was really not happy how the book left me looking for a true end,23,107

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,overall i thought it had a good plot but i was extremely disappointed in the lack of editing there were so many spelling and punctuation errors did anyone actually read the story before it was published,36,109

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,the plot and writing we are fine but about 20 pages in i started noticing the unusual incorrect usage of the word screamed it was misused so much that i started trying to picture how someone could possibly scream the words hello thank you mommy please and more i think in every single conversation exclaimed would have been more appropriate it was just very strange to me but otherwise a good book,70,112
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,i thought the ending of book 1 was ridiculousness would not suggest this book to anyone too much information was left out for the readers,25,113

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,if i had paid for this book i would be demanding my money back it was a kindle freebie even at no cost it is too expensive this writer needs a real publisher and a real editor trying to read this mess was painful she also needs to write about something she knows she has a shoe designer running around paying no attention to her business during fashion week the designer has an assistant she parties with who does not know her shoe designer employers shoe size or that she has over 300 pairs of shoes the writer tries to establish wealth by claiming her character received a 2 million dollar apartment from her parents and dropping expensive shoe labels then makes a point of saying that her character curls up in her 300 dollar comforter set apparently this writer knows nothing at all about the design business or wealth fiddling around with personal crap during fashion week a 300 dollar comforter give me a break these are just a few observations this entire book is a train wreck i forced myself halfway through it but could not finish it the writer needs to learn her craft know her subject and find a real publisher taking money for this mess is a crime,211,126
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,the book was fairly good probably four stars until i reached the last page too many story lines going off in too many directions but none of them fell into place or tied together in the last few pages at least a prologue would have been nice would not recommend to anyone,52,127
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this book has moments of being excellent and then you get caught up in dropped plots and a story line that jumps around,23,128

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i toughed it out through the whole book even although 75 of it made no sense despite the disclaimer at the beginning saying the book had been re-edited and fixed in 2012 the only thought when i got to the last page was wait what and not in a good way the story line s in this book are just so random and it is like the author forgot what she was writing about and did not connect the dots i would not recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted to kill a few hours reading a bunch of mini-stories that do not really go anywhere or go together,105,136
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i love this book because it grab and held my attention from page one plus it was filled with alot of twisted and turns i recommend this book to all readers and bookclubs av scott did an excellent job this is a must read you will not be disappointed,49,137
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,maybe entertaining to start with but even from the start it was so painfully cliche and felt like it was trying to emanate sex and the city but did not get there as i read further i realized the storyline jumped about made no sense one moment she is going to london next chapter it was meant to be paris she has happily running around after 2 days in hospital from unexpected life saving surgery for her cancer is pregnant and does not drink but next page she is out getting wasted on cocktails and somehow every character turns out to secretly be some other characters sister mother lover and more not only is it not remotely believable but it is also hard to follow the storyline less drama and more focus would of maybe made a more readable book i was not even bothered by the unfinished ending just happy that the book was over oh and it still needs lots of editing and typo corrections,158,138
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,okay i thought this story had a great premise and the two main characters sounded interesting but then it started to get seriously insulting the plot is trying way too hard to go in twenty directions nothing is resolved spoiler alert for instance what happened to the pregnancy and then cancer really should we just throw things and see what sticks and that is just one character very dissappointing,70,139
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,i downloaded this boom because it was free after only 9 pages into it i realized it is a rip off of gemma hollidays high heels mysteries so far same plot and same type if character down to melissas job,39,140
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i choose the rating because the story line had more twist than a fun park ride i did not like how the book just leave a reader hanging i not sure if this is because it is on line might recommend this book to a friend,44,141
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,crazy story line that was very poorly written i was relieved when it ended calling it chick lit with anything is a true disgrace to real chick lit,28,142
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,but what is book 2 really leaves you hanging but it was a good story it was really easy and i wish it would have stuck to a few less big advents it seems like way to much is happening but i will read the next one once i find out what it is,54,143
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,fun very easy read wondering if I shall pay the money for book 2 wondering what has gon na happen to all the girls that is for sure good / bad cliff hanger laughing out loud,28,144
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,great concept for a story but too much jumping around dropping situations and way too rushed maybe slow down and focus on a storyline and not jump between 5,30,145
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,so many times i get the free books and many times the cover looks promising as this one did however aside from the usual typos and misspellings this book skipped entire key parts of it is supposed storyline it also never came to any conclusions character development was disappointing as well sorry av scott i will not be reading further,58,146
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,many typos scattered story line and no ending this could have been a decent story had there been character development and a conclusion to the plot,26,147
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,good but what happened what is the next book who did it should not end a book that way mjunc2345 aol,20,148
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,ok so a good read those of u who know me know that i need an ending even in a series so the down fall is a cliff hanger which was great but did not leave me rushing to buy part two to be 100 honest i accidentally clicked on buying this book yep i paid for it and i always read free unless series captivates me so i guess that was stoke one two was the non ending glad there was not a three i will try and read the next oneday,91,149
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,keeps you paging ends too soon it leaves you with just enough to want to know more waiting to see who did it,23,150
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i was very impressed by the amount of drama mystery and intrigue this book had i about died when it ended as it did and can not wait for book two keepem coming ms scott,34,151
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,i really liked this book it is a quick easy enjoyable read i thought the characters were very likeable and i could not put it down i had to know what was going to happen next my only real complaint is that it ended right on a cliffhanger and now I am forced to wait for the next one before i can find out what happens,63,152
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,it was pretty good but the ending should have been different one part begin to talk about another person that was not even a character in the book that was confusing,30,153
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,too many typos coupled with a rushed ending i really wanted to like it this book but it just fell flat,21,154
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,the book has a great story to tell the author does need to do some editing a little confusing in some chapters i do see however that the author is rewriting to correct some inconsistancies looking forward to rereading,39,155
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,to short feels unfinished wish it went more in depth like many more people have said the ending left so much unsaid,22,156
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,this book features two shallow friends who wish only fame fortune money and recognition the original premise is somewhat interesting if not original an unplanned pregnancy discovered as a relationship ends the best friend is an aging hollywood star / diva the heroine is self-absorbed money-seeking female the friend is a nympho with commitment issues there is some potential but this book sadly lacks anyone that the reader cares about this is a waste of time and if you buy or bought it a waste of money,85,157
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,the story line is decent but i hate the inconsistancies first chapter she is looking at the gown tempted to put it on and next paragraph is removing the gown the lunch is in the first part a monthly meeting but in the next part is a weekly meeting very irritating feels as although the author wrote in a hurry and did not check her work why her publishing group did not catch these errors not well written,76,158
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,i thought this was going to be a quick fun and easy read it was not there were plenty of changes from past to present tense some of the characters names changed mysteriously then changed back and some of the storylines were well underdeveloped this was a decent draft but needs much more editing for consistency continuity and character development overall although this books main focus seems to be on the fabulous life of the heroine and her best friend i mean you are crying because you can not wear heels seriously not very good would not suggest to anyone,95,159
