Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,4.0,positive,maxine quit her day job and opened her own chocolate shop at her first catering job one of the guest fell from the balcony with one of her chocolates in his hand well needless to say this was not good for business bodies start dropping and maxine s shop is closed during the investigation at the rate the police were going maxine would be out of business before they solved the case this lit a fire under maxine and her grandma ellie story line is very developed and our author does an excellent job building the location of our story with vivid descriptions our cast of characters come to life each with their unique personalities i really liked the intense build up for the sometimes funny twists and turns that led us to a surprise killer you can certainly tell considerable time was done in research and development of the story the details were spun with flow of a great story teller fantastic read,164,0
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,3.0,neutral,the story was pretty good but the editing was terrible there were too many punctuation errors too many incorrect words one character went from carly to marly i did like grandma ellie and maxine i could not keep up with all the characters although there were too many and they were insignificant,51,1
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,4.0,positive,good read funny at times i like to try to solve mysteries by myself recommend this book and author to those that like to solve crimes,26,2
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,3.0,neutral,the story was good the main characters were very likable the proofing of this book however was terrible there were many words that were auto-corrected that we are out of context and the villains name mysteriously changed during the last 2 chapters of the book,44,3
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,2.0,negative,apart from the punctuation and other editing errors mentioned by another reviewer i found it difficult to read this book because the main character is frankly unrealistic and meddling in her attempts to solve the murders maybe it improves towards the end but i may never reach there at this rate she spoils what could have been an interesting mystery for me,62,4
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,4.0,positive,i liked the book anything with food added into it makes it better the only issue i had was the typos and the name changing from carly to marly,30,5
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,2.0,negative,as i lived in victoria many years ago i thought it would be fun to read a book set in that beautiful city i was wrong this book was almost painful to read the grammar punctuation and sentence structure were terrible a characters name changed from carly to marly between chapters they are there their have different meanings and should not be used interchangeably many aspects of the plot felt overly contrived for example there was no initial rational reason for maxine to feel she needed to solve the case i will not give other examples so i do not give anything away to those still planning to read the story i never really felt engaged in the story or cared much about the main characters i give it 2 stars rather than 1 since i did actually finish the book although i was tempted to stop several times all that being said i do think the author shows promise and that this book could be greatly improved by a good editor,169,6
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,2.0,negative,i liked the premise of the book and enjoyed the recipes as i am a chocoholic but this book needs a lot of work it was confusing there would be no indication that a particular character was in a room until they went off on a rant about not being the killer I am thinking in particular about a scene at a catered party where the protagonist was talking to someone she brought with her to the party who oddly enough was in the kitchen by himself reading a book maxine begins talking to him and out of nowhere the owner of the house takes off on a diatribe those kind of odd transitions happened several times in the book ninjas would love that kind of stealth but it was jarring and confusing i had a lot of where did they or that come from moments then the characters had name changes kathleen sullivan becomes kathleen oreilly and carly becomes marly huh call me picky but i expect more out of a book if this ends up being a series i honestly do not think i will be reading any more of them,191,7
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,1.0,negative,i would not recomend this book to anyone the author gives very poor charecter discriptions example he is six feet tall with blue blue eyes end description it took me the whole book to find out the main female charecter has green eyes no hairwhen i emailed the author she siad she thinks she gave the main female charecter brown hair she thinks as in she does not know i do not expect authors to spend a whole chapter on charecter discription but a brief discription is apricated and if the authos do not care enough about there charecters to give them discriptions then why as a reader should i read it ok done with my rant,118,8
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,5.0,positive,very good and easy read as it keeps you wondering lots of suspects to think about plus kindness loving of others can not wait to read the next one,28,9
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,5.0,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this book it keep my attention and totally surprised me at the outcome should appeal to suspense readers,21,10
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,3.0,neutral,for the most part i liked this story but i felt there were too many characters mentioned in the beginning chapter yes they were at a party but i felt like the author was trying to cram in the names of all the potential victims and suspects into a few paragraphs and i did not really get to know any of those characters i did like maxine and her mother there were several editing issues spaces before commas lack of punctuation and the name of one character changed in the last few chapters from carly to marly and back to carly the ending felt rushed and i was surprised at who the culprit turned out to be as there were not any clues along the way to even hint at this persons involvement all in all this turned out to be a pretty decent effort i think this author can only improve with more experience and a little editorial help,157,11
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,4.0,positive,the title and cover alone were enough to make me want to dig right in but the story is a good read too it is a satisfying mystery but not too heavy with gruesome details i could relate to the characters in this one and who does not enjoy reading about chocolate,50,12
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,5.0,positive,maxine launched her new chocolate shop and catering business with the bc historical societys annual fund raiser when land developer ron vandemeer collapsed holding a half-eaten chocolate in his hand this was not the front page picture maxine wanted chocolate worth dying for death by chocolate is a great book that grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept my interest to the end it is a worthwhile read i recommend chocolate martini anyone,73,13
Kindle_Store,B00ECUG9TA,5.0,positive,i enjoyed this story very much part of it is that i have visited victoria and know the city for it is beauty and incredible views therefore the authors wonderful descriptions took me back to a place i loved plus having a book being plotted with chocolate playing a role almost as one of the characters is a brillianti mean who does not like chocolate maxine our heroine the owner of au chocolat a brand new chocolate shop and catering business begins the day full of confidence that her new business is finally taking off she has huge aspirations of success until the first dead body literally falls at her feet and it looks as if one of her chocolates is the because of death from that moment on she becomes consumed with finding the answers to this mystery to the disgust of her sometimes boyfriend detective patrick shannon surrounded by both friends and enemies no matter the danger maxine never gives up the hunt to my delight at the end of the book ms amsden has added recipes for chocolate yummies love it,184,14
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,4.0,positive,fun read he clearly loves what he did the good and the bad i found it encouraging as i contemplate following him down the icw and beyond,27,0
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,3.0,neutral,the best thing about this book is that from cover to cover it is one episode after another of the many things that can and will go wrong would strongly recommend for the average dreamer who has their eye on cruising the author is not a professional that is an understatement but if it was ever true that the best lessons are taught by mistakes then this book is full of lessons,71,1
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,2.0,negative,i wanted to read this book because we have the same boat and we are looking to cruise in the same area as the author writes about but i could not finish it it is not edited it does not flow well and some of his facts about sailing and locations are just wrong this trip was done i believe in the late 80s and maybe the author did not keep a good log so some of the facts are off the short stories within the book are a paragraph or two long and then they just end leaving you wondering what happened there is very little discription besides we got stuck and now we are sailing again i congradulate him on doing this trip as a lot of us are still just dreaming about it but the book should of been gone over before he put it out to digital print,146,2
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,2.0,negative,even amazon has not corrected the book title which shows on it is web site as paraduse instead of paradise an indication of the wrong words appearing in a book that was spellchecked electronically but not proofread by a human examples guaranteed for quarantined plain for plane boat plaining once in a time for once upon a time without incidence for without incident cautious to for careful to and more author take note in spite of all that as a former caribbean sailor i enjoyed reading about the stupidities described,88,3
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,4.0,positive,by todays standards he will be quick to offend some but to me this kind of honesty is greatly lacking in todays overly pc world good read for me,29,4
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,3.0,neutral,stories is a strong word more like ramblings hey he did it and I am just reading about it so who am i to judge,24,5
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,3.0,neutral,an easy read that was just the right length for the subject matter covered and in a context of normal experiences with normal people about what i thought would happen to me if i chose to go cruising,38,6
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,5.0,positive,l have been sailing for over thirty years mainly on a coastal cruiser the experiences described in this book are ones that most sailors will encounter at one time or another regardless of the size or type of sailboat this book will give valuable information to those considering buying a sailboat a very enjoyable read,55,7
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,5.0,positive,wow what a nice book a testimony that if you really want to do something you have to go for it it takes you with them on their voyage with all misfortunes and also the nice things they experienced i hate when the book is over I had like to go on for ever reading very nice book,57,8
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,5.0,positive,thoroughly enjoyed being on this cruise as an armchair sailor i am a power boater 19 yacht on hudson river i dream the dream and love to read and put myself on board for sailing and cruising adventures thanks for a great cruise,44,9
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,2.0,negative,bumbling through paradise is more so bumbling through this book it is poorly written and even poorly organized being a sailor for over 40 years and having sailed extensively through the caribbean i had expected more some parts were entertaining and even enjoyable in the couples movements through the northeast but the use of the caribbean certainly could have been fully portrayed cover picture is excellent and probably brought on the sale of the book although it was purchased as an e book,83,10
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,5.0,positive,i am a just learning to sail so this was fun and informative for me easy to read and entertaining too,21,11
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,1.0,negative,the more i read the more i realized that the author is the type of person who illegally parks his car in a handicapped space because no one is using it and he only needs it for a few minutes and then is proud of himself when he returns and does not find a ticket he tells his stories of bumbling through paradise with a complete lack of self awareness that many of his mishaps were the result of negligence ignorance or disregard of boating skills and regulations,87,12
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,5.0,positive,very funny and interesting book the writer has a hilarious sense of humor without purposely trying to be funny lots of interesting sailing predicaments encountered,23,13
Kindle_Store,B00IGK7IRO,3.0,neutral,in the work world as in anything else you can do the same thing year after year for 10 years or you can learn and grow and improve over the same period both give you 10 years of experience it is hard for me to believe that the thackers did as much sailing as they say they did before they embarked on this adventure in paradise i could not believe he actually said he did not have much experience tacking is not that the very nature of sailing tacking whatever happened to the ready about ready hard a-lee that i learned as a child yes bad things can happen if you are not prepared,110,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,2.0,negative,horrible does not have magnet to keep closed covers up the light indicator telling you that you have messages when the phone is sleeping there is nothing to hold the phone in place while using the stand so it just slides after a very short break in period and the leather material is just plastic that feels like it has been dipped into a soft nylon like substance which is already starting to wear down after a few days keep in mind i carry in my back pocket just like a wallet it is called a wallet case for reason so you can carry it around like a wallet and even although it kinda does what it is supposed to it is junk and will not last long you can buy much nicer for just a few bucks more,135,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,4.0,positive,the hunt is over i found this nice tasteful flip case for my galaxy s4 active it just the black one i did not want one in a garishin animal print sporting some cartoon character or bedazzled up the ying yang that is fine for folk who want that this one is good for the phone i did not need nor want one to also hold my id and credit cards good product for the price,75,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,2.0,negative,i used this case for about a month before it started coming apart the edges are held together with a glue after use the gluepeals that is why i gave it a 2-star rating i case itself is a goodi like how it functioned the case adds about 3 layers of thickness to the phone so be prepare for your phone and case combo to be about twice a thick as the phone alone one way that i would improve the case would be to add a slot for a credit card,96,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,3.0,neutral,my husband had to cut some of the cover out to keep it from pushing the home button causing the screen to stay lite and the battery to die quickly,30,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,1.0,negative,when i originally ordered this case the name active was not in the title nor the product description i have a t mobile galaxy s4 and i have to guess there has a size difference between that an the active case as made well and i wish i can say functioned well but my phone would just flop out,57,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,3.0,neutral,this case is a bit of pro against con it protects the phone well but is just large enough to interfere with side button access it does have fold points built in but you can forget about propping the phone up at a convenient angle using this design,48,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,1.0,negative,i bought this case for my brother and it did not even fit at all there was a hugeand the phone could easily fall out when we turn it returning this product as soon as possible,34,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,3.0,neutral,it does stay open and propped at an angle but it is not supper variable it wants to be open and stable about as much as it is in the picture putting it on your chest and thinking it will stay open like that while you watch a movie although is out also the front cover does not stay shut it needs a magnet or something that will keep it shut other than that it is slim and tough and stays on just fine at least for me,86,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DYJ0ZNG,2.0,negative,case is bulky and has sharp edges not at all what i was hoping for too much to ship back to return so it is getting tossed out,27,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,3.0,neutral,gave it 3 stars just because i was able to set it up i think i did not know they made cell phones so small my biggest concern although is that the charger adapter is really really flimsy and i am not sure it will not just melt and blow up the phone the holes in the adapter into which the us prongs are supposed to fit are round and you have to jam the oblong us prongs into the round holes to make contact the telestial rep was no help when i called to ask if that was the correct way to do it,103,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,5.0,positive,travelling all over the world for an extended vacation i wanted a simple phone that let us me call when i need to and enjoy my quiet time when i want it the phone is small light and the sim card instructions are easy compared to most worldwide sims great service and quick delivery,53,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,2.0,negative,i used this on a recent trip to italy and was sad to find that the text messaging service was extremely unreliable my fiancee never received half of my texts while the others would go through hours after being sent i only received maybe two texts successfully i blew 100 on minutes and mostly futile texts in just one week abroad i was able to call italian and american phone numbers easily but the minutes get eaten up fast when you can not just text instead the phone is light and small so that is good and you can recharge minutes easily by dialing their number from the phone,108,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,5.0,positive,functioned a advertized easy to use and to manage when overseas pleased with the product happy to recommend nice product thanks,20,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,5.0,positive,perfect for travel and was super easy to set up and refill will use for all my travel overseas,18,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,3.0,neutral,my husband and i ordered these phones to use in france we had looked at so many options to have cell phone access and this seemed like the best one we wanted to be able to call each other in france more so than use the phones for calling back to the states we also wanted to leave a phone number so that people could call us for an emergency the set up for using the phone is easy you can not access the network in the states so at this point we will not know if it is working as it should until we are overseas,105,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,5.0,positive,can not beat this i bought one for myself and another for my daughter who was travelling in africa and europe i met her later on in europe and we used these phones to communicate i was able to call her for free from home in the us before leaving for europe because they include a us number in addition to an overseas number and allow 30 free incoming call minutes the phones worked flawlessly reception was clear as can be and the instrutions were very clear i called customer service once and got a very rapid response to my question it was easy to add minutes the calls are not cheap about 1 per minute 79cents for text messages but i felt that the cost was acceptable overall these phones made a huge difference in our travels overseas and i highly recommend them and the company,145,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,5.0,positive,wow I am impressed this looks to be very thought out and will be quite handy on our trip to europe,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,4.0,positive,i was pleased to have the ekit520 phone with me when i was out of the country my flights were changed at the last minute and the phone allowed me to communicate this to the person i was meeting at charles degaulle airport i had customer service to help me set up the phone and then again to increase my minutes they were very good both times for the money it is great insurance to have this phone while abroad if your standard cell phone is not usable,87,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDZA28,1.0,negative,phone did not charge even after 2 days and would not turn on we were really disappointed and will return for a replacement,23,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CX1LJJK,4.0,positive,the ears are a little too flexible if you are not careful they can fall off also it is hard for the charger to stay in with the rubber the way it is otherwise it came in good shape and coming from that long of a distance the package and the phone holder were in excellent condition,56,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CX1LJJK,5.0,positive,i ended up getting my product a little faster then expected i was worried that the long shipping time would be a problem but it was totally worth the wait there is small imperfections but with anything there is always going to be things like that you can see the seem lines where it was made in a mold but i have no probelms i do know that the ears indeed pop out but they are easily placed back in i think for the amount of money i paid this product is perfectly fine if you are really set on this case i would suggest it again and i would also happily buy this as a gift for someone it does in fact not look exactly like the pitcure they added another spot where you can see the phone but i think it makes it easier for the consumer to remove your phone from your case,156,8

Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,5.0,positive,what has more funny this short by garner or that so many reviewers apparently have nowhat satire is either way the very existence of this kindle single makes for some diverting reading readers will likely find these purposely-absurd fairy tales at least a little entertaining especially those currently unenthused with the satirical target the american taliban or the tea party for those with sensitive palates be aware that this short is a not a book for children and b not meant to get glowing reviews from tea partiers still it is comedy and humor is subjective in my opinion tea party fairy tales is a quick entertaining snort-laughing good time made more so by the bad reviews which compelled me to buy and read tea party fairy tales favorite line moral do not cloud your resolve with facts compare to andy borowitz onion news stephen colbert,145,0
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,1.0,negative,this was at best a waste of my time and money and neither of those are very costly nothing in the league of politically correct bedtime stories i give it one star just to show i read it,38,1
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,5.0,positive,as a bleeding-heart liberal i thoroughly enjoyed each and every cheap shot james finn garner takes at the tea party and other self-proclaimed super-patriots any true liberal will enjoy this book and if you are a staunch conservative with a weak ability to detect sarcasm you will enjoy tea party fairy tales too this book has it all in the first story alone you have survivalists semi-automatic pistols geriatric dementia murderous little girls crooked atf agents and urban wolves i stopped reading my free download of ivanhoe to read tpft and I am glad i did it is way funnier and more timely than ivanhoe you will agree stop reading fifty shades of gray and download tea party fairy tales right now,117,2
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,1.0,negative,seriously if you have a moral compass of a survivor competitor you will love this book no value just right wing political spin,21,3
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,4.0,positive,i loved it but I am not sure that some of the tea partiers i know would pick up on the irony,21,4
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,2.0,negative,thought it might have some merit but it was less entertaining than expected and not all that creative oh well the tea party is something of a fairy tale anyway,30,5
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,2.0,negative,when i bought this book i did not know what to expect had nowhat it was about so far i can not get interested in it may try again later,30,6

Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,4.0,positive,this was the first title i have read from this author it showcases the crazy positions that tea party people take on many issues this book would not be entertaining for angry tea party types using story book tales to demonstrate the lack of reasoning in tea party thinking is very effective,52,8
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,4.0,positive,this is a wonderful collection of tongue-in-cheek twistings of familiar tales i recommend it to anyone who gets a little annoyed at simplistic answers to complex questions,27,9
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,3.0,neutral,better than his pc bedtime stories but but another case of picking on easy targets have yet to meet those tea partiers able to take themselves lightly enough for this book but it distracts anti-tpers from looking at the tea leaves in their tempestuous pot,45,10
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,5.0,positive,i was left wanting more i read the stories out loud to my husband while we were on holiday in ireland to distract him from the stress of driving there i might have to download mr finn garners other politically-skewed works,41,11
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,5.0,positive,james finn garner is back on his game in the early 1990s he skewered the political correctness bug that had infected our country now he takes aim at the tea partyers it is a mix of steven colbert and garrison keilor tongue firmly planted in cheek he nails em you really have a hard time figuring out if he has serious or not my favorite was his take on snow white i can not reccommend this book highly enough if you are a tea party member you will probably read this to your kids verbatim,90,12
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,1.0,negative,for those who may wonder this is not a book for children it is meant to be adult sarcasm plenty of cheap shots at conservative values i do not mind a cheap shot here and there if they are funny but i read the entire book in 30 minutes and never found a funny moment nothing clever nothing insightful nothing witty a waste of money and more importantly a waste of time,70,13
Kindle_Store,B008SA15KI,4.0,positive,fabulously entertaining and thought provoking at the same time obviously the title let us you know the audience the book aims at but it is not just for tea party followers if you are proud of the fact that you did build it then this is a great read for you the author channels grimm and aesop in a personally responsible interpretation which questions authority and control at the expense of freedom,70,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,5.0,positive,the fit is great love thewhat else can i say other than i need to get more colors in the skin,23,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,3.0,neutral,i love the flexible and softness of this nokia lumia 521 greatand price too i like it better than the panda full diamond design,26,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,1.0,negative,this case was made out of a shiny rubber material and it looks very nice the problem is that it did not fit my phone my phone would not go in the case and it is the exact same phone they said the case was made for i also purchased a red and black now however and those were made of a different material that fix perfectly,64,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,3.0,neutral,average product over price and not fit perfectly for the phone I am still looking for a right case for my new nokia lumia 521,24,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,3.0,neutral,it is good if you have the 521 but for the 520 it is about a 1/4 inch to big for the 520 but over all it is a good case,28,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,1.0,negative,case attracted so much hair and it always came off when i out it in my pocket do not ever buy this itrem it sucks,24,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,3.0,neutral,theis exactly as it shows but that is about it I am wondering if it is supposed to be for the 520 because the camera hole speaker hole on the back and the raised parts for the buttons are all a litle lower than they should be the buttons are not noticeably affected but i did have to cut the holes for the camera and speaker i had to just barely snip the front to fix the microphone hole otherwise it is bee holding up very well and has protected my phone every time i dropped it,93,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,4.0,positive,this case looks a lot like the original phone before the cover it is not bulky at all but very thin if you do not want a very thick phone case this product is a good choice although it is thin i think it will still provide adequate protection for the phone if it is dropped,56,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,2.0,negative,this case does not stay on the phone very well i guess i should have known it is called the barely there slim and soft case would not purchase this again,30,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CU8OK88,1.0,negative,it is one of those cheap gel covers that you buy at kiosks in the mall although it fits the nokia lumia 521 well it collects a ton of dust and other particles it also adds significant size / bulk to the phone,40,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i love this case it is adorable but I have had it less than 12 hours and the tail has already come off if i could figure out how to fix it that would be great but otherwise everything has stayed glued on pretty well buttons are easy to push,49,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,2.0,negative,fits my phone very well however i expected the design to be black and gray as pictured instead it is black and an orange radishif i would have known it was going to look like this i would not have bought it,41,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made and does not fit my phone very well to short all the way around not giving the phone any protection fur coming off and it is brand new save your money and buy something somewhere else took way to long to ship from china and this is not a united states company,49,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i saw this case and thought it was so cute i got the case and was disappointed be a use the quality it aweful the main part of the case is not soft at all the tail is soft hut feels like a feather the ears were horrible because they were put on and bow in the middle and art completely bent over which i hate the case is only worth what you pay really,75,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,5.0,positive,this is the cutest case i have purchased this is for sure a unique case that will catch peoples attention like mine did i especially love the tail it is soo soft and securely attached the fabric is attached pretty good and there has not been a problem with the ears falling off yet so I am very happy,56,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,4.0,positive,i got so many compliments on it it is so adorable only problem was one of the ears fell off after a couple of weeks of having it but that is easily fixable with some hot glue,36,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,4.0,positive,i heard so many mixed reviews about this case a lot of people saying parts were coming off and so on but i still gave it a shot because of the super low price i have to say that it completely met my expectations i adore it it looks just like the picture it is made out of really fuzzy material and the cat tale is simply adorable the only small complain i have is that the case makes it is a little hard to press the side volume buttons and the power one nothing you do not get used to but other than that it is a great case,106,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,thistook a long time to arrive which was expected the case was really cute but after only a few weeks of use the ear fell off it looked like it had been held on with glue so i tried myself to repair it but it did not hold i really wanted it to last because it was so cute,60,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,i waited forever for my case and did not receive it then they wanted me to wait the same amount of time to get a new one but i did get a refund very fast although which was a good,40,14

Kindle_Store,B00B84UZKW,3.0,neutral,i got this free so i have no problem with the book if i would have paid full price i would have been disappointed but this was asexy read and it tried to be a romance book with somewhat of a story line but basically it was just a quick sexy romp it was an enjoyable read and had a loose story if it is still free grab it it is worth the read if it cost money i would not spend more than 99cents,76,4

Kindle_Store,B00B84UZKW,2.0,negative,it was not absolutely terrible but it was much shorter and lacking a lot i can not complain too much since it was free but the characters were stock and the story was velveeta on the cheese scale do not expect to get caught up in it because the moment it starts it is over there was not much content to the plot either expect it to be as cheesy as the cover,68,7

Kindle_Store,B00B84UZKW,3.0,neutral,i have read some really great short stories novellas lately this unfortunately is not one of them there is potential and the authors writing is technically correct but it could have been so much better this is a story that deserved to be told with depth not as a quick drive-by the characters a powerful knight scarred both on the inside and the out as a youth by an evil uncle and a lost gypsy looking for her family troup are likeable the premise of her dislike for him is quite a stretch however there needed to be more too it the night of passion with the knight was not enough to carry this story on it is own the ending is also very abrupt and leaves you thinking that the author hit her word limit not the worst I have read but not nearly good enough either,144,10

Kindle_Store,B009GSWUNM,1.0,negative,i had a very hard time reading this book since it seemed so choppy and did not flow very well it seemed to jump around and some of the story line did not mesh together it left me questioning every situation and trying to understand the characters and the whole story,51,4

Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,a short but satisfying collection of four romantic stories with holidays themes female protagonists in these stories are either meeting new flames or getting reacquainted with old ones in rather steamy way my favorite story was rekindling the fire middle-aged couple that lost the spark so to speak is stranded in the mountain cabin by heavy snow and while waiting for the rescue they rediscover their passion for each other prose is simple yet tasteful love making is described in a sinfully polite way four sensual stories just in time for the holidays recommended,95,12
Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,who does not love a good romance i know i do these short stories were just the right length each of the four stories entertained me thoroughly and left me with a smile on my face i was waiting in the doctors office for about 10 minutes and found this book the other patients must have thought i was a little strange there staring and smiling at my phone but i guess in todays day and age that is pretty standard loved it and recommend,84,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,1.0,negative,i replaced my motorola i290 with the theory thinking that i was getting a better phone turns out that is all it is good for theory as far as motorola tech people are concerned they suck at providing sound tech advice on their own product you would think they should know that there is no way to connect the theory to a pc either with bluetooth or data cable it cost me over 50 to get their motorola tool kit which they recommended as a solution for getting access to my contact and text messages not to mention photos as poor as they are on a pc only after installing and reporting back to them that the tool does not seem to recognize theory did they figure out that there has no way to connect theory to a pc worse still they would not refund me even although they told me to buy it each time i called i get a different recommendation from motorola technicians needless to say this is my last motorola phone for real,173,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,4.0,positive,works well as a modern phone without all the bells and whistles of an iphone or droid phone you can not play music on it but if you go online and download opera mini you can use your boost unlimited internet on it and it functions and looks just like a regular computer opera mini is also about a thousand times faster literally than the browser that comes with the phone great value for what you pay it is way more cost effective than a smart phone,86,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,5.0,positive,i bought this phone and i just love it i needed a longer lasting battery so i contacted motorola and ask them did they have a battery that had more talk time and they yes and just sent me it to me at no extra charge and now i can talk on my phone for 8 to 12 hours before i need to charge it up,66,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007CE0ZA2,3.0,neutral,yes it has android but it is a chinese version one that will not let you install anything from google what a shame because the look and feel of the phone makes you forget about the system average capabilities this is not a problem if you are familiar with rooting systems because that is what I shall do to mine the dual-sim works perfectly as it should but if you are just looking for a cheap dual-sim phone not smart then you will find cheaper good ones in here,82,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007CE0ZA2,2.0,negative,phone is totally in chinese it says it is an android and a motorola phone but is a moto I am guessing a bootleg of motorola and does not allow access to google play store / android apps it looks really nice and seemed perfect as i was purchasing this phone as a gift for friend who is not the most tech savvy but wanted a front / back camera phone with android for skype whatsapp facebook and more this phone would of been perfect if it want in chinese it was packaged really nice and shipping was good even if you change the language to english the app store is still in chinese and you can not change that i do not know enough nor do i have the time to root / flash and more and I am not sure if that would even work so if you do not know chinese or plan to live in beijing which is where the location kept popping up as do not buy i wish i would of seen the other review sooner that said this exact same thing do not know how i missed it,178,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CLRN47G,2.0,negative,the material is very cheap and inflexible for this case do not fall for the appearance of the otterbox you get what you pay for in this arena if you need the otterbox protection go ahead and get the otterbox itself this was a huge disappointment for me,48,13

Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,3.0,neutral,i was expecting specifics not such generalizations of the industry all that the studios agents actors and more are doing is changing with the times to stay viable just as the rest of the country has had to do nothing new disappointed,41,2
Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,1.0,negative,ms finke is indeed a special character who claims to tell the all-revealing truth about current hollywood she has strong dislikes a highly-developed sense of outrage and especially a bloodhounds knowledge of where the bodies are buried she also regards herself as a holy icon and interviewer david blum is afraid to probe the icon too deeply lest it turn and bite him finke controls him and says very little she knows a great deal more this is not in fact an interview it is a fog-machine covered in gauze it could have been stunning not worth 99 cents alas,98,3
Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,3.0,neutral,too many that is crazy and that is stupid this sounded like a summation of an interesting subject by a vocabulary challenged teenager save your money do not buy it,27,4
Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,5.0,positive,this interview with nikki finke was a revelation so much inside information from the ultimate insider i do not think this book would be of interest to everyone but i was totally intrigued and fascinated this was not nearly long enough and could be read in an hour but it would be an exciting hour highly recommended,56,5
Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,4.0,positive,exceptionally honest i love nf nikki is right although most people in the biz seem to paint honest intelligent individuals who do not believe in denial as risky leaks at best,34,6

Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,1.0,negative,this is a really sad and pathetic product consisting of a transcribed interview that seems much longer than it is because it is so lacking in real content nikki finke rants and raves with all the certainty of a lunatic who has incapable of grasping the notion of nuance unpleasant tolja,50,12
Kindle_Store,B00IJKERAM,2.0,negative,the interview was very boring and not what i expected a complete waste of time as far as i am concerned seemed to be self aggrandizement more than anything else,30,13

Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,2.0,negative,too short i understand it is a novella however i believe writers are taking them too far soon as they are discovered she takes off and the book ends i refuse to purchase another novella or book from this author,39,3
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,2.0,negative,not sure what these others reviewers read but i read a rush novella read teaser with an unexpected unfinished ending this novella took like less than ten minutes to read if that save your 99 i wish i had,39,4

Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,1.0,negative,for all of the potential of this novella the brevity of it which resulted in stunted character development was disappointing i wanted to root for her but i was not given enough to understand her motivations or his for that matter i wonder if more time had been given to story development i may not have gotten whiplash from the breakneck speed at which the plot developed sadly even the little teaser at the end is not enough to salvage what could have been a good story because it does not make me want to know what happened next,95,7
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,4.0,positive,good book for a cold or rainy day,8,8
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,2.0,negative,the ending was too short looking forward to the next book i am hoping for a better ending then the first,21,9
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this read although the female character had sex with him a little too soon however i do look forward to the next book the author left me curious and hanging,33,10
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,4.0,positive,this was new to me it was very short and quick penny and matt had unbelievable chemistry from the start it seems it is and impossible love story it works out and matt really does like penny it is a continuous story although told in sections,44,11
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,4.0,positive,I am on to the next book i enjoyed penny and matt very much can not wait to see what waits for them in the next book excited,26,12
Kindle_Store,B00K7Q8I1A,3.0,neutral,nope nope nope i hated the ending cliffhanger this could have been so much more who started the trend of cliff hanger books terrible i tell you just terrible,32,13

Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,1.0,negative,i have nowhere all the glowing reviews came from this is an extremely short story it only goes to 60 then it is over and sara does not even know this guys name until 55 through the book this is after he gives her oral in a restaurant and intercourse on his secretarys desk talk about low standards i have nowhat the conflict was supposed to be i deleted this book from my kindle and i will not be reading the other books on this series,88,0
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,4.0,positive,has a good story plot and is very well written i recommend reading it also has samples of similar work spsm,21,1
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,5.0,positive,aimlie aames can write the ladys truly a gifted wordsmith not only layering beautiful descriptions but painting her characters with a fine brush the contrast between this and many of the other billionaire books out there really can not be overstated aames spins a mean plot too with some genuine surprises it is nice to see a heroine who actually has a mind of her own and who is not about to submit at the drop of a hat because it makes it all the hotter when she does finally melt for brazier as we all would that is not to take anything away from the sex which is as hot and abundant as you could want it is just that this is one of the rare erotic romances where you genuinely want to find out what happens next and can really find yourself rooting for the characters I shall now be following this author with great interest to see what she comes up with next,161,2
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,1.0,negative,i would have been ready to give this book 4 if not 5 stars i was completely enthralled with this book until it suddenly ended on a cliffhanger at 60 and then gives an excerpt into the next book part 2 lust and lies that ends at 83 it is a good thing i had gotten this book as a freebie or else i would have been really ticked the next books are each 299 and are likely just as short this is a horrible marketing ploy and has completely ruined the fact that this was a great story a story that i will not continue,103,3
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,4.0,positive,i love aimelie aames use of descriptive language i liked the start of this series which gives a free taster an opening only this is why i am sticking to four stars i dislike purchasing serials and am well known for complaining of such however i now know this is a full novel so am off forthwith to buy said story and then hopefully it will stand as well alongside aimelies other works I have read this is a paranormal story werewolf by implication but not all clear as yet communication between life and death is it oh and a spectacularly creepy note written in blood from the mysterious journeyman are things i am now curious to find out about but aames erotic and bdsm scenes are so good like an exquisite swiss chocolate bar to savour 4 stars for the freebie opener and I am off to get the novel,149,4
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,2.0,negative,characters are not really interesting there is no one to really root for and when the main female character says she goes in for lunch every single day but can not afford to tip i was completely appalled by this confession,40,5
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,4.0,positive,the submissive and dominant sides of the story are really good the twist of her being some sort of a spy was a let down for me at least,29,6
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,4.0,positive,this is a short story where a woman named sara finds herself doing things she does not quite understand and with a man who she is drawn to in ways she can not explain the storyline is well written and is different from the usual takes on the paranormal the characters are sexy and mysterious and keeps the reader looking to see what has in store next the story is to be continued in the next book and i am looking forward to see what sara has in store for us,88,7
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,5.0,positive,first i have to say that i really enjoyed the authors writing style and would have read the book just for the flowing prose and lush little details but the best part is that she spins a great story too it starts out much like the billionaire romance story structure I am sure we are all used to by now but then it diverges from there in some very interesting ways the hero in the story is just the right kind of dangerous and smoldering sexy and the heroine has intrigue of her own as we find out in a twist the sex is just the kind of needing-to-fan myself hot that i love without being gratuitous or overdone i also enjoyed the hints of paranormal lore interspersed and look forward to seeing more of that in the next book,138,8
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,3.0,neutral,this is not what i would or could call a romance it defiantly is bdsm and paranormal thought not sure how far the paranormal extends because unfortunately this is so short it is an installment of a book there are 3 more of these shorts you have to buy to get the whole story this is a marketing tactic i detest while i liked this short better than the other one of hers i read both are installment shorts rather than whole stories i doubt i will bother reading any more of her books as a result of this marketing ploy,99,9
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,2.0,negative,i was not impressed or entralled with this book it was hardly bdsm one could say it contained some erotica okay if labeled that way then there is some paranormal but until the last page one would never know i felt the author thought ok what has selling now werewolves-check vampires-check bdsm-check and so on there are so many plots and subplots and none that are truly fleshed out that i lost interest fast the story is not cohesive it is like a 12 headed snake and they can not decide which one should direct the tail,94,10
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,3.0,neutral,the first half of this was good if a little cliche the poor girl who nabs the billionaires eye has been done and done again unfortunately the whole thing fell apart when it took a drastic left turn from it is plot up to that point and then just ended at 60 the remaining 40 appeared to be a preview of the next instalment i did not bother reading it I am sorry but that ticks me off this is not a complete story it does not end on a cliffhanger it ends on an incompletion i was left with more questions than answers and there were more open threads than closed wait there were no tied up threads none at a stretch it could be considered the first chapter of a longer work but if you take that route then you are faced with having to pay for each and every chapter no i refuse the author can obviously write i have no complaints in that department but i will not be continuing this series,170,11
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,5.0,positive,aames has fused the paranormal with the popular billionaire sub-genre in a way that is electrifying her billionaire her wolf is the perfect cocktail of erotic writing supernatural imagery and just plain good storytelling when you get into the story you will find that passion waits tempered beneath a shroud of mystery that makes turning the pages irresistible saras long sought liaison with the handsome stranger she has watched from afar is only the beginning soon she has drawn into the hard world of mr abraxis owner of the company where she works as a temp and seemingly the wider world in this tale absolute power does not corrupt absolutely it corrupts with beautiful lust scenes of smokey domination that definitely made my kindle a few degrees warmer the writing magnificent aimelie aames is an excellent craftswoman she wields her pen with real presence equally capable of teasing shocking and making you pause with breathless fascination to appreciate her awesome scenes her billionaire her wolf is an interesting bridge between two erotic romance tropes and it is sure to appeal to fans of both brooding billionaires and primal alpha wolves five stars,186,12
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,1.0,negative,a very disappointing read not a book that i would purchase i can only hope that the author has written better,21,13
Kindle_Store,B0091V9BPE,1.0,negative,unloaded it from my kindle app just not my cup of tea if you are into this kind of thing you will enjoy it just read the excerpt really well to be sure,32,14
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,3.0,neutral,i am addicted to military novels with navy seals and enjoyed the book but sorry to say and please do not think i discriminate against female authors but they just do not do justice with this type of story line as well as male authors like for example keith douglass,48,0
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this story and how it wrapped up all the threads of the various plots in the books,20,1
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,3.0,neutral,i skipped a lot of pages for this book because i wanted to get to the end not because i wanted to know what happened in the end but the characters just did not mean much to me,37,2
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,3.0,neutral,there was a lot going on in the story i was not a fan of any of the women in the story they all frustrated me with their brightness i really just wanted the story to end,36,3
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,1.0,negative,i quit reading this book when i ran across glaring errors in military rank i emailed the author the error and she did not respond it takes no time to google military ranks and other information or to contact a military public information person at a military base i would not recommend any book by this author and will not purchase another book by her,64,4
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,1.0,negative,very poor writing and the story did not flow well at all the author also needs to research military ranks and responsibilities before writing about them a petty officer is not in the air force and would never be a pilot,40,5
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,2.0,negative,i never review books but i feel so strongly about this one that it is hard to keep my mouth shut the entire time i was reading this book i felt like i was reading a report that had to have a certain amount of words in it and the author was simply filling space to me a great part of reading is using my imagination this author left absolutely nothing to the imagination i do not need to know which hand a character shook hands with because his other hand was holding a cigarette the cigarette was not even pertinent to the story line the entire book was the same way i do not know who edited this book but it was very poorly done the story line was good but needed to be developed in a better way i will not be reading anything by this author again unless she changes her writing style,151,6
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,5.0,positive,this book was very interesting did not care for the abrupt ending and hope the sequel picks up where this one left off,22,7
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,2.0,negative,i was really looking forward to this book it started out okay in the beginning however there was to many characters that were flip flopping through the first few chapters to many grammatical errors does not anybody read through the transcripts before publishing i liked joshua and will as the two main seals other then that this was an extremely slow story and was all over the place,67,8
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,2.0,negative,if you are looking for a book with a lot of military navy and marine corps terminology you have found it if on the other hand you are looking for some romance with a military flair there has some cheap sex scenes in this book but otherwise no romance,45,9
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,5.0,positive,i love military romance especially seals special ops black ops and more there has a new writer in town and loren mathis did a great job on this book the action took us all over from the middle east to pakistan russia and the united states the characters are well written seal team member joshua and the woman in his life victoria a journalist are hot together i can see 2 more books already on 2 of the other characters the action was non-stop i would put this writer in the league of dee davis sharon hamilton stephanie tyler and cherry adair for military romance for 99 you can not go wrong so buy it and be entertained i can not wait for her next book,121,10
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,1.0,negative,the writing was equal to my teenage daughters high school english work very disappointed i do not recommend this author,20,11

Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,4.0,positive,good book would recommend as good military read there is an expression that was used incorrectly the expression is for all intents and purposes,24,13
Kindle_Store,B00DKHJZUQ,4.0,positive,while on a tour of the mid east former us congressman henning is captured and held prisoner by the haqqi network seal team 14 makes a daring rescue of the congressman the us government learns that this haqqi network is also trying to obtain the smallpox virus their intentions are evil and they realize that there is no cure with a mortality rate of 50 if a version utilizing weapons is used the mortality rate rises to 90 ouch meanwhile back in dallas a young reporter victoria sanchez is investigating the congressman she has a feeling about him and her feelings are usually correct the smallpox virus 3 vials has been stolen in russia the plot thickens with the involvement of the seal team 14 and the fsb part of russian foreign intelligence inside russia will the cooperation of these two units result in the return and destruction of the smallpox virus and how does victorias investigation of the congressman tie in with this virus i enjoyed the read and thought it was neatly tied up lots of adventure action and a couple of romances tossed in highly recommended,189,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,2.0,negative,this case looks cool but it did not fit my phone correctly and it took about an hour to snap it on and then when i finally got it on and dropped it for the first time it broke it also makes the phone bulkier than other cases i have had it is cheap but i would not recommend it,57,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,4.0,positive,the cover is very pretty it fit my phone well and was easy to put on i was impressed on how fast it shipped i already ordered another one,29,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,1.0,negative,do not waste your money even although it is not much i got this one and there was nothing good about it it was cheap plastic the picture chipped off withing the first two weeks or so and it did not protect my phone when i accidently dropped it the screen was cracked so much for being a shock absorbent product do not waste your money unless you are an idiot,67,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,4.0,positive,i like this case it fits the thunderbolt perfectly the design is not quite as vivid as it looks in the picture it is very difficult to get off but i guess that is good it will not be falling off seems to be good protection for the phone,45,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,1.0,negative,if i could give it no stars i would it did not fit my phone all of the corners would not snap at the same time and it was very flimsy the case has been on my phone for about a week my phone has not been dropped or had anything done to it out of the ordinary and the case is already cracked and broken in two places it does not even stay on my phone anymore do not buy this product yes it is cheap but you get what you pay for,94,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,2.0,negative,lasted for about 4 months before all of the tabs that hold the two halves together all broke off you can not beat the price but just make sure you buy a few of them,34,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,3.0,neutral,the case is beautiful but does not close completely i have the super screen protector on my phone and i think that is the reason it does not close even with thethe case fits and is secure,39,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,1.0,negative,i purchased this for my thunderbolt not only did it not protect the unit it caused a crack in my screen now i no longer own a that phone because i tried to purchase a cheap cover to update the cover i purchased initially with the phone do not waste the money it was an expensive lesson to learn,58,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,2.0,negative,the design is cute although it is not as bright as the picture that was shown i did not mind that but i thought i was getting a rubberized case as it says in the title of the product it is not rubberized it is just cheap plastic that does not even fit the phone correctly i can get everything snapped except one corner i have spend half an hour putting the case on and struggling to get it back off to see if putting it together in a difference order will get that last corner to close no luck I am debating if i should just return it but the postage would probably be more than the cost of the case lesson learned you get what you pay for,128,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,3.0,neutral,made the phone thick and bulky and noticeably heavier plastic did not completely snap into place around phone also design did not match up at seams and it ended up looking odd,30,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,5.0,positive,it is truly a beautiful case and I am confident that it will keep my phone protected it also feels really smooth all around i would definitely recommend it shipping was fast with amazon prime so sign up if you have not already if you do plan on getting this case get a screen protector to completely protect your phone from scratches cheers,60,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,5.0,positive,it seems to offer moderate protection to the phone although i have yet to drop it and really test that theory it does not feel cheap it looks nice does not add much bulk my husband ordered a gel cover for his thunderbolt and it is nice too but it did cost more and I am not sure how much better protection it will give although i would agree that a gel would protect better as this could come apart if the phone were to fall also i think this looks nicer,91,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004MGCD0I,5.0,positive,this case is perfect for the spring it is colorful and the texture is so soft yet durable i love it and i have received many compliments,27,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,4.0,positive,these are nice and easy there has not much to say these earphones are exactly what i wantedthey have great crisp sound with descent bass all with wirelesss convenience the only thing i would suggest to novero is adding some foam ear pieces i perfer the foam ear pieces they would stay more firmly in the ear i say this from experience i took the earpieces off my much loved jvc marshmallows which just happen to fit these perfectly and do secure them much better in your ear they also have superior noise cancellation,93,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,3.0,neutral,i really like this product for many reasons however i was disappointed by the volume it does not quite generate enough decibels to fully enjoy music i am not an extreme listener who wants his acdc to split his ears i am a 50 year old bald guy who likes to hear every note of adele,56,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,4.0,positive,if you plan to wear these while running do not they are a great design and fit although for normal use my only criticism is you can never tell if they are shut off and if they are not batteris go quickly just remember to unpair them from you device after use,48,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,1.0,negative,i bought these as a replacement for a lost pair of the sonys the design is good and i really wanted a pair that could work with the standard micro usb charger and pair with two devices while indeed the noveros do these things the overall build quality is terrible cheap labels fall off the earbuds so you lose track of which ear is which the battery cover is very flimsy and more and the quality of the connection is very poor maybe in the future they will fix some of this but at least for now these are best avoided i sent mine back for a refund,107,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,1.0,negative,i did not expect these to compare to the bose wired ie2s headphones i normally use but after using those for a long time the rockaway headset makes my music sound like it is on an am radio with an old shallow speaker there has hardly any bass and the buds do not sit well no matter what size i use they fall out often maybe because of how far the ends stick out I have used the rockaways in the office paired to my laptop about 3 ft away and on my iphone as well with the same sound results I shall just get an extension cable for my bose instead of continuing with these,112,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,4.0,positive,they have great battery life i really wish they were ear buds and not in-ear they do not stay in my ears and even with the smallest ends hurt my ears after a couple hours of listening but the audio is extremely clear and the maximum volume is nice and loud they do sufficiently drown out background noise so they work great in loud environments i just wish they were more comfortable for me,73,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,2.0,negative,i thought design was very nice they fit well and i liked the flat connecting wire my problem was the music quality was just not there and i went back to my wireless head phones less money and better sound,40,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,1.0,negative,i contacted manufacture which was by email and phone message only no live person took a long time to get a response eventually after months got a replacement but it was a huge hassle and took lots of follow up contacting do not have much faith in the replacement i was right to worry about the replacement it also quit working properly on the switch side it has a very very low volume on the one side even at full volume with all the hassle to get the first one replaced i do not think I shall bother with the second set very expensive garbage,102,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z18ULK,1.0,negative,i got this headset today i am so excited but was disappointed when i can not swith it on at all at first i thought is because the batt is low so i plug in the cable provided and try to charge it when i plug the cable to the device the led light shows blue led fully charged instead of red led charging i tried to charged for more than 12 hrs althought the led was showing blue light after more than 12hrs i try to switch it on and it will not switch on anyone have the same problem too please share thanks days later i got a reply from quantum wireless saying that i can ship the headset back to them i am so disappointed this is my first time ordering from them and i got a defective set i paid the headset for headset 80 plus shipping 50 plus total 130 and now i got to ship back 60 due to faulty set they send me now they are telling me that most likely i will get a refund back for only thei order they do not cover the shipping fees really sad and disappointed,201,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005BINK4Y,1.0,negative,this phone had potential it has a nice fast processor a decent amount of ram and supports a 32 gb expansion via micro sd heres the problem lg and at t are not going to update this phone it is still stuck to this day on android 23x there has no hope in sight of it ever getting upgraded beyond this point so unless this phone is a freebie not-contract based then do yourself a favor and look at a motorola or a samsung phone do not under any circumstances get tied into a 2 year contract with a phone that has no support for the future,102,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005BINK4Y,4.0,positive,this is by far the best smartphone that i have come across i think it is bettr than the htc evo 3d this phone is sturdy and does not feel like it is going to slip out of your hands the phone has tons of features you just have to find them all some you just come across by yourself and others are in the user manual can not wait for the update in october hopefully this fixes some of the small minor issues the battery life could be better but it could also be worse depending on how many apps you have and apps running make sure you stop off running apps when not in use overall great phone good job lg,119,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005BINK4Y,3.0,neutral,i bought this despite what i read about the battery thinking it can not be that bad it definitely is as bad as people are saying the phone itself is nice screen is giant 3d is cool pics and video are clear but if you use your phone for an hour you will be at 20 or less battery they need to make a larger battery for this beware of battery but great phone otherwise quadrant score of over 2800,78,13

Kindle_Store,B00AT1GM3E,1.0,negative,would have liked a little more info about her abilities i believe they could have made it all into one book this seems like just a chapter of her info about herself that led nowhere kind of dissapointed should have bought a different book with more detail into her life,52,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,this case fits my new verizon iphone like a glove looks pretty too the case keeps my iphone safe and very easy to use all buttons on the phone great purchase and price,33,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,i received my case mate case and it had obviously been used and was black not pink and gray there were numerous scratches on the back and signs of general wear i toyed with the notion of sending it back but it was not so that bad and i am far too busy to deal with the hassle that being said it is a fine case very sturdy good shock resistance and easy to get in and out of pockets i wish there was more front protection but the slim design outweighs that minor flaw over a good product,97,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,i have had this case for a little over a week it is a wonderful case slides easily into my pocket easy to grip and more my one complaint is that the rubber on the sides of the case is beginning to show some wear it will not affect the usefulness but it does look a little worn the pinkis a little more bubblegum pink than in the picture but in my opinion it is a prettyand looks nice with the grey i would recommend this cover,84,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,the case is very durable the silicon stops the phone from sliding and the hard case protects the phone really well,21,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,i have had a couple of otterbox cases and this one by far is much better i love this case it protects my phone is not too bulky is not difficult to put on the phone and i like the look,39,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,so i love the case it is comfortable and looks nice all the buttons and plug-in areas are easy to access however part of the case split after three months of gentle use i did not drop it pull on it and i never took it off after putting it on I am not happy about that I shall buy one more and hope i got a defective one the first time we will see,69,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,the case lives up to the description and is much cheaper online than in stores protective yet smooth enough to go in and out of my pocket easily,28,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,when i received the case i was disappointed to see that it did not come with the advertised screen protection kit i contacted the seller and they advised that they never received the kits from case-mate they then offered a small partial refund i received thein good time from the seller unfortunately this is one of the sellers that requires you to pay shipping even when purchased through amazon the case itself is very nice and i am very pleased with it the case is not at all bulky the rubber sides have a nice feel and the pink is very pretty the case is made for the verizon iphone 4 and fits the verizon buttons perfectly after two days of use the back of the case does have a few scratches but that may be common among all the hard plastic cases with this case just know that you will have to order your own screen protector,160,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,this is an excellent case it is not too bulky and fits the verizon iphone 4 well the only problem is that the screen protection kit was not included with mine purchased from daydeals via amazoncom as described in the product description i contacted the seller and they said that case-mate must not have included it in the package and offered to send me a generic one i received the generic one and it was crap cutouts for front camera and more did not match the iphone 4 update i recently purchased another one this time directly from amazoncom and the screen protection kit was included,104,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,the side switch does not match up with the att iphone but i still like it and use it i bought it based off the colors,25,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,the case itself is very nice but in the picture it appears to be light pink with a light grey grip on the side which is indeed false it is more of a hot barbie kind of pink and the grip looks more black still a nice case just watch the advertising,52,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,1.0,negative,when i saw this case online the grey looks much lighter and the pink looks really cute and pale and i have the line green and grey case of this brand and loved it so i ordered it upon receiving it however the pink was more of a hot bright pink and the grey was practically black i was not all that satisfied and it did not even fit my phone properly at the silencing switch even although it was ment for the iphone i have,86,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,love this case the grippers on the side are wonderful so i do not feel like I am going to drop my phone the only problem i have had is if i try to plug it into ait is not able to because it can not get in far enough because of the case but not a big deal in my case,60,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,it is a great case i had a white one before took good care of my phone when i got my new phone they gave me top price for the old one this case does it is job they rubber grips on the side are a bonus i just really like this case it will not be my last one,58,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,1.0,negative,side switch is out of reach for iphone 4s it is hard to get in to turn switch on or off as hole in case is not aligned with phone,30,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,3.0,neutral,just do yourself a favor and buy tempered glass for the front of your phone it is about 40 bucks which may seem like a lot but it is worth it i still use the back part of the screen cover just because I am a scratch nazi they work fine just scratch like anything else does,54,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,1.0,negative,i thought i was going to receive five front and back screen protectors i just opened the package and there is only one cover for the front of the screen why,31,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,3.0,neutral,the price is great hands down but you get what you pay for these are a great fit for the phone and they fit with my otterbox without peeling on the edges however like an earlier review mentioned it does blur the screen a little bit and makes it a bit difficult to read especially if you are accustomed to no screen protector at all great quality for the price but I am going to replace it with an hd screen protector from zagg here soon if you are on a budget and do not mind a little less sharpness and clarity this is the deal for you although,105,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,4.0,positive,feel good to touch and see just one minor problem the top part of back cover is easy to fall off but luckily i got five ones here,28,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,2.0,negative,it is not like it shows in the picture the back it is not separate it is one whole thing so it gets some air in the top and in the bottom i got this package because of the picture so I am not that happy about it,46,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,1.0,negative,i ordered the anti glare screen protector actually the pack was written ' ' anti glare''but the product inside is n't what i ordered do n't buy it,24,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,2.0,negative,the price especially since it includes a rear protector is great however having used a number of screen protectors i have found that the matte finish of these is unacceptable if you are worried about fingerprints you may be tempted to go this way but i was disappointed it turns out that the matte finish slightly blurs the image and makes fine print less readable not much point in having a retina display screen if you use this protector,79,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,5.0,positive,perfict fit i love the anti glare five sets of front and back protection in this low price you should not miss this deal,24,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,4.0,positive,i like these screen protecters really tough and sleek it was a little rough to the touch although but otherwise really nice at an unbeatable price good job,28,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,3.0,neutral,it is a regular screen protector but the screen protector for the back is cut in 3 pieces instead of 1 regular piece 2 small pieces for the top and bottom glass part and then 1 middle piece for the metal part this is not in the description and it is horrible looking,50,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,2.0,negative,the quality is not good but on the other side it is quite cheap so you can balance between the price and quality,23,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,1.0,negative,i bought this this2 days ago shipping was really fast i like it but i do not like the screen protectors i cleaned my iphone 5 screen and try it to put it on everything was good 2 minutes later screen protector was coming out there was a lot bubbles i tried to put another one still same shit do not buy it,63,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,5.0,positive,good quality it fits my phone perfectly great protection for my iphone front-back and i got a good price from this shop i live ingermany it costs about 5 for 3 front screen protectors I am very impressed definitely going to buy more stuff from this shop again,47,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,5.0,positive,a good product with a low prize the delivery was really fast the product is just as shown in the picture and described in the information,26,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009GSEHR4,4.0,positive,these were awesome for my iphone 5 the only problem was that they scratched fairly easily i do not have any problems reading my screen nor does it reduce the quality of the pictures,34,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,5.0,positive,i went from original iphone to a blackberry bold and then back to iphone 4 i have always said that the only think that i really liked about the bb was the raised keyboard and the thing i dislike the most about the iphone is the virtual keyboard and now i can have the best of both excellent service received it within a few days of ordering very easy to hook up with bluetooth and pretty basic / easy to use the negatives for me are auto capitalization does not work when using keyboard and there has only one shift key and it is on the left side other than that i really like it anyhow i like it it is easy and it looks cool,121,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,3.0,neutral,i bought this device a while back and never wrote a review figured i would get around to it now i bought this to have the feel of buttons as many iphone users miss in the end the buttons worked great and the quality was better than i expected but not having the spell check option became too annoying maybe a new ios will help make this product better and allow for it overall i felt the product was as advertised and if you are way more accurate than i am you might like this product,96,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,1.0,negative,so i get my package in the mail and i am very excited but when i open it i find that they sent me a cheap keyboard that does not light up or anything or even slide out it is the tk 421 keyboard and it twists out from the side and the keys are much bigger and bulkier needless to say i will not buy from this user again,69,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,2.0,negative,did not work well with my iphone affected my ability to text even when i had it turned off and was only texting with the phones touchscreen,26,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,4.0,positive,got this for someone who hates their virtual keyboard for the money it was worth a try they really like it and are adjusting to it i used it for a bit and did not think it was the most ergonomic devise it is a balance issue the phone is kinda top heavy with the keyboard slid out can not see a way for that to be fixed without making the case way too heavy nice backlight and very easy to pair,78,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,1.0,negative,worked great when i first used it disconnects all the time and eventually stopped charging and stopped connecting plus there has no light so you can not use it in dim or dark rooms,32,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,5.0,positive,the one complaint i had about the iphone was the lack of a physical keyboard for texting but look what we have here case fits great no trouble getting it on keyboard slide out like it was build onto the phone,41,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,3.0,neutral,bought this because it was cheap and had just needed better keyboard function than was on the tiny screen with my adult male sized hands it was a greatwhile it worked however it completely died after about 2 months and would no longer create a bluetooth signal may have let the battery die not sure there are other products on the market with key patterns the better mimic the layout of a real keyboard so that is how i replaced this one,84,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,4.0,positive,this works great and does not seem to drain my battery i do wish it had a right shift key and the space key took a little getting use to but overall a great product,34,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,4.0,positive,purchased this as a gift for my wife was for the most part as described by the seller quality could be a bit better and as some others have said could use a light in the keyboard keyboard interferes with camera unless you slide it open before taking pictures bottom line nice product until the novelty wears off,58,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,5.0,positive,bought this for my mom as a christmas gift to be used with her iphone 4 as she hates the touchscreen keyboard she loves thisit works great for her and is much easier for her to use this will prevent you from being able to use a case so that is the downfall but to her it is well worth it,63,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,1.0,negative,i ordered thisthinking it would make texting easier when i received it the cover was cheap feeling plastic and the keys did not punch half the time of you were ever spoiled by a quality qwerty keyboard you will be disappointed i returned and am waiting on my refund,51,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,4.0,positive,wish i could use this more but the thing is like too bulky and it does not fit in my pocket,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,5.0,positive,this keyboard and case seem to work well on the iphone 4s i putchased for a friend that is used to having a regular keyboard,25,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0052CHOS2,4.0,positive,the keyboard works like it should my only actual criticism is for individually backlit keys and a longer battery life,20,14
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,1.0,negative,more of an article that you might find in a local paper than a book and aone at that save the dollar,24,0
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,3.0,neutral,i was expecting more information the pamphlet on my kindle did not last very long into my flight it was ok otherwise,22,1
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,5.0,positive,after reading this piece i can say that it is very well written and gives us a glimpse of what happened to these two ladies that night the author paints a vivid picture of the tragedy and how it has affected him and his response it he writes with compassion and respect which is sorely missed in many writings today i do not see why others are complaining about the length of this work it is after all an essay and it states that fact in the description this is very much worth a read some of these reviewers need to remember that the quality of a writing is much more important than the quantity of pages,116,2
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,3.0,neutral,good as it is but i expected more in depth information and description than there was but it was an ok read,22,3
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,5.0,positive,one of the girls who were killed that night was michele koons she graduated from kearny high school in san diego just as i did although i did not personally know her news spread quickly at school the book is like a roller coaster ride starts slowly and then the bears show up after that night park rangers and their policy towards bears changed in a major way up till then bears seemed to be viewed as the same as zoo animals i highly recommend it i will never camp in a area that has bears it is a bear version of jaws,101,4
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,4.0,positive,just as the author I have always felt a connection to night of the grizzlies i still have the original paperback which i pulled out not long ago to read once more coincidentally about the time i ran across the essay while searching for a kindle version of the book and something more current although night of the grizzlies 45 years later was interesting and i appreciated the authors personal connection to the victims and his journey to honor them i would have liked more than just an essay with perhaps updated information about the victims families and more with photos,99,5
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,3.0,neutral,a bit brief but we will written loved the original story it has stayed with me and took me to glacier in every page,23,6
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,1.0,negative,to say this is a very poorly written piece hardly describes it adequately it reminds me of poorly organized letters to the editor it does not have anything to do with the original book but borrows on the title i am sure the author tries to do good work in the interests of wildlife and grizzly bears in particular i wish he would confine himself to that good work and not visit pieces like this upon the reading public,78,7
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,3.0,neutral,i probably would of liked it more if it would not have quit less then half way thru it and i could not turn any more pages never happened before with a book so i just returned it,35,8
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,5.0,positive,i purchased this account because of my familiarity with the subject matter and an interest i have in the life of bears as the wife of a former forest ranger i have encountered grizzlies in the wild and watched as the public goes through seasons of wonder at the animals and horror at the devistation they can inflict this author has a first person experience worth the reading of anyone who loves the bears or has ever experienced the impact of these creatures in the wild he speaks with passion and the emotion of his respect and love is evident as well as his honor for those who suffered the greatest at a time when man and nature were in conflict in short i love this account and it left me wanting to read more,135,9
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,5.0,positive,the is a follow up to the first book night of the grizzlies easy read i enjoy knowing what happen to the people and the land if you ever consider living with bears or just want to improve your knowledge of bears these two are a must read,48,10
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,1.0,negative,i was surprised this is really a 10 page booklet that does not give much in the way of new info mainly a brief reflection of two lost lives i was hoping for more info on the condition of the bears health and what changes in park management occurred afterward,49,11
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,2.0,negative,this is not worth your time it is little more than a personal journal entry definitely take a pass on this one,22,12
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,2.0,negative,i thought this was supposed to be a book it is more like a term paper which can be read in ten minutes,23,13
Kindle_Store,B00B04B0KY,1.0,negative,not even worth 99 cents this is nothing more than an essay saying that the author feels a bond with the 2 victims the only new information is the authors short description of the attack scenes as they exist today this is not a full length book most of this essay is about a animal rescue organization which the author belongs and his opinions on the actions of alaska wildlife officials this was my free book to borrow for my kindle thank goodness it was free,86,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,4.0,positive,exactly as pictured fit my phone with no problem the only thing i do not like is that it is a bit hard to hit the volume and power buttons with the case on because the material is stiff but headphones and charger work no problem and the speaker hole is in the right spot I am very satisfied with this purchase,59,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,1.0,negative,i know this case is super cute but do not buy it extremely cheap bow came off within a few hours of usage and case did not fit s4 well seemed like the phone was always popping out of it super cute but not functional at all,47,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,4.0,positive,i really like this case it is great for the price i agree with other reviews that it is hard to press the power button and the volume buttons through the case however i would also like to add that since the sides of the case are not made out of the same plastic material as the back of the case the sides tend to get really dirty besides that it is too cute to pass up and I have gotten tons of complements on it,84,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,4.0,positive,this case is adorable super thin and light weight i love it the only reason i did not give it 5/5 is because the side buttons side power key and volume keys are very hard to press other than the that it is made very nicely,45,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,4.0,positive,love the case only problem is that the charging port hole is a little small for some of my chargers but it is not that big of a problem,28,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,2.0,negative,the cover looks very cute but unfortunately the power and volume keys have to be pressed really hard for them to work it looks like there is a smallbetween the edges of the phone and the cover so the phone might slip out over time get this cover only if looks are important to you but if you want to retain the functionality of the power and volume buttons and are expecting some protection to your phone keep shopping for a better case,85,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CRAR2GQ,2.0,negative,the red thing in the corner broke in 3 days of use so i do not recommend this product,18,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,4.0,positive,it did not work i ordered it hoping it would fit a samsung flight it is a great price although so i gave it a high rating,25,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,5.0,positive,a neat little adapter that does exactly what it is supposed to do been using it for months with no problems,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,2.0,negative,what i ordered and what is in the product description is not what i received gtmax stereo adapter pictured with a 90 degree angled plug what i received was not even gtmax had a straight angled plug had a microphone and function button so far not a big deal and is mono not stereo huge deal i ordered this to listen to the music i store on my phone using my nice bosse headphones rather than crappy earbuds but it is mono instead of stereo which on a lot of my music completely loses a lot of what is going on only get left channel blaring out of both headphone speakers,110,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,5.0,positive,it is perfect and works great fits perfect to cell phone and ear phone,14,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,1.0,negative,the first time we tried to use this product it broke i did not bother trying to return it since it was so inexpensive,23,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,2.0,negative,i was actually looking for mini usb to 35 mm stereo-plus-mic jack for my samsung highlight mobile this product is good for listening music from your mobile which i do not do i already have an ipod touch with a remote mic ear phone so this is the reason i am going with 2 star rating,55,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,2.0,negative,wish the discription had said it did not work for answering the phone only works with music if i had know i would not have purchased the product,28,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,4.0,positive,i use it to connect 35 mm jbuds with my samsung t401 g mainly listen to podcasts but it sounds good with music too so far it is working pretty good can hear some static on some recordings seems like it might not last too long but it is fairly inexpensive and so far has been worth the price paid,56,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,3.0,neutral,you plug it into the phone and then you try to put the phone into your pocket without the adapter getting unplugged from the phone good luck on that it can be done but it should not be so difficult it might be a design flaw of the phone or it could be a design flaw of this adapter either way it should not become disconnected from the phone so easily boo hiss to samsung for not having included a normal headphone port to compensate for this flaw make sure you have headphones with an in-line volume control,98,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,1.0,negative,the part is not good i tried to use it so i can connect my phone through my car aux but it did not work i was able to hear but people coudnt hear me,34,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,3.0,neutral,for one this is not a picture of what you get the cord is actualy about 24 inches long and it is not angled and it is got a microphone and alligator clip,31,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002S5R4IG,4.0,positive,have not had any problems with it although i have had some for previous phones fall apart after a while because they are cheap to buy it would be best to order 2 or 3,35,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,3.0,neutral,product does extend the life of the battery significantly however the finish wears off and the trim starts coming apart fairly quickly it happened just a week in to my using the product and i only use it when necessary since these things do not affect the functionality it is still worth putting up with them for the extended battery life but it is disappointing after a short time to have a shabby lookingplugged in to such an awesome phone,83,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,5.0,positive,if you are frustrated with the battery life on iphone 3 g this is exactly what you have been looking for never again be stuck in an airport or conference or out on the town with a dead or dying iphone you can even simultaneously sync and recharge the mophie and your iphone together so you do not need to bring two cords when you travel i love it mophie juice pack 3 g black / green,73,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,4.0,positive,product that does the job it is asked to do i keep the juice pack with me in my briefcase and use it as a backup when my power is running low it at least doubles the time i can go without charging my iphone the juice pack makes the phone slightly larger but when you phone is running low on charge you really do not care,66,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,2.0,negative,used with 3 g s i was primarily interested in this product as a sacrificial battery to prolong the alleged 500-cycle life of the internal iphone battery not to extend talk time per se i could never get the thing to charge from the apple ac adapter only from a usb port tying your extra life to the availability of a computer the pack did not run down before the internal battery as advertised by mophie it would start out running off the pack but the use of an app talking on the phone or various other activities would inevitably because it to suddenly switch to the internal battery when the pack had plenty of juice left obviously this rendered it useless for my purpose had high hopes and was therefore extremely disappointed this may be more the fault of the phone internals but if it does not work well it does not work i hope it can be improved physically it seems very well designed,163,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,2.0,negative,good this product keeps the iphone charged for a full day of use and has a nice weight / feel to it bad protection on the top is well bad ugly the rubber sleeves on each side come off after a month or so this also happened to my friends product is in need of improvement especially for 99,56,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,4.0,positive,pro-doubles battery life useful during high useage hard case feels substantial and is well designed unlike most other cases it allows complete use of the screen 2 other cases i have limit the functional use at theof screen due to case overlap 4 leds on back of case provide relative charge status rechargeable via std usb tops off both 3 g and mophie con-device came drained against juiced as advertised recharge was quick and uneventful so only mildly disappointed 3 g iphone treats device as if it were plugged into external power which it is but this means device continuously drains mophie even in stby you can carry the pack detached but that defeats the purpose of having an integrated ext battery / case hardcase does not protect topof device overall-highly recommend despite what are relatively minor issues as stated above i am hopeful mophie can address the power management issue with apple then this device would be a 5 star,160,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,2.0,negative,i bought this in january 2009 everything was great except for the glue problem you have read about but since my iphone 3 g was updated to os 30 the battery pack does not charge the phone correction aug 02 2009 this was a coincident it turns out that i had a defective juice pack morphie and company honored their 1 year warranty and paid for shipping i am now upgrading it from a two to a 4 1 off for the glue problem i now have a brand new fully working juice pack just in case you did not understand it was not a problem with os 30,105,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,4.0,positive,this product has doubled the lofe of my iphone i have golfshot gps on my iphone and the juice pack has performed extremely well andi never have to worry about the battery running down during a round of golf,39,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,5.0,positive,i have not had any rubbers issues after reading these reviews I am waiting for them this thing is great i can take the phone with a dead battery plug it in to the juice pack and watch a movie when the movie ends the phone battery is fully recharged and there is still some left in the pack sick and the basic form factor does not change it still fits well in your hand it still holds well to make a call better actually because it is not slippery still fits in your pocket if you are not wearing tight pants alternatively any time you are sitting somewhere you can be charging the phone then take the phone off the pack when you are heading out again i have a kensington extra battery that i had before this came out it connects by a wired works but a constant pain in the butt,148,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,4.0,positive,very good at recharging my iphone i am still a little fuzzy if it is the correct one for my 3gs amazon says it is but the packaging stops at 3 g i am also a little unclear when the phone is runnign off the mophie juice pack or the iphone battery the 4 light battery level indicator only works when there is no phone attached it does what i needed kept me iphoning during an extended period with no chance to recharge with via outlet or computer,87,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,1.0,negative,plenty of juice that is true plenty of glue all over your phone case hands and clothes as the side grips just fall off this I shall manufactured case fix it mophie,29,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,2.0,negative,the charging ability is good however the device is falling apart the side grips came off and i had to glue them back on,24,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,5.0,positive,i happened to see this as a gold box deal and that saved me a whole chunk of money it is great the instructions suck but that seems to be true of most electronics i buy it is a usb type recharger but the iphone comes with an adaptor for charging to a standard electrical outlet so just plug the mophie cord into that adaptor takes a good long while to fully charge 4 blue lights but it holds the charge for awhile when not in use unlike my iphone there has a little button to press that can tell you how much charge you have remaining mine has held the full charge for several days of non use since i just got it a week ago or so i do not yet know the limits of it is holding ability but I am already very impressed,142,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,4.0,positive,for weeks i thought this was a brilliant accessory battery drains first leaving your phone fully charged then you charge the mophie like a spare battery which phones used to have once it gets real warm although the rubber bumpers on the side start to slide around and come off leaving a really sticky mess it is a real problem making an otherwise brilliant product very annoying,67,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001E42QBW,2.0,negative,this is one of the most disappointing products ever sometimes it charges and works perfectly as designed and sometimes the iphone gives you an error message you have to basically leave this thing on all the time or you have to remove it from the iphone to reset it not worth the money i bought 2 of these things and both of them exhibit the same behavior on the 3gs,70,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,for people who want a device that is a computer in their pocket this is the right device for you for those of you who are not comfortable with computers and there make-up and do not know how to customize things to your liking on a windows mobile device than this device is not for you the great thing about windows mobile is there are so many customizable options you have out there and the programs you can install are limitless if you do not like how a certain program functions install a different one there are tons of custom roms operating systems you can install to turn this machine into a beast that can not be touched by any other phone out there today,121,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,3.0,neutral,never dropped it kept a protective rubber cover on it and only used it for calls and texting by the way there is a delay in texting which is frustrating stored a few pics but never used pic mail after only 4 months it failed to start up this morning took it for diagnostic test and was told i need a new phone but they did not tell me what caused it to kill over my replacement phone should arrive in 3 - 4 days but i hope that it is not a lemon as well the guy at sprint told me they get alot of lotus phones in for repairs not good,108,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,ok i have gotten into the world of ppcs with a real old model this is by far the best phone and the wife loved it so much she had to get it now for thoose not used to a ppc it might feel a bit clunky with the interface but do to all it can do it will i will say battery life could be better although there are registry tweaks and such that greatly help [ ] there are certain programs to help with the tf3d feel overall i highly recomend this to someone with the need and use for a powerfull phone and business use dave,108,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,1.0,negative,this is a terrible phone for a man to try to use the keyboard is too small the smart keys try to do too much for you and you end up calling people you never intended i hate it,39,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,this thing has a great keyboard buttons are slightly raised for nice tactile feedback easier to use than you would think even with the strange shape it is short but wide which is perfect actually ditched my last phone because i love this one so much if you are looking to simplify your life this is a good phone if you are somebody who uses some features rarely like web email or gps there is no need to carry around a big smartphone this has those features and they work great would not want to use them on here all the time but for somebody like me who just uses it to phone and text it works great camera is also nice much better than other phones i have used up there with my nikon and fuji digital cameras this phone is not for everybody it is takes a bit getting used to when you hold it since it is so wide if you can get around that although it think you will like it i know i did,174,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,I have been an user of cell phones from a long time ago and i owned 6 different brands siemens nokia htc hyundai motorola and sony ericcson and i got a new offer from my cell phone operator giving me this blackberry so far after one month using it i can not be more surprised and pleased of the capabilities and the functioning of the cell phone i highly recommend this blackberry,70,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,2.0,negative,powerful phone but somewhat problematic not as easy to use as i had expected complaint from people i talk to about poor sound quality i did not have this issue with previous phone and different service short battery life you need to purchase a copy of microsoft outlook 85 to us all features sprint service very average in my area there are better choices denied my rebate even although everything was in order I am still trying to work through that issue,80,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,2.0,negative,i bought this phone on 12/26/08 and less than 8 weeks later it stopped working i took it into a sprint store and they told me many people have the same computer issue but it was over 30 days so i had to send it to lg lg then told me i had to ship it to them and pay for the tracking / packaging / shipping / insurance and the plan while they send me a refurbished phone in two weeks i bought a new phone and will receive a used phone back i was very disappointed with sprint and lg but felt trapped to fix this problem,101,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,i go my lg lotus about 3 or 4 weeks ago i used one in the store and i liked the cool design and it is features also it has gmail which not many phones have i think the qwerty keyboard is pretty easy to type on and i like that also it has internet which is also good the internet is kinda slow but it is a phone so what should i expect it is a phonethe other downside is it does not always show the whole screen but it is okay i like that it is flip and qwerty key board also i like the pictures and videos i can make with it also the camera buton on the side makes everything easier it is kinda slow but it amkes up for it i have the red one which the do not sell on amazon but the red one has an amazing design and I am glad i got this phone,154,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,5.0,positive,i balked at the form factor at first but after checking out the cnet review i wanted to check it out in person went to a nearby sprint store and still thought it looked funny but the functionality of this phone is sick gps email texting internet phone it gives my wifes blackberry curve some serious competition and the menus and options for every feature are very well thought out and executed give this one a serious look even if your friends make fun of you for having a chick phone I have even grown to like the chunkiness of it,101,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,2.0,negative,this phone is kind of a piece of junk my daughter has went thru 3 of them with sprint it has a problem of turning itself off and on for no reason at all plus it loses it is signal quite often and we live in a decent sized metro area it is ok i guess if you get it for free but do not pay for it if you are looking for a replacement,73,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,1.0,negative,amazon and sprint please get your act together the ad says that the phone will be free after mail-in rebate when purchased with a phone plan i paid amazon the 4999 and submitted the mail-in form for a rebate of 5000 when the rebate was denied i called sprint and they said amazon had given the 5000 rebate at the time of purchase so that the price of the phone is really 4999,74,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001MYLTDA,3.0,neutral,i recently switched from a traditional cell phone to this phone because of the reportedly good web experience it does have a good web expereince but alas i miss having a phone this is a warning to all you phone only users wanting to transcend to a higher plain this might not be the one for you pro fast internet and good browser experience cons weak battery and clumbsy phone interface short story this device is less of a phone and more of a very small computer still bleedingin imho,91,13

Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,4.0,positive,this was a fun book to read the characters were interesting and amusing the story kept me interested all the way to the end the main character was likable although somewhat dense at times the ending would have been disappointing had i not known it was the first book in the series and yes I shall look for the second one to see where it goes,65,6
Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,4.0,positive,who was it the british the americans the iranians or some local took getting all the way to the end took to find out and you are still left with a mystery,32,7

Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,1.0,negative,very uninteresting i never got past the 5th or 6th chapter moved way to slow for me to hang in there,21,9
Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,2.0,negative,writing is convoluted and tourtured main character is sadly forgettable silly plot will not be reading another by this author,20,10

Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,3.0,neutral,this book was just okay it took forever for the intent of the book to finally come out there were some very interesting characters and dry english humor to enjoy but i felt they were wasted a bit in the overall scheme i am considering reading the second book but remain unsure,52,12
Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,2.0,negative,riveting if you enjoy a yawn a page this book gave me a new record for complete boredom thank heaven it does not describe all brits i do not recommend anyone buy it,33,13
Kindle_Store,B005DFEFDU,3.0,neutral,crime in the communitya very strange story some of it believable and some of it totally unbelievable and the ending was a twist too far,28,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,4.0,positive,for the price of the product it definitely fulfills my expectations fits the iphone 4s like a glove and looks nice my only complaint is that similar to other white or grey cases it dirties quicker than other colors overall chivel makes a quality product,45,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,3.0,neutral,arrived very quickly broke about a month into having it but still useable for the price what can you expect,20,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,2.0,negative,it is cheap when i opened it it was already scratched on the buttons yesterday the gray lining started to seperated from the plastic casing-basically it is already falling apart,30,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,4.0,positive,this case is very stylish and i like it a lot however i do not see it providing a lot of protection if you drop the phone it is just for looks that is for sure but I am not very hard on my phones like some people so it works for me the rubber part did start to she had best word i can think of to describe what it is doing after a period of time but i got the case for so cheap I am not too upset about it it just gives me an excuse to get it in a different,100,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,4.0,positive,it is not bad for the amount you pay the only problem i had was the white rubber corners become discolored rather quickly but it is way cheaper than buying the actual apple bumper,32,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,4.0,positive,this particular bumper works great on my iphone 4s the buttons all have the metal aluminum look and feel to them just as the apple version does however from what i can see chivel-made bumpers should have the name on the bumper itself this does not of course this does not take away from the utility of the bumper itself it does however give users the notion that they are indeed receiving a chivel product 4 stars only because the bumper does not seem like a real chivel product other than that it is a great accessory,97,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,3.0,neutral,if you are like me you are considering buying this bumper because of it is low price and appearance both of those factors work in it is favor it looks good out of the box matches my white iphone well and was waaay less than the overpriced bumpers apple sells i also liked how the rubbery part of the surround added a bit of grip to my phone the stock iphone 4/4s is way to slippery in my hands which makes me nervous all the buttons line up well and work fine the rubber around the headphone jack does not work well with all 35 mm connectors but i can live with that unfortunately this bumper just has not held up well over time after about 2 months the rubber surround material started separating from hard plastic core of the bumper additionally the rubbery portion of the surround attracts grime like a magnet and it seems hard to clean so definitely ok given the low price but you also get what you pay for,168,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,3.0,neutral,i likeof the cover but the top bottom has already broke off only had it for a month,20,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,3.0,neutral,it works fine to protect my iphone i recomand it it is a great product good goood good good,20,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,2.0,negative,basically this case is only so-so it is a nice bumper but within about 2 weeks it had cracked and the silicone began to separate from the plastic frame I am not hard on my phone at all and i only got about 4 weeks out of this bumper case it also does not have the proper cut-out on the bottom so you have to actually remove the bumper to charge the phone or plug it into an accessory which probably contributed to the cracking of the plastic my advice spend an extra 10 for a case that will last,96,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,2.0,negative,I have used all-white bumper cases in the past and hated that after just a few weeks the silicone bumperwould turn yellow from handling no amount of cleaning would remove the yellow i hoped that the grayon this case would perform better but sadly it did not within a week it was a dingy yellow-gray and again would not come clean the rigid white plastic sides were still pristine the case did fit my iphone 4s perfectly and all buttons worked well i replaced it over a month ago with the le white and green premium bumper case the new bumper looks and fits the same but the green silicone is still bright and pretty with no yellowing at all i have not had to clean it yet i paid 188 for the le against 699 for this one i recommend the le,145,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,2.0,negative,bumper case looks nice but it breaks easy i only had it for approximately 10 days and the power button came off so there goes my bumper case,28,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,5.0,positive,i picked this case up after reading that it actually fits the 4s model the prior bumper-style case i ordered was from a different company and required some filing for the mute toggle to fit properly and the volume buttons never lined up quite right I am happy to say that this bumper case is a perfect fit for the 4s the volume buttons feel great and the mute toggle works without any modifications needed,74,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,5.0,positive,this one is more than adequate it is a little rough with some mild parting lines but after i ran a nail file across it they were long gone fits a little more snug than the apple bumper and that is a good thing,43,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064GYRFI,5.0,positive,this bumper fits my at t iphone 4s perfectly the buttons work well and look good the bumper also fits over my front and rear protector films this is a high quality product the light graylooks great on my white iphone i tried a white bumper from another supplier but it looked too dirty too soon,57,14

Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,this book is well written if not for the periods instead of commas you kind of have to put in commas where you think there should be some to be able to read this book good plot line although a little editing and it is a great read,47,1
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,a scify that is ok and then great at times it is worth reading but is not outstanding,18,2
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,5.0,positive,yeah it was good and made you want to get the second one which did not live up to the potential of the first volume,27,3
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,the story line is good the characters are not bad the main character is a perverted and drunk version malcom renolds not a bad thing per say not my style other character development is not bad i read the book until the end i did not hate it and i did not love it i am a sci-fi reader and if your looking for action packed what the fuck am i reading then jump on in read the title for what i would compare it too,82,4
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,felt like a conclusion not the start of a series,10,5
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,4.0,positive,good read space zombies and an alien invasion very very gooda very good read almos epic,18,6
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,the story wandered around it did not end on a clear note obviously one of a series but not self contained enough for me,24,7
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,1.0,negative,really bad i can not believe that this books author is over 16 years old or that english is his native language,21,8
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,1.0,negative,hokey hokey hokey sheer commercial content i am sooo tired of zombies vampires and ghouls did not read enough of the description or i would never have bothered author has some ability to make you interested but dumps you into the characters rather than letting them develop with the story and let you discover them,54,9
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,4.0,positive,very good story kinda old west gangster space epic i liked it,12,10
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,2.0,negative,good book a rather weak ending i was disappointed in it as it left you hanging and I am not sure if i want to read more even although it was a pretty good read until then,36,11
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,it is like the scriptwriters for the 1970s battlestar galactica had a hand in this the author needs to learn something anything about outer space at least i have not come upon the impossibly dense asteroid field yet this makes the far from home series seem like super terrific writing I am going to finish reading it just because I have read everything else on my phone,63,12
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,2.0,negative,take a few english composition courses please learn to use more verbs one for every 10th sentence is way too few,21,13
Kindle_Store,B00JPJQR4U,3.0,neutral,quick read not really what i like in sci-fi i prefer much more character development yeah the story was futuristic and space ships and all but developing the details about only a couple of the characters is limiting how involved someone can get into the story the bad guys are a little too obvious and killing off a love interest of a higher profile character even although she qualifies as a bad guy really dampens the enjoyment of the story,80,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,3.0,neutral,case arrived in nice package and on time but a piece of it broke off when trying to put my phone in it also i will probably have to break it even more to get my phone out of it if you can get your phone into it without it breaking i think you will enjoy it until you try to take it out,64,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,5.0,positive,i took a gamble on this case I am a sucker for bamboo related things fortunately the texture of the bamboo was great a satin and smooth finish the colour thankfully was not actually as saturated as the product image indicated it is a dull walnut colour personally that is a good look the bamboo is a little thick as is the felt backing unfortunately there has no felt on the sides so for a first impression the case is really good despite the extra thickness the overall size is very comfortable to hold dimensions roughly could not find a caliper height 127 mm width 635 mm depth 11 mm iphone5 is 76 mm thick,108,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,1.0,negative,total and absolute crap if you drop your phone one time this cover will break as mine did i dropped mine on a soft carpeted floor and the cover broke in half,32,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,1.0,negative,poor quality looks great but if u let it fall it will crack on you i enjoyed this case all of 2 days before i got rid of it,29,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,2.0,negative,nice case but cracked within a week due to design flaws i do not recommend buying it I had read other reviews hoping mine would not crack but it did within 3 days,29,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,3.0,neutral,loved the way this looked and felt even the way it smelled out of the box only complaint is that they do break easily but at the price it is not a huge deal although the second one i purchased was delivered broken but with a case like this wood glue works,51,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,2.0,negative,this case arrived and i was really happy with it at first glance then i realized it was not real wood it was some sort of vaneer i still was not too upset it only cost around 10 but then i dropped my phone not from a large distance either around two feet onto a hardwood floor the whole corner of the case cracked and fell apart then i was really unhappy i suggest buying a more expensive real wood case,79,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,4.0,positive,it is not as durable so if you drop your phone alot this is not the case for you otherwise it looks nice,23,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,5.0,positive,really nice finish did not ship direct to australia hower used a 3rd party like theof wood rather than plastic unfortunately split on first drop right on top corner but should be able to clear fill it,38,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,1.0,negative,i had purchased mine and in a little over 2 weeks it started to fall apart i am not at all rough with my phone so if someone were to carry their phone in a bag I had guess it would not have lasted a week,44,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,1.0,negative,love the natural feel of wood over technology however the picture was deceptive it came unvarnished almost indistinguishable wood grain even after i varnish it myself and is already broken despite the fact that i am very careful with my things do to how thin and super lightweight it was sure would love one that look like the picture and actually withstood normal use like taking it in and out of your purse and putting it onto your desk or bedside to plug-in,82,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,4.0,positive,it is a beautiful case good fit functional i have dropped the phone a couple times and the phone was undamaged the case did it is job one of the drops did result in a half inch chunk of wood coming off the case just above the camera it is the thinnest most fragile part of the case so if it was going to break somewhere it would most likely be there it does not matter the case did it is job i can buy a dozen of them for what it would cost to repair or replace my phone,97,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,4.0,positive,i changed phones so i never put it on my phone my cousin tells me she gets complements whenever she use her phone,23,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009YC0W3K,5.0,positive,i have bought several of the wooden cases and this one is by far the prettiest i dropped it once and it cracked but it did protect my phone so i think it was worth the money you just have to be careful with it,45,14

Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,3.0,neutral,the content seemed very good but it needs an index preferably active to find things i liked the way it read but it is very difficult to find what i am looking for,33,1
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,1.0,negative,i am not seeing too many images at all so they should not be calling this illustrated very very disappointed,20,2
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,1.0,negative,the kindle edition has no visual references as the tittle said just text very disappointed about this ebook kindle edition,20,3
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,2.0,negative,i do not know what the threshold is for a book to be considered illustrated as promoted so prominently in the title of this book but in my personal opinion a mere 21 out of 187 entries around 11 having an illustration falls well short and while we are helpfully shown what the fruit of the orange raspberry and strawberry look like less commonly known plants are left entirely unillustrated,71,4
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,4.0,positive,many herbal remedy books are organized alphabetically by the herb name this book also lists symptoms and suggests remedies easier to find what i want to know in a particular case,31,5
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,5.0,positive,this book is filled with alternative solutions to traditional medicine it is well written and filled with information i rcommend this book to all that have an interest in non-traditional healing,31,6
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,4.0,positive,a good read history of each herb is very good and thorough a good book for someone trying to learn herbalism from the ground up easy to understand and not too clinical in nature,34,7
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,1.0,negative,on my kindle fire there are very few illustrations the information seems to be thorough but not helpful to me without the pictures to identify the herb not even worth saving in the cloud,34,8
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,3.0,neutral,would be excellent does not spread nicely on 7 tablet and a bit hard to navigate book as a such is more than just nice you can see the effort put into making if mary wants us readers to supply some photos from our gardens free of charge i am in just to make it look better,57,9
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,5.0,positive,i have not read the entire book but overall it is very informative and helped me find what i needed with no problem,22,10
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,4.0,positive,this is a great informitive book but honestly it deals more with the plants and herbs found in europe it is not as illistrated as i had hoped it would be i was looking for something for the beginner herbalist and this is certainly not it for instance if you do not know what mallows is you will not learn it here it has a very nice description of the flower but it could describe one of a million flowers i gave it a four star rating for the information of what each plant is used for would really like to see a picture of each plant although,107,11
Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,5.0,positive,this is an excellent book very complete i have often thought that the pharmaceutical industry and the fda are completely against this but certainly herbs are much cheaper to get than the traditional drugs yes there is skepticism but i have administered many drugs and am now old enough that i have to take some the herbs have it and herbs are a lot more fun as soon as i get a chance i will grow them in my glass house,81,12

Kindle_Store,B006ZDPPBA,3.0,neutral,it is a great book for a certain niche but for not the general public the language is archaic and many of the terms are medical descriptions for ailments that are called different things now i found a thesaurus and dictionary being close by as a necessity,46,14
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,4.0,positive,this is truly a good hea i liked that it had just enough angst to make it believable and the ow vile the story line is about those who have money and how the parents decide who they will marry it is about two people who grew up around each other not run in the same crowd the parents work together and want the company to stay with in the families this is a sweet story of what happens when there is a spark there i look forward to other work by this author,93,0
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,1.0,negative,so trite and unimaginatively written i kept skimming faster and faster hoping there would be something worth slowing down for but in the end i really could not have cared less,30,1
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,4.0,positive,i was totally into this story i could not put it down i loved the characters except for that snake in the grass ruby laughing out loud very enjoyable,26,2

Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,1.0,negative,this was just so bad brad had no personality he was not one dimensional he had no dimensions michele never expressed her feelings and did nothing but internally freak out and/or cry the misunderstanding between them about ruby was laughable so trite and drawn out that you can not believe the author even went there lastly stop writing about wealthy people if you no nothing about how they live they got married in a hall a one carat diamond had michele gobsmacked,80,5
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,4.0,positive,i liked the main characters and the story micheles and brads families have been friends for decades their parents want them to marry and find a way to force them to comply of course being a love story they do fall in love the only issue i had was with brad wondering why he was so willing to be away from his bride so often for such lenghths of time not sure most women would have hung in there as long as michele did when brad finally figured a few things out,91,6
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,1.0,negative,marriage of convenience stories are usually a tad predictable but this one was just awful the heroine is a moron and the hero is an ass one decent conversation and the whole issue that plagued them would be over but no we have to perpetuate the stereotype of the weak crying female she can own a business but can not muster up the courage to tell her husband about his who are of an assistant get a pair lady,76,7
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,3.0,neutral,it was a quick read but the characters were one-dimensional the dialogue flat and trite and the storyline both predictable while being pretty ridiculous I am glad it was free,29,8

Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,2.0,negative,the couple has almost no dynamic throughout the book the guy is an ass that the author tries to portray as oblivious but comes off as stupid uncaring and down right cruel to allow what goes on the heroin [ ] is a complete patsy should not have read it through it never got better,52,13
Kindle_Store,B00FUUDP1G,1.0,negative,i chose this rating because there was not a zero i agree with the other 1 star ratings wish i would have read them and saved my time i read less than 1/4 before i skipped to the end to see if it got better it did not do nt waste your money even if it is free it is still a waste of time,61,14

Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,4.0,positive,quirky short story intended to be a teaser for me myself why works well as that i know find myself looking to read the longer novel to discover exactly what this quirky heroine is about,35,5
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,3.0,neutral,i thoroughly enjoyed me myself and why so thought this short little prequel would be a fun entertaining read well it is definitely short and it was free so i guess i can not complain i actually did chuckle a little i mean a guy at a speed dating event talking about his experience with a woman with multiple personalities should be funny right but it was just way too short and rushed to really amount to anything plus even although it was super short and published by a big-name publisher it still contained spelling and grammatical errors overall okay for a free quick read but do not feel you need to rush it to the top of your to-be-read pile,119,6
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,1.0,negative,i am so thankful i now take the time to read reviews before i purchase this was a freebie i got when i first got my kindle if i could taste less than 1 start i would this prequel which should not say it has 300 pages did not make me want to buy the actual book i did not find it funny the way it was written was quite confusing you have no clue what going on at first and then it ends very abruptly extremely unsatisfying i do not recommend,91,7
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,5.0,positive,very funny i have got to read the series to find out what happens next definitely shows maryjanice davidsons quirky humor,21,8
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,4.0,positive,the starts out with a flashback of clive telling his story about what happened to his face after almost running over a cat and meeting a crazy blonde girl the girl he met obiviously has two different pesornalities hince the name of the book i can understand how it could frustrate others especially the way the crazy blonde talks throughout the chapter but i love it and can not wait to read the book,73,9
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,1.0,negative,i do not know what i just read maybe i should have read me myself and why before reading this one,20,10
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,4.0,positive,humor humor humor humor humor ah did i mention humor one of funniest stories i have had the pleasure to read if it had been 500 pages longer i would have given it five stars,31,11
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,1.0,negative,glad it was free i will not be buying the book the female character was too far out there mentally and the male plumber needs his head examined he should have run as fast as he could to get away from her screw helping her get the cat out of the tree,52,12
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,4.0,positive,i would not recommend anyone read this first even although it is a bit of a prequel you need to already understand the characters for it to make sense there are no great revelations it is just a bit of fun not necessary just a quick flashback for fun,49,13
Kindle_Store,B00403MNZ8,5.0,positive,awesome read from one of my fav authors on this sneak peek can not wait to read the full story when i order it,23,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,4.0,positive,before this phone i had only lg the latest being the vx6000 to put simply i was blown away by the capabilities included with the phone and the opportunity to do much more data plan is kind of needed to take full advantage of ev-do network and push e-mail but verizons got to take the price down so most people can afford also the larger battery is a must for serious users especially if your using the data network and anyone creating lots of movies and pictures or downloading content into the phone should consider a minisd card I am on my second one 1st had an irreparable software glitch and very pleased despite the lack of wi-fi but imagine the battery life then,123,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,3.0,neutral,the moto q looks beautiful and is overall a great concept i am a heavy phone and light pda user i do actually use the pics and videos as well as texting email and scheduling features a lot while all of these things are good in general in classic microsoft fashion the software has issues glitches crashes and instability my phone is a bit too slow and easily confused when moving from one screen to the next the internet surfing is amusing at best completely useless at worst have you tried customizing the ringtones yet why does it just beep or vibrate about every 30 - 45 minutes why can not i make it stop if you do not mind huge lies about battery life and slight underperformance as a pseudo-pda then it is a good phone with a few additional capabilities i do like it and knew what i was getting into when buying any kind of 1st generation gadget heres a tip to all engineers who design a device give it to real people to use in the real world and listen to what really works just ask the makers of the palm or lg,193,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,4.0,positive,phone quality is tinny by that i mean choppy weak with the reccomended bluetooth it is even worse speakerphone is not as clear as i expected it to be mp3 and streaming quality not at all as good as the tmobile sda which is overall worse than the q the batter life is not great every time you shut a program you have to go to task manager and stop the application from taking up ram weird,77,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,1.0,negative,if you get this phone plan on using all of your minutes on the phone with microsoft trying to install active sync it has very stringent requirements none of which are mentioned on the site when you purchase the unit i still can not get it to work why motorola would have hitched their cart to microsofts spur is beyond me if you just want a really expensive unusually large phone that pretends to maintain your task calendar and contact data without actually doing so then this is phone is perfect [ ],91,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,3.0,neutral,at first i really liked the q i was using the treo 700w because of it is compatibility with corporate outlook and the q has that same compatibility but in sleek slim package but then the battery problem became painfully apparent it would not even last a whole work day with around 90 minutes of phone calls and auto synch set for 15 minutes so i trotted down to verizon to get the extended battery this worked but now the phone was so bulky that i was better off with the treo so i returned the q and reactived the 700w which is not great on battery life but far better than the q i would keep the q were it not for the battery life issue it is less fully functional but i think overall a better package than the 700w if you only need to have it check your e-mail every few hours and you do not make many phone calls this is a great choice but until the battery issue is sorted it is hopeless,177,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,4.0,positive,I have had my phone for almost a year now so far it is been awesome the pros i live in new york city so the reception and sound quality are really good verizon seems to have the best service out here good windows functionality it is not slow and boot time is quick not too expensive synching is so easy it is pretty tiny packs a lot of punch,69,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,4.0,positive,i use it more for business than personal use here are my findings 1 syncs with outlook i keep all my contacts and schedule on my q sometimes the sync conncetion does not work although puzzling update now that i am running windows vista it syncs flawlessly every time 2 great screen not as big as a pda screen but big enough and the quality / clarity is top shelf easy controls mean you dont need a touch screen 3 great sound superior as a hands-free speaker phone or for playing music headphones are still better but this speaker is nice when you need it 4 lots of accessories i have a leather case 2 gb sd card and bluetooth headset that just scratches the surface also bought the hi-capacity battery 5 email supports pop and gmail from my experience 6 battery life not so good with standard battery needs a charge daily keep a wall charger and car charger nearby to ensure you can juice it up when it is low 7 expansion options / versatility can be used as a gps device with upgrade not too expensive either can be used with a slingbox to watch tv nice,199,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,5.0,positive,first smartphone I am addicted had it a few weeks now and it has never crashed or even had a hiccup there are a few very minor things i do not like but those are problems with the microsoft os not motorola my understanding is that there is a software update coming to solve most of my gripes but like another reviewer said i use it all the time it looks fantastic and the screen is amazing,76,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,3.0,neutral,so i am currently on my 2nd q happily working my way to the 3rd since i brought the phone in august i have had problem after problem 1 the battery power sucks if i talk on the phone for more than 1 hour the battery power dies to 1 bar 2 because i have my emailed account synced to the phone my battery dies even faster there are days when i have charged the phone all night and by mid-day the battery is either dead or has one bar left 3 this one is weird there are times when the phone shuts on and off by itself i know it is not me because i keep the phone locked so i will not accidentally call anyone again once it cuts off and back on i am again down to one battery bar the reception on the phone is okay and i do not experience as many dropped calls as i did with t-mobile however the stress of the battery life is what makes me what to just get a new phone,179,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,1.0,negative,just a short note to say that if you use aol and/or act 2006 contact management software stick with the communication devices you have do not buy the motorola q aol email is not coompatable with the q and neither is act 2006 you can not download any database this took me hours on the phone with india discussing this with verizon aol and sage the present owner of the act software the problem is being worked on but the only advice i got from any of them was just check back on our website occaisionally and we will post when the problem is solved i think maybe i should change to another phone company ya think very frustrating as i spent hours on trying to like this phone very frustrating,126,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,1.0,negative,i bought the q because of the poor phone reception of the treo 650 i had the reception was a little better on the q but still not as good as a stand alone phone after a month the q slipped out of my hands and the glass cracked when it landed i sent it in for repairs and was told it could not be fixed i have now opted for a data card and a mot razr now i finally have a phone that will work at my house and the data card is a much better way for me to handle emails it gives me portability and i only have to handle the emails once,116,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,2.0,negative,motorola q sucks if you are a serious user of cell phone then do not buy this the phone is not good that is the reason verizon has brought down the price from 199 to 79 reasons why you should not buy this i get the standby time of only 10 hours and talk time for just 2 hours where as verizon claims that this phone has the stand by time of 212 hours and talk time for 7 hours but that is not true remember a situation like sep 11 or blackout day if anything like this happens then this phone will not help you for any reason,108,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,4.0,positive,i have had my q for about 2 weeks now i love it i use it for receiving my e-mails which was as easy to setup as any other e-mail in outlook i used it as a modem simple the phone is fun i use the internet too the voice recognition is also neat i can say numbers and it translates pretty good with my old phone i had to record the name and it would search for that name when using voice recognition the q actually translates to the number or searches the contact list without having to record anything the only thing that is not that great is that it deletes the e-mails after a week or so i would like a touch screen but i do not miss it the heard the treo 700w touch screen is not that great anyhow that was the other phone i considered i love it,151,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,2.0,negative,i sent for my second replacement nearly everyone on the other end says they hear an echo or just terrible sound quality from my end what a waste of time had internet but a waste of time at 40 per month from verizon all other features are mostly ok will not work on my mac and the one time i tried to download games or do updates on the pc it did not work,72,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000FYU4SO,1.0,negative,this phone looks good on paper in person and in my pocket but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a treo first everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything the treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized and more importantly has a touch screen with the touch screen i can click on links buttons and more even with my finger which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad finally the qs battery life was terrible i thought i received a defective unit so i had it exchanged the second unit was just as awful finally the qs keyboard looks better and is bigger but is harder to use the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow sometimes keypresses do not register while windows mobile is trying to catch up or something i wanted to like the q but came away utterly disappointed,163,14
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,1.0,negative,confusing incomplete although i like all the things about the amish community and life this storytelling way did not make sense,20,0
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,5.0,positive,i read all nine volumes and wished there was some more to read it was a real good series to read i really enjoyed them any one that like amish books would enjoy reading it i had a hard time putting my kindle down after i started reading it,49,1
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,1.0,negative,i wonder if anyone edited this book before publishing it there were so many mistakes i lost count this was a waste of time and money and the story line walsall over the place i do not recommend this book or this series,43,2
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,5.0,positive,i absolutely loved these books i just relax so much when i read my amish books they are a true blessing from god to me when i read each and every one of them i could gush on and on but i will not this review is for each and every one of them,53,3
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,3.0,neutral,i have read all of these this last one was difficult because of the many typos need better proofreading several times i had trouble following because of wrong words,29,4
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,2.0,negative,i am so angry with myself for wasting my time and money on these volumes i just like to finish a book once I have started it whether or not i like it the spelling errors and the grammatical mistakes were just inexcusable and only made the confusing and ridiculous plot more unbelievable and uninteresting i even reread some portions trying to mark some sense of the story just made me dizzy i could never recommend any of these volumes to anyoner,81,5
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,1.0,negative,i am sorry but this was not done very well the author kept getting names mixed up and each new volumes chapters were repeated over and over know that i will never purchase a sicily yoder book ever again,39,6
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,4.0,positive,i really like the book wish they put all the volume together instead of separate book like the way it ended with everybody together and knowing the truth,28,7
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,5.0,positive,great series great story i loved it so much going on with the family very well written and is last of the series,23,8
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,2.0,negative,the first book if you can call it that held promise but it went downhill from there the repetitive nature from one book to another felt like a recap of what you just read the typos i can excuse but the wrong character names in several scenarios left you baffled and rereading until you figured out whose name should have been written the overall impression i got was it had potential but ultimately i felt let down by the unrealistic scenarios and jumbled storyline,83,9
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,4.0,positive,it was a very good story it kept you wondering what was next sicily yoder is a very good writer of amish stories,23,10
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,5.0,positive,i enjoyed the complete set very good read,8,11
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed the series but i prefer to read an entire novel instead of several short books i think more time should be devoted to proof reading and not depend on auto correct,33,12
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,5.0,positive,first i recommend that you read this series within close proximity of time it had been some time since i read volumes 1 - 7 and as a result i had to review in order to remember the storyline as usual ms yoder kept my attention i look forward to future sub-plot spin-off series,52,13
Kindle_Store,B00ECN4PWA,2.0,negative,is no way to end a story there was no wedding you have led me although 9 books and the end is no where close,25,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,5.0,positive,i love these i do not want to get into some audiophile debate with other folks here but i think these are the best bluetooth headphones i have tried the sound quality is good for both music or conference calls the battery life has been great and i can go a week of average use my average use without having to recharge i think they are great I had buy again without hesitation,71,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,works great but feel very cheap love the ability to quickly adjust the volume mute and more i have having the integrated batteries although what happens when the batteries are no good this unit becomes disposable,32,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,the sound is great the battery is pretty good too no problem with the bluetooth comunication in general is a very good product but the headset shape does not fit properly with the head and there is not option to set them up to make them fit i mean the problem is that they do not press your ears so it feels like if you have two little speakers hanging in your head so everyone can hear what you are listening and you can not listen good because they are far of your head it is unfortunate because the headset is great without that detail,105,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,5.0,positive,i have been using this bluetooth since the moment i got it my home and so far it is been awesome,20,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,i mainly use these with my phone at work to listen to music but i have also used them for making calls just so i do not have to hold the phone or put it on speaker phone people on the other end do say it sounds a little more distant than just talking directly into the phone and I am not entirely sure where the mic s are to pick up my voice but other than that they work well and the sound quality is good it is nice how they fold up to store them without much space and connecting it to my phone for the first time was very easy so i had no issues using them or figuring things out they do kind of fall off my head if i look down rather easy sometimes since they are not super snug i have a small head although i like how they look and feel and have no real complaints other than what others have said about not being able to hear me as well on the other end of the line although,182,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,wish they did not crap out on me because i loved these headphones crying shame,14,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,it is a phone with a very nice sound however constantly a momentary mute split-second thing but very unpleasant occurs while listening music,23,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,i expected this stuff get a better microphone i work in a site with a lot of noise and did not improvement the quality of the voice,26,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,it is not upto the mark and it is not with for the price,14,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,about 8 months after i bought these the hinge on the on / off side stopped sticking into on position so when grabbing them off the desk to take an incoming phone call it would unhinge turn off and disconnect by the time i realize it is happened turn on reconnect to the phone missed call good electronics sound quality voice qualitybut brought down by cheap plastic construction,66,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,i bought this as it was one of the only bluetooth headphones with multi-point support it started to stutter updated the firmware stuttered again reset the headphones after a month later it is still not reliable i guess i will have to lower my expectations for wanting multi-point support however i will likely buy something better and while wired headphones is obviously better i wanted wireless as i sometimes get the wire caught against something especially when walking my two dogs,81,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,good price sometimes difficult to lock on the extender position the ear covers get a lot of stuff on them and one of them is loose already with limited use,30,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,like other reviewers i discovered it is not reliable with my macbook pro sometimes it works sometimes it sounds like a tin can and often it clicks and goes dead it also will not connect to my htc telephone surprisingly it works wonderfully with my ipad but sadly that was not my intended use for the headset it looks good and is comfortable however the black felt-like fabric picks up hair and dust and after a short time on my head it resembled my dogs bed,85,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,i like it so much that i gave it my brother so he could enjoy the product too just thinking of getting another pair,24,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,1.0,negative,they never did work and i can not figure out how the buttons work this is supposed to be blue tooth but it was never coordinated with my system so i bought the audio technica quiet points and they are outstanding a lot less the price i am very dissatisfied with this job but due to the hassle of sending anything back i am just going to eat the loss it is sad because i wanted to use this for one of my clients who is disabled using the bluetooth mechanism this set and maybe it was just mine was completely worthless,100,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,1.0,negative,i bought it because tower is located for marginal signal and it is not of much use it may be the wrong unit for my hot spot 570e6d8a but i ordered according to info provided,35,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,2.0,negative,i plugged this into 3 different devices and it made absolutely no difference in signal strength or speed goodbut it just does not work,25,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,3.0,neutral,i had problems with the connections i have to use tape to hold the plug into the unit because the plug contentiously falls out the antenna did boost my reception by one bar in most areas,36,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,2.0,negative,i received a used product dirty helped very little in reception after spending part of a day installing the thing,20,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,4.0,positive,I have had the external antenna for about a month now and it works great i use it in my office where i have very poor reception and usually only 3 g i placed the antenna right next to my office window and now i always get 4 g reception as mentioned in other reviews the only drawback is that the plug does not want to stay in place as long as i place the mifi in an area where it will not get bumped the plug stays connected and the reception is very good,90,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,5.0,positive,i really did not expect much from this antenna but it pleasantly has surprised me it definately does improve my reception with my verizon mifi 4510l hot spot,28,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,5.0,positive,this product is the top of the line if you want the best then this is the one,21,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,3.0,neutral,tried this product often this past year while traveling only occasionally did i notice an increase in signal sometimes it actually decreased,22,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,3.0,neutral,i gained 1 bar was hoping for more it is the hills around us even although i can see a verizon tower just 2 miles away this is what we get when we do not live in town,37,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,1.0,negative,I have tried many times but plugging this in makes absolutely no difference on the reception of my mi-fi do not recommend,21,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,4.0,positive,i live in a rural area and sometimes when i am using the internet to play online it start to lag the connection was unstable but with this little antenna the connection is more stable and a little faster the internet was already fast but it was unstable it has a magnetic base and that helps to position it the price is also good,64,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,1.0,negative,bought this and it took over a week to get to me 5 days just to ship hooked it up and had no change at all 1 bar before and 1 bar after do not waste your time and money,39,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,5.0,positive,traveled to hawaii and the mountains of north carolina for three weeks recently i have an at t iphone and a verizon mifi this antenna allowed me to stay connected with the mifi when at t stopped working at times the mifi was the only way to make a skype call also in areas with a fair signal it boosted the mifi from evdo to 4 g lte speeds highly recommended for anyone who wants a portable antenna,75,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,1.0,negative,i get 2 bars where i live i plugged in the antenna and still get 2 bars i wave the antenna around and nothing happens i do not think it is having any effect whatsoever no instructions were included so I am not sure if I am supposed configure something on the mifi card I am probably going to return it,56,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SKO09S,2.0,negative,i tried it and it did not improve my life by making my computer more reliable so i returned it and they gave me my back,27,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,5.0,positive,i got this phone because my i was i need of a new one and i wanted a touch the phone it is self is great and looked cool andhowever this phone is a smart phone so you will need data to put in to use,47,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,5.0,positive,you can not go wrong with any samsung product the cell phone is no exception it is easy to setup and on the sprint network in minutes,26,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,3.0,neutral,i ordered this phone on amazon through just cellular i ordered the new phone but it did not come in it is original box it does not look brand new it did not come with the manual book for the phone and it did not come with it is original phone charger the charger is different and only about 2 feet long very short compared to normal chargers it is the cheap charger that they have for sell for 5 so i guess they take the nice one out of the box from your new phone and give you the cheap crappy charger so they can sell the other one for a better price not sure it did ship on the 4th of the 3 to 5 day business shipping days so that was good so far the phone is working well but if i need another phone i will not be ordering it through just cellular and i would advise others not to as well,163,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,4.0,positive,as far as phones go it is pretty nice easy to use however buyer beware it is considered a smartphone and requires a data package not just a texting one the sprint people at first told my daughter it did not but they changed my plan to data so upon deeper investigation i found out that it was in fact a smartphone so as far as phones go it is a great buy for the money but only if you want a full data package,85,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,4.0,positive,good phone everything was as expected-new excellent condition-no issues-great phone for the price call text email and watch espn on it,21,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZGH062,2.0,negative,got this for my father who needed a replacement phone for work and this is one that he can not wait to get rid of the slide screen is frustrating because you have to slide to answer but you miss more calls then receive them because it is so hard to slide you swipe your finger till you want to throw the dang thing other then that the screens are weird and not like any that I have ever had most screens are at least similar in their settings but this one was not,92,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,5.0,positive,the product is good as shown however i have a problem with the contract extension when i bought product from amazon amazon indicated if i had an existing contract with at t which i had i only had to extend by 6 months at t retracted on this position and stated i had to extend with a new contract for 2 years I am still trying to resolve,65,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,2.0,negative,i purchased this phone from at t in august the music player did not work correctly and frequently froze the phone with a playback error only fix was to remove the battery and reboot at t was very good about replacing the phone but the 2nd and 3rd phones i received had the same problem i discussed with lg and they were no help at all at t was very good and replaced it with the lg xenon this is a far superior phone the mp3 playback is awesome and it actually works do not waste your time or money with the cf360 buy the lg xenon instead the cell phone quality is amazing and the slide out keypad is good for email and texting if you are into that i just wanted a good cell phone with a good mp3 player and the xenon is outstanding in that regard,147,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,2.0,negative,i purchased the lg cu920 and loved it originally the keys became unresponsive and the phone impossible to use after a few months i could accept calls but do little else att warranty services was very helpful and shipped me a replacement phone all replacement phones are refurbs so within four weeks my touchscreen was once again unresponsive when i attempt to make a call and push the phone icon it connects to mobile tv needless to say not very helpful it will temporarily work correctly for a few minutes after removing the battery and powering back on however i do not feel compelled to remove my battery and restart my phone every minute so i am waiting on my third phone in this model the phone is gem when the touchscreen is working i prefer it to the iphone thanks to the ability to send and receive picture and video messages directly the qwerty keyboard makes texting far easier however given the fact that i have had 2 replacements in less than 9 months i do not feel that these phones are very sturdy or reliable long-term once again att warranty services was very helpful if you need them call 1 - 800 - 801 - 1101,200,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,4.0,positive,this phone is for people who hardly tex it is great for taking pictures and making and taking calls the pictures come out great and it is very easy to use just be carefull using some of the features like gamesthey charge you for everything almost and if your going to buy this phone beware of the hidden cost like 20bucks for texing and roadside assistence and voicedial i think these people get a commision by putting these charges on without you knowing it so ask before they start ringing up your bill,83,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,1.0,negative,my wife and i chose these phones after looking at the cnet review and because they were basically free with a new 2yr att contract i purchased 2 2 gb micro sd cards to extend the memory when i put the card in my phone it would freeze up after a few minutes i tried both cards with the same result my wifes phone worked fine with it so i called att and got a replacement it worked fine for about 2 weeks now it is doing the same thing my wifes phone is still working fine so there are 2 things going on here lg is making an inferior product and I am losing the phone lottery maybe the 3rd phone will work,121,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,1.0,negative,first off i do not understand these reviews they must of used the phone to 3 hours then reviewed it this is not a substitute for the iphone this is far from it if you want an iphone get one or get the droid this phone has little to no apps and they require subscriptions you can not just swipe your finger up or down to scroll you actually have to keep your finger on the scrollbar my brother has had this phone replaced 2 times you can not customize the menu order or the homescreen icons my brother does not want the data pack and does not want the tv but when he tries to hit the menu button the tv app starts and at t starts charging at ts solution block data but then you can not have pic messaging,134,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,3.0,neutral,i use to have a blackjack phone and i wanted to try something different i like the lg vu expect the fact that i have to turn it off everyday so my internet service will work also this phone is not that good for text messaging i like the black jack way better but know i have a contract so i am stuck,63,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,4.0,positive,this is a good phone and the only one on the market currently with dual sliding keyboards i owned a nokia 6800 and once you own a phone with a qwerty keyboard you never go back i purchased the pantech matrix pro for the dual sliding keyboard feature and because it is a world phone with tri-band 3 g and quad-band connectivity usuable in many countries the down sides with this phone are 1 it is heavy because of the dual keyboard design 2 screen rotation is slow compared to the lightning fast response of the nokia 6800 3 texting is slower compared to the nokia 6800 the cadillac of keyboards because of the small keyboard design and limited symbols 4 very poor battery life i have to recharge every other day with little texting and few calls it does take a bit to familiarize yourself with how to navigate smoothly in and out of screens and there are many applications / features the user may or may not need but all in all a good phone,172,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,4.0,positive,let me start by saying i no longer have this phone the phone itself is very cute not bulky as many have said and is a keeper i liked the shininess of the phone it came with a velvet case / cleaner which i thought was a nice touch i love windows mobile 61 this is a great operating system and worked well for what i needed the only problem i had w the phone was the size of the displayand all the games on the phone are demos not a favorite of this prior to using this phone i had the htc tilt loved that phone and the display was much much bigger when they decide to expand the display i will consider purchasing again so for anyone considering purchasing the matrix pro know that it is a great phone and worth the money,142,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,4.0,positive,that is what you get when you purchase t-mobile dash black i love the phone but come on the phone comes with the same wallpaper and games yawn nothing has really changed ps owner of both dash phones,37,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,5.0,positive,the phone is great with a lot of features the amazon people were great at answering my questions shipping was fast and free and activation with at t was easy with what amazon provided the price here is 50 less than getting it locally and amazon had it in stock not back ordered as everyone around here had,57,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,3.0,neutral,overall my wife and i have both enjoyed our cf360 phones i agree with the prior review that the battery life is far too short but we have not had a need yet to have the phone be away from a charger for longer than a couple days i would expect that the phone could run without plugging it in for 4 - 5 days with limited usage but just with a small amount of talking 1 15 hours of talking I have easily taken it down to 2 out of 3 bars the screen is bright and this is the first slider phone we have owned so we actually like that the number pad is a bit difficult to handle small and crowded and this phone would not be very well suited to someone who wants to text a lot the call quality is good the phone gets a good signal if you hold it right the antenna is in close to the mouth-piece and the speakerphone works well overall this is an ok phone for a free phone,175,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,5.0,positive,i received this phone 2 days ago from at t and am really impressed with it great reception great call quality and great battery life what more could you ask for it is small and light but still easy to press the numbers on the slider also it has a nice non-slip feel to it the phone connected right up to my jawbone bluetooth headset with no problems I am very happy with this purchase,72,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,4.0,positive,I have had this phone for about a week so i have not fully evaluated it yet I am currently buying the micro usb cable and memory card so i can transfer ringtones note do not let at t sucker you into getting their micro usb cable for this phone any usb 20 cable a male to micro b male cable should work this phone replace a motorola razr,64,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001PKTRVM,5.0,positive,I have had this phone for over a year now and i have had zero problems with it which i think is pretty rare I have had many other phones all which become pretty crappy after a while even with good care this phone is easy to use nice to look at and very durable I have taken pretty good care of it with a screen protector and a case for the outside and i have not had any problems with the screen being unresponsive or any of the hard keys either i think if you take good care of the phone and do not seriously scratch up the screen you will avoid these problems worked for me anyway i love my phone and I had definitely recommend it especially at such a low price right now 01 it is definitely worth it i paid about 100 for mine plus activation and i still think it was worth it,151,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,4.0,positive,there are some lines showing after application it does not really bother me but i can imagine it would drive others crazy there are no bubbles just some weird looking lines probably scratches on the outside of the plastic from attempting to apply with a credit card thankfully i have 4 more tries,52,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,3.0,neutral,is not that efficient when talking talking about bubbles we hope it goes better in time however 3 stars for the price,22,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,1.0,negative,it is the classic clear transfer paper with the shape of the screen when putting it on the screen leaves a lot of bubbles bad quality product,26,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,2.0,negative,these would have been fine but the second little eye that is the sensor for when the phone is close to your face is not cut out in this cover,30,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,1.0,negative,i order it because of the model of the phone and it is way too small it sucks i really would like to give it back but it does not even worth that just hope nobody else make the same mistake,39,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,5.0,positive,product is in excellent conditions and new as advertised it is good for protecting your screen and without bubbles of air on your cell,24,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,2.0,negative,the product is the worst kind of screen protector i have ever seen or used in my life would not recommend it for my worst enemy the protector does not fit the screen and it has a kinda adhesive u have to use as whatever to stick it to the screen do not like it at all,54,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,2.0,negative,la calidad del producto es muy baja luego de colocarlo con solo frotarlo con un pedazo de tela se rayo en la colocaci n es muy dif cil de evitar no dejar burbujas y aun luego de colocarlo aparecen varias mas,39,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,5.0,positive,my wife is happy with them works ok fits the phone and does the job not a whole lot more to add,22,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,4.0,positive,fits okay but a bit difficult to remove bubbles it is my first try at this so do not get me wrong,22,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,3.0,neutral,it scratches just by installing it lot of bubbles but that is something you can fix easely but i think i will have to change it often because it scratches really bad at least is a 5 pack,38,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,1.0,negative,these pieces of crap do not even stay on the phone for more than 48 hours once your phone gets used for a little while you can see it start lifting and bubbling disappointed,34,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,2.0,negative,cheap plastic protective film and it is impossible to stick it to the phone without bubbles what else i can say,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,5.0,positive,so necessary for protect the screen of your sony xperia p and keep it always like new i recommend it totally,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00853OGS6,1.0,negative,this cover is not clear does not come with instructions and especially does not fit the phone it claims to fit in the image you will not get what you see in the picture i recommend you not get this,37,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,2.0,negative,this is a really helpful little device for as long as it works my first one failed after just a few weeks i sent a note to the company but they never responded i liked the unit so much i just bought another one good product i hope it stays food because I have sure not been impressed with their customer service if i found a similar product elsewhere I had sure buy it there,74,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,4.0,positive,this unit acts as shown i use it for ear buds medium size but be sure to get the plug a little longer than the earbud end so the buds do not come off every time you pull them out,39,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,4.0,positive,wish it could stop randomly when pulling the cord out but it has to be pulled out all the way,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,2.0,negative,it was hard to recoil my charger cord probably because it was too thick and not pliable enough,18,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,1.0,negative,this is a great concept but build quality holds it back i got this for my daughter so she would stop losing her earbuds and after only two days of use the recoil-action stopped working extremely disappointed and I am unwilling to give them a second chance,45,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,2.0,negative,i bought it for a very thin shaver cord about the width of a telephone cord i have to find it to pull the cable out i have to find it to retract the cable,35,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,5.0,positive,as described on time delivery no problems at all,10,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,5.0,positive,this is a really good invention a great way to keep your charger cords neat and organized,17,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,2.0,negative,sadly i have to give this review 2 stars i really wanted to like this product but it does literally what it says winds your cord it does not stop part way through the wind i bought two of these and neither one will stop mid-wind if you want more than just a little nub of your cord to stick out you pretty much have to unwind it all the way i guess technically the description does not say that it can stop mid-wind but come on would not that just be expected why would anybody think that non-adjustable winding would be a good thing the winding action is very strong maybe a little too strong weaker cords would require a lot of stress on the cord to unwind bottom line make this product stop mid-wind and you have a winner,140,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,4.0,positive,not the easiest thing to work but i guess it does it is job,13,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,1.0,negative,i ordered two of these one of each size for my charger chord and my ear buds to me they are unusable the tension can not be adjusted so they suck in the entire chord they are also very bulky so i can not carry my ear buds in my pocket the main reason i purchased them,55,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,5.0,positive,i had purchased the set a while back and liked them soo much i purchased sets to give to family members for christmas year before last when i needed more i made my current purchase of three medium cord winders i like how they roll up to storage compactly and then when i need to use the earbuds i can unwind them and the earbuds are not tangled up,69,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,5.0,positive,these were the best things i have purchased to store all the cords you have these days i even bought some for my daughters i can drop them in my purse when i travel no more tangled cords to deal with,41,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,4.0,positive,great concept and product with a few quirks it does require a specific technique that you will get the hang of after a few tries i thought it was defective at first but it must be done exactly as shown in the instructions it did split at the top after a few months of rigorous daily use but i was very rough with it great product for the price this device definitely reduces hassle and aggravation in my life because it keeps my headphones organized and easily accessible in my briefcase,91,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CY0MAJ8,3.0,neutral,although wonderfully designed i have found the recoil mechanism problematic to the point where i had to throw one away i still have 3 that are working,27,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,if you are expecting a full review on the h12 sorry but i did not get that far amazon shipped me what was clearly a used returned and broken headset which does not seem to fit with my preconceived and up until now i thought widely understood notion of what new means in future I shall be more aware that bulk may mean previously returned and that as a consequence that it may be more likely to be doa you already knew from the bulk packaging that this is not the stuff that gifts are made of now you know that bulk may mean extra hassle if it needs to be returned ok you live and learn on the flip side the h12 return process was simple prepaid label in your inbox ok so it is was a hassle but amazon is still a great firm to shop with so I shall be back motorola h12 bluetooth headset silver [ bulk packaging ],159,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,4.0,positive,this is my second h12 headset the first one started developing bad audio problems after about a year and a half this is the best headset I have had although I have only had 3 or 4 others and they all have been motorola good battery life excellent clarity and ease of use are the best features,55,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,2.0,negative,thought this was a good deal but unfortunately the audio was dead on arrival it powered up and connected to my cell with no problems but not a single sounds would come out of the ear piece i was dissappointed but amazon made it very easy to return and even refunded my return shipping hassle free i will think twice about these oem purchases in the future,67,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,4.0,positive,hey let me just say that if your looking into buying a bluetooth for yourself just make sure you do your homework first i did mine and it turned out for the better because this headset was perfect and i love amazon because it was a whole lot cheaper on here and i love the sales the stylish design is really cool and if your background music is at a medium level it will cancel it out but let me make sure you know what noise canceling does it makes it so when you talk on your bluetooth ex in your car and the music is playing not too loud it will cancel out the music and let the person on the other end hear you clearly one thing to know although it hears everything in the background if you stay silent other than that i turn my radio down anyway while talking using the bluetooth and it is done me good so far one more thing before i go it comes with two chargers and a usb cable a desktop charger and a case to charger so as i said it is good and i reccomend it to anyone,198,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,1.0,negative,i had purchase lots of items and this is the first time got this product from amazon that is not in original packet do not know why they send me in an opening box seem it is already used by other but i call customer service and i return this to amazon,51,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,1.0,negative,I am so disappointed with amazon regarding this purchase at the time i purchased this as new and received it in a plastic bag no box since i had bought this as a gift i was too embarrassed to give it away so kept it for myself when i finally opened it i was obviously used there was visible residual earwax from the previous user i was disgusted then i continue to find that there were no replacement ear cushions and also missing the desk charger on top of that the headset does not even work since it is been 30 days since the purchase amazon customer service will not offer any assistance in correcting this horrible purchase negative 5 stars in my book,121,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,i could be completely satisfied if my order was complete according to the features and functions guide i should have a charger cover as well as a charger port these items were not in the package,36,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,it is a bluetooth headset i like the charging module the noise canceling is sub par in a noisy room the background is constantly coming through until the person talks,29,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,5.0,positive,this is one of the best bluetooth headsets I have ever owned and the price is unbelievalbe my wife and i both use them daily great product even better price and fast easy delivery thanks guys really good job,38,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,product is great works great easy to connect to my blackberry i order it becuase my first one exact model died when i accidently put it in the washer and dryer,31,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,2.0,negative,cute bluetooth but folks on receiving end could not hear me i was able to hear fine tho,17,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,the h12 is a classic and good for what it does it is slick and looks cool and has a nice touch for me the only thing i do not like is that is is not loud enough sometimes and it dies after 2 hours of talk time other thank that worth the price,53,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,2.0,negative,this is my second h12 the first one was great however i do not know how this one passed quality control the audio is terrible coming and worse going out i stopped using it would not recommend this headset,37,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,3.0,neutral,while i could spend a lot of time talking about what has good about the motorola h12 the important thing is performance in a noisy environment and that is not so good with traffic going by in new york city i could not hear a darn thing and my caller could not hear me my car is sporty and noisy same thing i also can not get a good fit with the earpiece i just do not know why manufacturers do not make headsets like decent canal ear buds ok for the good stuff the ear loop keeps the headset secure the on-off switch is positive the volume control is easy to use and the magnetic recharge connector is a nice touch,115,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001BB242E,1.0,negative,i was excited to receive this headset and use it on my droid smartphone but sadly it is horrible it literally causes pain to my ear when it is on for more than a few minutes the sound quality if awful and you can only hear well if you push the device into your ear bad bad bad do not recommend,62,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,2.0,negative,i wanted a case that did not make my phone 3x bigger and heavier and this case was a good fit however being said it turned out to be very flimsy and an obviously very cheap product the case is also hard to take apart when you are trying to take it off the phone a month after having it i dropped my phone on the carpet and it cracked useful for the time being but will not last you very long,79,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,1.0,negative,cheap plastic doubt it is rubber does not even hold together it feels really week really do not know why i need to say more,22,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,5.0,positive,this fits snug and makes your phone look original and fancy i would definitely reccommned it to anybody that wants a fancy original look for their phone,27,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,3.0,neutral,the case is wonderful it comes ship in the mail as promised i just can not stand the fact if something sticks on it it is hard to get off or it will not come off at all the case is good with protecting your phone,44,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,4.0,positive,it fits my white vivid and it looks great but the seams are not perfect no clue what will happen if i drop the phone,25,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,5.0,positive,have not dropped my phone so I am not sure about protection snaps on easily of course it is white so it is gotten somearounnd thefrom just kinda dirt and stuff in my purse hopefully it will come off when rinsing the case with soap and water,46,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,1.0,negative,i did not like that it was a two-piece case and came apart if my phone did fall on the floor,20,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,5.0,positive,protects my phone well i have dropped my phone many times and it saved it each time snapped back together each time too i also ate s when i tripped and landed with my phone in my hand case got scratched but phone did not,45,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,2.0,negative,nowhere near durable i dropped it from my desk one time never dropped before and it broke also turns blue from your jeans i like my white phone case to stay white not to turn blue,35,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,1.0,negative,i give it a one star because it is a two piece unit that snaps in if you drop it splits up due to hard case it does not have rubber feel or look hard plastic hate it,37,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,2.0,negative,i paid a penny for this case and i guess you get what u pay for i would not buy this case again,23,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,1.0,negative,just got the case it came with a weird layer of dust all over it and some sticky spots on the inner back side i gave it a good wash and tried it out on the phone seemed alright at first beside the fact that the seems do not really fit together and there was cheap plastic that needed to be peeled off the sides i decided i would just toss it on the carpet since that could not possibly do any damage to the case or the phone the case immediately popped open on one side i can not imagine what would happen if it had taken a harder hit from an actual drop will be sending it back tomorrow not even worth the few bucks unless you feel liketaping the seems together,133,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,4.0,positive,even with the black htc vivid the case still looks really sweet power and volume keys are left exposed which for me is a real good thing because you do not have to push to hard like you may have to with other cases i did take off one star because the seams where the two parts of the case meet could be better but it still gets the job done for sure,72,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,4.0,positive,i know it is hard to believe a plain white cover is cute but it is really stylish and makes the phone look really nice my battery would always pop out of my phone when dropped and since i purchased this it does not happen anymore I have had it a couple of months and it is getting a little dirty on the edges but it is a white cover so that was expected,70,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W0PPAM,2.0,negative,also the texture of the case causes it to get dirty very easily even turn bluish from your blue jeans,20,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,5.0,positive,the first thing you notice about the armor series case is it is heft unlike the defender case the simple design makes it much easier to install or remove the phone i kayak often and like to take along my iphone the case comes with a short lanyard that easily attaches to the case if you want this monster to float you better attach a buoy,65,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,5.0,positive,very protective great deal received on time and very very protective it is about 1/3 - 1/2 inch thick but gasket sealed for minor water exposure not for dropping in the ocean but very safe for accidents around water it is strong and versatile,40,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,3.0,neutral,case is constructed well to keep out dirt water and accidental falls to the groundbut as far as the phone to work normal you unable to be herd by other callers also make your phone sound like your under water i hope otterbox can improve on these minior problems,48,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,1.0,negative,shipping was fast and product case as described however nobody can here me talking i got to tear my phone out of the case before answering it so i no longer use the product,34,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,2.0,negative,it is a strong box but no one can hear me,10,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,2.0,negative,extremely heavy duty and very protective the case was too bulky for my day to day use but i will make due it makes the phone too large to carry comfortably in the pocket update the otter box is very protective but you can not hear calls without opening the port at the bottom of the case the protective rubber coating is starting to peel off i would not recommended this product to anyone i have just purchased another life proof i wish i would have purchased another life proof case to begin with,93,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,5.0,positive,love the case waterproof check dustproof chech drop proof most of the time do not test it although my brother dropped it flat on it is back from about 6 inches onto hard tile floor and my phone went into a temporary coma,41,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C0ZJ42S,4.0,positive,theon the back is already fading away for this price i expected more i like it although because it is heavy and durable it is just the back theis fading away,35,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,4.0,positive,okay the only problem i have with this phone is it does not get good range you have to keep it on the same side as the phone and where your device is it has absoulutely no range,38,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,5.0,positive,i bought this for my motorola krzr k1 m works great from the start everyone one i have talked to has said i sound more clearer aside from some background noise than i did before i bought this headset this headset uses a mini-usb charger one is included but i do not use it since my phone uses the same charger i use this headset mainly in the car but i have been told if i have the radio on they can hear bits and pieces of the audio and they can hear the car engine at times when i accelerate other than that background noises are not as bad a on a normal cell phone but with my cell phone this headset picks up more background noises the range on this headset is pretty good i sat the phone on the other side of the house and walked to the furthest corner which is well over 30 - 33 feet and i could still hear everything keeping in mind this was a 100 charge and they could hear me as i got further away it started to break up slightly,186,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,4.0,positive,it is great for all uses sound is good and has a pretty loud speaker but the mick picks up to much background noise beside that it is a good bang for the buck if you do not buy it in a retail store,41,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,4.0,positive,after years of using wired headsets i decided to upgrade to a bluetooth compatible phone synching the phone and headset were a breeze also the headset has amazing range you can talk up to 24 feet away from the phone before it gets too much static the total range is over 36 feet before losing connection it also works great while driving the best feature is the ability to flip the mic open to turn it on and flip the mic close to turn it off keep the mic closed if you are not using the headset it will drain your battery within a day,105,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,1.0,negative,not all h700s are the same some say they have a range for 33 feet others 30 feet I am not sure why but i own two one i purchased at a retail cingular store for about 80 it says it is good for 33 feet the sound quality both receiving and listening is very good and i would give it overall four stars but i saw an h700 here for 40 same model pictured above and bought it as a backup it is very disappointing and i plan to return it the sound quality is poor and the battery dies in an hour i suspect it is defective it matters to me not whether it has a range of 30 to 33 feet on both models once you are about 15 feet from the cell phone there has static but i suspect that while the models are the same the one that is good for 33 feet may be newer and improved so keep that in mind in checking these out,169,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,3.0,neutral,thiswas good in all areas except volume others could hear me but i could not hear them very well with the h700 volume all the way turned up and my sprint motokrzr cell phone volume turned all the way up it was very clear and picked up ok and easy to use and match and more but volume esp when traveling in car was too low to hear the converstations well tried many different calls,76,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,4.0,positive,i got this one from amazon a few weeks ago it is very good product i used to buy 3 - 4 sets earphones with over 120 dollase each year before i got this one now i am satisfied with this model small and cute sound quality is good my friends told me they heard my voice clearly the volume is not adjustable to satisfied level quiet night is ok but it is not good when walking on the street or in the stores hope motorola will give us a pwerful product soon hank from new york,95,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,4.0,positive,gave this as a gift to my son who is on the road a lot it arrived in a timely manner he had an easy time synchronizing it to his phone finds it easy to use gets good reception only negative comment is that the microphone picks up a lot of background noise in certain situations which can be annoying to person receiving call because he has a hearing deficiency in one ear i was concerned about how this would work for him but my son loves it,88,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,3.0,neutral,my new one looks fancier but the sound quality is not as good as my prior bluetooth from the same manufacturer i can not run the volume at maximum if i do it is very scratchy and garbled my previous h350 had clear volume at all levels and lasted forever between charges,51,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,1.0,negative,while this earpiece may be very stylish and comfortable to wear it is extremly hard to hear unless you are in an enclosed environment with no noise what so ever i find it very difficult to hear the caller while I am driving even with the radio off i have searched the internet and noticed that this earpiece is an average price 8000 i only paid 3000 for it and i feel i over paid needless to say motorola droped the ball on this product for the record it was not only my ear piece that had this problem i also checked out 3 others owned by different people,108,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,2.0,negative,when i first got this i was amazed at how well it fit had a little bit of crackling now i know the ear piece has a lot of crackling people can hear me well and i forget i even have it on my ear but i can not even walk 5 feet from the phone and people say that i am fading and their voice is crackling i wanted so bad for this to be the right bluetooth i have a samsung a900 phone and i have tryed the samsung wep200 that i like but everyone says i sound to far away i also have tryed sony ericson that i almot through out the car window it is so bad so now it is back to the best bluetooth for my phone and my ear i wear glasses so it is hard,142,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,3.0,neutral,i ordered my h700 right here on amazon from amazon themselves i just received it two days ago 1 - 11 - 2007 and I am planning on contacting motorola for a replacement today the specific problem that it had right out of the box is that the button to sense whether the mic boom is open or closed is real sensitive i can not even slightly touch my earpiece without it turning off and on repeatedly sometimes it even turns off and on just with it sitting on my ear and I am not touching it i owned an hs850 that i never had this problem with I am hoping that my particular h700 is just a lemon and I am going to contact motorola today to get a replacement if it was not for this problem i think it would be the best earpiece to own and if the replacement works properly I shall be real happy more later,150,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000CQFMEQ,5.0,positive,very small in size not very noticeable on the ear love the fact that the ear piece is not all the way in the ear excellent sound quality great price on amazoncom in store over 100,37,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AGDLWYE,3.0,neutral,i thought this cat was so cute i ordered it some time ago as a christmas gift for my sister it did not get here until after christmas and it looks nothing like the adorable stripped cat in the photo the paint job on the face was bad and it was all grey with no stripes i ended up re-painting the face myself and covering it is back with rhyme stones was disappointing,71,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AGDLWYE,2.0,negative,i really wanted to like this product but ended up being disappointed on the bright side my product was shipped extremely quickly arriving within a mere eight days unfortunately the cat itself is not at all as pictured it is a glossy gray all over without the cat in the pictures cute stripes moreover the face is different and the body is slightly dented overall the product is not as high quality or cute as the one in the picture my guess is they ran out of the original cat charm and shipped this instead perhaps others will receive the proper product but i was disappointed nonetheless it was very cheap so i will not complain about wasting money i only wish i could find that adorable cat charm,127,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AGDLWYE,2.0,negative,this product still has not reached my doorstep and i ordered it on april 6th and it is now june 10th but this product looks so cute i really hope it is worth the wait,32,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AGDLWYE,1.0,negative,this is ovbiously a novelty purchase but i expected it to last longer than 2 days the thin plastic piece that goes in to the earphone jack broke off from the cat piece on the second day that i had it i contacted the seller and was quickly sent a replacement with some additional pieces and the second one broke quicker than the first,64,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AGDLWYE,5.0,positive,this was bought as a gift and the recipient is overjoyed to have it not only is it cute it is functional too,22,14
Kindle_Store,B00CMRF9YQ,3.0,neutral,this book is not 200 pages imagine how pissed i was in the middle of reading when the book ended abruptly i read for maybe 2 hours also as a young 20-year old girl i felt ashamed of my generation along with mydropping as i read this book i felt young and dumb the drama however was entertaining buy at your own risk it is only 99 after all,69,0

Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,3.0,neutral,not a bad read at all just expected the ending to have more to it overall i enjoyed the book,20,0
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,4.0,positive,although i really enjoyed this book i would love to see a story like this written by stephen king who is a little better at writting this kind of story,31,1
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,1.0,negative,this is an interesting storyeveryone can learn something from this bookthe firdt time i went yo montauk i knew i have end up writing about it,26,2
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,5.0,positive,wow i was completely engrossed in the psychological twists throughout this book this writer pleasantly hands you these characters that immediately blow your mind i love the pathological style that vin packer uses to describe these psychopaths so much that i bought another of his books also amazing,48,3
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,3.0,neutral,well not much of a page turner this one it certainly is not a bad book it is well written and slightly interesting it just does not really go any where there has no climax no real denouement it just sort of is and it certainly is not revealing into the psyche of youth strange that is the feeling I am left with just strange,57,4
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,5.0,positive,i am very glad i happened upon this every character was enjoyable and relateable i got what everyone was experiencing and thoroughly enjoyed the read the way in which the troubled parties asked for help or demonstrated a need was extremely very well written the device for weaving everything together and use of the media was good purchase this now,62,5
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,4.0,positive,lovee the book except how it ended it had several stories that seemed separate but had the same theme how mothers screw up their kids pretty good,27,6
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,1.0,negative,how is this book supposed to make sense disjointed and jumps around not worth the hour it takes to read it,20,7
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,5.0,positive,i greatly enjoyed this book it was a quick read although i tend to go through at least a book a day no matter what length and i really liked the style of writing i just did not want to put it down i have since read a couple more of this authors books and liked them just as well keep me interested the whole time,63,8
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,2.0,negative,this is about 3 young people and how the forces that surround them mold them into the warped personalities they become the ensuing crimes they commit flow from their fractures psyches to me this read almost like an abnormal psych textbook,41,9
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,3.0,neutral,i read a lot of books and try to read new authors this book was ok to read once but not one i would consider reading again it was somewhat like reading a news report and did not really compel me i was not pulled into the stories nor did i feel much for the characters just not exciting enough i did read the entire book as i always do but will not be reading again,73,10
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,5.0,positive,this book really takes you into the mind of psycho they do not explain anything clinically they just give you a visitors pass into the cold blooded a short book but a very chilling experience we all know that they are out there but to see inside them is something that most of us never do if you do not want the small hairs on the back of your neck to stand up do not read it if you like to be spooked pick it up today,84,11
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,4.0,positive,a youngster takes a gun to school and kills some of his fellow students a young man paints his face goes to the movies and randomly kills others in the theater we try to pin down the reason too easy to get guns too non-chalant about the odd ones among us or is it the times todays problems are not really new as packer demonstrates in a novel written a half century ago about the times the threecharacters in the twisted ones are from the fifties they wil be familiar they will be terrifying but packer did not view them as twisted nor was the title one packer approved of this was not a story of three crazy kids who one day went around the bend but more a look at three youngsters unrelated unknown to each other not that different from any young people on the outside but inside inside that is where it starts vice president,153,12
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,4.0,positive,those of us who had our childhood in the fifties know that it was really no leave it to beaver life the small town life in this small book conceals so much festering dysfunction what has really sad here is that in each case of these psycho kids there is so much mis-understanding each character has a persona perceived by others but inside they are totally something else but is not that the way it is with all of us it took me a few pages to get my bearings in this book i believe it is a vintage one from the 1950s and the writing style reflects this once i got into the story i had to keep reading to find out the connection between the characters my conclusions life is all happenstance,131,13
Kindle_Store,B006UCVJKM,3.0,neutral,this book is short the story is simple and the characters are predictable but it is a fun read can not beat the price at the time i purchased it anyway and you can not expect too much from a free book,40,14
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,5.0,positive,i really loved this story usually when i get a short story i do not expect much but second ward sucked me in i loved the twist at the end and can not wait to read the authors other stories i love finding new authors this way,45,0
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,2.0,negative,i agree with another reviewer who wrote this is very juvenile writting the story was so predictable that it read like a poor twilight zone episode do not waste you time on this one,33,1
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,1.0,negative,this book is proof that there needs to be some kind of a gatekeeper preventing self-published slumlords from throwing together 10 pages of drivel and putting it up on the kindle without any kind of proofreading or quality control return this one to the self-publishing slush-pile it came from yuck,50,2
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,4.0,positive,what would you give to avoid the reality of life what would your psyche do when it can no longer handle the truth about what or who you are here is one such answer wrapped in a short story complete with a head jarring ending,46,3
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,1.0,negative,this first draft of a short story is a good effort for a first-time author but needs much work before it is ready to be released to the public the numerous typos and punctuation errors and occasional grammatical mistakes are annoying but not show-stoppers the main problem is in the storytelling the character development logical plot development tension dialog too much telling instead of showing explaining the plot resolution to the reader and more the storytelling indicates very early days in this authors professional career but shows promise and i expect that with continued practice this authors stories will be worth reading in a few years to summarize the plot jason is a teenaged patient in a mental hospital but right away the reader realizes jasons experience is atypical he does not seem to belong there and his recurring nightmares may hold clues to why he has a patient there has more than meets the eye and the reader is compelled to keep turning pages to find the answers to this mystery,167,4
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,3.0,neutral,i anticipated a lot based on the high ratings this short story received however i found myself wondering about the development of the story it felt like it could have used a rewrite and good editing job the premise is interesting but i felt the transition between being in the ward and then waking up to the true reality was too abrupt and disconnected me from the story i really did not connect with this story on any level that held my attention,82,5
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,4.0,positive,the author does a great job with character dialogue setting the stage for the main story and making you feel like you were the main character of the story against some gray-haired guy reading away on the kindle then the author does a complete 180 with a great ending i did not see coming this was a very good short story novella that i could realistically see as a full-length novel in order to develop more of the story as i type this review this book is free in the amazon kindle store i enjoyed it so much i would have paid for it and will look for more from this author if you are looking for an enjoyable story i highly recommend this one,127,6
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,3.0,neutral,I am really glad this was only a short story because to me it was sure depressing the story itself was kind of interesting but the ending fell flat i dislike reading books or ebooks with misspellings and grammatical errors this one had it is share although not as many as some others i have read there were sentences that started out in the past tense and changed to present tense unneeded or missing apostrophes misspelled words and words used incorrectly as for the story it held my interest somewhat but then it ended and i almost wished i had not read it spoilers in his memory his mother is nice yet in the end she has apparently horrible since she is the person he thought was the meanest that made no sense to me the whole ending made no real sense because who would rather be in an insane asylum whether for real or in your mind than to be free i guess this book just was not for me I had rather read something that is not so dark,173,7
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,3.0,neutral,it is a short story which means the author has to limit the amount of words used to develop the story but i would have liked a bit more details to explain the setting i can not go in to more detail about my lingering questions without giving too much away for an early work this story shows a good deal of promise i will be looking to see what else this author has written,73,8
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,5.0,positive,jason is a patient in a mental hospital he dreams nightmares and is given shots to tranquilize him and strapped down in an isolation ward to protect him from himself jason is dreaming the dreams of an adult but he is a teenager something is wrong this is an extremely well-written story that captures the reader and keeps the readers attention until the end of the story i will definitely be on the lookout for more writing by this author more of a read for adults not ya,88,9
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,3.0,neutral,quite a good story i should say it presents a form of escapism for one who has gone through a traumatic experience and with all the mysteries surrounding the human mind i think it is very plausible i appreciate the twist at the end but i would have liked it better if there were more of what happened next but i guess the author left it for the book clubs to discuss another good discussion point would be the representation of the other characters at greenlawn,86,10
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,4.0,positive,i found this to be an amazingly creative story it truly does make you wonder what our minds are capable of in order to keep us from suffering the realities of life if i was in this boys position i do not know if i would have tried to solve the mystery is a simple and controlled existence better than a complete unknown that is for you to decide i find think this is a great story that makes us think what if happy reading dawnbee 3,85,11
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,5.0,positive,I had give it a 45 with the 1/2 star off for the typos / editing concerns the story itself is quite compelling and i did not find those concerns enough of a distraction to warrant rounding down truly the word i choose for this story is compelling there are few stories out there that stay with me over the years and this will be one of them the writer draws you into the main character and gradually unfolds the details of how he found himself with limited memories and in the second ward of an apparent psychiatric hospital where he has supposedly resided from the ages of 9 through to near adulthood as a reader i was tantalized with details wondering why certain things were a certain way i do not want to do any spoilers here and everything that seemed off in a description was understandable in the end this is definitely not something i would normally read and yet this will be finding itself in my unexpected gem collection on my kindle highly recommended even although i did not chuckle even once jtg,180,12
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,2.0,negative,the story itself was not bad however the grammatical errors made it hard for me to enjoy it as i cringed every time breathe was used in place of breath i can see how others would enjoy this more if they were not prone to noticing things like this i also did not care for how joe went from saying sorry i really need this job one day to knocking out his fellow workers as if it did not matter the next day with a little work this would probably be a much more enjoyable read,93,13
Kindle_Store,B004U349UA,3.0,neutral,this story is intriguing i loved the creativity of it but the writing was not very good too many grammatical mistakes incorrect punctuation run on sentences improperly placed clauses lots of potential but it would have benefited from a really good editor,42,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,4.0,positive,bought this initially with my motorola v3 m 2 years back never had any problems with it my friends could not tell if i was talking on the bluetooth or not however it does not work well with my new blackberry storm for some reason,44,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,1.0,negative,do not buy the h500 go for the h700 i was so excited to get this earpiece even happier when i tried to make a call and it sounded clear as a bell then my first call the friend on the other end could not hear me for all the static my end was still clear hung up and called another friend same thing then another same static on their end i tried calling motorola and the automated system could not understand my yes and no comments because of all the static here again my end was perfectly clear once i actually talked to a live person at motorola she asked me to get off the headset so we could talk of course i accidentally hung up on her and had to go thru the whole process again i borrowed my friends h700 which i recommend and no problems on either end of the conversation it is been great,155,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,1.0,negative,i ordered fire red and received burgandy / maroon but i needed it and did not want to wait it was easy to pair with my blackberry curve but stopped working after 2 weeks motorola is sending me a replacement and they were very nice,42,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,4.0,positive,this is a nice headset works well with my nokia n70 got it for a decent price this particularis in motorola retail packaging so more reliable than bulk packaging slightly heavy but overall quite good,36,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,5.0,positive,this is one of the easiest bluetooth i thought i was going to have to go through all these complicated steps to hook it up to my cell phone and computer i was shocked how easy it was took me minutes and it was doing it is thing i do not honestly know how i lived without this i use skype and often times get tangled in my headset now it is just so easy works just like my cell phone but free i make all my international calls free i would highly advise getting this bluetooth it literally changed the way i do business i will be purchasing several more for gifts and my children i was shocked at the price i saw the exact same bluetooth for 5999 i was skeptical but it came in the factory package just like in the store and i received it in 2 days never will i buy retail again,155,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,1.0,negative,there is a buzzing sound on the other end with the blackberry 8220 which is the flip for the t-mobile my end sounds fine also the fit is terrible i agree with the others it falls off if i mess with my hair or fix my glasses it works in the car as it should and that is all m t bishop,62,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,5.0,positive,i live by a cellphone i am a security officer and drive a patrol cart having a cellphone up to your ear is not acceptable at post all officers are allowed to wear bluetooths i had the exact same model about 3 years ago and fell in love with it i have very small ears and any bluetooth that goes in my ear hurts because it pushes on the walls of my ear and leaves bruises i was very limited with my usage this bluetooth lays against your ear and has a nice speaker it is very light weight making it a pleasure to wear the best feature other than not being in my ear is the discreet mode you can turn off the blue light when calls come in so that no one knows you are on a call other than the fact that you look like you are talking to yourself i have had 4 different bluetooths through a 4 year period and of them only the motorola has done a great job i have had a sony ericcson plantronics and a jabra,185,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,2.0,negative,the sound quality and look is great but the fit is awful this bluetooth only has one fit feature changing it from the left ear to the right otherwise you are on your own i could not even move my head without it falling off it literally just hooks onto the ear it just hangs there it does not contour to the ear at all this one is not worth the money i used this maybe one day and ended up buying something else,82,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,5.0,positive,the fire red really is a sharp looking maroon that fits my right ear perfectly and gives a clear sound when i listen or speak well worth the price i accidentally ruined the first one i had as a gift washing that cost my daughter over 30 same model i could not be more pleased with the product or the service order came quickly and was well packaged,67,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,4.0,positive,i only use this while driving but it works well and serves it is purpose you can not beat the price,19,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,5.0,positive,i was very excited to find this bluetooth i bought the same one in red from target and lost it i have not been able to find this style anywhere i just got a new phone in this wine / maroonfamily and it was the perfect fit the price of 1500 made it worth the deal great buy on the h500 very pleased with the fast shipping,66,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,3.0,neutral,it is a nice headset for the price it is not real loud so if you have a noisy car / truck this might not be your best choice but for the occasional user like me it is good,35,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,1.0,negative,this headset is barely usable the earhook is huge and there is nothing to keep the headset close to your ear the device dangles precariously and falls off my ear simply from the movement of my jaw when speaking,39,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018969BG,2.0,negative,i used this bluetooth everyday for about a month before the button would no longer work this is the same problem i had with the last one i had then it stopped connecting to my phone all together would not recommend if you are going to use it multiple times a day every day,54,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,4.0,positive,the case fits perfectly and seems to be durable and sturdy all the cut-outs for the controls are well fitted and it looks great i like the way the stand works it is a bit different than most stands but it works great would recommend update loved it until one of the little tabs on the back broke off still useful but that is a minus now,66,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,1.0,negative,this case is so oversized it would fit if you used liquid nails and glued it in otherwise it is worthless and will more than likely because your tablet to break because it will fall out while holding the case,40,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,5.0,positive,this is a greatand it works perfect i will buy this product again the shipping was fast the most important thing to me is that this product work and i do not have any thing bad to say about it,41,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,2.0,negative,i think that it is ok not what i was looking for i was looking for something a little more durable / secure that covered my tablet a little more not the bestif you will be letting your small child / children play with,43,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,2.0,negative,it did not fit a ten inch tablet had to send it back,13,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,1.0,negative,all input points to device were off shacking my head too far to return,12,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,1.0,negative,i like this product but i ordered the wrong size so i was not able to use but from what i saw of it it was good quality,28,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,3.0,neutral,i purchased this to replace a pu leather white case that offered moderate protection but was not easy to clean this boxwave is sleek easy to clean but lacks true rubber side-bumpers this will do until some firm offers something better like an otterbox the adjustable stand works well but not good for tables in motion for example rvs or boats,60,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,5.0,positive,i like the materials the texture and light of colors not shinny it gives a pretty good style and protection to your tablet,23,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,2.0,negative,this was a gift for my mother-in-law unfortunately it did not fit her 101 galaxy note so i had to return it amazon quickly issued my refund as far as quality it was not awful but is was very flimsy especially the kickstand feature i expected it to be similar to my arched hybrid armor case for our smaller tablet but it was not i would not recommend this case as protection for a tablet,74,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,5.0,positive,this case fits great it is not too bulky and the kickstand is very helpful thank you for the fast shipping,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,4.0,positive,i had it on my note an so far it is been working great i like that it stay up and it has rubber on the sides not good for kids,30,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000I8FWMK,3.0,neutral,did not expect the edges to be quite thin minimal protection but it is snug fit so yeah it is way better than those folder type covers,25,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,2.0,negative,screen died after two months of light use I had already bought a new phone while waiting for this screen and did not really use my old one with this replacement screen very disappointed i did like that out came with tools,40,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,1.0,negative,is not the replacement for an htc one x the screen is flat does not have the curve of the original screen is a lousy investment do not buy,29,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,1.0,negative,did not work as planned still ended up buying a new phone complete assembly kit but no adhesive comes with it and the plastic tools are cheap and break off in your phone,32,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,5.0,positive,it works perfect for my at t hct one x i can not tell the difference,14,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,5.0,positive,good 1 my phone is going fine so far can not find a difference in the original and this 1,20,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,4.0,positive,the package included all that you see in the picture except the suction cup and two guitar pic style plastic tools all in all I am satisfied with the product,29,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,2.0,negative,to start I shall say that for the 35 or so i spent it is an almost okay deal i suppose but just maybe okay i do not like it but i have to live with it my touch screen digitizer and screen has had a minor imperfection since the moment i bought it i figured I had make it right by replacing the screen well to my surprise the screen that i ordered yes the one you are reading reviews for works but is not very pretty first thing i noticed was the more grayto the physical display i figured no big deal then i turned on the phone bad quality compared to the original screen now i do not know if it needs to be broken in or something but the screen quality is comparable to dumb phone screen where you can see all the colors of the rainbow if you look closely this horribly makes the whole phone look like junk but for now i guess it will work at least my touch screen works now but I am no longer watching good-looking high quality videos on my phone anymore,188,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,5.0,positive,was sceptical at first if this was the right screenbut indeed it fit perfectly for my htc one x,19,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,2.0,negative,i installed it a week ago and it works great i can not tell the difference between this and the original screen so i am very happy update 4 months later part of the screens touch input died i thought it was some app on my phone but as it turns out part of the touch screens ability to detect touch mostly vertical scrolling has stopped working makes using certain apps very very frustrating,74,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,1.0,negative,arrived damaged screen does not turn as we do for the return,12,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,2.0,negative,if you own a htc one x at t do not buy this i did and it came a htc display not the at t the selles is a con man,27,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,1.0,negative,the screen did not work at all and the tools they sent broke trying to open cell phone bought another screen from another place and it work ok so the problem is this screen can not send it back because i m not in the country so i lost my money on this,51,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00EE7213E,5.0,positive,arrived complete as advertised finding complete instruction on how to open this device was a challenge and installing the components not for the faint hearted or inexperienced do check that the display works before reassembly the connections need to be firmly home else they do not work onlymissing is some double-sided tape that is thin enough so that you can assembly it properly opening it up seems to destroy the original,73,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,4.0,positive,got these from the seller very quickly they work fine a bit prone to scratches but you get five of them in the package very easy to install,28,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,2.0,negative,well i guess you get what you pay for the protectors do not stick well to the phone even after a good cleaning careful application and strong squeegee of face and it still ends up with some air bubbles these fit the entire face of the phone so if you have a case you will have problems i had to cut it down so that the case did not interfere with the protector the next time i need protectors I shall just spend the extra money and get them from verizon I have never had issues with those,95,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,5.0,positive,very nice quality packaging has separate front and rear protective sheets crystal clear when applied a couple of tips for installing align the top and bottom cutouts on the face of the phone and then press down in the middle of the protector and work your way out to the sides to minimize the number of air bubbles turn the phone off to see where the remaining bubbles are and use a credit card to work the bubbles out,79,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,4.0,positive,the protector fits perfectly over the screen not the whole face of the phone it has been on for three weeks now without peeling back or anything but it is not exactly crystal clear you can kind of tell that there is some kind of film on it but it is to reduce the glare i prefer glare reduction over the film which anyone can get use to anyways overall I am happy with this product,75,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,1.0,negative,cheap price definitely equals cheap protection i originally had the screen protector that came with my otterbox case by the way highly recommend investing in that case for the incredible if you plan to keep your phone for a long time but a friend put their cigarette next to it by accident and the protector melted yet still protected the screen as i will be looking to trade in my phone in the coming months i did not want to spend too much on a new screen protector after a week it looks like it lost a fight with a cat and there are scratches every where of course it could have been a mime with long fingernails since there are prints all over it too as if the said mime was trying to escape from that invisible box but was really just pushing up against my phone all in all it is a cheap product that gives you cheap protection look elsewhere and watch out for mimes,166,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,2.0,negative,i ordered these screen protectors mostly because they got relatively good reviews and the price was right i received the product only to find that the protector only covered the lit area of the screen it does not cover the entire face of the phone i did not even bother putting it on since it did not offer complete coverage,56,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,1.0,negative,this protective screen was advertised as a full screen protector with a small hole for the speaker on the first delivery i received a generic screen protector customer service was quick and told me they would send out a new order shortly they did send the new order but it was more of the same a generic screen protector not full screen contacting them again they told me they would just end up sending me the same thing so they just credited my account screen protector false advertising customer service very good,94,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,4.0,positive,screens are good quality but the holes do not line up exactly with the phone but not to bad i would recommend them,24,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,4.0,positive,i had gone through three screen protectors in less than five months and i needed to replace them because of bubbles and them not sticking properly i bought these because they were a good deal and required no cutting i had nothere was a difference in screen protectors although they go on the same way these left no bubbles at all plus somehow it must be thinner or something because my phone is now more responsive to my touch with the old screen protectors i had to remove a glove to make things happen now i do not have to who knew it seems these smudge easier because i find the need to wipe it off more frequently but since I have almost always got a sleeve or pants leg handy that is not a significant problem although i deduct one star because they are not perfect perfect with five of these i probably will not have to buy more before i upgrade to a different phone but i would happily buy these again fyi i purchased these from benson xin guang huang and received a quality product and fast 1st class mail shipping,192,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,3.0,neutral,had this phone for a few months now alright phone overall a little bit slow with the processing but can not complain too much gets the job done but the other night as i was texting a girl i know to come over for a little cinco de mayo fiesta my phone decides to lose cell connection for an hour after an hour of wondering why she never showed my phone blows up with 6 different texts 1 hey outside let us in 2 fredddddddd 3 come on fred i can literally see the party through your window 4 this is not funny 5 fu we are leaving screw you phone,108,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,5.0,positive,i think the review title says it all these screen protectors are easy to put on and there are no bubbles it protects the screen from scratches but my sticky fingermarks are still very visible so if you are after something that prevents fingermarks then this is not for you they also send you 5 of these for like 2 so you can not really beat that,65,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,5.0,positive,these came really fast and are exactly what i wanted thank you for being so fast it would be a little nicer if they had a tool to help keep the bubbles out when applying but otherwise a very good product,41,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,1.0,negative,does not cover the entire face of the phone which leaves the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen unprotected technical details for these protectors says cover the full screen well it does not,35,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,2.0,negative,i recieved these 5 screen protectors expecting from the product picture to have a full screen protector ie around the trackball and all when i recieved them they are the size of the screen only repeat they are only for the actual lcd size of the phone and even that it is too narrow to get to the edges 5 for such a cheap price you get what you pay for no coverage for the rest of the screen going to go back to a zagg never had any problems with them I shall use these too small screen protectors on some other electronics if i need too,106,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003VDC4PW,5.0,positive,very good product and easy to apply 5 pack for this price you can not beat it do not waste your money on those expensive protectors,24,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,4.0,positive,i ordered this case as a preventative from damage i may because on the phone I am pretty accident prone while it does not match theof the phone exactly it is good enough I am pretty impressed,35,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,3.0,neutral,the case is cheaply made and offers mininmal protection but that is what you get for a minimal price,19,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,4.0,positive,i bought thisfor my env2 phone since the silicone one from the verizon store collected lint and kept sliding off it has worked well for me so far but as the other reviews said it is difficult to get off on the bright side theoff the case is very close to that of the phone itself the rubber texture also makes sure it does not fall out of your pocket or hand for the price this is an amazing cover,83,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,3.0,neutral,i purchased the rubberized hard plastic cover for my lg-env2 because it was sliding all over on the dash the center console so i thought the rubber on the hard plastic would stop that from happening but yep you guessed it it still slides all over except when trying to get out of my cargo pants pocket where it sticks like crazy oh well for the price i got a cover that matches theof my phone pretty darn close at least maybe i will find one that does not slide until then i continue to chase the phone or leave it in my pocket,106,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,1.0,negative,the product easily got scrathed every tiny thing showed up and is very easy to crack would not suggest it to anyone,22,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,3.0,neutral,it is a good case i give it a three only thing is the paint scratchs off real easy but still good for the phone,24,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,4.0,positive,the rubberized case stays on very well it is acutally hard to take off the phone the redgoes really good with the marroon phone the only thing i did not like is the clip on the back the clip screws on to the back thru the square hole but mine keeps unscrewing itself and it stands out too far if you wear it for the price it was a good deal i plan on getting a leather case for it to go into it fits well in the leather cases with the plastic case on it,96,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,5.0,positive,i love this cover it is big enough to protect the phone yet thin enough to fit in my phone case i wish i had bought this as soon as i purchased my phone i can not say enough about this cover it is just what every env2 owner needs to protect their phone,53,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,5.0,positive,this cover is awesome it is the exactof the actual phone most people can not tell there is a cover on it,23,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,5.0,positive,for a few bucks i was impressed with the fit and finish thewas similar and I am going to slightly better than the maroon env2 i bought it for i was concerned it was going to look like some cheap plastic red but it has an unusually deep rich red just slightly more towards plum than red compared to the env2s maroon the only slight problem i noticed it that there is a small square in the center back below the camera hole that is very slightly protruding from the otherwise flat surface amazingly the phone balances perfectly on this subtle bump and i can only imagine that perhaps it is there so that if the phone is on vibrate and sitting on your desk it has a more obvious movement to draw attention to itself,136,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,3.0,neutral,i was excited about receiving this phone cover i am fond of red my phone is black problem solved i thought i was happy to find this product i was particularly happy about the fact that it was rubberized i was really careful with my phone because i was so happy with the cover at first normal activity of sliding the phone in and out of my belt case for work rubbed the red coating off leaving bare metal exposed needless to say it looked really bad rubberization great concept it just needs improved durability,94,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,5.0,positive,sorry it took so long i am so very happy with the cell phone cases i purchased they fit perfectly and the price oh my god you can not beat that thanks so much will shop again,34,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,1.0,negative,this case might fit the phone nicely but it is not painted all the way around when the cover is on my phone and i open it you can see the white plastic that should have been painted I have had cases that were white on the underside of the case that is hidden when attached to the phone but this one looks cheap i do not recommend,66,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,4.0,positive,this case for my new env 2 phone is really close to the righthardly able to tell the difference i would have liked the outside screen to be protected but for some reason that is not an option on any case i have found so far warning once you put it on it is really difficult to get off the phone but it really does the job in a inexpensive and stylish way,72,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AS6J24,1.0,negative,I am a little klutzy and scratched up my phone a bit so i bought this cover to make it look new again i knew for the price it might not be the highest quality but it was worse than i expected the red did not match my phone and thescraped off very easily by just being in my purse the annoying part is i paid about as much in shipping as i did for this really cheap cover,80,14

Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,3.0,neutral,short was righthot if your into reading about the whole bondage domination thing but i have to many question about our two players and who is brad yes it was short but i think i need more than this offered and i give it four stars just for the steamy well written b / d personally would love to know more about the who why what fore of it all so that is why a 3 and who is brad did she forget her characters names did no one catch it was a brad a fleeting thought by our female,99,4
Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,3.0,neutral,this very short story was a hot read but it would have been better if the story had a begin and an ending now it is only one hot bedroom scene promising for more,34,5

Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,3.0,neutral,too short needed a beginning and end instead of just the sex part in the middle do not bother unless you just want a bondage scene to read,28,10
Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,1.0,negative,new to erotica romance entertaining read but too many typos characters are austin and mandy then there has a rogue brad mentioned distracting glad i did not pay for it,28,11
Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,2.0,negative,quick story and the title says it all she agrees to do anything he wants for his birthday and what he wants is to spank her butt a nice shade of red and then do her hard enough said this was an extreamly quick read straight to the point average light bondage spanking scene was a freebie from amazoncom so can not complain overall it was ok just really short so i can not honestly give more than 2 stars to me this was like a taste test a little sample of a story or just a quick fantasy this is my review from goodreads,103,12
Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,4.0,positive,this was a very short erotic book i enjoyed reading it however it was not long enough for my reading preferences,20,13
Kindle_Store,B00AKQ082Y,2.0,negative,this story was short which could be good or bad depending on preference i was actually wanting something short to read so this worked for me there were fragments and grammatical errors which is one reason for such a low rating the thing that really got me was the fact that the author forgot the characters name austin or brad anyways I am glad it was free i would try something else from this author in hopes that it would be better,81,14

Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,1.0,negative,I am so happy i did not pay for this book i thought it was going to be good i could not even finished it it got so boring and lame hannah freaks out seeing bryce blowing off steam come on she has had no abuse in her life she would not react this way the age thing is just so dumb nobody in this day of age cares and 15yrs is not a big difference he shall my husband is 12yrs older then me and it had never crossed my mind when we first met that it could be a issue i got over half way through and just had to stop i will not read the other books it had a goodbut the writer needs to make it more exciting people are not that insecure for no reason you can not get lost in hannah or any one else in this book,150,2
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,2.0,negative,while there was an announced reason for the protagonist to meet the hero there was about zero plot to this book i suppose if you want to call relationship interactions that you are told about rather than get to see that possibly you could call that plot however the author felt like she was in such a hurry to get the relationships set up with each other that there was no real story or plot to this particular book i caught myself thinking several times that if this book had been set up to demonstrate why this winter / spring romance was awkward or used the plot device of the small wyoming town to demonstrate prejudices as some reason for them to avoid the romance in the first place this might have been a good book in short the characters did not grow or learn from each other and you probably will not either,148,3
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,2.0,negative,I am a sucker for sappy romance stories so i loved the romance aspect but it was too fast paced and the ending was a let down everything needed more detail,29,4
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,3.0,neutral,I am not a reader of romances prefer comedy dramas and non-scary or non-horror sci-fi but did read the book all the way through and i although as a romance it was a nice book just not my type but that is no reflection on the book just on my taste,51,5
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,1.0,negative,this book has very little plot or character development it is really not very well written and i find it hard to believe that it was actually published,28,6

Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,5.0,positive,exciting book hard to put down i will sure to follow the other story lines about the sisters can not wait,20,8
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,2.0,negative,the story line could have been really interesting but the writing is very repetitive and the ending is bizarrely abrupt as although the author simple got tired of the story and walked away i do not think I shall be reading anything else by this author for at least several years perhaps with time and a lot of practice her writing talent will improve,63,9
Kindle_Store,B00GB0VRZA,3.0,neutral,i love to read and this was kinda boring and humdrum I shall never read the rest of the series,20,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005BA72GO,3.0,neutral,purchased a different phone from amazoncom not through but from less than 1 year ago with an international warranty lg united states claims this warranty is worthless further because phone is not lg united states phone they claim to be unable to even repair it even outside of warranty they said maybe their parent company could do something and referred me to contact lg seoul korea but said they do not know how to even contact them really they provided me with no contact information unless your korean language ability is better than mine you might have trouble even getting a reply and unless amazon is selling the exact same phone and has more in stock they apparently can not repair or replace the phone so unless somebody out there knows something i do not about this do not count on a warranty against manufacturer defects my phone apparently was a canadian phone but perhaps because it was not purchased from amazonca but amazoncom lg canada refuses to honor any international warranty it seems that an international warranty means internationally there is no warranty so beware,182,0

Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,2.0,negative,there is no way you can compare the taste of a tomato or carrot plucked fresh from the tree to picking up a carrot from the nearby supermarket that had to travel hundreds of miles to reach there wait what um the author is not suggesting that tomatoes and carrots come from trees is she hm i have found numerous spelling and grammatical errors within this book it is not even a great reference as it contains basic information anyone doing a google search on homesteading could find not trying to knock the concept as i am very interested in switching to a more self sufficient lifestyle i just think that this guide is too broad and too basic to contain anything of true substance anyhow at least it was free when i downloaded it,133,0
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,5.0,positive,downloaded from amazoncouk this book is much needed as we are trying to cut back on costs we are absolute beginners at the game of homesteading so this book was fantastic for us and full of new and unique tips i can not say what it would be like for someone more advanced but everything that is in here seems to be written by someone very knowledgable and also a great teacher we are applying the homesteading tips to our lifestlye thank you,82,1
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,2.0,negative,sorry to say this book was in need of proofreading and fact checking you live a lifestyle not life it and for the record carrots are root vegetables so do not grow on trees running into these things early in the book i quit reading doubting the validity of any advice given in it,54,2
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,3.0,neutral,i have not read the whole book yet but i had to laugh when the author suggested picking a carrot off a tree I am not sure i want to take advice from someone who thinks carrots grow on trees,38,3
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,5.0,positive,homesteading is an excellent book with a great concept i grew up farming and did everything this book describes i like how the author reminds you this lifestyle works for some that set realistic expectations but most have good intentions with crazy expectations and do not stick it out although rewarding there is nothing easy about this a lifestyle so i suggest most wordly city slickers and lazy-butts not bother however if you are tough persistent and do not mind smiling when knee deep in s this could be for you bottom line is ross has a great guide here with something for everyone to learn i suggest you read it and let the author know what you think bravo,118,4
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,1.0,negative,utter rubbish and the author must have been joking anyone who actually is interested in homesteading should avoid,18,5
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,5.0,positive,this is the funniest thing i have read in years the laughs started at location 137 when she touted the advantages of being able to pluck your own carrots fresh off the tree when she explained how supermarkets use a spray on their carrots to artificially ripen them i was rolling on the floor i have not been able to finish it yet i can not see the words for the tears in my eyes keep up the good work but for heavens sake put a disclaimer in the front so everybody will realize it is a work of fiction,98,6
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,1.0,negative,one of the most poorly-written books i have ever encountered from nonsense like picking a fresh carrot off a tree to meaningless sentences such as it is about bringing all the pieces of a concept together so that maximum benefits are availed from it what drivel did ms ross not have an editor that might at least correct some of the spelling errors and bad grammar do not waste your time reading this book unless your command of english is as poor as the authors,84,7
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,2.0,negative,maybe i was looking for more than this book was offering but it barely offered enough tips to start homesteading more detailed specific examples or instructions on how to get started would have been appreciated several typos and an awkward writing style made this a somewhat difficult read,48,8
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,5.0,positive,I have been working on being more self sufficient so i started my own veggie garden really glad i found this book urban homesteading is loaded with tips ideas and strategies to help get you started with self sufficiency i really like the chapter on making your own food thanks,49,9
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,4.0,positive,enough to get you interested for more you will have to do more research please especially if you are thinking of getting livestock,23,10
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,3.0,neutral,i am brand new to this concept i was looking for supporting information along withbyguides since i am clueless in this area the information was good to give you helpful information however i did not get thebyguide,45,11
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,1.0,negative,edit edit edit rainwater is not a they and more the lack of editing in this book and some of the words used distract from the ideas in this book the more i read the more disgusted i became you see i have homesteaded before and this book does not count as a guide for a beginner there is a lot of information covered and as a result too much of it is vague or not carefully explained it would be better to toss out the fluff and flesh out the rest of it what was the point of including a chapter on organicwaxing on about the benefits but not giving information on how to properly care for hens sorry one paragraph telling us to let the hens roam free feed them homemade organic matter and claiming that organicdo not induce the hens to molt is not acceptable for explaining how to care for hens,157,12
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,1.0,negative,unfortunately i was not able to get but a few pages into the ebook author references a tomato and carrot being plucked from a tree and states that to set up a rural homestead you must be willing to give up even electricity although that is an option for those going off the grid it is not a requirement for a rural homestead numerous grammatical and punctuational errors throughout poorly constructed i am thankful i purchased while it was free,79,13
Kindle_Store,B00LAGPOO0,2.0,negative,this book is more about encouragement than information it also needed editing for example a carrot fresh from the tree makes no sense carrots being root vegetables moreover telling readers things like make sure your plants have enough sun but not too much sun or just enough water neither too much or too little is not helpful unless you also give symptoms of what plants look like when they get too much sun or water and more beginning gardeners or homesteaders would especially need that kind of information in short not a good gardening book not a good chicken raising book really just a book encouraging people to consider urban homesteading but not a how to book,120,14

Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,it took me back for a second look at bill clintons presidency then it gave me an insightful view of hillary she is an amazing woman she was definitely eclipsed by president obamas campaign in 2008 but i do not think we have heard the last of her the dems could do a lot worse in nominating someone else for the next presidential candidate,63,3
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,nothing but battlespace prep for 2016 all propoganda ignores the facts crimes malignant personality and utter incompetance of this horrible person utterly out of touch with america in every way shape form,32,4
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,not a review if you really want to get to know the real hillary read edward kleins book the truth about hillary i see some of the reviews seem to sympathize with her just as you will get people to side with stalin and hitler I am being to the popint here this woman is evil,53,5
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,this read like it was a propaganda pamphlet for hillary i am not political at all but the yeah me quality was so overwhelming that i became disgusted and simply never finished the horrible piece who wants to read a book about someone patting themselves on the back all the time,51,6
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,i am a fan of hillary so i knew i would like this book it was very interesting and made me like her even more,25,7
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,2.0,negative,a somewhat disjointed look at the life of hillary clinton quick read the writer obviously admires her and occasionally gets side tracked by talking about events during the clinton presidency,30,8
Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,i chose this title because of my sincere interest in this being hillarys time to become president of these united states of america marshall has given us a work with a personable and satisfying journal-like approach you are certain to enjoy this insightful look at our next president hillary rodham clinton,51,9

Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,as so many things clinton opinions veer to the extreme i like to make up my own mind so it was a pleasure to read this book that while it certainly discusses politics does so without indulging in politics this is a well-written portrait of a woman who has embodied and defined our times it sticks to the facts which from this reader and follower of all things political is high praise,73,14
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,1.0,negative,could not have been more trite what surprised me the most was when you finally get to the heart of the book also known as the actual diet plan you are told to do the slim fast diet wow really very disappointing,39,0

Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,3.0,neutral,i like this book for it is revolutionary and probably out of ordinary suggestions to lose weight for some this is a waste of time and money and i can believe that some tips here are not scientifically proven to be effective but still for me losing weight is a case to case basis i for one could lose 1 kilo in a week then gain it a week after that is without any special diet only with occasional workouts i found this book after reading goodlife fitness helpful tips to achieve healthy living healthy living series in which can be applicable to most people as it centers around what is the fact,113,3
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,5.0,positive,some of the ideas are tough to follow but if you can do it this stuff really works so still to it and you will see results,26,4
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,1.0,negative,this book will not tell you anything you do not already know in fact he will tell you to buy other books to get the information you need [ and you will need to because you will not find it here ] he uses this book to advertise for his other [ more expensive ] book and that is really all this is do not waste your time with this,61,5
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,5.0,positive,i think this book gives great tips on how to start and loose a couple of pounds fast even although i can apply certain thing permanently like 15 - 30 minutes of vigorous exercising especially when it busy and on the go all the time that is basically the concept behind curve circuit training,51,6
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,3.0,neutral,interesting tips on weight loss this book has some nice and cool suggestions although i did not like when kevin the author began suggesting various book on weight loss if you are just starting your diet regime you will find this book useful if you have some experience nothing new here book is written in a simple and understandable tone and it is easy to read,63,7
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,5.0,positive,i did not know what to say so i copyed something of course all this jiggling and joggling of body is caused by an unquiet uncontrolled mind in a cure for it lies in quieting controlling and restful erecting the mind i have found no aid so great as that of making the mind follow the body movements the motion of an awning mind are not only very jerky and wasteful but they are exceedingly quick such a mind vibrates with the speed again destructiveness of lightning and the owner simply can not compel it to be absolute be quiet but he can direct as well as to a very great extent by directing the mind to follow the body motions which are infinitely slower than mental motions he can accomplish great things to ward quieting the line by a little practice the mind catches a slower more regular vibrations of the body after which it is quite possible still further quiet it to a complete standstill as in making the mind a blank,172,8
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,2.0,negative,very short and really did not say much read it and wondered why it was even written anyone that is overweight will not learn anything from reading this,27,9
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,4.0,positive,good insight and a few websites straight forward and to the point the info can be used with most diet plans,21,10
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,1.0,negative,do not bother there is nothing here that is helpful it actually tells you to get other books for recipes ridiculous,20,11
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,2.0,negative,keep your calories at 1200 and exercise these are things we already know i was hoping for something a little more insightful,22,12
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,1.0,negative,waste of money do not waste your moneytells you to drink slim fast come on really not worth it at all,20,13
Kindle_Store,B006S4X7DE,4.0,positive,this was honest and to the point i recommend this book to my friends and family one key thing that was mentioned is that this is not to exceed past 45 days,33,14
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,3.0,neutral,this version is okay but if you are expecting the version from facebook you will be disappointed this is more like the home version where you only have two rolls,30,0
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,5.0,positive,i love this game so much i love playing it on my computer all of the time i think everyone should play it,23,1
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,3.0,neutral,this is an ok game although the other farkle games i have played have allowed straights also it is a little like zilch and a little like yahtzee there is a lot of finger work on the older kindles which i have and i suspect that it would be much easier on the touch or the fire considering that it was only 99 cents i suppose it was worth what i paid for it,75,2
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,1.0,negative,i thought this sounded fun i have the actual game and love it but this electronic one is awful do not waste your money,23,3
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,3.0,neutral,i made a mistake on the frakle review i was talking about the one on facebook not the one on kindle the one on kindle is great i love it,30,4
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,4.0,positive,i love this game but i wish it had the same rules as regular farkle but it is still a good game,21,5
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,4.0,positive,this is a good interprettion of agame which has many names such as zilch you are out and others the object is to make the scoring combos in aroll unlike yahatzzy the winning combos are not based on poker per se but are seemingly arbitrary rules of this game each variation of matching or sequencing numbers gives points often lots of them and the goal is to reach the winning total before your opponent easy to learn yes addictive yes yes you will likely find yourself saying just one more round and i know i can do better the only downer and why 4 not 5 stars is that it is sometimes a bit clumbsy to maneuver with the square controller but that is not a severe drawback and if you likegames i suggest giving it a try,139,6
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,1.0,negative,this verson of farkle is awful truly awful the game play is clumsy the few options available are laughable and yet the interface is complicated do not waste your time or money on this one,34,7
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,1.0,negative,this version of the game is very simplistic stick with the real deal there are so few options that the game is not challenging at all,25,8
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,2.0,negative,the rules are established and not recognizable by any farkel i have played it is a very limiting game is there a way to delete it,26,9
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,3.0,neutral,the game of farkle the way i learned to play is very different each player gets three rolls a roll of 4 of any number is worth 1ooo points,29,10
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,5.0,positive,it took me a while to catch on but if you keep playing you soon will see what it means to farkle still having a good time playing especially if I am waiting in the car for someone not at all boring,41,11
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,2.0,negative,i have played farkle on the net for years but this version is clumsy to play and not very versatile on a simple kindle i will continue to look for a friendlier download,33,12
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,2.0,negative,in the regulargame you can choose to shake thein the regular game you can shake theuntil you lose or until you stop this came does not give you a choice,35,13
Kindle_Store,B006YXIF8G,5.0,positive,grew up playing this with my mom then playing this with my cousins and using pennies nickles dimes and quarters to make it a gambling game many fun nights when i was young and in my 20s,37,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,3.0,neutral,appears to be a nice slim case however the coating on the case chips easily this only appears to compromise the aesthetic quality but not the protective quality of the case the included screen protector impedes the touch response more so than other screen protectors that i have used but that is an easy thing to switch out,57,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,3.0,neutral,i like this case but it is not overwhelming I am a little paranoid about scratching the phone so i like feeling of protection i get from it the two main things that keep it from getting five stars from me are the fit and the included screen protector neither one is all that bad but as others have mentioned there are gaps between the halves of the case and the screen protector does have some strange bubbles under it it is fine for now but I am going to look for something better,90,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,4.0,positive,positives it is a great looking case i love the feel and texture of it best looking case out there in my opinion and also comes with a clear film to protect the screen negatives putting on the film and case at the same time is a very difficult and tedious task unless you have your own screen protector the process may take a while since the film is not sticky it also bubbles alot and it took me forever to apply it bubblefree the case also does not fully close i put it on properly but there is still space at all four corners the spaces are pretty small although and not that much of a big deal to me have to wait until the first drop to see whether the case hugs it as tight as it does overall I am happy about how the case looks and feels the screen protector is garbage and the case could have been made better to fit the phone,165,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,1.0,negative,the second i put this case on it scratched my phone and not just alittle scratch a deep one it also dose not even fit right,26,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,2.0,negative,i chose this case because of the looks and the slim unobtrusive feel I have had it on the phone since the date is was purchased for a total of about 6 months now and my iphone has scratches on the chrome trim and small scratches on the back side not real happy about that i can not comment on the included screen protector i used another instead,66,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,2.0,negative,the back and top covers help in protecting the sides and back the screen supplied with the case is terrible due to the way the covers fit together they make the screen almost jam onto the iphone screen this made the phone hang because it seemed to be unsure whether my phone was still stuck to my ear or not additionally bubbles and moisture formed under the screen and yes it was a bit complicated to get the covers to fit together for those who areconscious although the description indicates that it is black it is really transparent instead of what i hoped would be a cool-looking black since i will need to buy another screen probably from the apple store maybe the type that sticks to the iphone screen rather than the hard plastic given with the griffin it makes the price of protecting my phone more than i thought when i found this product on amazon why have not i rated it 1 star at least the back of the phone which is probably protected by the metal is covered and will not scratch not that it looks very classy through the transparent plastic / silicone which you do not want happening with the great-looking iphone,205,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,1.0,negative,this case was recommended to me by a friend they love theirs but i deeply regret my purchase the case would be perfect if not for the fact that it had one chip in the rubbery plastic of the back by the end of the first day it was on the iphone and several days latter there are several pits and chips the inside of the plastic is much different than the outside making each defect that much more noticeable i bought this case because it covered up thebetween the iphone and the iphone screen it does that but it is getting deeper pits and more chips the longer i use it as i keep my iphone in a very small purse that only contains my bus pass and my leather credit card / identification holder i can not even imagine what is causing the chips and pits i have another case that does not cover screenwhich i used for a month before purchasing this one that case is as pristine as the day i bought it,180,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,4.0,positive,my only complaint is that the top cover has some sort of film that peels off a little piece at a time,22,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,5.0,positive,i was nervous to buy this case because of the negative reviews on here but i gambled on the positives and have not been disappointed pluses great looking case the wave design is cool looking i also like that the back is semitransparent so you can see the apple logo fits the iphone tightly not sure what the issue is with people not being able to put it together right just follow the instructions and it fits perfectly not bulky at all the phone does not feel much bigger at all with it on provides a much needed grip before i always felt a bit that the phone was about to shoot out of my hand if i squeezed too tight this case provides enough grip in your hand but it is not tacky / sticky plastic or rubber so it does not get stuck in your pocket negatives yes the included screen protector is terrible do not use it however this does not detract from the rest of the case it looks and works fine without the screen protector if you must have a screen protector just buy one separately that got good reviews buy this for the excellent case,204,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,3.0,neutral,i loved the case when i first got it it was a little tricky to get on but anyone with anbetter than an 8 year olds will get the hang of it after a couple of tries anyways the case is super protective but the silicone frosting started to peel off immediately and has continued to worsen throughout the past month it is especially bad on the edges i would not buy another one like it but i do not hate it enough to drop another 34,87,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,5.0,positive,i must have bought over 10 different covers for my phone griffin belkinand i have to say this is the best because it protects the corners as i tend to drop my phone the others just clip on but does not wrap the corners like this one i would get this if you are looking for a sturdy case the best part it was under [ ] bucks,68,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,5.0,positive,this is a great case as long as you do not use the included screen protector go out and get yourself an anti-glare screen protector and put that on first then put the case on make sure you put the case on correctly i have seen so many people use this case incorrectly if the flaps are not tucked over and under the proper places of course it is going to look funny one problem the finish on the back of my case started peeling i called griffin and they sent me out a new one within days at no charge to me at all it was so easy looks great very sleek great customer service i highly recommend,117,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,3.0,neutral,the look and feel is good i like the fact that it came with a screen protector film with the case however it is an absolute pain to get it on the phone because of the weird wavy design atleast it was for me also after you get it on over time moisture settles underneath the film and causes weird bubbles,61,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,5.0,positive,I have been using the griffin wave case on my iphone 3 g for a year and have just switched it over to my new iphone 3gs heres what i love about this case it is subtle smooth provides a slightly tactile feel to the slick iphone and it seems indestructible I have dropped this case on the floor a half a dozen times this year and both the case and the phone are just fine every month or two i take the case off and wash it with dish soap and let it dry in between i wipe the phone down with a cloth after a year of use i can say that this is one of the best phone or pda cases I have ever owned,124,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B4AAJ0,2.0,negative,the griffin wave case is without a doubt very protective but it has one very serious design flaw the rubberized coating touted all over the box peels off days after putting the case on for me an entire chunk of the back of the case was missing the coating it does not hinder it is protectiveness but it makes it feel really slippery and it looks like crap,66,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,3.0,neutral,i had this for a week and the top part started to fall off so i do not use it anymore at first it was too tight on my cell and when i tried to get it off my cell would come apart then it started to fit nicely and i love the material and design so much cuter in person but after a week or 2 the front cover started to come off and now it does not stay on so sad because i really loved it,83,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,2.0,negative,had trouble with the phone and needed to remove the cover to retrieve the battery the tab that holds it on the phone broke off so now it is worthless,30,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,3.0,neutral,like the case but it started to chip right away it was not even a week before the paint started to come off ok case overall although,26,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,1.0,negative,i dropped the phone once on my kitchen floor and it broke cute design but not durable at all if your looking for a durable case this is not it but if you want a cute phone cover this does it,42,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,4.0,positive,my boyfriend bought me this case and it is very cute i love the owl and the little animals everywhere it is definitely a lot sturdier than any of the cases I have ever owned and they were sold to me by my phone company the only reason i scored it down was because thewas not quite as bright as it looks on the display it is definitely much duller but i still like it it fits my phone very well and the part that clips it to the phone is very strong I have had problems with those parts breaking off the case in the past for something at this price the product far exceeded my expectations definitely a great bargain,118,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,4.0,positive,i just got this a couple of days ago and it works well does the job and it is very stylish,20,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,5.0,positive,okay i am not a teenager or a 20 30 or even 40 something but i do love cute things and this cover just took my plain white android phone to a newer happier level you can not beat the price either i would recommend these products to everybody at this great price you can afford to get a few to change the look of your phone i love the feel of it too it is not sticky feeling like most or hard metal feeling like some but a smooth yet subtle finish that is the best of both worlds,96,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,2.0,negative,it broke way too easy when trying to put a sd card in the phone however the colors are nice just be prepared for heartbreak when the cheap plastic breaks,29,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,4.0,positive,nice and cute case offers minimal protection just more for looks than anything not very durable and breaks easy would recommend if just wanting a cute look for your phone packaged well decent price considering and excellent shipping time thank you,41,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,4.0,positive,i really like this cute little cover but the paint seems to be wearing for the price it is a great deal since it is sturdy and protects the phone i did buy 2 so when the paint completely comes off i can use the other,45,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009JBABG4,2.0,negative,i bought this for my daughters phone because she really liked the owl design it was cool at first but did not hold up very long it broke after about a month so stay away from this case if your looking for something durable,43,14
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,5.0,positive,what has not to love about more walking dead i really enjoyed the story and learning more about the governors story,20,0

Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,5.0,positive,all of the walking dead series is a page turner never a dull moment always leaves you wanting more horrible good,21,5
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,4.0,positive,I am an avid walking dead fan who has seen some negative reviews in my opinion this is well worth the money and a must read for any twd fan,28,6
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,3.0,neutral,it is a short story that ties in the first two books oft he governor series together do not buy if you already have issue 1 of the magazine because it s the same story from it so if you would rather have it in print buy it that way,47,7
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,5.0,positive,very persona lifel story one who need to know very entrainment to own one,14,8
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,1.0,negative,basically you are paying for a preview the first two chapters of the road to woodbury just another day at the office is a very short story it is about 1/3 as long as a chapter in one of the two walking dead books so far and it does not really add anything to the plot and is barely worth reading knowing what i know now i would not have bought it i would rather have my 99 cents back I am a big fan of the walking dead but this should be free given it is poor quality and value i wonder if the people giving it good reviews had not read the road to woodbury yet it might be a cheap way to give the first two chapters of that book a try but I had buy that book before I had waste my 99 cents here and the original excerpt is definitely very short and uneventful and definitely not worth the 99 cents,159,9
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,3.0,neutral,i was pretty bummed that you really only get a few pages of content the story itself was worth reading but the first chapter of the next book took up more space than this story did,35,10
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,4.0,positive,over half of the number of advertised pages were a preview of the next book otherwise it was a good story,21,11
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,2.0,negative,great story but the free preview is almost the whole story it wad almost a waste of the purchase price maybe it could be longer by providing more introduction info about the rescuers,33,12
Kindle_Store,B009E5VHOK,5.0,positive,i am a avid watcher of the walking dead and it def gave me a better insight of the govenor while watching,22,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,i just recived this product about a week ago although i ordered a blue and orange case i recived a case which is very much purple and orange but it is still a nice case i have recieve many compliments on it,42,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,the colors were great because it represented my team but the durability of the product itself was not too good it already started falling apart i would order another one but it is not worth the time and delievery it was fun while it lasted,43,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,it is more of a purpleand def not blue at all other than that it is a good bumper case as good as any i have used they are more like disposable ones since really they do not last more than about 5 months or so the rubber starts becoming stretched out but at the price i usually just buy a couple at once,63,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,it was really cheap but thewas not real i thought it was the homeas new york knicks but it was actually purple and orange if you do not really care about that then it is a good case,40,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,it feels cheap with some unfinished sharp seams in the plastic but considering the price it is a good deal,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,well I am not the type of guy to write reviews on anything nor do i feel as although what most people write are accurate but in this case it is the photo makes the case appear to be a nice bright shinny orange and a dark glossy blue however in my case no pun intended laughing out loud it has a dull orange band and a vilot / pruple rubberknowing this i probially would have pasted on the case but what do you get for 2 also the sleep button is very sloppy and has to be in the correct postion to work or else another oart hold it down and it constantly tries to power down the iphone hope this helps,120,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,it is a very cute and likable case i get many compliments the only problem is it is not much protection but it is good besides that,25,14

Kindle_Store,B007HIMU3S,1.0,negative,nothing on this book that can not be found online with a simple google search do not waste your money on this garbage,21,10
Kindle_Store,B007HIMU3S,1.0,negative,you can not fake talent some of my favorite songs have only one chord so i do not understand what has so great about the number three it is not the number of chords you play but how you play them there are numerous ways to play one chord no what you really need is conviction if you can tell me a story and make it sound believable make it sound true like it really happened to you or convey a feeling and make me feel it all you need to do is strum one chord I shall listen if you can do that you do not need anyones advice cb,105,11
Kindle_Store,B007HIMU3S,3.0,neutral,was not exactly what i thought it would be i thought there would be actual song chording but you do get instructed on how to change the chording to other keys,30,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,4.0,positive,this cover is pretty thin it looks good and keeps the iphone compact the cover helps maintain battery life because the screen does not turn on accidentally i gave it a 4 rather than 5 because if you are looking for lots of protection ie if you plan to drop your phone frequently then this is probably not the best protection realistically this is a 45 rating price is great,73,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,3.0,neutral,i thought the leather was thicker and more plush but it was not it still serves it is purpose of protecting the phone from scratches it does not add to the weight of the phone which is good to me it does not weigh down my purse I shall use it till it wears out,50,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,3.0,neutral,this is really pretty but the flip top is a pain i thought it would be like the old flip phones no different than that it is different the cover interferes with the camera function on my phone do not like it,42,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,5.0,positive,this case is very functional the cover flips up instead of down this is why i bought it good quality and workmanship,22,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,5.0,positive,this is a great case for the iphone 5 esp for the price i constantly get compliments and i have dropped my phone a few times already and no damage the front cover really does the job of protecting the glass the only drawback is that you have to hold the cover up when you take a picture but that does not bother me at all,67,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,1.0,negative,this iphone 5 looks nice in the picture but the actual product does not look as good hope i did not buy it,22,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,4.0,positive,it is not too big the magnet closure works well it is only been a week although the plastic tray holds the body of the phone snugly i left the plastic on the front of the phone until i get a proper plastic protector for the face of the phone it is light nicekind of a light burgundy the front can be folded back behind the body of the case so that it is not flapping all around while you are using it who can say if that will eventually because the front cover to break off but i will not borrow that trouble from tomorrow today i am enjoying the case this will buy me time to investigate a real protective case for the phone it arrived as promised and was packaged appropriately i would order from this seller again,138,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,1.0,negative,the red plastic inner case left redon sides of my white iphone never ever buy this flip case unless you have a black iphone5,26,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,3.0,neutral,good fast delivery product ok for the price I have had it for about 2 weeks and the threading coming appart already i do love thei would not say is a premium leather case,35,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,5.0,positive,this case is great it fits the iphone 5 perfectly the phone just snaps into place the little tab has a small magnet that holds the case shut and you can flip the tab backward to hold the case open while using the phone the red is nice and rich great price update after a few months the threads have started to come out of the sides i have to clip them every couple weeks still a nice product and the leatherhas held up well but not the fanciest option,91,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,4.0,positive,this case looks more expensive than it was it has a nice magnetic lock and is highly functional but a bit awkward for picture taking,24,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,1.0,negative,it was cheap and it feels like it flimsy side and the leather stitching is fraying already do not buy it,20,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,3.0,neutral,this case is attractive and effective as a protector for my iphone 5 however the threads began to show signs of fraying soon after i got the case so i find myself babying it a bit,36,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,5.0,positive,this case is exactly what i was looking for i feel i have better screen protection without increasing the bulk of the phone unlike other flip cases this one also has side coverage which i love i did take the liberty of decorating the otherwise boring look but that is just personal preference love this case love the price and the shipping was lightning fast,64,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008OSES58,4.0,positive,the case is classy but not showy it fits my iphone 5 att perfectly the fact that the cover flips from the bottom up is helpful for taking photos in landscape view as it provides something to hold on to away from the lens on the phone I am giving it only four stars because the inside lining which touches the phone is hard plastic i would have preferred a soft fabric so i left the protector that came on the phone from the factory on the back to protect it from scratches,92,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Z29550,4.0,positive,it is a nice solid case only problem is that it is more of a dark pink then a red it is no where near as red as thein the pic it is still not bad although high quality case for a good price you may want to consider like a blue although unless your looking for a really light red,61,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,2.0,negative,too hard to push the top on off button if you push really hard it will work about 1/2 the time sent back to amazon and will try the speck candyshell grip,32,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,4.0,positive,like many others i had this case for my iphone 4 and loved it inexpensive fit well felt good in my hand and protected my phone this new one for the iphone 5 is pretty much the same reason for 4 star rating like many others the button on top of the phone is difficult to press and the backhas a slightly sharpto it neither is a deal breaker for me if incipio had kept it same as before would have been a 5,88,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,4.0,positive,after 11 months of daily usage the case has stretched maybe a millimeter to allow some wiggle room but has been great otherwise has outlasted 2 iphone 5ss,28,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,1.0,negative,as others stated it is hard to push the top button i put a piece of paper between the phone and the case and it works great it was thin cardboard from a chewing gum package folded in half,39,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,5.0,positive,just what i wanted and here in two days,9,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,3.0,neutral,created massive bubbling on the sides of my screen protector and it did not have as snug a fit as i expected,22,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,4.0,positive,i ordered this ngp case for my iphone 5s straight from the ngp website i paid a bit more because i figured i would be getting their latest design production rather than old stock it fits the 5s perfectly however the power / sleep button is hard to press compared to the ngp case on my iphone 4s there is something different about the design for that button between the two models and i do not think that incipio has completely fixed the issue at the same time i do not think we should exaggerate how bad the problem is even although it is harder to press the button the amount of force is reasonable so it does not accidentally get pushed inside pockets and i am still happy that i bought this case for my iphone 5s I have used many different cases and the ngp is still my favorite since it provides outstanding protection considering how slim it is i would still buy this again,161,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,1.0,negative,do not buy this case it is terrible i bought mine off fab should have known there was something up with these pros it fits you get the intended thin body of the iphone 5 cons the plastic is cheap feeling and stiff thenear the screen will get under your screen protector and peel it off at the corners the power button is a workout to push and the plastic is like holding down a guitar string you need some calluses by trying to mimic the lines of the phone body in the case the edges are sharp or rough on the back of the phone making it uncomfortable to hold it is really slippery for me I am all for getting it in and out of my pockets easily but I had rather it not feel like a stick of butter it looks like you won it after turning in some skee ball tickets pass find something else if i could return i would,161,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,5.0,positive,this is a great case for the iphone 5 it is also a good value for the money would definitley recommend this case,23,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,3.0,neutral,the shiny metallic back scratched too easily and it is quite thick i bought another incipio product instead and love it so it is just this particular model that is not worth the effort,31,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,3.0,neutral,i like the feel i like thebut like other reviews before the edges are sharp and not as rounded as previous models and the sleep button is very stiff clickable but needs pressure i had an incepio case for the iphone 4 and was amazing this newer model is ain the wrong direction still a great case protects well and very low profile just a couple small complaints worth the 10 bucks or however much it is on amazon,83,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,3.0,neutral,i had the same kind of case for my 4s and loved it this one is not my favorite the power button has to be pressed really hard to even work and the edges on the back side are actually pretty sharp overall not very impressed,46,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,5.0,positive,it is a nice quality case and i really like the look and feel of it and it is very protective as well,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,2.0,negative,having owned the ngp case for iphone 4 i will say that this one is an obviousdown in quality and usability as others have mentioned the bottom area does not sit flush to the phone curving outwards I am not sure if this is due to manufacturing issues or poor design however the most glaring flaw also previously mentioned is that the top button takes too much effort to push i fixed this macgyver style by sticking layers of tape cut into tiny rectangles scotch or electrical will do on the inside concave area where the case makes contact with the button it is ridiculous that i had to engineer such a solution had incipio done a bit more testing instead of rushing the product to market they would have realized that they would have needed to fill in said area with a bit more plastic,147,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0098FKJXQ,3.0,neutral,very functional indeed but also very boring design,8,14
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,5.0,positive,the very beginning was a little flowery in description which tempted me to quit right there i read on in the sample and bought the book this has fascinating characters a wide range of kinds of people and creatures and lots of action with a little mystery coupled with some romance the ending is nicely done so that the tale is wrapped up but there is room for more books with the same characters i will read any future books in this series,83,0
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,3.0,neutral,i liked the premise of the book and the world it was set in however the main character mistral was very unlikeable she was rash beyond reason crazy moody and would have temper tantrums she did not even care about the people who raised her when she found out her adopted mother had died even although her adoptive parents were really good to her she did not care then she met some guy and after several days it seemed as if she became a totally different person although her brat-like qualities were still consistent i read the whole book hoping my view of her would change because i liked some of the supporting characters and the plot ideas but when the book ended i knew i would not be reading the sequel if mistrel had been tweaked in varying situations to make her more likeable and less volatile i think i would have liked the book yet as it stands i would not recommend it,163,1
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,2.0,negative,starts off great crazy brave awesome woman warrior takes on monsters and evil and survives with the help of her warrior brothers then she turns into a weak sniveling whiny baby when she falls in love i find it unrealistic that such a tough and fearless girl could change so much and even if she could why does she let the guy dictate to her that she must persue the sight he keeps telling her to be who and what she wants which is a warrior not a seer but she keeps giving in and let us everyone around her force her to be a seer stupid and unbelievable at best,108,2
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,4.0,positive,this book had an interesting story with a longer coming of age plot line than i expected but still managed to pull it off my only possible issues were with the main character who i had trouble relating to until a good way into the book and speed with which the story developed either way i would still recommend anyone in this genre to read it as the story ok and the price is not to bad either,78,3
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,4.0,positive,the problem is the main character and the emotional wreckage she is way too much time spend on this and not enough on action most characters are well done except the main hunts are too short and lack punch only to see the character fall back on her mental state as soon as possible,51,4
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,3.0,neutral,this is the first of four or more books i enjoyed reading it but could not get interested in the sequel although i tried several times this rough and tumblebecomes a love struck puppy at the end and never gets over it,44,5
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,3.0,neutral,i had a hard time reading through the book due to the inconsistencies on mistrals experience on one hand we hear how she is such a great hunter and as any hunter knows is patience and that is one thing she does not seem to have the book is peppered with a lot of whining and temper tantrums thrown in with how inexperienced she is in her role if i did not know she was supposed to be older i would assume she was all of 5 with how her character seemed to evolve it does get a 3 although for the vivid descriptions of the surroundings if a second book came out i know i will not be buying it considering i have to keep skipping over so much of irritations in this book,132,6
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,2.0,negative,the first few paragraphs were hard to read due to punctuation errors and i never complain about that but it sets the tone of the book right after her adopted parents loving discussion about her future said child is cold and unfeeling towards them this theme is repeated as the teenager refers to her home as a prison and never considers the love they gave her as another reviewer said the heroine is a real turnoff i also had problems with the collage dorm attitude that the training camp had all party at the bar after working out all day sophomore jealousy i am barely into this book and just can not force myself to read more the plot if there is one lost in the endless descriptions of daily life if author was trying to recreate a harry potter type of interesting school grounds he or she failed big time so tired of the teenager that can do it all again this was a kindle unlimited book and free thank goodness,171,7
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,2.0,negative,i had enough after i read about half of the book the story simply was not really interesting and neither were characters in the end i just did not care what happens next i personally felt reading any further would just be a waste of my free time the characters do not seem to have any depth and it is really hard to find the main character likable she is stubborn and thoughtless and quite often acts like a spoiled brat she often gets angry when someone reasons with her and actually does not seem to display any other emotions until of course she gets in love the love interest thread of the main character seems to me to have been just bluntly inserted like something off a checklist and the relation further seems incredibly out of character and incredibly unnatural overall i do not think will be waiting for any other works in this series,151,8
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,5.0,positive,can not wait for the next one i love all the characters exept maybe fabian it is well written and awesome in all ways,22,9
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,2.0,negative,too simple characters with little development and a very vague world building the main character is also social stupid if not all-around plain dumb especially considering she can read and understand all feelings in others it also feels off how the main character turns from unfeeling to obsessed in no time and with a deus ex machina reason,58,10
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,3.0,neutral,interesting story that kept you wondering what would happen next the overall sappy love drama was deffinately overplayed and quickly became boring,22,11
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,2.0,negative,could not connect with the characters did not like the main character at all she is rude childish and self centered prone to tantrums and anger displays it was difficult to read about something you do not like will not make the same mistake again would not recommend,43,12
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,5.0,positive,i do wish all the errors would be edited out btw wolverines are big nasty weasels and are not related in any way to wolves,25,13
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,5.0,positive,glad i bought the first book before seeing the negative comments i have really enjoyed this series of books I shall grant that the main character is brash and offensive but that is the point her name is mistral which essentially means a harsh wind she is stormy willful and undisciplined entirely ruled by her emotions the series is about her growth i like the characters and appreciate the world ms jones has created fun experience if it gives anof how much I have liked it i got the fifth book thru kindleunlimited 995 a month for unlimited qualifying books but ended up buying it after i read it so i could add it to my permanent library,118,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,1.0,negative,this look a metal case and they price like a metal case but when i received this case i was very disappointed in is a cheap case that you can get at the 99 cent store do not be fool by this case it look great online but is a cheap plastic that you can fold with your hand and it will not protect your phone,64,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,1.0,negative,i purchased this case on 5/25/11 and by 6/20 the plastic piece just above the volume control broke off within the next month a crack appeared on the backside and the corner guard above the volume fell off today I had rate myself as an average cell phone user in terms of gentleness i do not pamper my phone but i also do not drop it that often in fact i believe I have only dropped it once the reason we get cases for our iphones is to protect them surprisingly this case has scratched the aluminum core running around the outside of the phone which i find odd do yourself a favor an find another case this one looks cool but will be in pieces shortly after you begin using it,128,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,3.0,neutral,great fitting and feeling case slim and comfotable in the hand but it is already cracked in two or three places still works ok but dissatisfied about the plastic quality or lack thereof j,33,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,2.0,negative,i bought this case thinking it fully covered the outside of my iphone but it did not the pictures online made it difficult to determine the full shape unfortunately after only just a few days i dropped my phone and the side of the case cracked was not worth the money,49,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,5.0,positive,product arrived quickly and looked just like the pictures looks great on my iphone 4 and I have gotten so many compliments on it i love it,26,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,3.0,neutral,i bought this right before the holidays and while the case looks really cool their plastic is not strong enough over the volume control and this has broken twice i have a second iphone case that i switch between but i doubt that this case will last more than 6 months the price is great but i would not recommend it to others unless you are buying it only for a short-time,71,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,1.0,negative,i read the reviews before i ordered this case so many people wrote that it broke or chipped way too soon i thought i am a careful woman surely it will not happen to me wrong it did the first day i had the case maybe my hand was not used to the case but i dropped it the phone was protected which i guess is the point but the right lower corner of the case broke off it is now totally worthless i learned from this to not only read the reviews but to take the advice too and does it matter that it was cute for the few hours i used it no not at all,116,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,3.0,neutral,i had the black version of this case prior to this one which broke unfortunately when my phone was dropped the silver is much more cheap looking and has a cheap feeling to it the photos look much better online than in person,43,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,2.0,negative,this cover is so cheaply made and really adds very little protection to the phone if you are just trying to not scratch the sides and the back this is the cover for you as long adn you do not bump it too hard or drop it from a minimal distance you are good the thin area between the volume and vibrate buttons and the front face cracked through after about a week of taking it in and out of my pocket and a small pump into our coffee table laughing out loud this cover looks cool but you should also purchase the clear film protective shields for the back of your phone also as dust accumulates in the holes of this cover and it may because scratches to the phone and we all know that cell phones hold their value and the better you take care of it the more you will get out of it later all in all i would never purchase this cover again or the other elago ultra thin covers i have had the same experience with those as well,180,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,4.0,positive,this is probably the fourth case I have tried through amazon and the first one that i have not returned it is nice because it is not bulky and all the buttons are easily accessible however the picture does not show that both the top and the bottom of the phone are not covered I am worried about what would happen if it got dropped keeping the case although because it makes the phone look really nice,70,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,1.0,negative,this case looks pretty good but it is poor constructed pieces around the edges have already cracked off and a hairline fracture has appeared on one corner of the case this will no doubt result in a larger piece of the case falling off soon all of this occurred within the first week i have had the case it only cost 10 although so i guess i got what i paid for,72,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,5.0,positive,this cover looks metal but it is not i love this one it just looks really neat on the phone,19,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,2.0,negative,this iphone case is really bad it broke in just a week i got it and it is even harder,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,2.0,negative,looks cool in the pictures looks totally different in hand snaps on to my iphone good enough and offers adequate protection of the back and corners that is all i wanted because I am careful with my phone it is just a small insurance policy that i although would look cool and match the style of my macbook pro wrong this thing is cheap plastic that has poor finishing bits of plastic hang off the edges and i needed to tidy up the edges with nail-cutters there is no shimmer to it like in the photos so it does not even look close to aluminum i knew it was plastic but the photos make it look much better than what it really is i gave it 2 stars because it fits well and was posted quickly the looks are a huge downside,138,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003ZHPWKS,1.0,negative,my case has broken after a week i dropped it accidently from a about 2 feet high and it broke in two spots,23,14
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,2.0,negative,i liked the plot but i felt there was not enough written about after he came home the characters just seemed too vague it is a good read if you just want a lot of heat but there was very little to go off of for a storyline,46,0
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,5.0,positive,denise agnew knows how to write hot military men and this book is no exception the communication in the form of letters between eve and sean add to their chemistry and elevate the sexual tension to flaming intensity male call has all elements of a fun sexy book that will keep you wanting more fortunate for denise agnew fans there are more books in the hot zone series i recommend male call and the other books in the series you will not be disappointed,84,1
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,5.0,positive,wow what a fun little novella eve begins to write to a male friend from work who is now a soldier in iraq the letters pick up the heat with each back and forth until they are dying for each other more happens of course which i will not give away this was a warm funny and touching story about two people who once took each other for granted now connecting through a long-distance relationship seans letters are intense hot and heartbreaking as a person who has experienced a similar situation i found this story to be just right,98,2
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,4.0,positive,I shall be honest i got this book as it was free on kindle I had never read this author before but decided that the price was right as it were i really enjoyed the book the characters were great and while it is quite short i thought the author did a good job with the pacing of the book there is a slight cheese factor but for the price i say go for it i read two others in this series and thought this one was the best i will say however that the stories while have differing plots do have some things that repeat that is a character in the three books i read gets bad feelings about things the men are hotties in disguise or they were / are geeky and more,128,3
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,5.0,positive,my favorite part of romance is the anticipation the excruciating build-up that we all feel between the time that we start wanting someone and the time that it happens that is what makes this book so great,37,4
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,1.0,negative,I am glad it was free on my kindle i deleted it 1/2 way through the plot seemed like potential but the whole story was one cliche after another,29,5
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,3.0,neutral,there has no other way to describe the book other then erotica it is that plan and simple although this book may be on the tamer side of things it is still a cute read the author used her own way of writing to make a story about a solider and a friend he left behind when he went to iraq it is a fun read that will only take you an hour at most to read and it tells a good story between a solider and his love,85,6
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,4.0,positive,as a military spouse i found the book similar to what i have gone through in the early part of iraqi freedom while it was kind of like reading someone has mail sent to his girlfriend it brought back memories i enjoyed it i do see however that it is not for everyone so you might not like it it is also on the short side but at it is price i feel it would be a safe bet that you would not feel jipped by taking a chance on it,88,7
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,4.0,positive,yes much of this story as with others in the hot zone series is superficial and silly old fashioned letter writing suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work the entire scene at the male strip club and more but that is kind of the fun of these stories personally I am a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance and male call despite the awful pun reeled me in for an hour or so worth of reading this story is definitely enjoyable,85,8
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,3.0,neutral,this was a fun read but do not expect anything other than that it was is very short so if you have an hour or two to kill but this will probably leave you rolling your eyes at the end for how cheesy the ending is,45,9
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,2.0,negative,i have gotten some good books for free for my kindle so i decided it would be good to try male call i am sad to say i am very disappointed it is extremely smutty and the use of fowl language is horrible i believe the author did not spend enough time on creating a history for the characters and you are just thrown into what feels like the middle of a book this book is so short i read it on my lunch hour start to finish after skipping about what felt like 20 pages of smut not good but i guess if you like smut this would be a good read,112,10
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,4.0,positive,this is a cute little quick and i mean quick story the plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other for me it got a little annoying but it does not matter sean was crazy sexy and i loved eves personality if you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it is fast paste the sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up,104,11
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,2.0,negative,if a reader wants lots of sex in a very short book this is just the thing but if you are looking for plot or characterization this does not satisfy,30,12
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,2.0,negative,the writing left a bit to be desired seemed more like it was written by a teenager trying to be grown not my favorite and i caught myself rolling my eyes quite a few times,35,13
Kindle_Store,B000SRGF2W,3.0,neutral,i enjoy when the main characters have a long history together this was the case in this novel i also enoyed the correspondence through the use of letters between the main characters it was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel with that being said this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre the plot was a bit predictable and the ending was as always wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow not too realistic but if you are looking for an easy beach read this one is for you,100,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,i purchased this as a gift for a teenager thewas a little too bright and after dropping it so many times it started to crack eventually the phone ended up having a crack in the front,38,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,5.0,positive,i looked all over trying to fine the exact case i needed for my daugher in laws phone this was perfect i love that it has a built in screen protector those that just stick on are incredibly hard to use and do not last exactly what she needed and wanted now her phone is much safer and hopefully will last longer case keeps the phone very well protected,68,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,2.0,negative,the phone is an older generation of phone so finding cases for it is very difficult so i took my search to amazon the case is shit do not order it i gave it two stars because i was lucky that the phone cases even existed and that it shipped like next day but beyond that it stinks,57,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,2.0,negative,the rubber cover does not stay on near the bottom of the phone i have to keep playing with it so it does not come off,25,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,1.0,negative,this product is very cheaply made and broke immediately it lasted about 4 days save your money because it is not worth the 15 dollars,25,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,nice for the price but unfortunately the belt clip falls apart only after 3 - 4 months of use for the price buy extra if you need the belt clip so you have a replacement on hand,35,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,4.0,positive,i love this case it is easy to take apart when my phone malfunctions and not hard on the hands but the rubberized purple part of the case makes it hard to put in my pocket and the bottom charger entrance cover broke off by the next day but it still stayed in tact overall pretty nice,56,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,thought this was a good case at first but not so much now the rubber is too thin and tears real easily where you put the charger in the white plastic is just cheap going to be getting an otterbox,39,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,4.0,positive,this case was wonderful my only complaint was little rubber parts the flaps that hold the rubber onto the hard plastic they felt very flimsy i felt it if i pulled it out of my pocket too hard or too fast it would rip the same goes for the flap covering the charger port other than that it is an absolutely wonderful case for the price and protection,68,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,this is exactly what i wanted a sort of otterbox for an htc but as i kept having to remove the memory card from my phone to put in my computer to upload images one of the little tabs on the side broke off and now the rubber cover does not stay on very well so it is a poor quality but i guess u get what u pay for seeing as how it was so cheap,75,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZS9ZP4,3.0,neutral,it has a smooth touch to the case clasps work really good too so if i drop it i feel it will protect my phone overall nice,26,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZS9ZP4,5.0,positive,love the case it fits great the design is super cute it is also super durable as the phone has fallen out of my backpack twice now and the case is still intact and holding up great there customer service is wonderful my order never showed up so i contacted customer service and they sent me another one right away,59,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZS9ZP4,5.0,positive,i put this case on as soon as i received the package it looks so beautiful and the designs stand out it look almost kind of 3d i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to give their infuse a new look thanks,44,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZS9ZP4,2.0,negative,the design and feel of the material is really lovely unfortunately the case comes in two pieces one that fits over the front and snaps into the backing there is the worst rough-feeling plasticky seam where the two pieces meet it happens to be right where your fingers are when you hold the phone the phone is uncomfortable to hold now and I am disappointed less importantly the design does not match up between the two pieces of the cover lame,79,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004ZS9ZP4,4.0,positive,i bought because i needed some pretty cases but i did not want to pay the big price for the big case,21,5

Kindle_Store,B00HHH8B0U,3.0,neutral,several times the author bounces between present and past tense often in the middle of a sentence but that aside this was a fun read swiftly paced interesting concept i get the feeling the author is young and look forward to her future works as she matures in writing enjoyable story,51,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,1.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this product the armband does not fit the galaxy s4 unless you remove the protective case from your phone even then it is such a tight fit that the plastic is pushes up against the touch screen and causes apps to open or the screen to change so you can not actually use the phone anyway the arm band is ridiculously huge it is not made for one size fits all and the strip of velcro for adjusting it is fairly small i bought this for my wife and it was way too big clearly this is a product with a smaller price point and i was not expecting it to have the quality of some of the pricier armbands that being said i was not expecting it to be so ridiculously off the mark that you could not even fit the phone in it or adjust it to a wearable size while the price tag is tempting this is a deal that is not worth taking,168,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,3.0,neutral,the vktech sport armband is okay but it is really to tight for my galaxy phone so i do not use it at all it need to be slightly larger,28,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,1.0,negative,started out okay but not very comfortable because it pinched my skin i only used it 4 times when the plastic piece broke completely off making it unusable and unable to be fixed,33,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,3.0,neutral,nice band and a great price but my arm is thin and the strap is meant for larger people,19,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,2.0,negative,this is cheap so i did not expect stellar quality however i did expect for it to at least fit the phone the plastic part where the phone fits is too loose for the galaxy s4 even with a case slim ringke fusion there are bends in the plastic screen cover due to the poor fit which hinder the use of the touch screen i agree with other reviews that said this is not for big arms although i do not have that problem,82,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CINM2YE,1.0,negative,the fit was wrong phone was loose arm band pinch my arm when trying to adjust dissatisfied with it,20,7

Kindle_Store,B005JPT86S,1.0,negative,this is not a to-do list of activities for a tourist visiting hawaii it is just a list of personal anecdotes from the author about how to relax and unwind heres what the author lists as must do basics of hawaii taken directly from the pages of her writing 1 walk on the beach 2 listen to a hawaii radio station 3 shade bathing 4 explore your island 5 take time during your vacation to learn about it is fascinating history 6 wear a fresh lei so you get the drift it is all hokey stuff and apparently just personal suggestions and nothing in depth please do not waste your money buying this nonsense and dribble buy something from frommers or any of the other real world books,123,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,2.0,negative,i purchased thisbelieving it would be more flexible than the rubber feel cases i have purchased in the past thus giving my phone a bit more impact resistance when i received it it turns out it is no different than the cases i have had in the past it is simply a hard plastic case with a soft rubber-like coating,62,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,2.0,negative,case initially fits nicely enough and looks great on the phone the problem is once the phone has fallen the case becomes useless due to the fact that the clips that snap the case to the phone immediately break off afterwards the case will not hold to the phone if you buy this case prepare to change one after each fall,61,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,3.0,neutral,i wanted to get a rubber sleeve for my touch pro 2 this one was ok for the price however i have not had it for a week and the rubber on the slide out piece is peeling off only the back piece is brand new still it will have to do while i wait for the smoke snap on case and the body glove one I shall let you know how it goes,70,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,4.0,positive,i have a bunch of firefighters that use htc tilt2 phones and due to the nature of their work they abuse the phones with these economical cases we replace the case whenever they bring the phone in for service and they always look like new the fit is not perfect and the plastic does degrade over time but that is why they are so inexpensive when you understand that you realize that it is a good value for the price,80,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,3.0,neutral,the protective case is great to guard against accidental drops or bumps but the design of the case causes some features to malfunction that is prompts notification screen continuously,28,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,2.0,negative,i was hoping for something that would actually stay on if my phone got dropped and this thing just flies right off it is cheap so if you are not looking to spend a lot of money then this is the way to go but if you are looking for a more quality case you should probably search elsewhere because this is not it the case gets the job done but that is about all it does after taking of off the phone and putting it back on a couple of times it gets loose as well,93,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,4.0,positive,maybe it is not from verizon or sprint apart from that issue it was ok,16,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002V6A2PE,5.0,positive,i wanted cheap case to protect my phone while waiting for a replacement invisi shield i could not have made a better choice this case is not fancy by any means but that is not what i wanted and the price well what can i say it is perfect i have a touch pro 2 from t-mobile and was wise enough to order the case that fits the correct carrier so it fits like a glove for the money it is absolutely perfect,77,7

Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,yes the final shot is similar to the hathcock shot but this a short story with good descriptive writing that shows both the frustrations and emotions of dealing with an enemy sniper and the patience needed to deal with a worthy enemy it is worth the price,46,0
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,there should have been two beginnings and two middle parts of the story to go along with the two endings just think of the number of combinations of a mediocre short story there could have been,36,1
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,an interesting story with an optional ending for the reader to prefer i prefer version 2except that it is the bad-guy who wins in the end but having the bad-guy win is a great twist and does a great job of making the story that much more memorable and emotional i feel it also makes the story more complete in that it answers a question about a character mentioned earlier and honestly the story spends more time proclaiming the expertise of ma and less so that of our guy so why should our guy end up the victor over one who seems the more expert sniper having ma win this encounter also alludes to the fact that the vc did defeat the united states in vietnam in the end,127,2
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,5.0,positive,this short story was beautifully written it was a quick and engaging story i could not put it down once i started to read it choosing an ending was an interesting option the first one i chose i did not like i read the alternative which is the one i should have chosen in the first place based on the details and descriptions i could tell the author has first-hand knowledge about his subject i do not usually like war stories but would recommend this to any one as a human story,92,3
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,i remember going off hill 55 south of danang looking for a sniper that was shooting marines back in 1966 and this story takes me right back to that dreadful time the sounds the smells the rot and the damn bugs,41,4
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very easy short read 10 minutes or so it is almost like a chapter from the many exploits of carlos hathcock,21,5
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very short story characters were not developed as well as they could have been the ending was weird as you get to choose between two different endings,27,6
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,the shirt story was interesting but very familiar if the name of the sniper was changed to carlos you would have a true account of one of the many great shots made by an actual marine corps sniper sgt carlos hathcock known as white feather was a marine sniper in vietnam and had more confirmed kills than any sniper in country this definitely seems like a case of plagarism to me,71,7
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this is a re-telling of carlos hathcocks story without any mention of sargent hathcock of the marines i think it is shameful to do this and it is not very well written anyway not worth the time to download and read it is only a few pages and of almost no value to anyone if you want to read about hathcocks exploits search for other books on amazon but avoid this one completely,71,8
Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this was a very poorly written short story which i thought was misrepresented as a book,16,9

Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,this is a story that is a retelling of other stories save your money and time do not waste it on this waste of ink,23,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,2.0,negative,it is a small and impressive set of headphones but that is pretty much it they fit oddly in the ear and fall constantly every time i wanted to use them i had to pair them with my iphone every time also the sound of the earphones is much too low even at the maximum level move on and buy another earphones i was not pleased with this product so i returned it,73,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,2.0,negative,sound quality decent ease of use is good design is nice and stylish functionality and comfortablity sucks after trying all of the provided ear attachments i was just not able to keep these things in my ears these will definitely not work for exercising i could hardly move my head left to right without them falling out,57,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,4.0,positive,these headphones are great for what they are i was not going to compare them with my bose headphones for the sound quality but they are good for being as small as they are and bluetooth the recharge time is short and they seems to hold a charge for 3 - 4 days for light uses i am happy with them and will consider giving them to friends as gifts,68,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,4.0,positive,i got these because i was in need of some wireless headphones but wanted something different the product works as should had they are a little bigger then normal ear-buds but i can deal with this the sound is great but if you want something that will blast your ears off these are not for you great battery life and easy to connect to your bluetooth products,67,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,1.0,negative,thedid not work when i received it the main button was defected but thewould not stay in my ears while i walked a bit too heavy,29,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,2.0,negative,i loved the design and bought a pair despite the low ratings the rockway will just not stay in your ears forget about walking around in it i stayed motionless and it fell out under 10 seconds coupled with a very average sound quality i just had to return this pair it looks great but just does not perform in the real world get an other brand that understands ergonomics,69,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,1.0,negative,i was so excited at first when i saw this for the first time there were no reviews for the product but i had been waiting years for wireless bluetooth earbuds that had volume controls i bought two pairs when they arrived one of the pairs was broken the second pair worked for maybe 4 days and then stopped working i believe they are not made very well the cord is two long which makes them heavy it only takes a little bump for it to fall out of your ear which includes changing the volume in my opinion that defeates the purpose the cord comes out of the earbuds sideways in my opinion which makes it uncomfortable because it rubs agains your ears if they could fix the issue with them breaking i could have lived with the other issues long enough for a better pair to come out the company itself is not helpful and rejected my negative review of there product they also would not accept my return of the product they would not exchange it either or fix them,183,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,1.0,negative,the worse bluetooth i have ever had the sound quality is so poor the worse part of this product is there is a lag about 2 seconds that mean you can not enjoy the movie or game with this product,39,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,4.0,positive,had these shipped to a relative in the united states and then brought to us in canada which seems to be they only way to get many items from amazon the headphones were easy to pair and everybody who has tried them like them i have freakish small ear canals so the smallest buds are still to large for me but the range seems to fit everybody else who has tried them not the loudest but decent,76,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,5.0,positive,this one meet my usage i do recommend this product if you do not have quite big ears because many people have this issue sound quality considering this is a bluetooth device not bad but if you are really sensitive to sound you will choose another products price meet my standards delivery service fast,56,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,5.0,positive,these headphones are great they are bluetooth so no need to plug into a device can set up on iphone and computer so never going to get up from my desk and have the earbuds pulled out of my ears since it is not corded to computer great product,48,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,3.0,neutral,functionally they are great good range the battery lasts a good time sounds are clear in both directions they are too big to wear comfortably however and i find myself using them much less than i would if they did not keep falling out when i turn my head suddenly,48,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z19G7M,1.0,negative,i received these headphones charged it up it paired with both my iphone and ipad the sounds was not great actually not even good i switched around different tracks and music styles and they all sounded bad there was some kind of hissing noise in the background this happened on both devices i paired it with then it abruptly it stopped working i thought the battery was low so i recharged it overnight everything looked ok in the morning the blue ready led was on indicating a full charge and now nothing it will not turn on will not light nothing the leds light up when connected to the usb port but that is it i will be returning this garbage and continue to look for a better set of headphones,128,13

Kindle_Store,B005JYUWVY,5.0,positive,it is not easy to write a complete satisfying full story in under 7500 words too often a steamy story that short turns into an excuse for nothing but sexual antics with no plot beyond the one that takes place between the sheets or in this case up against the wall that is not the case here tag team is complete full of action and not just action of the sexual kind the storys good the plot is exciting the characters are well-developed and compelling with back-stories and a history they have more at stake than just their attraction to one another the love scene fits well into the plot as a whole but it is not the plot as a whole it is just part of it as it should be this is a wonderful little story i wish it was longer and I had really like to see these two have another go at each other and maybe resolve something of their relationship while they are at it,164,3

Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,5.0,positive,this turned out to be my favorite story in the anthology hearts from the ashes i found theof an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing yes laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story but i like yaoi he is a little effeminate which may seem stereotypical but there are men like this certainly not allmen or even all bottoms yet i rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong handsome men either why are not they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical because this is a fantasy romance not real life laneys clumsiness is a little over the top but his relationship with dev is sweet and hot i would have liked the characters to be more developed but this is a short story not a novel langley sets the stage for her with or without werewolf series which gets more depth in the next two novels overall i have enjoyed everything from this author especially the werewolves check out the next two without reservations and with caution highly recommended,191,0
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,5.0,positive,i absolutely love the funny werewolves of jl langley after without reservation here it is with love dev is a strong werewolf who arrives to asheville for business like every good werewolf he wants to meet the local alpha to give his respect to the leader but the local alpha is a really piece of shit when he meets him the alpha is trying to rape lainey an omega werewolf so dev saves lainey only to find that he is his mate lainey is a little tiny beautiful man with red hair and amber eyes and with a propension for making trouble but he is also an eager puppy in bed and dev likes him very much so does it matter if he will spend his life to take off from troubles his mate here like in the other books of jl langley the humor is a main aspect of the novel she has a way to make you happy and to leave you with a smile in your face and also eager to read more i can not wait to read the next enstallment in this wonderful series,188,1
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,4.0,positive,i love this story an the author is amazing however i liked the second book better loved it although awesome purchase,21,2
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,2.0,negative,i like the series but the lainey character is just too out and about for me waaay too much of a clutz laughing out loud,21,3
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,2.0,negative,the story is really simple and feels really forced and does not flow naturally scene to scene a lot of explaining and not much actual drama or action like the romantic scenes were written first and the rest as added as a connect the dots later,45,4
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,2.0,negative,i do not know whether this is langleys first book but it sometimes seemed that way to me when i read the book the plot is pretty fast and sometimes gives you the impression of watching an episode of a soap opera of course as the wolf-enthusiast that i am i know that the behavior of the werewolves as well as their social structure is not really lupine but they are not wolves after all although they refer to themselves as such the sex scenes are ok but this dominance stuff pretty much ruined them for me in addition the whole mate-topic is kind of like a fairy coming along and casting a love-spell on the two main characters since i do not get what it is they see about each other not only is one much younger than the other it is more as although the younger and extremely clumsy one needs a guardian and not a mate it let us you wonder whether these two would have had a relationship without the whole mate-thing all in all the book is rather average at best and there are definitely better ones,189,5
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,4.0,positive,i accidentally read the second book in this series first and i have to say that i liked it better there was more to it the author really has talent when she takes the time to expand one thing that i found oddly creepy and curious was that devlin is a name i have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and laine is totally the type of guy i dig jl have you been reading my journal laughing out loud really although these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again,96,6
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,5.0,positive,langley never fails to deliver i love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases dev is a reluctant hero rising to the occasion to save his mate lainey from an abusive alpha lainey is a spunky cute klutz who keeps his handsome mate and the reader laughing and groaning in turns at his antics this fast-paced sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next this one has a permanent place on my reader because once was not enough,83,7
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,1.0,negative,after reading the sample for this i was disappointed by the rest of it it seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot however the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters the focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and i would say immature now while this can be a part of a character no one is perfect after all there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that laine could act like more than a teenager at least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession but i would not advise anyone to buy this story even for the cheap price it is short and does not really make the reader feel any emotion,150,8
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,4.0,positive,i thought this was a quick read or perhaps i liked it soo much i was able to read it fast it only took me a few hours if that it was pretty face paced i hope to see more of dev and laine i enjoyed it it jumped right into the action and did not slow down dev is new to town he and his best friend cole and his mate caroline are going to be relocating for work dev stumbles upon a the local pack assualting there omega he get angry and goes to recue him laine the local omega and does not have a filter on his mouth he says what is on his mind both to their joy they realized early on in the book they are destined to be mates when the local pack alpha continues to torment laine dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover / mate,154,9
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,1.0,negative,this book is so bad it is totally funny take a standard old style harlequin plot change the heroine to another male but do not change the dialogue or even the endearments add in a couple of inconsistent werewolf details and there you go a book sort of so bad it left me giggling,51,10
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,5.0,positive,i like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves laine and devlin are mates which is only discovered after devlin saves laine from being beaten up and raped by his alpha pack leader devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on devlins newly discovered mate laine needless to say but there will be a change in leadership,117,11
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,4.0,positive,this whole instantly recognizing your mate thing i totally love that and the eyes and teeth shifting when emotions run high very cool if you like the genre you will like this family loyalty friends and of course love and romance what has not to like throw in some decent wolf action and bam you have got a story what i particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning there are plenty of stories out there where you have got nountil 6 pages from the end if the couples even going to work or not if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not this storys not about that it is more about how to work together to solve a big problem the alpha and i enjoyed it,142,12
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,3.0,neutral,i read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it i went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story i suppose laines antics were meant to be comedic relief but i did not laugh not once his antics were not funny i did not buy devlin being so amused by laines antics i was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with victor i thought it was a weak plot point this story was just ok i would not recommend anyone spending the money to buy it if it were free then yes,102,13
Kindle_Store,B000WCWUWM,3.0,neutral,it was an ok read it did not flow well for me and a lot of it seemed forced i liked the plot and most of the characters although lainey was annoying after a while,34,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,4.0,positive,when one combines the immediate availability of an iphone with the advantages of these lenses the total value blows away conventional cameras,22,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,4.0,positive,i like the product I have ordered quite a few for people my biggest complaint is the packaging is hideous I have been giving these out as gifts to people and the product is fun but the packaging is embarrassing it is so bad,41,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,3.0,neutral,usable and handy even it is not what i am expected i do like the items probably it can have room for improvements,22,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,5.0,positive,i bought this for my teenage daughter who is having a great time with it and making cool little movies,20,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,4.0,positive,this is not high-end camera equipment it is inexpensive and fun to play with a great gift for someone who enjoys taking photos on his / her iphone and wants to experiment,28,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,1.0,negative,only 2 of the 4 lenses were delivered i hope the rest come soon the big lens is works but is not very practical no one would really carry it around to use it but the other metal lenses are sweet and they can easily be put in a purse or backpack so you can use them when you need to,61,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,5.0,positive,purchased this for my son he has thrilled with the options it gives him using his iphone camera reasonably priced well-packaged and it arrived exactly on time highly recommended vendor,29,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,1.0,negative,thought it would be better would not order again no directions were included poor quality although it seemed like a cool thing,23,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,3.0,neutral,i wish there was a better design for the lens connecting to the phone besides have it use the case also the macro and wide angle need to be separate because they are very hard to separate,37,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,4.0,positive,this was a rare impulse buy for me i do not buy on a whim so i was nervous i rated this a 4 star because the only way to use it with my iphone 4 was to modify the stick on ring the ring covers the flash if you want the ring in the middle so the lens is centered i ended up taking a pair of side cutters and cutting a small section out of the ring i stuck it on and it works great and does not impede the flash just keep in mind that the flash is still blocked when you use the lens but will not be blocked without the lens i use my phones flash a lot for a flashlight so it was important that it was not blocked otherwise these are great little lens that can enhance your picture taking with a phone,149,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,5.0,positive,is what i want when i search and see the specifications the product is excelent this buy is in substitution of the older,23,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,5.0,positive,i really like the camera lens kit especially the zoom lens i have recommended to my friends so you should be getting lots of orders for this product,28,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,1.0,negative,these lenses might fit some phone but not the iphone4 stick on adapter covers the flash and may or may not stick the smaller lens may have some merit it looks good and sounds good until you see it,37,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,5.0,positive,my future daughter-in-law asked for this for christmas and i know she will love it she already takes crazy pictures with her phone and soon as the hetic holidays are over she will be sure to check them all out,38,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,1.0,negative,i should have listened to other reviewers and their complaints but i did not so I am learning the hard way only 3 of the 4 lenses came and the only option provided to me is to send back and reorder and hope for better outcome but based upon other reviews this seems a chronic problem so next i could get fewer or damaged lenses the lenses look fun but they are very cheaply made the rings do not stick well and you also have to turn your flash off in order get a picture that is not destroyed by the flash my biggest complaint is not having gotten all 4 lenses and being in a growing list of customers with the same complaint if your thinking about buying thisbeware,128,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,4.0,positive,good for the price happy with my purchase and would recommend to others only the most discerning eye would be able to tell the difference between this and the one your carrier sells for 30,35,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,3.0,neutral,this product is okay it will not completely protect your phone but will protect the front screen my case may have been defective because it does not completely close onto my phone,32,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,5.0,positive,i bought a white one to give it a try for my white note ii it came in more than a reasonable time since it is shipped from china it fits tight and right along thenoyou can see i carry my phone in the back pocket of jeans all the time theof front cover gets dirty of because its a white one but it can be cleaned easily i bent the front cover to make it as a stand when i laid the phone on a table to watch a show on the phone then bent it back when i am done the front cover does not break it comes back flat as a cover i now also have a black one from the same great seller imaging you phone looks glossy black with sliver blue chromeand textured front cover with white trim on the front,153,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,4.0,positive,great cover protects the phone and looks good snaps on replacing back cover which makes it better than just a cover,21,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,4.0,positive,it is worth the money just 6 bucks the back is much harder than the original front is soft it does not add weight to the phone delivered in 20 days these flip covers do not protect the phone much bcoz when the phone would fall it would just flip open and the front screen might crack but i just bought it bcoz they look cool and i dint want to put 40 bucks for the original case because it does not serve the actual purpose of a phone cover that is to save the phone incase it drops or something you can not even take pictures if you completely flip the front cover behind because it would cover the camera so buy this cheap one for now and keep looking if something better comes up for our amazingly awesome galaxy note ii,144,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,1.0,negative,this cover looks and fits like an official samsung flip cover but it is missing the metal contacts that make functions like the s beam s pen and nfc work,30,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,5.0,positive,this case fits the t-mobile galaxy note 2 perfectly right now t-mobile only has the charcoal grey covers i wanted something different and this is a great case it is cream white not snow white so it looks a little higher quality very pleased with it,45,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,5.0,positive,thisis exactly what was described a original samsung case for only 3 the same case was listed for 35 at my cell phone carrier store so it was well worth the wait around 8 days which was not bad coming from china,44,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,5.0,positive,looks like the one samsung sells for 25 just a better price and material feels the same to me buy it you won tcomplain,22,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,1.0,negative,have only had it for a few weeks but the fabric on the flip cover is fraying and separating from the cardboard the samsung logotype has rubbed off do not buy this,32,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,3.0,neutral,i really like thisit works great and has a nice clean look to it it did not take long to get the,25,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,3.0,neutral,case is fine but not from samsung with this you can not use nfc from note to note can i replace this,21,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,3.0,neutral,does not have nfc parts on the back cover like it was supposed to if you are not going to use that feature then it is a great cover people are good to work with as well,35,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009X78DKU,1.0,negative,this case is very cheap priced because it does not have the nfc communicator chip built in also it very poorly snaps into the back of your phone and can break loose causing you to drop your phone as for the front cover is very flimsy and rips and does not sit on right it is ok for a piece of card board and cheap plastic if that is what type looking for the real cover like a this might be better quality,80,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,1.0,negative,1st set cracked in the center of the headband after about a month once the crack appears the headset starts to disconnect the wires at the crack and the headset stops working entirely 2nd replacement set cracked after about two weeks that was over a year ago i did not bother replacing it because why bother then i found out they were issuing a different design entirely as replacements freepulse do not bother with this design unless it is free,77,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,2.0,negative,mine broke first time took forever to get replacements second set broke also returned for refund took forever to get refund,21,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,2.0,negative,yes they break and they are to tight they definitely will not come off when running or shaking your head violently they must be made for pygmae-heads my heads is 56 cm around which is normal adult size and they are too small i had them exchanged twice as they broke within 2 - 3months of purchase / replacement and i am now waiting for the third pair to break then i have to have them replaced again the sound is quite good and the wireless freedom is brilliant which is why they receive two stars from me but the breaking and tightness is annoying until logitech improves the design do not buy them i have contacted logitech to inform them about the problem please do the same maybe some day they will listen,128,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,1.0,negative,i excitedly bought thisonline thinking that at last I had be free of the wires from my mp3 player while i jog and workout at the gym it was not out of the shipping box for more than 10 minutes when i was writing for a return goods authorization this contraption is huge heavy and cumbersome the adapter that plugs into an mp3 is almost as big as the player itself and the headphones made my ears hurt think I shall just tie my wires up and stick them in my pocket from now on,94,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,2.0,negative,his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason i got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are it is only a matter of time mine cracked within a week and yes i knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful unless you have a really small head maybe the size of a softball do not mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service do not get it it looks and sounds good otherwise and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio a2dp it is a pity,120,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,5.0,positive,this is the 4th set of these headphones that i have purchased the first set i bought for my son and i was so impressed i bought a set for myself and then my brother and then my other son they work great they are comfortable the charge lasts a long time and more,53,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,5.0,positive,i recently purchased the bad design flawed heaphones october 2005 i loved it except for the you know the heaphones breaking but as of december 2005 this flaw has been fixed no more cracked headphones so the only reason why you should not buy this is becuase of the price as for the weight it is not too bad it helps that it is behind the ear it only 3 ounces most behind the neck headphones weigh 2 or more ounces,78,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,3.0,neutral,these headphones broke in the first 3 weeks nothin more to say than that,14,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,1.0,negative,great sound quality moderately comfortable but not built well for daily use the day i received the headset it cracked i returned the broken one for a replacement and after a week of cautious daily use it broke again I am not sure if anyone else has experience this problem i was very disappointed since in the past i have been very happy with logitechs quality,65,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,4.0,positive,I have been looking at these for a week or so thinking on buying them but looking for a good price and found these feed backs i read they break period but that is ok with me I am going to wait for the price to really drop and they can break all they want because I am was going to break tham anyway to put them in my motorcycle helmetcool hhhuhjust put them in behind the ear peices attached with something and your ready to go just anfor some,84,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009MYS9S,5.0,positive,i am not one for wires on any headset we tried other wireless headsets and either the battery did not last or the headset was flimsy or it would lose connection with the mp3 this one is consistent comfortable and very reliable plus the battery lasts for quite a long time,51,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,4.0,positive,love the case perfect fit great protection minus the top and bottom section granted leaving the top and bottom open allow for easy access to accessories and docks the texture of the case makes it less grippy than the s4s naked she shall wish it was a little less slick,49,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,2.0,negative,this case does not cover the whole samsung galaxy s4 i dropped my phone with the case on and it fell right where it was not and cracked my brand new phone i had to spend 250 to fix the damn phone after having it for 1 week,46,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,5.0,positive,i heard about kayscase from a friend on youtube and am very pleased with the quality and speedy shipping their customer service is also excellent they replied to my e-mail almost immediately late at night to change the shipping address the case has a slightly rubberized texture and feels sturdy it snaps right on my galaxy s4 tight with no wiggle and all of the ports have ample space this case is great because of how slim it is and protected my phone from a fall with only a scuff mark on the case and no damage to my phone they also sent me a free bumper case which is also great quality and i use it from time to time as well kayscase is only a couple dollars more than the really cheap chinese cases but that couple dollars makes a big difference and you see it in the quality i highly recommend ordering from kayscase and i already purchased another case from them,165,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,5.0,positive,bought this case to simply protect the rear facing camera and screen from contact with the surface there is a lip that gives the screen about a 1 mm clearance this case is not meant for drop protection think scratch protection also comes with a screen protector for about 9 it can not be beat met and exceeded expectation,57,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,5.0,positive,thin case that provides good protection against scratches the case has no logos and really showcases the beauty of the phone which was a feature i was looking overall for the price it is a really nice clear case,39,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,5.0,positive,the case is good quality and easy to grip highly recommended for all samsung galaxys4 users they have great customer service that is a plus,24,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,1.0,negative,i got several cases when i first got my galaxy s4 because while i like the phone the design of the phone made me feel like it was going to slip out of my hands really easily also the was a big sale about half off on a bunch of these cases this fits fine over the phone and is pretty clear so you can see the phone design but i hate it because it makes the phone even slicker there is no hardly any grip to this case what so ever so it feels a little like trying to hold on toI am pretty sure if i used this case I had have to fix my phone or buy a new one within a week because i was dropping it so much i would not recommend this case unless you have insurance on your phone,146,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,1.0,negative,the case is made of poor material it has cracked in two places since the 9 days i have had it i have not dropped it and the cracks are due to the top left part of the device not being perfectly fitted i purchased the white one save yourself some headache and purchase a different brand,57,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,2.0,negative,i bought this cover for my new galaxy s4 and had only positive things to say about it until about 2 weeks of it being in use on my phone that is when i noticed small cracks starting to form on all four corners where the cover curves around the corners of the phone it is really too bad this happened because it is a niceand i really liked the feel of this cover but if it only lasts two weeks it is not worth it even for the minimal price,92,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,2.0,negative,case is nice looking but cracked on it is own from just the fit and weak points still usable with a little tape,22,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,1.0,negative,i purchased this cover exactly 1 month and a half ago so far i am completely unsatisfied with this purchase here is a quick rundown pros fits very well very thin case looked great when new cons not durable whatsoever only offers superficial protection to phones finish the screen protector supplied is of low quality the matte finish stains very easily this cover already has micro cracks on the edges in two places the finish is peeling up everywhere there is anon this cover this phone has never been dropped with this cover and the only thing used to clean it has been dish soap and water this is a total waste of money take my advice and look elsewhere because I am sure there are better covers available at a comparable price i never tried to contact the manufacturer as I had rather not have them ship me more junk and i would not feel right asking for my money back and then leaving this review i would not recommend this cover to anyone,174,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,3.0,neutral,looks great but turned out to be very fragile left upper side broke after only the first fall looks slick but not durable,23,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,3.0,neutral,this case might not be a bad choice for the money if you are a careful phone user but if like me you drop your phone from time to time then this case will not be sturdy enough for you i dropped the phone with case onto concrete the phone remained functional but the case cracked beyond use i think most cases can handle a fall from your hand to the concrete much better if you know that you are clumsy or accident prone then buy a better case,87,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,4.0,positive,came on time was surprised to find an enclosed screen protector thank you for that put everything together my samsung s4 beauty not hidden by the case kudos to the clear and slim case but i do not think it will protect the phone if it slips down it does have a grip overall it is a good case,59,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008ZCO1QY,5.0,positive,perfect buy for those who want to protect their new galaxy 4 phone fits snug and perfect to protect the new phone a must have thank you,24,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,1.0,negative,the tiny piece that goes on the front plate next to the volume was broken in half it is cute it does not cause overheating it is cheap but be prepared to have to glue it back together,37,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,it is a beautiful cover and this cover protected my phone well in a few falls the only problem is it is very hard to remove,25,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,it is just cute does not seem to offer protection just decoration smooth and thin easy to take on and off,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,really liked the case it was on time and was even cutter then i thought i fell in love with the bees the problem with the case is that it is really porous the first week i got it i was wearing a new pair of dark wash jeans that had actually been washed twice already and the phone case turned blue around the edges and corners and had a blue tinge to it when i tried to wipe it clean it would not come off all the way it also is difficult to keep clean just in general,99,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,1.0,negative,i bought it because it was on sale one drop of the phone i broke it now i see why it was on clearance,24,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,5.0,positive,the case is beautiful and very durable it was very reasonably priced and i received it within a few days it is so nice to be able to shop and get excellent prices and designs to choose from i give it 5 stars excellent product i ordered another one it was so nice,53,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,1.0,negative,i am rating thisas a 1 start because thewas broken when i recieved it not to mention the size was off a hair so even if it was broken it did not fit,36,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,1.0,negative,ripoff not happy but i m not going to return i just put the thing on the trash it was broken not a good quality,24,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,2.0,negative,had it on my phone as it arrived pretty much nextday it cracked when i took it off to clean my phone and i used the little opening to seperate but i can not complain for the one penny price right,40,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,5.0,positive,i love this cover it feminine without being being girly it fit my sprint galaxyll in all the areas it needs to i normally am not a pink person but this is a cool pinkand the white balances is out,42,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,2.0,negative,i saw this online and thought it looked pretty but once close up you can see more detail and it is not really cute for my taste i did not really like it once i received it but overall shipping and product were great,42,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,you get what you pay for it is cute but not sturdy at all when i dropped my phone it popped right off,22,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,case does it is job in protecting sprint galaxy s ii epic 4 g touch however the charger did not fit while case was on phone i had to shave the sides of the case in order for the charger to fit,40,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,3.0,neutral,wife loves her case but hole to connect the charger is not large enough to allow the charger to stay in the hole they need to redesign the bottom of the case for connecting the charger,36,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005W5W006,4.0,positive,it is a hard she shall that comes in two pieces and snaps together and seems like it might break fairly easily where it connects but so far so good have had it several months with no problem and it is attractive good product for the prices,45,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,3.0,neutral,i was just upset that the fit for the iphone was a little too snug there is no room to change the song or have a phone cover on,29,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,2.0,negative,while this serves it is purpose the purple mesh fabric is kind of itchy and it has not held up too well i replaced it within a couple months,27,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,5.0,positive,perfect fit for my iphone 5s and is comfortable too,10,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,5.0,positive,since it did not provide the arm circumference it did not fit me i have skinny arms and a circumference of 9,22,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,4.0,positive,fits well a little too tight but I am very happy with it if you have a case you have to take it off,23,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,2.0,negative,they sent the strong size to fit the phone than i ordered instead of paying the costs to ship it to return it i just kept it other than that it would do it is job,35,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,5.0,positive,love this armband for holding my iphone while i am walking or running my phone fits right in it and i am ready to listen to music,27,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,4.0,positive,this arm band is exactly as described it is cheap but it does what it should do i have small arms so like many other users i found that the band did not fit i was able to make it work by looping the band through the plastic fastener and then wrapping the band around itself before fastening the velcro it is a little awkward to get it on but once fastened it holds tight and does not come loose while in use this says it is for the iphone 5 but i am using mine with an iphone 4s and it fits fine even with my small case on it,108,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,1.0,negative,put it on as soon as i recieved it but it does not work it is velcro and only has a little bit of velcro at the end so you have to be the exact size as the armband to wear it does not work at all for me because my arm is too small i weigh 135pds,56,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,3.0,neutral,nothing wrong with it but it does not fit with the phone case i have to take the phone case off in order for it to fit it also smelled weird when i first received it i do not really use it because the fact that i have to take off the case every time i want to use the armband,59,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,3.0,neutral,it is a nice product exactly what i expected however the band is almost too large i think i would like it better if i had bigger biceps i do not have tiny arms by any means so i was a little bummed when i went to workout with this and it kept sliding down my arm because it is as tight as the velcro will allow a lot of times it is just easier to not use this product,78,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,2.0,negative,it seems like fine quality but it would not stay up on my arm probably because my arms are so small but it looked tacky all safety pinned together to hold if you are skinny you might want to pass on this,40,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,4.0,positive,i am so happy i ordered the arm band for my son he says it really helps him keep up with his phone while working out,26,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,1.0,negative,it was difficult to insert the iphone into the slot,10,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009VY2QOE,1.0,negative,these where ordered for iphone 5 and they did not fit so where avwsistbog money very disappointed they size of the space for the phone was not big enough for the phone,31,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,1.0,negative,i thought the phone case was great after i figured out how to put it on i quickly changed my mind when i went to plug up my phone to charge it my charger does not fit through the tiny hole so i am unable to charge my phone when it is in the case my charger is not the one that came with the phone i bought a longer one from a wireless retailer and the end is thicker than the apple charger,83,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,2.0,negative,hard to operate touch screen and volume is very low due cover,12,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,2.0,negative,so i bought this at a cricket store when i bought my iphone 5s the thing that pisses me off first off is that they charged me 50 for this case when clearly it is a lot less than that so disregarding that the case itself is not that great i did not realize until i had started using the phone with the case on that it makes the touch screen a pain to use when it is properly sealed the plastic screen in the middle bubbles up in the middle at that which makes it a pain to use the touch screen i also used this as a gps and the bubble gave a glare on the screen which annoyed me i do not know why i opted for this case since i do not plan on using this anywhere near water another few things i do not like about this phone is that the start button is incredibly hard to press down the audio output is nearly impossible to connect into with the case on and the charging port can be a bit tricky to connect at times i just went ahead and purchased a new case with some screen protectors read reviews online before you opt for something,204,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,5.0,positive,the only issue about this case is that it does get a little scratched up but so does the lifeproof it also does not have any rainbow effect like the lifeproof it creates a really tight seal and it is not too bulky nice grips on the side to prevent dropping and when it does drop it is very protective silicone will save your phone not only is it cheaper than the lifeproof it is a lot better lifeproof is only able to go down to 66 feet underwater with the vault you are able to go down 16 feet underwater with the s4 case and 66 feet with the iphone case on top of that it is a lot easier to get to the charging ports it is definitely a better investment the the lifeproof and it is cheaper,135,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,5.0,positive,i was kind of nervous with testing it out but i placed the case in the water with no phone in it and it actually worked then that is when i placed it in water with my phone inside and it worked just be sure that you have it sealed nice and tight and no worries,55,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,5.0,positive,outstanding took the case in ocean and had no problems never went more than a few feet deep everyday use is not great,23,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,5.0,positive,at first i was scared to order because of some of the reviews in here but i took the chance and it was so worth it i did the water test twice with n without my phone and it passed with flying colors very satisfied i have a lifeproof case and this case has better qualities like ppl can hear you better and it is easier to plug charger and headphones what could be change is making the screen protector flat so it is easier to type other than that very satisfied specially for the price,94,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,3.0,neutral,this is a case you will hate using as a everyday protection for you iphone it is very annoying to put it in or try to get it out it is cheap plastic the home bottom it can be very hard to work when you need to text or type something it can take you for ever to actually get the little chat window to open I am a woman and i have a pretty decent hand / fingers size forget about it if you had man or big fingers the cons well i went on vacation to the beach and i still used it and my kept my phone safe i even took some pictures during playing in the swimming pool not underwater although so it does keep your phone dry and dirt free,131,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,1.0,negative,package was open probably a returnedwhen phone is in the cover you have problem communicating go for a better one if needed,24,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,2.0,negative,this case is ok but the sound during a call seems very soft lifeproof cases ar way better i also had to go on youtube to figure out how to open it,32,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,5.0,positive,i lost my previous phone to water i was worried about the waterproof case and that it might be bulky heavy and not easy to use but it is been great my phone is light even with the case i do not plan to lose this phone to water I had recommend it to everyone,52,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,1.0,negative,after multiple iphone casualties i decided it was time to put my phone into a vault well it is definitely a vault no one can hear me i can not hear anyone else and i can not use the headphone jack because the casing is too deep oh and the port closure for the charging post fell off after just a few days rendering it no longer waterproof oh well i should have done more investigating before making a spontaneous purchase,78,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,1.0,negative,unable to access side silence switch difficult to use edges of touch screen will be returning buyer beware no waterproof or drop proof case could be this cheap,28,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,2.0,negative,i bought this considering it was a lot cheaper than a life proof but I had rather pay for a life proof for me there has a few things wrong with it 1 it does not have a switch for me to switch from vibrate to sound 2 the case makes the screen too deep and makes it hard to type 3 if you have an iphone 5s you can not use the fingerprint scanner 4 inserting headphones or the charging cord does not happen the holes are way too small all it does is protect it i would only use it if i knew i was going to only need it for the day maybe,112,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CYNN4ZO,2.0,negative,just ordered this phone case from groupon because it was on sale and it is nice looking and easy to get on however i can not fit in my charger or headphones which is super frustrating also can not access the loud-silent button on the side really i do not think it was worth it wish i would have bought the lifeproof while it was on sale instead just ordered an otterbox instead live and learn i guess,74,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,this is probably one of the best purchases i have made so far i bought this for a trip i made and thanks to this product i was able to take pictures and videos,34,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,the case works great no problems with it except the back panel was loose when i received it and shortly fell off and was lost i emailed the company and they sent me out a replacement case right away no problem the replacement case was received and the back panel was not loose and works great i was so impressed by this companys customer service they responded to my email promptly and took care of it right away will definately do business with them in the future,86,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,4.0,positive,i have a mophie extra battery pack for my phone and gave this one as a gift it works great it is great that it covers the whole phone which gives the phone more protection if dropped once you know to hold the power button on for a few extra seconds continually to turn it on when you need it then it works great,63,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,great product and arrived on time charges phone to about 90 great when u r on the move and have no access to a charger,25,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,1.0,negative,i bought this battery charging case and seriously 2 days after i had it it stopped fully charging and it would not connect to my phone anymore,26,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,1.0,negative,bought this for my girlfriend for v-day since she liked my unu charging case so much i got this one because she likes pink after one month the case started to fall apart the glue holding the metal backing was not good so that came off completely then she noticed that her phone was not charging any more i saw that the micro usb slot had been pushed into the case so the usb charging cord would not make a connection so in a total of two months this case is now nonfunctional I have emailed alpatronix twice about this to get a replacement and have yet to hear back from them so I had say customer service is non-existent do not buy get the unu case instead they are a great company and have great customer service,133,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,4.0,positive,i am comparing this case to my mophie juice pack which my daughter now uses for her phone i usually charge my phone each night but with this case i am able to wait 2 - 3 days it holds a charge just as a good as the mophie case only requiring a charge every 2 - 3 days with average phone use the only downside is that the plastic bumper piece does not really match the back,73,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,very good does what it is supposed to have not had any problems very good addition to iphone now i do not have to worry about my phone dying on me,28,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,2.0,negative,i ordered the pink case it was supposed to have black trim came with ugly salmon colored trim does not match the back pink panel at all cheaply made adds significantly to the weight and bulk of the phone far more so than a mophie case i will be returning this,54,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,my granddaughter just loves her new charger i know because every time she sees me she is thanking me all over again,22,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,5.0,positive,works great charges phone first then charges batter case now i can use my phone all day without running to a charger it does not have a regular iphone charger cable it is a micro usb cable,37,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,4.0,positive,there are many products out there that serve the same purpose as this one for the price and functionality however i would suggest buying this one the power button in the bottom left is easy to press the lights light up to let me know of it is battery power and charging it helps me get through almost 2 days without charging the micro usb port is genius the material for the back feels sleek and great but the sides of it are plastic regardless i feel i have enough protection to last a fall so long as it is not straight at the screen which I am hoping i will not have to experience,112,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,4.0,positive,easy to use case protect the majority of falls the usb cable that come with it is a little too short,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,1.0,negative,it worked ok for one day then stopped charging it looked like it was trying to charge but nothing happened in the garbage within one week,26,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD5UYOG,4.0,positive,i bought a similar charging case when i bought my iphone but after a few months it fell apart i really like this case because it protects without being bulky and it does the job well the only reason i did not give it 5 starts was because theof the back and sides do not match I am a little ocd about that kind of stuff this is a great value,70,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,love this case it was exactly as promised they even included extra pieces and glue just for safe keeping I have not had to use it I am hard on cases but this one is still holding up perfectly,37,0

Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,5.0,positive,i enjoy true crime books and have read many and yet this one had several evil people i had not heard about and more information about others yes it is disturbing to read what people are capable of but still very fascinating,42,0
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,3.0,neutral,this book was bloated but interesting there were times when i was hooked and page turning like mad and other times when i felt bogged down in too many useless words,31,1
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,1.0,negative,only buy this book for someone if you want them to have a lot of the wrong information in his introduction the author made slight sense but it fell apart when i started reading about his first evil person and i noticed some information that was wrong 30 seconds with google and 2 ivy league college resources i confirmed it if you want to present new or different information please do but do not forget proof or at least a reason for the conflicting facts lastly it is extremely difficult to apply todays ideals on the ancient world or even the world 200 years ago i feel that this is the authors biggest mistake,113,2
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,5.0,positive,scary to know that there were enough people in the world to have a book written the atrocities again humanity is so evident from the serial killers to the mass murders you see inside a black heart and ruthless demeanor i rated this a 5 not that i like the subject matter but was able to glimpse inside their lives to see maybe how they became this way from caligula to hitler to people in the 21st century we get a glimpse of horror great job,86,3
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,1.0,negative,too sad for me to read i know evil is alway around and it just too much to take a interest for me i really can not rate this because it was too scary,33,4
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,2.0,negative,while the stories are interesting and chock full of facts it is poorly written there has tons of people who are mentioned and if you do not already know the story you would be lost because he does not explain who the people are,40,5
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,5.0,positive,this was a good book and it does well at describing the atrocities that these people committed but it missing a few people like khomeini francisco solano lopez king john cromwell pizzaro and nero other than that it has the most evil people in history,45,6
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,4.0,positive,i think the title is misleading however very good historical context in it i really enjoyed learning about some of the people i heard of but never knew for sure who they were it was brought together nicely,38,7
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,1.0,negative,my kindle was stolen and the sick person who stole it ordered this book i guess he would qualify as one of the most evil people,26,8
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,3.0,neutral,the book was interesting at most some of the people included should not be in the list can you really categorize lenin as an evil man while some of the stories capture interest most seem just a mish mash of facts assembled in no particular order you are better off spending a few hours in a library,56,9
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,3.0,neutral,did not know how many crazy people their were in positions of leadership from the beginning of time to the present,21,10
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,3.0,neutral,what can you say about evil i have not enjoyed this book at all due to the subject however i read it for information only,25,11
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,4.0,positive,this book definitely worth the purchase price it covers quite a bit my only complaint is that it drags on in parts and starts to read like a history text book in others there are quite a few typos as well which can be distracting but otherwise it is a good read,51,12
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed reading this book it was very informative and gripping i am excited to find more like it,20,13
Kindle_Store,B004LZ576M,5.0,positive,i absolutely loved this there are a lot of historical characters and facts i could not put it down a well deserved 11/10,22,14
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,4.0,positive,good book to read if you like interracial like me however it is a 3 part series this one was good let us see how the others pan out,27,0
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,2.0,negative,stunned at how quickly this book turned into complete ridiculousness that scene with her ex was laughingly bad and there were so many instances of editing mistakes that it became distracting the characters themselves also were not that great i definitely will not be trying out book two,46,1
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,2.0,negative,quite a few editing errors characters needed more flesh and bone jilted lover was not believable suspending reality just did not work,20,2
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,3.0,neutral,it was a nice read but i guess I shall have to read the other books to get the full effect,20,3
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,4.0,positive,i liked the characters i like the ease in which the writer sets her story one flaw the character comes from the east side of chicago poor no way still i liked the book,34,4
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,4.0,positive,this i the first book by this author and i would read another carter was a terrible person after his accident but that do not mean that you should be so cruel vanessa is a good hearted person that had helped a perfect stranger i was very pleased that after spending time with vanessa that carter was now working on being a good person i would recommend this book to anyone who has found that the story is very good,79,5
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,2.0,negative,cute story editing needs to be done because it was missing a bunch of words and other things vanessa went to new york because she was deciding if she would take a ceo position or not they gave her a month to figure it out she ended up meeting carter who was on bed rest from an accident he thought she was the maid go figure and was rude to her from the jump the book moved by telling what was going on with them over the weeks then her ex the one she would dumped in the opening pops up her and carter seem like a good couple until the end something about her keeping a secret from him not sure about reading the next one but I am not saying i will not,131,6
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,5.0,positive,i hate that i can not read more loved it so much,11,7
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,3.0,neutral,i liked how the story started out wish it was a little bit more detailed but overall a good read it was a little dull because i found myself drifting off while in the middle of reading i barely remember either character or their names,45,8
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,4.0,positive,i came across this book because i was bored and wanted something new to read it was a good book the author hooks you with this book and there has about 2 or 3 more in the series,36,9
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,3.0,neutral,why i hate when i really get into a story and find out i do not get to read the ending because it is to be continued who started this trend it needs to stop the story was good and i loved the characters i hated the tbc of an ending,49,10
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,2.0,negative,it was just ok nothing great at all about these two and definitely nothing that makes me want to read a part two there were many grammatical errors and quite frankly neither carter or vanessa struck me as ceos of anything thank goodness it was free,46,11
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,2.0,negative,I am so tired of new authors or maybe she has not new and I have never seen her not listing that it is a continuation serial or series whatever you want to call it until the very end i had already purchased before the other review but another author has done this and all i can say to authors who do this is shame on you you may get a few purchases but we go back and let others know and they do not purchase just be honest to begin with and show some integrity and you will go further in life so very disappointed,97,12
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,1.0,negative,really did not understand the connection that these two were supposed to have there was none definitely not worth the buy,21,13
Kindle_Store,B00JX4TOLA,3.0,neutral,the cliff hanger buy another book has started to wear on me this could have been a great read it moved along quickly easy to follow but something is missing like the yeast left out the bread i get theof the storyline but then it turned to a drama not love story trevor did not enhance the story for me now the mysterious caller just tell the man already if she told him about the job tell him the other secret gees it forefront to me towards the end,90,14
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,5.0,positive,for some reason the file does not open in the correct place it opens at the bonus chapter for the new book you actually have to hit previous page a few times to get to the beginning of the story it is there although and is a complete story hope this helps,51,0
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,1.0,negative,i did figure out that it opened on 36 percent so something was wrong i went to cover amd got to the beginning of a very holly christmas i just did not get it it felt like i had gotten to the last chapter of another book that still was not complete the rest of the pages were for a preview of another book do not waste your time on this one even although it does not take much of it,77,1
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,4.0,positive,this was a fast short read i enjoyed the book until i got to the end and i felt like the author forgot something that is why i have rated this as 4 stars and not 5,37,2
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,1.0,negative,this was a teaser not a short story on the good side i am curious about what the strike was all about,21,3
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,2.0,negative,i downloaded this freebie to get a taste of shelia roberts writing as i have not read any of her books before i had not expected most of this book to actually be a sample chapter for a cat story i finally figured out that kindle had opened the book in the wrong place and i found the exclusive short story which is a follow-up to on strike for christmas as i had not read either of the books these stories were connected to i felt a little lost the writing seemed pretty good and i did like ambrose being a cat person but it was not what i expected it also did not really give me a good feel for the authors writing maybe I shall have to check out one of her books from the library,132,4
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,5.0,positive,this was a cute follow up to on strike for christmas short and sweet but gave the reader me insight to what happened next,25,5
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,2.0,negative,while this is a cute little story it is also just an excerpt out of a book i had already purchased also i would not consider this a christmas story which is what i was looking for disappointing,40,6
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,2.0,negative,i found this to be a major disappointment i felt as if i was thrown in the deep end and told to swim without the benefit of a lesson things just did not make sense to me,37,7
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,1.0,negative,wow this was the worst book i have ever read it was very short and stupid what the heck this was horrible i do not recommend this book at all i do not understand why it even got published sorry who ever wrote this book but i do not think you should write anymore because of the lack of talent this is a no,61,8
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,1.0,negative,this story was disjointed and incomplete the main story was not that interesting then in the middle it jumps to another character with no connection to the original plot,28,9
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,5.0,positive,if you read on strike for christmas by sheila roberts you certainly will not want to miss this short follow up story that returns to the town of holly one year later just as funny as the original story you will be aching for more from the ladies of the knitting club and their families if you did not get a chance to read on strike for christmas then this short will give you a great glimpse into a talented writer who knows how to touch your hearts and tickle your funny bone,90,10
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,1.0,negative,i found this short story to be disappointing it was not worth my time,14,11
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,4.0,positive,i liked the plot and the way that it was presented christmas stories are always something that are easy to read,21,12
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,2.0,negative,the story was written from a cats point of view the story ended too soon and left the story hanging,20,13
Kindle_Store,B005T54NYK,2.0,negative,ok not really what I am interested in reading to short not not much going on seemed like the first chapter of a book,23,14
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,3.0,neutral,a rather conservative choice meaning 500 greatest poems would be in this collection which perhaps is some form of verification however the faintest leaning to a more liberal taste would be digestible,32,0
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,1.0,negative,i do not recommend this book it is full of unreadable poems in the beginning and by unreadable i mean words that look like another language besides english excessive junk I am sorry i wasted my time with attempting to find something good in it,43,1
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,3.0,neutral,missing some of the best of blake but i do enjoy the really old poems,15,2
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,5.0,positive,many glitches in transfer to e-book repeated lines stanzas and more difficult to find a particular poem authors works not always gathered in one area,23,3
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,3.0,neutral,the poems i could read are masterpieces the poems at the beginning of this book are written in middle english with no translation and the formatting is crummy,28,4
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,1.0,negative,most of these poems sound like a rambling on of words with no obvious meaning i can not understand the title of greatest poems,23,5
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,1.0,negative,the first half of the collection is practically indecipherable olde english and all that then major poets are rarely cited not even emily dickensen was included too much shakespeare not even the most quoted poems from ts eliot no significant or most noted poetry of robert frost no ee cummings and a host of other no-shows,55,6
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,1.0,negative,i have come to love good poems thanks in large part to garrison keillor i have also the courage of conviction to declare when poetry is trite archaic or vapid these and other even less complimentary adjectives apply well to about three quarters of these compositions this collection will appeal to certain english professors and their graduate student sycophants i regret having to be so uncomplimentary but the english language teems with vital poems and readers will best find them elsewhere,81,7
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,5.0,positive,so large i am still reading it every page a hidden gem,12,8
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,3.0,neutral,somewhat quirky in that some famous poems and poets are left out but there are unexpected gems to compensate if you browse although browsing through a collection this size is rather laborious on a kindle touch,36,9
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,4.0,positive,a well although out collection a pleasure to read,9,10
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,5.0,positive,very nice compilation of memorable poems and poets i would recommend this kindle book to everyone it is nice to be able to have these works right in my hands on kindle,32,11

Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,4.0,positive,an enjoyment for me and i have many more poems to read,12,13
Kindle_Store,B00BWYDQ36,4.0,positive,it is a useful reference book some of it i like some i do not,13,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,2.0,negative,listen to the other reviews one corner of the case does not fit it is a bit irritating if you are particular about those sorts of things i did not bother returning it because it still stays on the case but i play with the loose corner like i used to play with the hinge of my flip phone,56,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,4.0,positive,the first phone case i received was completely wrong i contacted the company and after giving them the identifying numbers off the plastic wrap not the shipping receipt that everyone would keep thank goodness i kept it because i almost tossed it as soon as the case was out they sent me the correctat no additional cost the shipping times were 2 - 3 days longer than i have waited for similar items in the past but the case is great,82,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,2.0,negative,case arrived quickly but it does not fit on my xt926 it does not wrap around one corner securely reading the reviews it sounds like this is a common problem,28,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,1.0,negative,does not fit on the phone do not buy it luckily i did not pay much for it again do not buy it,21,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,4.0,positive,i got this case about a month ago and it is been holding up really well I have dropped my phone a few times and it is definitely cushioned the fall a few people commented that one of the corners does not fit well and i do see a similar issue however it covers it enough to 1 not let the case fall off and 2 still protect the oh-so-fragile corners of the phone i actually do not even really notice it anymore the case is also very sleek and stylish and does not add bulk at all since the phone is so thin to begin with this was key for me when trying to find a nice case and clearly you can not beat this price,120,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,2.0,negative,does not fit my phone properly the cores do not stay on if he fit right it would be a nice case,21,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,4.0,positive,shipped very quick and fits well the slim part located at the charger opening tends to slip off nice that is comes in different colors although,26,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,4.0,positive,slim not bulky awesome grip easy to hold great product for just a few dollars wish the face lip was thicker / stronger although,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,5.0,positive,i would buy another one of these covers even if it was triple the price looks nice and is non slip,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009XL4J4U,2.0,negative,the top left corner keeps sliding off very frustrating this is the 2nd cover I have ordered for this phoine i wish they could get it right,26,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,3.0,neutral,these headphones are very nice but unfortunately they are not made for small ears they do not fit comfortably on my ear nor do the hoops fit behind the ear like they are supposed to at least for small-eared me a friend of mine with larger ears tried them on and loved them so they work for some people just not me,58,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,1.0,negative,complete garbage lost all bass in right ear with-in first week of light usage they do not stay in ears for any movement or exercise more extreme of walking would not pay 5 for these they are temporary / disposable earphones at best sent back for refund,45,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,work well so far but fall off of my ears when I am running fast on the treadmill,17,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,these are nice headphones that stay in place when running and have a sufficiently long cord without being too long the microphone is a nice touch as well and i carried on a full conversation while jogging and everything was clear the button is hit or miss it hung up the phone instead of answering it and kind of acts randomly with my android phone the sound is also a little flat lacks bass and they do not really get into your ear that much so it sounds like you are listening to small speakers held close to your ear instead of a true headphone all in all not bad for affordable and tough little earbuds,115,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,1.0,negative,i had a pair of these but i washed them and they did not survive the dryer so i saw these and they looked like the ones i ruined but when i received these they were not as heavy the wires were cheapand in about two usages the mic just fell apart they are junk,52,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,the fit is excellent and the security of the over the ear helps sound quality is good and the microphone makes it convenient to answer the phone while hiking or walking,31,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for the plastic holding the earbud broke after a few months sound was okay but there has to be better out there,27,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,1.0,negative,the problem these have is with the switch when wet it malfunctions when i used these to work out with the sweat would be enough to because the switch to make the motoactiv go crazy the answer from motorola was to disable the switch function on the motoactiv not fix the headphones i went ahead and purchased other headphones i do love the motoactiv it is an awesome running watch just not the headphones it came with,77,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,2.0,negative,with volume turned up on device still hard to hear through the headphones poor quality,15,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,i bought these to replace the set that came with my motoactv i broke those after catching the wire on something and the headphones separated where the microphone is connected so they are not the most durable the sound is average for a set of gym headphones i can not complain about the volume even when it is windy the clarity or bass is not impressive although just ok they fit me quite well and i like the look overall they are satisfying for the price,81,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,extremely comfortable headphones my second pair bought these as a christmas gift for my girlfriend she was looking for a new pair of headphones for working out i own a pair and love them she appreciates the comfort and excellent sound quality as well would recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of stylish and hardy headphones,58,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,these earbuds are for personal listening on portable devices they are designed for sports so they have an around-the-ear loop and a small chest clip for added stabilization they also have a slider to adjust the length of separation between the ear pieces they come with soft plastic ear plugs and ship with 8 extra ear plugs just in case you lose some or wear some out also included in the package is a faux leather carrying case to reduce tangles if you want to carry the earbuds in your pocket backpack or purse these earbuds are light weight and comfortable but most importantly their sound quality is excellent music really comes alive when you are wearing these earbuds,117,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,nice headphones good sound quality fit well in ear very happy with my purchase i would recommend this product to anyone,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,2.0,negative,my first impression was that they were counterfeit because of the packaging and nowhere on the product does it say motorola they work okay but the cord is a little tight around the neck they do stay in place although all that said i did not expect a lot for the price,51,14
Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,5.0,positive,such an unbelievably beautiful love story i truly enjoyed not having a cheating hh in the story I am really surprised that there has not been a bigger reaction to this book I am so happy i took the risk it was awesome along with some rock and roll,44,0

Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,2.0,negative,book was good storyline ok but i felt like effie dragged on too much about life i skipped a lot of pages until i got to the interaction parts of the story,32,6

Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,2.0,negative,i do not usually leave reviews but this story was so boring that i only got three quarters of the way through and gave up this story had a boring plot very little action and the author just kept rambling on and on about the same things over and over for pages upon pages I am glad i only paid 99,60,8
Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,1.0,negative,no depth to any character weak weak female and malekind of book that makes me I shall with the poor writing and lack of substance,24,9
Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,3.0,neutral,i must say that this book has great potential the whole plot was an excellentand had potential to be something great and it just did not quite get there the characters did not develop the plot did not develop i almost felt like the author jumped around a bit during the story you only get bits and pieces of the story i would have loved to have learned more about effie and timothys relationship and why it did not work and more about jacks past more about effies relationship with her parents more about jacks past with his family and why they are distant more about what a psychopath sam is and more about him stalking effie this had the potential to be fantastic but it was just okay for me,129,10
Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,4.0,positive,this was a really good story I am only giving it 4 stars cuz at times effie came across a little too stiff and stodgy while jack was always so playful sexy and goofy jack was really well written and i thoroughly enjoyed him i think others will enjoy this as much as i did,54,11
Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,3.0,neutral,good story development very romantic and erotic it was quite a long read and very detailed it was well written,20,12

Kindle_Store,B00C6NHLC4,2.0,negative,i do not like to write negative reviews however this book left a lot to be desired the writer would ramble on for pages at a time going through effies inner dialogue it got very boring i started skipping over paragraphs at a time because you did not need to read everything to get the mainthere were a lot of little hiccups for the main character but nothing big that would be the climax of the novel also i felt that effie was a little obsessed with jacks money she always references his money before she talked about how awesome he was like my rich handsome boyfriend maybe I am over analyzing but i did not really like her as a character overall the writing was decent but the story just did not capture me,132,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,5.0,positive,this is a great case it does not negatively impact the phones functionality and i think it will adequately protect my phone i had a little trouble installing the screens protective shield i should have read the directions i did eventually get the protective shield on properly,46,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,2.0,negative,i opened the box took out cover and immediately tried to put it on my phone the back snapped on great and is solidly attached i inspected the front before ever putting it on and it did not look that promising i carefully tried to attach it to the front of the pre and one of the tabs snapped off i was able to get it to stay in place 1 tab but it only lasted a few days before the others broke off now I am using the back with a rubber stick on front cover from another case set i like the look very much but the front is not very usable,112,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,5.0,positive,i took a chance on this case since it was cheap and included a pouch and screen protector i received the items 3 which included the weekend days after ordering and all items were shipped as promised i ordered the blue case which is darker than the one they show in the picture but still a beautifulthe screen protector was a little difficult to make sure it fit properly over the phone but i was successful the case fits quite snug and i am able to open the cover for the usb cord / charger without sliding open the phone the case adds a decent grip to the phone without any bulkiness if you are looking for a cheap case that works fairly well this is a good buy and you get extra items too,135,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,3.0,neutral,i really like the case that came with this order the little satchel is also nifty however the big issue is that the screen protector does not fit when the case is on when the case is attached the screen protector bubbles on all sides also there has no whole for the microphone what has up with that,56,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,4.0,positive,after reading the reviews of this cover i was kind of hesitant to purchase it but the price was so good i figured why not I am glad i did i got the green fusion cover and it fits my pre perfectly i love theand the cover makes my phone feel a lot sturdier than it did i no longer feel like I am going to break the keyboard when typing on it the top cover snapped right on but i had a slightly harder time snapping on the bottom cover after the 2nd try it went easily into place the phone slides the same as it did before and it does not feel bulkier just more secure I am not afraid to hold it anymore and it still fits in the small side pocket of my purse i think I am going to get another cover for my hubbys pre the only problem i had with this order was the screen protector it came with i could not get it on without bubbles so i just threw it away did not really bother me because the case was the big draw not the screen protector,191,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,5.0,positive,as advertised i had hoped for a case that would give me a little more traction and protection while not turning it into a clunky eraser for a white board i am impressed the case fit together easily and the functionality is not hindered it actually provides a bit of sturdiness that helps out a bit on the opening and closing i can see how the charger might be a slight problem this is not the case for me as the little cover for the usb connector broke off the day i got it now the case protects this area nicely if you are looking for something to absolutely protect your screen from breaking this is probably not it as it provides some extra padding but that is outside the scope of what they are doing here overall great product and great service highly recommended,145,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,1.0,negative,do not buy this case i got it 2 days ago and it already broke it is really cheap plastic that breaks if you remove the case i only took off the case twice and now when i try to put it back it does not snap into place anymore,49,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,5.0,positive,I have had my case for a few days now and am very happy with it it looks good and the rubber has a nice feel to it it was extremely easy to install it does not interfere with any functionality except as another reviewer pointed out it does prohibit closing the phone when the usb charger is attached,58,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,4.0,positive,this case is all good i fits perfectly i would give it a five but the screen protector does not cover the entire face there is a niceat the bottom for voice speaker whatever you cal it so callers can hear your voice it should have been long enough with a hole in it but this is still a great case and screen protector it is a must buy i do not think it gets any better than this and plus you get a fewoptions the phone fits perfectly into your pocket it still has it is slim sleeky design i recommend this for pal pre users,107,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,1.0,negative,contend states 5options but only 3 are shown it this product available in black,17,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,1.0,negative,this palm pre case does not fit very well and is very hard to get on and off since i use the magnetized charger i have to take the back off to charge it and this is a huge hassle it also prevents my phone from locking sometimes i would not buy this product again cheap knockoff,58,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,2.0,negative,so yeah when i first got the cover i was excited because i lost that original bag it came with but then i tried to put on the screen cover and that had a bend in it so it would not properly stick without airbubbles then i lost the little pouch it came in somewhere then when i snapped on the case the back went on fine but the front however would not clip everytime i opened the phone it would come off it became really frustrating that i do not even use the front cover and on a side note just having the back cover it really is plastic and flimsy it shakes a lot pretty much this deal is cheap and the product is cheap i am going to buy the seido case today instead,135,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,4.0,positive,the case has a good feel to it and unlike some of the other pre cases it does not interfere with the use of the unit the case came with a few screen protectors which is nice as with all screen protectors they eventually need replaced I am pretty happy with it the only reason it is not 5 stars is the charger / usb door is a little tough to open with the case on unless you have long nails,77,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,2.0,negative,there was no problem whatsoever with customer service or delivery but i have purchased three of these covers we have 2 palm pres and all three of them have broken,30,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002QIQ76K,3.0,neutral,i really like theand finish of this case blue one big problem although this case is not compatible with the touchstone charger i would have appreciated knowing that upfront otherwise the case does not impair functionality i cut a large hole with a dremel tool and it works great now with the touchstone in fact no more guessing exactly where to position the phone on the charger case is solid and will protect the phone when it inevitably bites the pavement,83,14
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,1.0,negative,do not waste your money I am sure the authors time is worth something but the writing was very bad why say as stated if you had stated or how many howevers do you need without all the extraneous words you could find the information on any garlic bulb package may help if you were trying to grow from bulk plants where there are no directions included,65,0
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,1.0,negative,this book covers all the processes involved in having a garlic garden however it seems to me that there is a lot of information missing in addition this book is full of grammatical errors which make it hard to read it would be great to have some illustrations for example there could be one with the part of the plant the different stages of growth the ideal places to plant the garlics and more my recommendation is to wait for a new and corrected edition,84,1
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,4.0,positive,i like this book due to the fine details it is a must read for growing garlic and doing it right,20,2
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,3.0,neutral,will i have garlic this spring i followed the instructions and with my super i live in new york city will see what happens,23,3
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,5.0,positive,a must havein todays day and age even the most savy are quick to learn about the importance of sustainability and all in one book,24,4
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,2.0,negative,it saddens me that books are put on the market without adequate proof reading nearly every page has grammatical errors or typos it took away from my reading pleasure i would only recommend this book when it is free and that is with the disclaimer that it is more like a rough draft than a finished copy,55,5
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,4.0,positive,having recently retired i now have more time to plow into gardening i have had gardens since age 8 but never had much success with garlic this short presentation answers a lot of my questions and points me in the right direction have some soil amending to take care of but looking forward to putting these guidelines into practice in my garden,62,6
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,1.0,negative,i found this to be overly verbose full of fluff sentences short on actual detail and mostly generalizations you have to read through entire paragraphs to find one sentence that actually says something useful,34,7
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,2.0,negative,the information is a little better than the absolute basics but the book seems to be written as a high school research paper the authors writing style is a real turn-to off and to have a good garlic garden there is a lot that this book does not cover,48,8
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,4.0,positive,this is a very well written guide for the novice planter of garlic my husband has planted garlic for 13 years and he picked up a couple of tips from of it well done,34,9
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,1.0,negative,this pamphlet reads like a junior high 4h report and not a very interesting one read the seed catalogue and the directions that come with your purchase skip this it is not worth it,33,10
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,3.0,neutral,there is a lot of good information in this book the book could use a good editor it could probably be a third shorter if all the unnecessary fluff were edited out,32,11
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,3.0,neutral,has some good information but the content does not flow well and is not organized it lacks detailed descriptions pictures would have helped,22,12
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,5.0,positive,i can not wait to get started i love garlic in everything this spring you are going to find me in my gardens,22,13
Kindle_Store,B00FVXZ57Y,2.0,negative,for a book entitled how to plant it was woefully short on actual usable instruction i was expecting and hoping for something along the lines of a checklist something like 1 buy this specific brand of garlic 2 prep your soil using this and more instead we got advice that basically came out like it is really important that you buy the right type of garlic so make sure you do and it is really important that you have the right type of soil so check that out not too useful to me there were a few good nuggets but the title was quite misleading,102,14
Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,5.0,positive,there were many good useful applications in this book looking through the book and apps i was able to find others apps i could use as well,27,0

Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,4.0,positive,definitely worth a look thanks would not of looked at it if i would have had to pay for it,20,7
Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,1.0,negative,maybe hot apps but when you tap get it here it goes to amazon and the green box says app not for my kindle fire against,27,8
Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,4.0,positive,very concise and informative quick and to the point with no unnecessary fluff i was surprised by the apps I had not heard of yet,24,9
Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,1.0,negative,sorry this was not very useful for me perhaps i downloaded the wrong book a few cool apps in this book but nothing you could not find easily enough on your own without much searching,35,10
Kindle_Store,B00B1FDWDK,4.0,positive,there are apps i would not have thought about and apps i had trouble finding links are there for downloading convenience there are also apps not listed that are necessary like es file explorer,33,11

Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,2.0,negative,this is you reading my review this is you wondering whether a story about a serial killer stalking a swimming team will be interesting this is you wondering why anyone would write anything in this annoying style this is me warning you that the novel is written in this aggravating headache producing alienating fashion if that is not bad enough you have one dimensional unlikable characters who behave selfishly and oddly throughout there is no suspense and the only thing satisfying about the ending is that it is over although the authors portrayal of swimming meets and practices is accurate these are the cattiest nastiest pushy sports parents ever their kids are not much better a bunch of entitled brats but perhaps the biggest disappointment is the serial killer if you want to make a mystery boring well this is how you do it pass,145,0
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,4.0,positive,the writing style is definitely an acquired taste but I am kinda quirky myself so i enjoyed the change my strongest suggestion is to read the opening chapter and see if you find the writing format oddly enjoyable the suspense was delicious,43,1
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,2.0,negative,lot of swimming not much else plot eh characterization eh conclusion eh had to finish it to see how it ended eh,19,2
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,3.0,neutral,apparently the unusual writing style used to tell this story annoyed lots of readers it did not particularly bother me the story was a good one and i did not have any trouble sticking to the end the characters were not the most believable but it was not a bad way to pass a cold winter night,55,3
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,4.0,positive,written from an interesting perspective i liked the character development the ending was satisfying,14,4
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,4.0,positive,told in the second person this is a book that makes you the main character that can be very distracting but you has your moments a serial killer is on the loose and only you knows who he is you can not tell the others who he is and the only thing you can do is read helplessly while the other characters slowly figure it out oh you,67,5
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,2.0,negative,the first two words in the title of the book is the way ms murphy began many sentences in this is the water and it seems to be her writing style to me it was an odd unique style and took a bit of getting used to this is the water is about a swim team the parents of the swimmers and about a murder that affected the entire community i was looking for a mystery but found a book mostly about swimming and the personal lives of the teams parents it was a bit difficult to get started because of how the book was written the book did keep you guessing although about who the murderer was that was killing young girls at rest stops when it was revealed the scene was quite scary and the murderer was someone you would not expect i continued to read the book because i wanted to find out how it would end but i did skim quite a few pages 2/5 this book was given to me and my book club as a win in a contest on tlc no compensation was given and this review is my opinion,196,6
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,5.0,positive,murphys prose is not for the general page turning crowd his style demands focus and attentiveness however once i got used to the repetitive nature of yannick murphys writing i could not put down great story with captivating characters and action,41,7
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,5.0,positive,this is a novel that is written in a very unusual style which is actually part of it is success it develops characters builds suspense and twists and turns the plot all while keeping the reader hooked until the very end excellent read,42,8
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,3.0,neutral,liked the story but found the stylistic approach heavy handed and distracting if i never read the term this is it will be too soon,23,9
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,5.0,positive,one of my favorite books of the year the unusual writing style helped build tension as the story unfolded and kept me interested,23,10
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,2.0,negative,do not like the writing format this is ridiculous that a killer would decide not to kill someone in their grasp because they are not young enough,28,11
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,3.0,neutral,the constant reference to the swimming pool became tiresome after awhile,11,12
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,3.0,neutral,like the call this is not a conventional novel and that is good while i applaud the authors experiments with style and techique this book began to grate on me about halfway through it would have worked better for me if it had been a shorter book with fewer characters or more well defined ones i found myself reading for pages and not knowing what character we were with the swim team milieu was interesting and full of detail the author is good at atmosphere and contrasting the ordinary and extraordinary in life while i can not give this 4 stars i feel it is a noble effort and i do look forward to her next book,117,13
Kindle_Store,B00GG02SIA,4.0,positive,this is me reviewing this is the water yannick murphy delivers a chilling psychological thriller that threads together the lives of a community and especially one of it is members but as much as i enjoyed the story and it is pacing so many paragraphs start with this is the water this is you annie this is you in the foyer this is an evening at home this is dinah deciding to lose weight you get thei can not believe murphys editor did not say i refuse to let you ruin this book by adding so many clunky starts you are not allowed to use the word this i would have given this book five stars but all the this is thrown in really derailed the pace and the tone which is a shame because murphy is a very good writer and this story is quite compelling a badall around,147,14
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,3.0,neutral,i was expecting a walk through the html5 specs and how to use them instead i got a quickie review of the new features in html5 it may be ok for someone who is totally unfamiliar with html markup but for anyone with experience i would suggest looking for something more robust,52,0
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,5.0,positive,gets the point across about new features in the world of html touches on key features of next gen implementation in web development,23,1
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,2.0,negative,it is really difficult to complain about something that is free but i did spend the time to read the entire pamphlet hoping that I had find something useful and i did not i m not sure who the target audience is intended to be it seemed to me that to understand the context of the thesis you would have to know more than a little bit about html and dom to begin with but even with that little bit of html and dom knowledge you would be frustrated because you never get a clear example of html versus html5 and if you did not have that baseline html and dom expertise then i think that what is html5 would leave you baffled i gave two stars because the points the author makes are valid and important and it did not cost me anything but my time i just think that the points could have been made as effectively maybe more so in a 300 word blog entry which would have been worth the time to read,170,2
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,5.0,positive,this is that only book i found that really breaks html5 down very interesting and downloaded easily to my kindle,20,3
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,4.0,positive,a good survey of the subject pleased with the purchase,10,4
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,2.0,negative,i must admit i did not check to see how many pages were in this book before i downloaded it there are 10 do not expect this book to be instructional in anyway rather it is a set of small discussions on what html5 is,44,5
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,5.0,positive,i like it it helped me to manage my application ion ec2 and cloudsearch i really recommended to everyone l,20,6
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,5.0,positive,come with mine so what more do you want me to say they require a review to read it hmm,20,7
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,4.0,positive,well explained in a simple way great book for beginners as well as those who wish to use this book as a reference,23,8
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,2.0,negative,if you thrive on concepts and theory then this might be for you however i would like to see some examples to backup the theory there is only one example and it is html 4 which is used to point out why html5 is better the points made are valid and i agree with them but i was hoping to glean more information out of the book than a simple html5 is better and here are the concepts and theory as to why it is better most of this information if not all can be obtained with a simple google search and/or a few blog posts but then again it is free it may be worth the time to download / read to some people but if you are a web developer by trade then this book is probably a waste of time,138,9
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,5.0,positive,good introductory book take a full class if you want to learn more,13,10
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,1.0,negative,it was free but hardly worth the effort to download it to my kindle unless you simply want an overview do not download it it is ok for general knowledge,28,11
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,1.0,negative,not impressed not very deep and somewhat repetitive,8,12
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,2.0,negative,as i am starting to learn html 5 i was expecting to receive primary guidance from this book it is very good for advanced users but for beginners like me it will not be of any help,36,13
Kindle_Store,B005ISQ7JM,1.0,negative,it is not describing anything in detail only writes broadly about html5 if you are a technical person or a developer it is totally waste of time I am very disappointed about this book,31,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,3.0,neutral,did not hold up well for normal teenage usage,9,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,3.0,neutral,i got this case on a pretty heavy discount i certainly would not pay full price for it it fits more or less well although on the top and bottom edges of the screen the rubber gets stuck under the plastic due to this a little piece of the plastic case broke off around the headphone jack other than that it is a fairly good cheap case it looks nice anyway i probably would not buy another,74,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,2.0,negative,stiff buttons and bad design also very prone to dirt after just a week the case ripped just from opening and closing the cover on the charger input and the auxiliary cover does not even snap shut it just dangles and does not really do it is job,45,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,4.0,positive,i am very picky when buying anything i do some research and watch and read several reviews i liked what i read about this case i was a bit hesitant when i read the buttons were stiff however mine are great they are very easy to press the dust guards work well the headphone jack is for slim headphone plugs as is the charger slot i use paypal for my small business and the card reader does not fit with the case on there is a slight rainbow effect on the screen protector but only in a couple of small areas so i think it is a defect on mine,108,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,3.0,neutral,this phone case fits perfect this is my second same case for my galaxy s4 I have dropped it many times and have not cracked my screen there has two phones apparently galaxys4 and galaxys4active make sure you get the right case galaxys4active phone case is a little bit bigger than this one and your phone will be lose inside the case,59,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,1.0,negative,this is the wrong case i need to return it i need a case for s4 active,17,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,1.0,negative,it was broken when arrived returned for a refund,9,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,2.0,negative,product is ok charging port flap does not work that well constantly have to keep closing it because it does not stay shut,21,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,4.0,positive,i liked this case because it was relatively slim and easy to hold and handle i did have to ask my other half how to open it up to put the phone inside since the instructions were in the closed case and i was afraid I had break it trying to separate the two pieces once we put the case on i had no problems pressing the buttons or snapping the port covers back into place and the screen protector did it is job without a hitch but I am a bit of a klutz and was afraid this case would not be protective enough if i dropped it on a tile floor he had ordered the trident kraken and after making sure i could hold it firmly in my much smaller hand i ordered one of those and am happy with it I am keeping the cyclops as back-up and would recommend it to anyone not given to frequent fumbling in risky places,159,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,2.0,negative,case is well built sturdy and will protect your phone but it has a number of issues 1 the biggest problem the power and volume buttons on the case are very hard to press I have tried reaseating the phone several times but to me it seems that the plastic rim that holds the screen protector in place gets in the way of the buttons 2 headphone port is too small you will need to make sure your headphone plug is a slim type anything larger will not fit 3 charging port is too small luckily the included white samsung charger that came with the gs4 works fine but probably like many other folks i too have a various micro usb chargers and anything larger than the charger included with the gs4 does not fit with that all said if you pay full price for this case i think you should look else where or wait for trident to fix the buttons do not get me wrong the quality of the case the build quality design and details are top notch but keep in mind you will need to interact with the power and volume buttons everytime you use your phone,197,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,4.0,positive,great size already protected my phone from a couple falls the charge / data flap showing some wear after only a few weeks still very happy with it,26,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,3.0,neutral,it looks good but my son still managed to crack his screen with the case on not sure why it should of protected it but did not,26,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,1.0,negative,poor fit and still allows dust in buttons do not work good either bought one for my wifes galaxy s4 active and it was flawles so i got one for my s4 and it was pitiful so now i have to shop for another and spend more money I am not happy,50,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,4.0,positive,well constructed case fits nice in your pocket not to bulky the only thing is the buttons are hard to push not a big deal it is not like they are going to get turned on while in your jeans other than that it is a good product,46,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BQYE9H4,5.0,positive,i bought this case for my husband new galaxy s 4 it fits perfectly the phones locks in perfectly the plastic cover is sturdy but still let us you use the touch screen with no problems,35,14
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,1.0,negative,this is dr dres worst album ever it seems it was rushed and made in a day all the songs are boring and the production sucks i will try and forget that dre ever made this cd do not buy this garbage,42,0
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,5.0,positive,a nice compilation by dr dre not better than both chronics or compton but it was a good start after he left death row i like the whole cd but east coast west coast killa was why i bought it it brought back some memories,45,1
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,5.0,positive,tight beats specially rbx dres next album chronic 2001 will finally put aftermath on the map,17,2
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,5.0,positive,thank you my husband really enjoyed this cd and listens to it oftenthamk you so much really appreciate it cool,20,3
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,3.0,neutral,this could have been a classic if dre would have let his artists do that hardcore stuff even if he did not wanna do gangster rap anymore himself dre should have stuck with his p funk roots and this would have been a instant classic i always liked the first chronic better,51,4
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,2.0,negative,I am glad i did not bougth this new i bougth it used and gave it away a couple of days later simply because the album hardly got any good songs the only ones worth mention is the intro eastcoast / westcoast killaz been there done that and the mel-man track called shi n on the world and for does songs i would not pay this much skip it unless you are a true dr dre fan that buys everything he touches i recommend either the chronic or 2001 if you want dre at his best,89,5
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,4.0,positive,everyone really hated this cd i do not mind it yeah it was his worst but it is still worth having if your a true dre fan there are some really good songs like aftermath [ intro ] eastcoast westcoast killaz sh ttin on the world blunt time been there done that fame nationawl as the world keeps turning it is not all bad loosin up good job dre,64,6
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,1.0,negative,i can not believe i was excited to buy this cd,10,7
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,2.0,negative,the seller did a great job nothing bad to say about that i was looking for the new aftermath cd that was supposed to be released on 4/20 but could not find it in stores so i ordered what i thought was it on here this cd sucks dr dre does not even do much vocals and the beats and sound in general does not sound like what i expected from such a great artist adam,73,8
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,3.0,neutral,dr dres first release after leaving death row with this compilation of heavy hitters and newcoming artists with aftermath the intro strarting off this lp it seemed to be headed for a five star classic east coast / west coast killas by group therapy consists of four emcees rappers of killing lyrics of rbx krs-one b-real and nas mel-man drops mediocre lyrics over the heavy bassline and hard kicks on sh tin on the world rbx bats again on the solo blunt time as he continues to deliver the hard lyrics as done on the chronic newcomer r b diva kim summerson delivers an impressive performance on choices dre has a song of his own been there done that as he compares himself to other rappers emcees and producers the highlight of this release is production,134,9
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,1.0,negative,i bought this a long time ago thinking it was going to be full of the usual heat dr dre brings i remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase i ever made for an album there is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks one after another there are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value i still enjoy them to this day of course it is because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like krs-one nas king tee and an actual song with dr dre on it keepers east coast / west coast killas been there done that str8 gone throw the rest in the garbage and press delete,128,10
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,4.0,positive,this is a fairly good album by dr dres company aftermath and there are some excellent songs on here an obvious standout would be east coast / west coast killaz by nas krs-one b-real and rbx other good songs are been there done that by dre sh ttin on the world by mel man and the less popular songs king ts absolutely amazing str-8 gone and shariefs song los angelesw which may be the best song on the album rcs cover of the song fame is good and king ts verse is excellent however the rest of the album is simply cliched r b and a disspointing song by rbx buy it it is not that bad,111,11
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,4.0,positive,i like this album rap hip hop r b god sounds all in this production of dr dre my favorite song east-west coast killaz featuring rbx krs one cypress hills b-real and nas is the bomb and been there done that is all classic,42,12
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,3.0,neutral,it is alright the majority of the cd seems to be rnb although i did not really even bother with it the good rap songs although are on the world blunt time and been there done that,36,13
Digital_Music,B001NZ0WP4,4.0,positive,i would recommend this cd to fans of r b and smooth hip-hop it is well produced and has variety nas krs-one and b-real are on it and i got this used through this website dre is the executive producer so it is really well-produced from top to bottom and I have played it a lotta times it is definitely worth the cheap price i paid for it it is kinda old school and i guess that is why peeps is hatin on it every song is not about shootin niggas this cd is probably not for illiterate gang bangers or gangsta wannabees these songs are by the new artists that dre was trying to introduce from his new label after he left death row,118,14
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,3.0,neutral,an interesting concept for the story but it was not executed well i did not realize this was not a full length book when i purchased it so i was surprised by the lack of details and nuance in the stories execution while i enjoyed the characters they were not given time to develop fully so it was hard to emotionally connect to them,60,0
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,1.0,negative,i downloaded this book because it was free for the kindle and I am glad i did not waste any money on it it is rushed and just overall not very good,29,1
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,5.0,positive,it is always a joy to read a delilah marvelle novel and this novella is no exception lady augustine jane ascott and the duke of wentworth are characters you can not help falling in love with i rooted for their happy-ever-after from the very first page a must read,47,2
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,5.0,positive,i loved this book a great historical romance is hard to find these days I am all about the story and marvelle is a gifted storyteller this is a keeper for me,31,3
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,3.0,neutral,the story was good but it was short and unresolved at the end I am undecided as to whether or not to continue the series but it was written well enough and kept my attention,34,4
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,5.0,positive,I have read the prequel and listened to all the books in the series the storylines are very intriguing and tearful in places to round off the stories is a good bit of humor although these could most likely be read or listened to as stand alone i would suggest the reader start with the prequel which can only be read there are also the deleted chapters to the prequel on the authors website if you listen to the series the only downfall is the switch in narrators this is a great series,92,5
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,2.0,negative,first of all i did not pay for this book it was borrowed through the local library ebook system a fact for which i am incredibly grateful because if i had paid for this mess of a book I had be hopping pissed historical inaccuracies abound pulling me out of what was a greatbut very poorly executed dialogue is as one reviewer puts it stilted and just all around terrible i get this is a prequel but the writer has to resort to telling us augustine and irving are in love she does not show us instead we have to bloody take her word for it this kind of shoddy writing makes me angry as i want to be immersed in their story and yet i feel like a dispassionate bystander nope sorry i really can not care about these characters the writing is certainly competent but that is about the only thing this book has going for it save your time and money read something,165,6
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,4.0,positive,even although this novella takes place 20-some odd years before the first book in the rumor series forever and a day i would suggest reading forever and a day first that way you are not spoiling some of the story from forever and a day plus i personally enjoyed seeing leonard first as an older gentleman in the role of rodericks father and then in the novella as his younger self finding love for the second time leonard the duke of wentworth has set his eyes on lady augustine he is ready for marriage again after seven years of mourning his first wife lady augustine has different plans although she is consumed by a family tragedy and does not think she could make any man happy until she gets some answers i found this to be a very bittersweet novella it was also pretty humorous leonards dialogue especially was very amusing I am now very much invested in finding out what happened to nathaniel looks like i will have to wait until july when forever a lady is published to learn more,181,7
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,2.0,negative,this was just a little prequel but it was so rushed lady ascott wants a husband a real one that will not lie cheat steal and everything she wants someone she can trust that will not hurt her and will love her truly love her the duke of wentworth comes along boasting about his love for her when they hardly know one another it roams a bit around their get together but then most of the story is about the mysterious loss of her brother,83,8
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,2.0,negative,this is not for those looking for a rich reading experience the plot is sketchy and there is very little character development i was not sure where the author was taking me even when i got to the end thankfully the book is short i do not recommend this one,48,9
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,1.0,negative,i totally agree with the other one star comments no story no real insight to the characters lousy dialogues the only positivity that it was for free so for me it was only a waste of time it is such a pity not only did i leave a negative review but the author will never have a chance with me again,61,10
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,2.0,negative,what the at it was like pulling teeth getting into this story then you get interested in it and it is suddenly over,21,11
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,1.0,negative,the rumor series by delilah marvelle 1 forever mine one of the worst prequels i have had the misfortune to read it starts ok and then abruptly jumps ahead and stops without giving us a gratifying conclusion of the love story the mystery part that we learn here could have been easily included in the next book and i don think you will be missing anything not reading this one i have had a great time reading the rest of the series except for the ending of book 2 there is some back and forth in time but all stories are almost simultaneous however this should be the order of your reading based on the events and the publication date 2 forever and a day 3 forever a lady 4 forever a lord,133,12
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,3.0,neutral,I have got to stop reading teasers that are put out as actual stories there was not really a romance here as much as a set-up for her next story and even then it felt incomplete and stilted the author mentions there are other chapters on her site but i just did not love the characters enough to put more effort into them i think i set myself up to be disappointed by assuming this would feel like a completed story line and teasers just never do,82,13
Kindle_Store,B0061N848A,5.0,positive,so I am usually not one for the shorties i love a full length in-depth sweep you away romance that i can spend hours and sometimes days getting lost in that being said augustine and leonard hooked me immediately delilah marvelle did a brilliant job giving a little back story to tease me into wanting more from the upcoming series I am looking forward to reading the rest,66,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,product arrived earlier than expected and fits it is description well the one thing i that threw me off slightly was it is a baby pastel pink almost white glitter sparkle instead of the light bubble gum pink sparkle however it was a gift for a friend and she loves it when it first came in i was afraid the glitter would get everywhere however she has had it for a week now and not even a speck of glitter has rubbed off very happy,83,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,it was pretty when i first got it but turned black quickly and very dirty then the material on the case would fall off glitter was everywhere not worth it,29,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,i ordered this case with the assumption that it would actually fit my iphone 4s by verizon boy was i surprised when i got it in the mail i took it out of the packaging and tried to put it on my phone and it seemed like it was made for a completely different phone i was extremely disappointed,59,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,i hate this case because it does not protect the phone at all not even a little and it feels like card board and it does not sit even on the phone so it is lopsided i do not recommend this to anyone,40,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,i liked the case a lot it is cute and handles well it does feel a little tight around the corners I had like it to fit a little better there,30,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,this is a very pretty case the picture on amazon actually reflects what it will look like thein person it is very shimmery and i get a lot of compliments on it when i use it the price is great i would recommend this case to others,49,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,this is a super cute case i like it a lot especially if your a girl who loves pink fits my iphone 4 perfectly and it is easy to take off,30,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,it is a cute case but that is really all it has goin for it it provides no protection for the phone and the glitter did come off rather easily,28,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,my daughter loved this case so much the glitter and sparkle of it is perfect for a girly teenager like her,21,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,disappointed that i will not be able to use this case pulled it out of wrapping and immediately had glitter all over my hands can not imagine after a phone conversation how much glitter would be on my face and hands,40,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,do not usually use cases as I am careful not to drop my phone but was just looking for one as a change of scenery for my iphone like the description says the case only covers the back and some of the sides keep in mind this is not a protective case at all for what i payed for did not expect much but when i received it it was good enough i was looking for something sparkly / glittery and also got a lot of compliments from my friends it gets dirty quick because theis so light and sometimes when i slip it into my jeans pocket the blue denim rubs off onto the edges after some of the sparkles had eventually rubbed off from normal wear and tear all in all i was satisfied but decided to order the black sparkle caseat a later time because i liked the case just not the dinge it got after awhile,159,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,this pink sparles case was cheaply made it looks better in the picture than it does in person i did not like this at all,25,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,i ordered this case for my friend and i thought it was really cute and it is when she opened it she was really happy the only thing is is that it is scratchy and glitter falls off easily also theof jeans sticks to the sides of the rubber part of the case if you want a cheap case then i suggest this one it is cute and simple,69,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for and that is true in this situation too i used it a few times and then threw it away because it was getting discolored and the coating was peeling off the hard plastic case oh we will,42,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,this is exactly how it was pictured and very affordable so far it is so good it is sparkly and pink,20,14
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,5.0,positive,have you ever wondered how a lawyer feels after he helps a client he knows is guilty beat the legal system i loved this book i read it in 2 days and could not put it down great plot twists that i did not see coming some puncution and grammer errors but they did not get in the way of the story it does answer the question about why some attornyes will work for clients that they know are guilty great read,79,0
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,4.0,positive,i like this book because the topic interesting the questions posed by author are ones that i have had myself while i this is not a true crime story it does give you something to think about travis is very good at his job of getting people an acquittal some people felt the vigilante was cleaning up behind travis how much effort would the police put into finding someone that was taking care of what the legal system did not it is definitely worth reading,83,1
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book by an author I had never read before plot was interesting and new with a very unexpected ending and the price was terrific for my kindle,29,2
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,1.0,negative,this book could have been really enjoyable however there were so many words spelled wrong words left out wrong words used loose instead of lose about 100 times that i had a difficult time reading this book if mr shea decides to place another book on kindle please please please have someone proofread it before putting it out there for the world to read subject matter and novel concept would have gotten 5 stars but the rest caused it to be only one star,85,3
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,1.0,negative,a good premise spoiled by mixed-up facts and a sophomoric writing style and then there was the ending i can not remember ever being so disgusted with a protagonist and the way the author treated him what was the author saying oops,42,4
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,1.0,negative,i read many thrillers and this one falls short after getting off to a good start the endingwas not good,20,5
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,5.0,positive,this is the first time i have written a review i really really liked this book the characters were real and the plots and twists made it an enjoyable read to the end by the way the end was not what i expected,43,6
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,2.0,negative,the plot of this book was great but the presentation of the book was awful the dialogue between the two main lawyers was very high schoolish i noticed more than once the word where was used in place of were the first time i thought it to be an error but once i saw it more times i knew it was just someone who has not a clue i got tired of seeing the in a lot of the dialogue the usually fell at the end of a line so one of the dots started on a new line with a lower case word and it just threw the whole sentence off if you can get through the high school dialogue the childish behavior of his wife the bad punctuation and missuse of words then you will have a decent book to read,139,7
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,3.0,neutral,i just finished reading defending evil and found the premise and story held my interest it was however marred by the many grammatical errors improper use of punctuation improper word usage loose instead of lose many times i kept thinking of vince flynn in an interview i watched him do one time he told of how he could not spell worth a darn so had an editor who went over what he wrote and put in the proper spelling and punctuation so his books would be readable it seems mr shea has a talent for writing perhaps recruiting a person to proofread and correct is in order,107,8
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,2.0,negative,this author seems to have an imagination capable of good plot development but his execution falls short for me at about the 3/4 mark poor spelling and usage bad sentence structure odd punctuation and incomplete editing are combining to make this a tough read in addition the writing level and depth seems to be descending from the mature toward the juvenile I am having trouble forcing myself to finish,68,9
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,5.0,positive,ever wonder why attorneys represent guilty clients i hate it when a review gives away the story so I shall be careful because this was a really enjoyable read with a great ending and i would have been sad if someone had ruined it for me the story was well written and hard for me to put down i kept sneeking reads at the office and finished it in a day ok i read it a lot at the office because i had to find out what happened next there were some great twists to the story that kept catching me by surprise and kept me turning pages or rather clicking pages the charaters were wonderfuly developed even if i did not like all of them it is hard to like a murderer oh and yes it did answer the question of why some attorneys defend clients they know are guilty of terrible crimes enjoy,155,10
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,2.0,negative,the story line is probably alright but i have trouble getting past all the grammatical errors words left out and/or misspelled lots of them and this author apparently loves exclamation points there are so many it makes it look like the book was written by someone very immature oh sorry got carried away,55,11
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,4.0,positive,i just finished reading the book it was a really good story that kept me interested all the way through if you like suspense this book is definately for you there were some grammar and punctuation errors but they in no way took away from the story i would definately recommend this book great job mr shea,57,12
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,5.0,positive,i read in the other reviews about the proofreading errors i must confess that while it has been very noticeable in some of the other books I have read i was so engrossed in the story i did not really notice them here this book had me from the beginning and while i thought i knew where it was going i was surprised at the end if you like legal thrillers this book is for you,74,13
Kindle_Store,B0036FTZZW,5.0,positive,i too like so many others in the kindle world i have noticed download random inexpensive or free books sometimes taking our chances with what we are getting i personally had never read anything by charles shea but i thought the book was great i found it hard to put my kindle down and on my breaks reading from my iphone at work i have since added him to my of oh yeah i will read this guys again list,80,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,5.0,positive,i buy a new inexpensive one every couple of months and this one held up the best in my 12 year olds hands,23,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,4.0,positive,it was just as i had expected and it came pretty fast i would order it again it was cheap and did exactly what i needed it to do,29,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,1.0,negative,the design is really bad the plastic is inside and the rubber is outside which is really bad way of protecting the edges and glass of a smart phone and i am saying so is because it did not protect my razer from breaking when in fell it is really good on price but not worth it as the replacement digitizer would cost 180 200 so it is better to buy someting that would protect the razer really well will not recommend to others,81,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,5.0,positive,ok this is a look alike and similar protection to the otterbox series my husband uses and loves i do not use belt clips so this option was better for me the little stand is helpful at times too the plastic case itself is a little fragile in removal from phone and the stand is not a sturdy plastic either there is no screen cover or protection of any kind included with this case so additional purchase of that is required for the price although you can not get better and we have purchased a 2 and intend on getting a few more in various colors and as always we keep a few screen protectors on hand just to ensure the phones are as protected as possible the gorilla glass is only so safe if dropped and scuffed,135,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,4.0,positive,do not think this is going to make your phone indestructible it adds a lot of bulk to an already big phone i bought it for my son and even with the case on it he managed to bend the phone enough to break the screen and of course has nohow it happened if you do not mind the bulk and drop your phone often you will probably like it and it does add quite a bit of protection,79,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,1.0,negative,this is absolutely the worst case ever it does not fit the xt912 as it states i can not even get the hard plastic inner case to lock together on my phone i left the hard case in 2 pieces and just applied the rubber case over it still terrible the power and volume buttons can not be used while the rubber case is on do not buy this one i would look for a better case,74,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,1.0,negative,i have an xt912 however this case is not made for the xt912 despite what the description and packaging says do not waste you money,24,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,5.0,positive,this case has worked fine for my husband who is a plumber and in the field all day plus the kickstand allows him to play is games on the phone also,32,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,3.0,neutral,case is set up nice gives the phone some girth to hang onto but noticed after having it it is hard to use the side power and volume buttons it has the bumps to use but does not always work so 3 stars for inconvenient,43,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,3.0,neutral,it worked it looked cool but then the buttons would not work when i tried taking it off the tabs snapped so it will work and look great for a while but the rubber for the buttons is to flimsy and they stop working,43,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted kick stand works well and i have dropped my phone at least 8 times since the purchase of this cases and I am happy with it fits motorola droid period would recommend as a replacement to outerbox,40,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,3.0,neutral,the cover is good but does not line up on the right side so i have to pull it back to press then button nice price and protects the phone although,31,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,4.0,positive,it is a pretty good fake otterbox the only thing is the stand broke but that took a while before it happened,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,3.0,neutral,this is okay much bigger in person when you get it on the phone which is already big to begin with but not terrible,24,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VYMHT6,5.0,positive,this case is fantastic quality it is a hard case for superior protection but has an additional silicone layer covers the hard case to protect the case and the phone from hard impact the silicone is thickest on the corners where it would most likely hit if dropped you can not beet the quality and price of this I had take this over otterbox any day it protects your phone better and is way cheaper,73,14
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,5.0,positive,i have purchased several calendars for my kindle and after using them for a short time deleted them this is the best one i have found it is well worth the price and it works great easy to use and easy to see your reminders at a glance love the icons that you can pick to use for each reminder i hope that it will be available soon for the new kindle touch,73,0
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,3.0,neutral,i am shopping and chose another calendar kindle program this program is designed for needs greater than mine i need something that is not based upon work i am retired i do not have 20 words to say,39,1

Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,4.0,positive,i loved using this program but when i upgraded to the touch this is not compatible please make it available for the touch i really miss it,26,3
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,4.0,positive,this is an ok app but i think it is easier to just great a real paper planner but that is just my opinion,24,4
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,1.0,negative,this product caused my kindle to freeze up on multiple occasions i had to perform a hard reset to get it working again,23,5
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,5.0,positive,I have gotten all of the kindle calendar programs calendar pro jujuba and calendar compulab calendar 7 dragons task list professional jujuba and day planner and calendar magellan the calendar program on this page day planner and calendar by magellan is my new favorite 1 icons for events look great in month views 2 every detail in other programs seems to be in this one 3 first program with a decent year page 4 offers choices of us holidays canada holiday provincial holidays popular events and moon phases 5 give good flexibility for tasks and events recurring events are easy 6 tasks can be marked as done so this becomes a decent to-do list program as well pressing c brings up a bold clock which advances every minute it looks like magellan read every review on all the programs mentioned above to see what people wanted when you first launch the program you will get an excellent looking month of your activities superb program in every way highly recommended,177,6

Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,3.0,neutral,do not like the fact that only certain holidays are included ease of use is okay bought a different calendar planner that seems to be more flexible,27,8
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,5.0,positive,love this little app it is so versitle and so much can be entered onto it love having the clock also very flexible to your daily needs schedules in addition i love having access to a 12 month calander on one page as a great bonus,48,9
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,1.0,negative,disappointing very cumbersomeuse not worth it a waste of my hard earned money for sure do not buy it,21,10
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,3.0,neutral,i thought that this would be better but i found this harder to use it took extra steps to record my events especially if they were repeating events it was harder and took extra steps to find the events and tasks of the day sure it has more icons but most of them were unusable for my purposes 7 dragons calendar is much easier to use shows the days events on the opening page and does not take an extrato check off a task,86,11
Kindle_Store,B005OGO2AY,2.0,negative,i have had the planner and calendar for a short period i think i would like it more if i could be able to reset the time on the clock i have tried several ways to try and fix it but to no success if i could get an answer to how to adjust the time i think i would be happy i have this program on my kindle,69,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i purchased this as a friend has one and i read the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a good bluetooth device well it is not working the way it is intended this is the first bluetooth device i have tried to own i originally bought this from amazon and after charging it up completely i could only get less than 24 hours on it in standby i contacted cardo and they told me that it could be the coupling to the phone and asked which phone i have after another email to them they said it sounds like a defective headset and i can send it back which i did i received a replacement one very quickly and it has the same problem and people tell me it has too much static for them to talk comfortably to me with it i could live with the battery life as i only use it in the car while driving but can not live with the static so it is useless I am going to i will say that cardo was extremely customer oriented and amazons customer service was great as well but this device does not live up to what i was hoping for i would not recommend it,205,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i have my cardo scala paired with a sanyo katana ii cell phone people say they can hear me fine but on my end voices sound a bit hollow also when i hear my cell phone ring it takes about five rings before the scala picks up the signal those are my issues with it for the price i can live with it because i only use it for a few minutes a day during my short commute to work but if you are someone uses a bluetooth all day i would look at a different one,96,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,I have owned a scala 500 a 700 and now the 700lx in addition to a few models of motorola headsets the scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity and handle wind noise far better than any motorola I have used i only recently replaced my 500 battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it would not hold a charge with a 700 which i loved until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine the 700lx is nearly identical to the 700 with one added improvement the earpiece on the 700lx unlike the base 700 has a much stiffer wire for custom fit this way when you get it to fit it is more likely to fit after you mash it around in your pocket another great feature is turning off the blue blinky led so you can be a bit more disreet when calling it has a bunch of other features too many to list but most are useful I am surprised this brand is not more commonly availabe in stores it works outside in the wind it has great sound and is tiny what more can you ask for,189,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this is the second scala 700 set that I have owned the first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use i did not drop it i tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working overall the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly it will crack however we all want a lightweight headset so maybe i should not complain the scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the on your cell phone however you have to press the button on the scala after picking up incoming calls this results in a 2 - 3 second delay an eternity if you have got another person on the line saying hello hello it is got it is drawbacks but it is the only headset that works consistently with my treo 650,142,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,after evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range i choose this one based on features and reviews unfortunately the first one recieved was defective and would not hold a charge amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well it has an automatic answer feature so you do not have to take your hands off the wheel to anawer incoming calls you can turn this feature on or off overall it appears to be a very good unit,80,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device it is almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket even comes with a carrying case battery life is very good and speaker volume was actually too high at times but easily adjusted when speaking with other people they were able to hear me very clearly occasionally the noise canceling would cut off my voice if i was too quiet when driving in a car this happened rather frequently in short this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments the jawbone may be better at managing noise but it is far more expensive get this if you are looking for a deal,124,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,i got the cardo scala 700lx to replace my cardo scala500 which i really liked but unfortunately lost i also had a motorola which had terrible range and no volume so i decided to go for another cardo headset i looked at the original scala 500 and 700lx and decided to get the upscaled model it is smaller than the 500 works just as well has a few more features like bluetooth 20 includes ac and car charger works perfectly with the iphone,83,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,the 700 was better than the 500 but less comfortable however the sound quality was so good my wife also bought one the biggest problem we had at first was bending the ear piece to be at least moderately comfortable my wifes headset fell apart literally one day she still uses it but holds it together with rubber bands a couple months later mine also fell apart unfortunately mine hit the ground after breaking in two and stopped working neither of us dropped our headsets they just came apart at the seam if it did not have such good sound and work well for voice dialing the discomfort and flimsiness would have me lowering it another star or two,118,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,2.0,negative,this headset was a bit of a disappointment as it has a lot of background noise sounds a little fuzzy and does not stay snug to the ear,27,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,i have never used an ear piece before but i am impressed with this one so far,17,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i ordered this as i have had the cardo 500 and found it to be good value my 700 lx arrived and would not take a charge returned it and got another same problem cardo says send it back to them and pay my own postage and they will send me a working one I am thinking maybe i will just get something else fed up with wasting money on postage and time going to post office,76,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i bought this headset mainly because it was ranked as having really good loud incoming volume it does i can hear people in the car now it is great from that point the only slight problem i have is the microphone volume people i speak to often hear echoes and i can not adjust anything to get rid of them still it was a worthwhile purchase,65,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,this is a great headset it works well comfortable easy to use and the price is right i would recomend this to anyone looking to buy a headset,28,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,it did not work for me it would only link to my phone when it was plugged up,17,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,original unit was defective asked for replacement which works perfectly returning original unit for credit,15,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,1.0,negative,this is not a good product i have tons of fingerprints trapped under the screen protector this is the 3rd product I have bought and have yet to find a good one more problematic is the fact that the top screen protector is not cut properly the holes are measured correctly i can not recommend buying this,55,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,5.0,positive,this is an awesome set of protectors comes with covers for front back and the sides if you have the slightestwhat you are doing it is very easy to install and works great,35,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,5.0,positive,purchased this for my black iphone 4s applied it as-per instructions but i must have had a fairly dust environment when i applied it because there was a fair amount of it beneath the film to fix it i removed the film washed it with warm water and hand soap then applied the film while still wet it worked great little to no dust under the film also i had to remove te back and side film because it interfered with the case i purchased over all the wrapsol film is fantastic and looks / feels great highly recommended,97,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,1.0,negative,do not waste your money like i did please worst film ever designed squeegie messes up the film and tons and tons of bubbles do not i repeate do not buy,31,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,1.0,negative,there are three big reason for money wasting 1 finger prints problem 2 bubbles problem 3 need very pro skill to apply i think after buy that product 95 people will be unsatisfied conclusion please buy original wrapsol kit,40,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,3.0,neutral,one this wrapsol is for a cdma model not a gsm at t for example two even with the stupid wrapsol on it my phone got a scratch on a side and it was a less than a meter fall three it seems to protect my phone but actually it is a polluting piece of junk since that time that it fell down i only use it with a bumper case note it does protect against keys and that type of sharp items that can fit in my pocket with my phone but honestly i own a phone that cost me over 500 dollars so i really take care of it,109,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,5.0,positive,do not buy from this listing the reason it is so cheap is that you are going to get recalled defective product if you buy directly from wrapsol you know you are getting the newest release of their products they had a quality issue with the first batch of the iphone 4 films that they made that has since been fixed and that is what you are going to end up getting if you buy it for cheap until you see ships from and sold by wrapsol i would not bother,85,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,5.0,positive,this protector is great it does not have a sticky feel and the front and back feel like there is nothing on installation was fairly easy,25,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,3.0,neutral,the films i received were not properly cut the holes on the front did not line up perfectly with the home button and the front camera and speaker the back film is a bit short and does not cover the entire surface these things do not bother me as everything still works but if you are picky buy from wrapsol,57,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,3.0,neutral,the screen protector itself is nice quality but the holes do not line up nice with the speaker and the home button the back protector works great the big problem i had was how the side protectors fit or lack there of they are supposed to keep the silverof the iphone nice problem is you have to cut it to make it work and it still does not fit right so buy it for the main screen protector and the back one other then the sides not fitting it went on pretty easy and the one bubble i had in it was gone in 24hrs,105,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,4.0,positive,so i have to admit that the first wrapsol i got for the iphone 4 was horrendous but when buying directly from wrapsol then shipped me a new one and told me to make sure i use the squegee included to allow stretching the 2nd time around i love it and it was pretty easy to put on I am not quite sure about the respositioning part of it all but i got a perfect fit this time around and did not have to spray water with the ones you do with zagg,91,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,3.0,neutral,pros thin shiny clear and sleek to touch as opposed to zagg / invisible shield which is thicker less shiny and feels rubbery resists fingerprints bubbles resolve quickly and easily cons dry application is difficult to apply contrary to popular belief a wet application is much easier and will be lint-free and easy to reposition as in the case of zagg / invisible shield not 100 fit will be a few millimeters short in each direction but will not matter if you put it in a case like i do falls off more easily than zagg the repositional claim is misleading yes you can peel it on and off but when you do the glue gets broken and distorted as you lift it and restick it retains scratches and etches / melts i got some purell hand sanitizer on the phone and tried to wipe it off and it basically etched the wrapsol not a stain physically deformed the plastic see picture that i uploaded and note the big swirly scratches on it is caused by me trying to wipe off the purell i would watch out in case other chemicals sunscreen alcoholmelt the wrapsol,190,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,4.0,positive,it is the best so far and really reduces fingerprints highly recommend and will buy fir my ipad too,20,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,2.0,negative,the same result as i bought the evo protector the size is not right and thisis for att hope seller can mention that side protector are useless for verizon iphone,32,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003SU4ZRS,4.0,positive,note i did not purchase from amazon because at the time it was not offered but this product is great it is a little difficult to install correctly it takes time patience and a dust / hair free area also it took double the length of time they said it would to get all the bubbles out now the first one that was sent to me arrived folded over which created a crease i contacted them emailed a pic and was sent a entire new set very quick no one ever believes that i have a skin on my phone it does not stick to the fabric of my pant pockets and more do not put it in a plastic bag in especially in the heat i did this at the beach and had to re-install the product which luckily worked,138,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,4.0,positive,looks just as picture fits perfectly arrived ontime also well all i can say is that it has a smooth texture and i would recommend,25,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,4.0,positive,fits phone perfectly snaps on and stays on and is also very hard to get off i actually broke the front cover trying to get it off but overall a great product fast shipping and packaged well,37,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for thiswas inexpensive and seemed to look ok however it was very hard to get on and off it broke the first time i tried to get it off,36,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,2.0,negative,the case is ok however the clasp on the bottom broke the first time i tried to put it on,20,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,1.0,negative,this case was great for the first few days then once i removed it the first time the areas where it snapped in at slowly began falling apart one by one they would no longer snap in and the case finally broken a few days later you get what you pay for and i would recommend avoiding these type of snap on cases,63,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,2.0,negative,this is a cute case at a good price however it does not fit quite right the back piece is cut so that it covers part of the top two buttons this would be okay if you did not ever need those buttons but since the button on the top left is the lock keyboard button it is kind of a big deal add to that it is a beast to get on and off so if you ever have to do a battery pull after downloading apps for example you will come close to breaking the case just to get to the battery,100,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,3.0,neutral,this case is very strong and seems durable the only reason it lost two stars is because i charge my batteries instead of my phone so i have to take off the case to get to the battery it is very very difficult to prop open this case otherwise it has a very nice feel and seems like it can withstand a good amount of shock,66,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,3.0,neutral,close i would not recommend any one to purchase this case it arrived nicely packaged but i did not enjoy this case could of been more secure,23,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,4.0,positive,great quality product sturdy and sleek looking easy to snap together and take a part shipped quickly great price for the product,22,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,1.0,negative,i ordered this from eforcity via amazon when it arrived i thought it was odd that it was shipped in a plastic envelope without padding i opened the package and noticed that the plastic was much thinner than i expected when i went to put it on my phone i discovered what i thought was a ridge in the plastic as it turns out the ridge was really a spot where the plastic was broken upon a closer inspection i found two more broken spots I have asked to return thebut realize that buying a padded envelope will cost nearly as much as i originally paid for the case including shipping,112,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002JWJYX6,5.0,positive,product works well never falls off or comes apart love it will def buy another one if needed,18,14
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,5.0,positive,fabulous short story book i could not put this one down if you like criminal justice type novels you will be mesmerized with this book,24,0
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,1.0,negative,abysmal this is a legal thriller only in the sense that the author appears to have watched television legal comedies to gain an understanding of the legal process some artistic license is inevitable no one wants to read about weeks of evidence review in response to interrogatories but the plot here bears only a slight resemblance to the legal system in the united states the author does not understand what hearsay is and so the prosecutor reads the police statement of a missing witness to the jury in a criminal trial the author does not understand prior bad acts evidence rules and so the prosecutor in her opening statement informs the jury that the accused is a bad man who has gotten away with many crimes before and never been convicted this story reads as although a junior-high school student was asked to imagine a criminal trial granting one star was necessary in order to write a review but if i could withdraw even that i would complete waste of time,171,1
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,3.0,neutral,a basic legal short story with not much intrigue useful as a quick read when you have limited time foul language probably over used in my opinion best left out,31,2
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,3.0,neutral,frankly i was disappointed in this one mr graham previous books were great but this was not up to his standard in my opinion also this ending surprise me very abrupt and left the reader hanging,33,3
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,4.0,positive,good short story on what criminal defense attorneys are supposed to do like it or not they do not have to like their clients or believe them their job is is to get an acquittal or dismissal,37,4
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,5.0,positive,would have liked more details seemed more like a review or preview too short even for a short story in my opinion,22,5

Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,4.0,positive,all are fine thrillers i liked them all just a couple better than the others,15,7
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,1.0,negative,not a single likeable character in the story odd wording some of which may be due to an author who speaks british english as opposed to american english just a guess bad editing for example many missing words the setting is in the united states but one character is a member of parliament all in all a very unsatisfying read at least it was mercifully short,64,8
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,2.0,negative,very short the ending was incomplete because the two criminals could get even with the attorney from behind bars he is still in danger,24,9
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,4.0,positive,the title does not lie it is really a thriller,9,10
Kindle_Store,B00LADYBSS,3.0,neutral,this is a rather short predictable read i found it somewhat amusing however and would recommend it if you need to kill a few minutes,25,11

Kindle_Store,B00IY5RM04,3.0,neutral,reading fanatic cmp does an excellent job of summarizing the specifics of this short so i will not bother interesting concept but a bit short on execution i thought that the 1 sex scene was rather bland / vanilla but really liked how well these handsome hunks treated sandy at only 33 pages one can not reasonably expect a literary award winner however for a story less than 35 pages long in the erotica genre it was pretty standard content like most shorts in the genre it read like a one scene excerpt from a full length novel there is minimal character development 2 salaciously gorgeous men a m / f / m sex scene missionary style and no condom used which was a bit disconcerting for sex with 2 guys that are obviously participants in a high risk sexual behavior okay as a freebie but do not think that I had want to pay for it,147,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004VMZZ3K,2.0,negative,this cell phone worked well except for one major feature that i really needed the blue tooth connections between the phone and my other blue tooth devices would constantly drop i complained to the seller an amazons merchant and i was sent a replacement the replacement had the exact same problem so i am now using my old nokia cell phone which works perfectly when paired to my car speaker phone and my headset the seller now ignores my requests for a refund saying that i am a few weeks too late so if pairing with other devices is something that you need this cell phone will not stay connected for more than a few minutes sometimes it will reconnect but then disconnect a short time later,127,3

Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,3.0,neutral,this is the first virginia henley story i have ever read and it was a disappointment setting aside the formatting problems which were annoying and distracting there was no character development neither hero nor heroine were likable i could find no reason why the heroine would suddenly be in love with the hero after he would raped her on their wedding night before sailing away or why he would be in love with her since she would acted like a shrew from the start there was also no building of a relationship and the story line was fragmented and confusing i found the writing very clichd dialog tags like nodded stiffly said coldly drawled lazily he mocked were all overused stilted writing and a heroine with burgundy hair and violet eyes was like reading about a space alien it was also very distracting the way the author constantly skipped between character point of views so yes i was very disappointed i gave it three stars however because i believe she did a credible job with queen elizabeth,175,0
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,1.0,negative,there was a great leadup to the story and the scine was set tension was created between the two character who were to fall I am love then in three paragraphs the main character falls in love the next two pages are the sex scine and then the story is done i was so disapointed that this story was ever published i expect more from a book even a paperback or a free ebook,73,1
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,5.0,positive,this was a really nice short story i wish it was much longer i was hopping for more i recommend this book,22,2
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,3.0,neutral,virginia henley does it again with this spellbinding story of all that is sacrificed for love i would highly recommend this book,22,3
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,4.0,positive,i did enjoy this maybe not as much as her other works felt a little cheated but it is a short story after all still i have been a fan of virginia henley for many many years and will continue to read her books,44,4
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,4.0,positive,love virginia henley the history and romance is an excellent combo every time i pick up her books i can not put them down a great short story how many families does mr burke cook for throughout all these books,40,5
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,1.0,negative,i liked the premise of this but quit reading in the middle because the sex was too graphic for me,20,6
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,2.0,negative,this is typical virginia henley nothing new she uses her usual abusive language dominant male character and dominant female character with court intrigue i have not read a virginia henley novel in quite a while because she uses the same style that becomes boring and a turn off with her overuse of abusive language this novella is more of a short story that follows her usual pattern and that is rather loose as it is short there is not much character or plot development however i think that a seasoned writer like henley could have done a much better job there is a better understanding of who burgundy is but not much is done with the hero nicholas there is a disconnect between the characters that is mirrored in the plot the reader is never really sure how they fell in love or why burgundy decides to marry nicholas henley uses two plot devices that are simply not strong a letter and a book perhaps if henley had spent less time using her usual formula and offensive language she might have written a better novella,182,7
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,3.0,neutral,i usually either completely love or utterly deplore books by virginia henley this book was a surprise because it fell into neither category it is a well-written story but nothing memorable at least for me i will not be rereading this one time and time again as i have some of her other books I am glad i read it it gave me a nice escape but i easily escaped from this world and headed into another without any regrets,78,8
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,1.0,negative,yeah it was that shallow who complains about free e-books well somebody needs to maintain standards actually I am disappointed I have been wanting to try henley for years and to be fair i do plan on reading one of her full-length novels but back to this literary root canal the central plot which i have read a hundred times before made no apologies for being regurgitated claptrap nary a shred of originality to be found even naming our heroine burgundy is not as clever as misplaced speaking of which it is a nod to the sauce not the area in france and for me it is arrestingly ugly why not call her malmsey or hippocras or claret even madeira would have at least been ironic and how could any writer get glorianna so wrong her body may have aged but her mind remained ever sharp it is also not likely she would have been keen on any of her ladies marrying all right I am long here you will get your moneys worth and a craving for boeuf bourgignonne,171,9
Kindle_Store,B005DMMEMM,1.0,negative,poorly written poorly edited a lot of written mistakes the word first instead of fist for example one dimensional characters with odd dialogue the storyline made no sense and even for a short story it was not worth reading wish i could give it zero stars there are better free books out there,53,10

Kindle_Store,B00761OU0C,1.0,negative,this read like a junior high short story the sex was stuttered and uninvolved and the narrative itself was poorly written weak storyline full of cliches lacking emotion imagination and a decent vocabulary do not waste your time,37,1
Kindle_Store,B00761OU0C,2.0,negative,the book started almost in an interesting way but went never really made me care for the people and suddenly it was strange and it ended i was hoping to learn something aboutpeople and their sexuality which this book did nothing to entice or teach me anything,49,2

Kindle_Store,B00761OU0C,4.0,positive,very easy read and quick character development with hot expectant air of sexual promise but big letdown that only serious action was not with main characters and personally i hate teasers rather buy the whole story in one book than wait for next installment,42,7

Kindle_Store,B00761OU0C,1.0,negative,so i have not even gotten past page three and i can not finish this book the writing is horrendous he could get lost in them for day or even years he although huh what happened to editing spellcheck will only check for the correct spelling of a word it does not check grammar then i run into this offensive little tidbit the problem was that jaime did not like the typicalguy can you say stereotype what has a typicalguy never mind I shall move on to another book,87,9
Kindle_Store,B00761OU0C,1.0,negative,if you get this book which i got free it will make you want to read the rest of the series if you do just be prepared because it turns into something that is not romance at all a bait and switch as another reviewer said that turns into something that is not romance at all and does not end in an hea for the characters more detail in my review of the final book,73,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,3.0,neutral,great headphones for the most part with decent sound quality for the price these are a good replacement for the apple headphone but it your looking for these headphones for just music look somewhere else this is for apple headphone replacement nothing more nothing less,43,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,2.0,negative,those blue plastics a really brittle and glued on the earbuds sounded good but only lasted about a month the non tangle cord really just means that it kinks if twisted which might have broken the internal wire leading to their malfunction it was either that or the poor junction of the cord and the jack it is not reinforced for the sake of style like many mac cords,69,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,3.0,neutral,these work well and fit my ear but they do not last after a few weeks the connections start to go bad first i get intermittent sound on one side and eventually is gone the problem is near the plug,39,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,4.0,positive,the sound quality was a nice surprise i had ordered these for purposes of listening to audiobooks i assumed that such a small headset in this price range would not be good enough for music listening but this has surpassed my expectations music sounds beautiful crisp full range or close enough i had difficulty keeping the ear-buds in my ears they kept sliding out of my ears even when sedentary i wish there was some way to adjust the fit i have better luck with the other type that hooks over the top of the ear however when i wear sunglasses that type that hooks over the ear does not stay on my ears because the sunglasses are resting on top of my ears of course i have not yet found the perfect headset fit for portable music listening the cord is described as tangle-free it may be tangle resistant tangling less than some headsets but is not totally tangle free overall rating is very good taking the price into consideration,171,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,1.0,negative,if you like the horrible earphones that apple ships with their audio products ipods and iphones then these are the perfect replacements for you these ear buds are big and round about the diameter of a penny not the in-ear buds that have become more popular in the past few years you need big huge ear holes to fit these into your ears they are rigid with no flex or padding if you can comfortably fit a penny in your ear then maybe these will work for you the sound is comparable to the apple earphones not great it is hard to get better sound when they do not seat in or on your ears very well the microphone is decent i hate to be so blah about a product i know there is a segment of the market that likes this style of earphone if that is you then these should satisfy you otherwise i would avoid these earphones and keep shopping warning do not put a penny in your ear it is bad for you,170,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,4.0,positive,these work great sound quality is awesome and the mic works great the only problem i ordered these hoping they would work with my non-idevices while the headphones and mic do indeed work the call answer button does not work for any of my devices i do not own an iphone but i do own a ipod with a voip app and the call answer button still does not work the button does not work for my verizon phone either i knocked off one star for this because you would think it would match the generic call answer button for all phones but it does not i guess i need to learn a little more about cell phone button programming i figure if there can be a generic bluetooth call answer button then why can not there be a generic hard-line call answer button otherwise good pair of stereo headphones / mic,148,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,3.0,neutral,nothing special just okay had high expectations but oh well tangles more than the ordinary earphones did not like in ear types that is why i did not opt to get 216 model,29,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,1.0,negative,firstly the company has a five day return / refund policy needless to say after ordering it took nearly seven days to receive it but upon opening it and using it for two days they completely stop working a lesson learned never again,41,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,5.0,positive,my daughter stole these from me and now will not give them back when i had them it was great sound comfortable fit and the mic worked great in the car they are certainly better than the standard apple earphones i wish i had them back,45,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,1.0,negative,i used these for a few months and then the headset controls just stopped working one day sound was good but the headset controls are why i bought them so another set of headphones in the trash i am still looking for a good quality set of headphones with headset,50,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,4.0,positive,this is the second pair i bought from them same model the first one lasted about 2 years can not go wrong with the price pretty decent,26,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0046SHQG8,5.0,positive,i was delighted to receive my new planatronics head phones as a person who runs three to five miles a few times each week i enjoy listening to music in particular my old rock and roll songs on my ipod shuffle this helps to pass the time in the longer runs runnjing to the music of tallahasse lassie sung by freddy cannon or dancing queen byu abba or even garth brooks belting out friends in low places definately helps me keep a good pace my prior headphones seemed adequate but these stereo headphones allow me to hear the music better the sounds come out louder and without the static i had noticed the ear phones fit my ears adequately and are sharp looking with a silver circle on the back of the ear phone that looks classy this is comparable to most smartphones and allows the user to talk through the inline mic I am most happy with my new head phones and definatly recommend them to users of other headphones who would like an upgrade,175,13

Kindle_Store,B00CAE71L0,5.0,positive,i really liked the frugal guide to cutting cable costs there was so much useful information given by the author and it was fully worth the cost i learned a lot in the book about how modern tvs can still function with tv antennas and how far some technology has progressed even if you decide to keep your cable then the book also offers tips to help reduce costs with your cable company or by cutting other costs the guide was simple to understand and provides you information on how to obtain more information about these resources,97,2

Kindle_Store,B00CAE71L0,2.0,negative,this guide is very basic there has nothing in here that you would not already know unless you live in a cave and have never gone online the authors suggestions of using netflix hulu are too basic and obvious as for antennas have not we been using it since the beginning unless you are a senior citizen who had completely skipped technology for the past two decades I had find this to be a waste of time,73,12

Kindle_Store,B0063672C4,2.0,negative,i found the descriptions of the sex scenes to be ok but what really killed it was the twist happy ending it is definitely not what i got this for I shall admit that the sex scenes were hot and that was the only saving grace in the face of poor characterization and spontaneous changes in motivation other than that I am happy i managed to get this for free because otherwise I had be infuriated at the fact that i actually spent money on this if i need a short read and quick shameless fap i might crack it open if my memory of it does not urge me to delete it,108,7
Kindle_Store,B0063672C4,4.0,positive,i gave this book 4 stars because i thought it was better written than most books of this type a cheating housewife having unprotected sex with a man from a different race to pay her rent at first she is dressing sexily to influence her landlord then is shocked when his agent insists she have sex with him then it is daily sex and finally the rent has nothing to do with it a little unbelievable but still a fairly well written short story,84,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BXVHEZY,2.0,negative,i believe i threw this one away sound like a greatbut it is difficult to use you are unable to get into the compartment you have attached it to without removing it you still have to basically turn half way around to get into your purse not for me,51,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BXVHEZY,4.0,positive,great for my new car keeps my purse from spilling all over the seat and floor of my car great buy,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BXVHEZY,3.0,neutral,i really loved this concept and looked forward to using it for a long time unfortunately 3 of the 4 straps that hold the pursestringz to the console of my car are pulling off and have therefore rendered it useless if these straps had been connected in some other way rather than just stitched to the edges it would have been a much better design i sent a message to the vendor requesting assistance with return or exchange but have never received a response,84,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BXVHEZY,5.0,positive,my sister and i had just been saying how cars needed a place to put our purse and bam i found the pursestriingz perfect answer,25,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,cheap has a very negative connotation here I am trying to use it in a fair manner this adapter set is cheap in every sense of the word it costs next to nothing it is also made from some low grade plastics and the cable is pretty thin and very short however it works and i have had much success charging my phone in my car the down side is that the car adapter gets very hot over prolonged use i primarily use it on a vector y adapter which has pretty long extension cables i have to ensure that the car charger does not come into contact with anything flammable while in use i do not honestly think it gets hot enough to combust materials but it makes me a little uneasy if there has loose paper nearby i can not comment on the wall plug because i have not used it this is a 2 star product but it gets an extra star for a ridiculously low price point beware the overly hot adapter but enjoy the savings,174,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,1.0,negative,bought this charger for my best friend as a gift for his birthday and he told me that once he connected his palm pre to the charger the phone would go craze and the screen would turn on and off by itself do not buy go get a palm charger and save your phone from messing up,56,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,people say you get what you pay for and with this combos low price against what you would normally pay i was a little worried I am happy to say my worries were unfounded the items came quickly and they charge the phone just fine i found myself wishing the kit came with 2 cables so i had 2 individual chargers instead of running the cable from one to the other when i want to use it but the cable is just a standard micro usb cable which can be found for a couple of dollars online if you look around it is worth the purchase just to have a car charger but get yourself an extra micro usb and you suddenly have 2 new completely independent chargers i highly recommend this combo for any pre owners,135,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,i recently purchased a usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone i received my purchase in a timely manner my only problem with this purchase is that in order to get it to work you have to wiggle the cord for it to start charging my phone but it will work,61,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this was an affordable package and works great as a back up to the charging accessories provided with the palm pre,21,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone works good enough for the price and not being sprint brand,31,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i use this to charge my phone in the car on my commute back and forth to work because i listen to music from the pre during the drive mp3s or pandora the car charger works but it takes a moment for the phone to realize it is plugged in i thought it was an issue with the usb cord but i have plugged it into the computer and the wall charger and both because the phone to start charging immediately the flexibility of this combo is great i now have an extra wall charger a car charger and an extra cord to charge and sync from the computer i would recommend this for any palm pre owner,118,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,the car charger and cable portionthe order work great and are more than worth the coast i was dissapointed withthe wall charger thoug because even when the light is on it will not charge the pre,38,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,both of the chargers worked ok for me but the usb to micro-usb cable i got is only 14 long which makes it pretty much useless for connecting anything to the chargers the pictured cable is much longer also the picture of the ac charger shows a rating label of 1000 ma but the one i got is labeled 800 ma which is not a bit deal but do not trust the pictures,72,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,in all fairness i have only used the car charger part of this trio i already have a home charger and usb mini cord so they are tucked away as backthe car charger has worked beautifully and i have yet to encounter any problems with it it is not pretty but it works super cheap so i was a little hesitant to purchase glad i did although overall very happy with it,72,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i received the product and my wall adapter did not charge my phone and i emailed the company and they emailed me back the same day saying that they would ship me a new one and they and it works so over all i was pleased with the product and customer service,51,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this bundle was not only a deal for the price but works great thank you,15,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,2.0,negative,the cord i recieved was less than a foot long but the picture shows it as much longer this is a big problem as i am unable to use the phone as it is plugged in at home or in the car without using speaker in which i do not prefer i tried to email them 3 times providing the info requested with no response,65,14
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,2.0,negative,an enjoyable beginning but i got lost trying to continue to the end this story could use some help when the bennetts house burned and both perent died my interest went down trying to make all the sisters stories in this one book was an over kill,47,0
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,4.0,positive,darcy does not write a letter of explanation to lizzie and just leaves he changes his mind about marrying for love and decides to marry just for an heir georgiana does not accept this and she and col fitzwilliam meet up with lizzie in london to set things right a fire at longbourn brings about multiple changes in the sisters lives another very enjoyable p p storyline and worth reading however overlook the spelling and grammatical errors or even omitted words as this can be expected when a computer is used for editing,91,1
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,4.0,positive,my only complaint is that i wanted more i thought the story could have been longer with much more detail / explanation i loved the different track with col fitzwilliam again i just wish there had been more i can not really explain it better than that i do have one disclaimer / warning if you have a difficult time overlooking editing / proof reading mistakes then do not read this one i have seen too many reviews that were bad based solely on the editing which completely dismisses what was a wonderful story,86,2
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,2.0,negative,slow stiff read it was okay but this seems to be a completely different lizzy,15,3
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,5.0,positive,another great book by don miller this is my third and i enjoyed it very much it had tragedy as well as a happy ending,25,4
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,3.0,neutral,i did enjoy this book but did feel that it was missing something what that something is i can not tell you I shall be honest i could not write a book to save my life so admire all those that can and do i just felt that maybe it was emotion that was missing just not sure the start had me very intrigued and then in the middle things started to pan out but by the end i felt it was rushed darcy and elizabeth did act out of what we would think to be their normal character although i think that might be what was grabbing me it was unlike what i had already read i really think you need to try this book for yourself as i said i did enjoy it and read it in only a few days,140,5
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,4.0,positive,i did enjoy this book even if it was a bit sappy it was just all to perfect for everyone i know this is fiction but this went a bit to far nothing was ever settled about the fire that was a loose end my biggest complaint is do not you have spell check i found more typos in this book than any other book l have read after all my complaining i did enjoy it,76,6
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,1.0,negative,this gets one star for so many reasons it is at once stilted emotionless too many plot lines none of which carry throughout the novel unedited should instead of shoulder mrs bingley and his aunt conversations that are painful and without any naturalness full of the retelling of events that the person being spoken to was party too this book is the prime example that spell checking software does not substitute for a good proofreading and the story could do nothing but improve for want of an editor,87,7
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,2.0,negative,this was a creative attempt at a variation of p p but i was not impressed mr darcy was only kinda like mr darcy in moments and lizzie was not at all lizzie it was often contradictory even in the same paragraph and many of the social requirements of that day were disregarded there were some pretty bad typos and missing words i can forgive a lot of things but this book fell for short for me i appreciate the attempt and the imagination but i felt this was p p in name only completely lacking the essence humor and difficulties of the actual characters and story line 2 stars for the creative attempt only,114,8
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,3.0,neutral,3 1/2 stars would have given it 4 stars if edited properly most editing errors seemed to be careless mistakes that a good proof reading would have caught that being said i did enjoy the story i always like it when lizzie is portrayed as a strong intelligent woman she really shines in this one propriety was loosely followed at best this does not overly bother me if it is an entertaining read that holds my attention i like the way this author takes secondary characters from his previous books and writes them into a completely different plot i did not find it quite believable that all of the sisters turned out so well and also married well but it is fiction after all and i like happy endings the ending here was all tied up prettily with a great big bow,140,9
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,4.0,positive,i liked the way she included the sisters especially mary in her retelling of the story,16,10
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,1.0,negative,poorly written book with extremely random story line and character additions that serve no point I have read worse but still not recommended,22,11
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,5.0,positive,loved this variation truly enjoyed this lizzy and will enjoyed their rocky road to discovery of their love loved the debt of the characters enjoyed the abundance of romance appreciated the torment and how the characters dealt with them i was satisfied by the end of f the book,49,12
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,5.0,positive,i loved this telling very different they characters are true i would have like to have seen more of richard mary and anne i think those three made very interesting back story in this novel and would have made a great book by themselves i love the fact that their is very little if the bingly sisters and lady catherine highly recommended,63,13
Kindle_Store,B00M179WOU,4.0,positive,this was a favorite of mine all the bennet sisters had happy ending wickham got what he deserved at the end,21,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,I am really loving my way i wallie iphone case because it is very practical it holds what i need to go to work it is not bulky and it is just easy to carry around in my pocket and the best thing about it i do not have to open it to answer the phone or make a call or text everyone that sees me with my phone want to know where i bought it so i let them know the name of the wallet and amazoncom,84,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,2.0,negative,design is not ideal phone slips to the side and then you can not type,14,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,I am using the iwallie and generally like it a lot i love that you do not have to open the case to use the phone it holds several credit cards one minor negative is that the case is thick around the opening of the phone so it is difficult to hit the keys near the edges of the opening i have small hands so imagine it would be even more difficult for most people i like that it has a snap rather than a magnetic closure also it would have been nicer if it had come with a wrist strap last thing it took a long time to ship to me i ended up receiving it several days after the estimated arrival date but it eventually showed up overall happy with purchase,129,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,when i received thisit looked fantastic fit my phone like a glove and the little hiding pouches and card slots awesome unfortunately when using the phone inside this case it has a tendency to push buttons with your cheek most notably speaker phone but random other buttons are affected as well great concept beautiful styling and wonderfuljust not quite ideal,64,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,3.0,neutral,i just received the product it fits well into the case and nice outward facing so i do not need to open to use the phone the only downside is i can not tap the right side keys with my right thumb due to thehave to use index finger of opposite hand i hope the case will loosen up enough to allow this but not too much where the phone will slip around I have had 3 speck covers in the last year all to crack with the credit card slot maybe I am squeezing too much in there although still not buying those again and hope this new case will workout once it is broken in,114,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,5.0,positive,this is the best case I have ever had for my mobile all in one and more compact than anything I have ever owned,22,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,theis great however the case is off centered difficult to type on the right side i need to take it out of the case to use iphone,29,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,i really like this cover and I have tried many my only comment is the phone holder portion of the case should be a bit tighter to keep the phone from moving around you have to readjust in order to get to the symbols on the right,46,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,3.0,neutral,the black cars fastner was broken strip was not able to lock,12,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,5.0,positive,for the money quite a good case phone stays in the correct place and it holds 5 cards or so nice thing is you can over fill it with cash or whatever and it will still close,37,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,3.0,neutral,purchased this for my sons birthday he likes it but it is a little two bulky to put in his front pocket also if your are going to be bulky make sure you have more protection as in padding for the phone,41,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,5.0,positive,i love this case i like that i can use it without taking it out of the case it works well,21,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,3.0,neutral,overall i like this case only problem is that the phone moves a bit while inside the case and i end up having to open frequently and adjust positioning the phone so i can type while texting,37,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,4.0,positive,my only problem is that it is already showing some wear and i have not had it very long the edges are already starting to scuff up and peel a bit other than that it is the perfect iphone case,37,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CKW2V3A,1.0,negative,you can not access buttons with this case it is made so poorly that the phone slides out and you can not even type the letters closest to the edges of the phone i rarely write review but this one surely warranted a warning to others,44,14
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,american lara croft wannabe very predictable not much action for this type of novel the fbi does not work outside the united states like this felix leiter was cia remember,28,0
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,5.0,positive,i thought it was exciting you wanted to keep reading it to see what happens next and how they are going to get out of the next situation i was a fast paced book there was no slow parts i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book,45,1
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,this was a great fast paced adventure story with just a bit of romance in it i just wished the story was a bit longer loved the main character chyna stone she is an intelligent and knows how to take care of herself and the others in her team i can not wait to read what is in store for her on her next adventure called the mummy codex,70,2
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,5.0,positive,i enjoyed this book very much and am looking forward to the next book it was very interesting historically and finding such a thing as the minoan mask,28,3
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,chyna stone seems to be too easy going and not worried about anything as she works her first adventure the helpers she has are not too worried either but they spend most of their short time in this book moving from hotel to hotel the book is very short and there is little character development too bad but the plot was interesting except kttomb claims to be an archeologist but make several errors in the book,76,4
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the book and how it got right into the meat of the the plot can not wait to read another,21,5

Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,interesting ancient greek and minoan history more romance than i normally find in the kind of books i read the lost history team in a scramble to find an elusive mask,31,8
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,4.0,positive,i love thrilling stories that involve archaeology so i will look for more from this author love the books by lynn sholes and joe moore as they carry off this sort of story very well hope to see more of kt tomb loving the last name,46,9
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,1.0,negative,did not finish reading it just did not hold my interest and the writing in my opinion was juvenile,17,10

Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,the book title interested me because so little is known of the minoans that i hoped the author could imagine some cultural detail but no this story is a simple heist which is solved by an invincible super-hero,38,12
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,3.0,neutral,this was not a bad story reads well but seems a bit short great story baseline a fun adventure set in the eastern med and turkey my issue is the ending was very anti-climatic and abrupt it sort of feels like something has missing I am curious to see if the author gets better in the series not sure if i want to buy them although,63,13
Kindle_Store,B00JW1R79U,4.0,positive,short and fast paced adventure with a satisfacting end nice take on the king minos mythology and a hint of the next adventure as well,25,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,2.0,negative,it seems strange that samsung would try so hard to make such a nice phone that includes great features picture caller identification dual lcd screens intuitive menuand then forget the most important part the phone the reception is great at least that is what the phone indicates but the sound quality is horrible i find myself saying what every 10 - 15 seconds i saw mixed reviews about the e316 so I am not sure if the poor sound quality is a standard feature or if i just got a bad apple I am definitely returning this one but not sure what to replace it with,103,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,2.0,negative,i scoured the internet and did my homework researching this phone and found only one person complaining about reception and poor sound quality other then the review above mine here maybe no one has bothered to review this phone and post their comments well i am number three now i was very disappointed this phone sounded the way it did and had such horrible reception i own a v400 as well on the cingular network and i know what and where i should have good reception and the e317 is not even in the same ball park it is horrible i am returning it and going to give it a second try if something changes i will either retract my statements here or qualify them with more bad news with the replacement e317 stay tuned,135,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,2.0,negative,okay so i started reading reviews after i purchased this phone seeing all of the horrible sound quality comments i was pretty nervous and i had a reason to be the sound quality on this phone is awful i do not think it has anything to do with cingular or reception as I have never had problems with cingular before i just can not hear anything on this phone and what i do hear is muffled and distorted my friends are tired of me saying what did you say over and over again and they can not even hear me half the time also I have had several instances of the phone freezing up on me I shall have to remove the battery to get it to start working again it is a great looking little phone and the camera is pretty cool and fun to mess around with but in the end it is a phone when you can not use a phone for it is main purpose you have some problems samsung should have put a little more time and effort into the speaker instead of into all the little options that do not really matter much,190,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,5.0,positive,this phone is better than the other camera phones out there because it is easy to use while being very capable the features it provides are useful the design is very modern and not too complicated as well i would recommend it to anyone out there,45,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,5.0,positive,i like this phone it is small and light with a nice look andthe volume could be a bit higher I am not noticing all the problems others complain about while i do agree the volume in the speaker should go a big higher the motorola v551 is too heavy of a phone to expect to want to keep for a year or more,64,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,3.0,neutral,i wish i could keep this phone but the sound quality is so bad that i have to return it it has some great features it is very small great display the numbers are very big when you type them in on the screen but the sound quality is awful i really have to press the phone up to my ear to hear and even then the other person sounds like they are in a tunnel at first i thought that my earpiece had blown out or something the way that your car speakers can blow out but now i think the volume is just lower on this phone than with others otherwise although it is a nice phone,117,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,1.0,negative,volume / speaker is indequate phone is not as teeny as predecessor 307 many different ringtones equates to exactly 11 pathetic,19,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,3.0,neutral,overall no major problems with the phone some difficulties with sound quality but i do not know if it is phone against cinguular one major glitch is inability to switch into hide number in caller identification when you do that the phone stops dialing out after an hour or so i thought it was a problem with a particular hand set got a new one and same thing happens will have to exchange it since i like to keep my number private,80,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,4.0,positive,i downgraded my initial review to two stars due to the terrible sound quality on the phone i exchanged it for an lg l1400 and all my problems with sound went away the good really small and light nice displays camera and photo caller identification feature the bad terrible sound quality the speaker is loud but it is buzzy and distorted poor reception i find i miss calls frequently because the phone does not ring the phone makes a snapshot sound when it takes a picture i understand that this is required in some countries but it would have been nice to be able to turn it off t9 is not the default for text input why and i do not think i can change that,134,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,5.0,positive,I have had this phone for about a day and so far the sound quality is just awesome it was so great i could just put the phone on my desk and i could hear it jsut fine so i do not know if i happened to get a good phone out of the bad ones that people are tlaking about or if samsung has improved it or not in the past weeks months i do not know how long this phone has been in the market but the hands free microphone is annoying it does not come standard with the phone and it is not a standard hands free plug so you are forced to buy their mic the package did not come with a holster thing either and the instruction manual takes up about the whole the box but whatever overall the phone is awesome i love it so far ],148,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,1.0,negative,my review is on cingular i bought a phone w / service and was told i could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used they lie the phone did not work in my area and i cancelled the next day they are charging me for activation even although it never worked in my area if you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service do not buy from cingular amazon will also do nothing to reimburse,79,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,4.0,positive,I had have to say that I am in love with this phone i recently received it last week and can not stop playing around with it for starters the external display on front of the folder is great you can choose whatyou want it to be and it has a neat little service light on it as well once you open the folder the screen size is pretty good the buttons and layout are nothing differen than you average clamshell phone but that is ok the softkeys are nice as for the features the phone is incredible there has too many things you can do to write down so i will not go into detail however let me just say that once you connect to cingulars media net you will be hooked lastly as far as everyone talking about the poor sound quality just buy the additional earpiece probably best to get it in the 3 piece travel package and you should be hearing fine again,162,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,4.0,positive,the speaker is fine i do not agree with all the whining about the speaker it may not be the best speaker out there but it works just fine sleek and stylish lots of nice features great user interface very intuitive super lightweight and has a really nice front display all in all a nice phone,55,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,3.0,neutral,the sound quality is horrible i purchased my brand new samsung e317 on ebay i first assumed that the seller had jipped me reading these reviews now i know differently if i had it to do over again i would have purchased a different phone,45,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VQDVM,3.0,neutral,had the phone on cingular serves for five days now bought the 317 for my self and the samsung 427 m for my daughter took mine back to day because the sound quality is so bad had to ask the other person to repeat them selves most of the time my daughters 427 m sounded great good sound quailty so i traded my 317 for the 427 m the only thing i miss is the front display,74,14
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,2.0,negative,the poor grammar was too distracting i found myself editing as i read and was unable to get caught up in the story i am so frustrated by the number of 3 4 and 5 star reviews there has to be a way to weed out the paid reviews as well as reviews by friends and family,57,0
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,4.0,positive,for a new author this was a very good read it had a good story line plot and climax the attention to detail made you feel like you were a part of the story the ending leaves you wanting to know what the future holds for megan and aiden all on all i enjoyed the fact that murder for neptunes trident did not revolve around sex a nice clean book for all ages can not wait for the sequel,77,1
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,1.0,negative,i typically love free books and i understand there being some typographic and grammatical errors however this book was so full of errors i was not able to enjoy the plot what little character development existed was overshadowed by the authors repeated attempts to create a detailed environment however she spent so much time pointing out which character was riding in which vehicle and stumbled over the details of each scene so many times the redundancy made me want to tear my hair out i barely made it a third of the way through this book the plot was dragging out so slowly without any obvious development that i gave up not worth the read,114,2
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,5.0,positive,megan is quite happy with her life until the day she sees someone shot sand thrown overboard it would have been safe but a cellphone rings what happens next really opens this story thanks for the good reading,38,3
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,4.0,positive,loved the book but way foo many editing errors good plotting fun characters and a touch of romance you will enjoy this book,22,4
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,5.0,positive,i happened to discover this book while searching for a new cozy mystery to read i figured at 99 cents i had nothing to lose i was pleasantly surprised i really enjoyed this book yes i will admit there were some editing errors lucy was called lori once and a few words left out but it truly did not take away from the content of the book i enjoyed the characters the setting and the story i read approximately a book a night so needless to say i read lots and lots of books i only write reviews on those i truly enjoy i would definitely recommend this new series to all i can not wait for book 2 in this citrus beach mysteries series,124,5
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,1.0,negative,ok i do not usually write a review if i think a book is bad but i bought this book and then did not even finish 1/2 of it i feel like the author used a lot of descriptions to explain every thing as a sort of filler so the book would be longer plus she used exclamations points on so many sentences that it drove me crazy i read a ton and can usually read books that are even mediocre until the end but i literally could not make myself continue to read this book very boring,96,6
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed the plot and the characters very much i think there should have been more editing and proofreading I am usually not one to nitpick and when i run across an occasional typo i do not think much of it however this novel had several instances where women should have been woman and where should have been were i even saw a couple of dangling prepositions there were times that i had to reread a sentence or paragraph to decipher what the author was trying to say i found it very distracting and was looking for the next mistake or misspelling instead of enjoying the delightful story line,107,7
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,2.0,negative,let me start off with that fact that i did not finish i read about 2/3 of the book i imagined that this would be a cozy mystery but really was like a warm blanket and a cup of chamomile tea in a bad way as soon as i started to read it i would quickly put it down to sleep or do anything else for starters the pace was off and the characters seemed a bit like dishwater out of touch with reality with their dialogue and actions and having little to no spunk or pizazz editing aside just a very ho-hum boring read thanks,106,8
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,1.0,negative,disappointing and frustrating to read i try not to be a rampant member of the grammar police but the multitude of grammar punctuation tenses phrasing spelling and word usage errors were so glaring on every page i found myself distracted from the story i realize new authors need to hone their craft but that should not have to include learning about sentence structure and spelling the story started out with an interesting premise but the ending was a very weak resolution for the crime,83,9
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,5.0,positive,really enjoyed this book characters were great real creeps which is what they are supposed to be really great story love the dogs everything about this i really enjoyed i look forward to reading however many she writes,37,10

Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,5.0,positive,i live in a posh part of southern spain where this type of story would not be out of place at all so could really relate to it the book is well written overall and i enjoyed the story completely from beginning to end this is a light fictional read for a less than a price of a coffee and will keep you enthralled for hours so is really worth buying and reading especially if you want to relax and spend an afternoon or evening and be transported to megans world of suspense and danger,95,12
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,3.0,neutral,i have been reading other reviews and i hate to repeat what has already been said if there is a newly edited version i did not get it it was obviously spellchecked rather than edited residences for residents as an example torturous to anyone who has a reasonable command of the english language the story line is good enough that i might have read the next book but i have corrected enough english papers that i have no intention of correcting a book that was bought for pleasure reading,88,13
Kindle_Store,B00FCNKTPQ,4.0,positive,i have enjoyed reading several of the books in this series but they all have one flaw they need a good editor there are so many wrong word choices wrong tenses and for goodness sake there is a difference between plurals and possessives other than these distractions the story is interesting and flows well i love the locale the situations are believable and the characters have a nice dynamic if you can overlook the errors it is worth getting invested in the whole series,84,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,4.0,positive,i got this cover within the week of ordereing as they told me i would it is what they say it is andis true the cutouts are right and i have not problem using the charger with the cover on I am happy with it and for the price so worth it,53,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,4.0,positive,at the time this case was only 02 and 295 for shipping so i could not pass it up thewas exactly what i expected from the pictures and it was very true to what it advertised if you are looking for protection for your phone i would not recommend this case it is silicone so really only protects the phone from getting dirty and scratches overall a good product,71,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,2.0,negative,a little too big easily starts coming off at corner i have a samsung galaxy s3 1747 may fit other models,21,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,1.0,negative,it is a loose fit and does not stay on the phone comes off easily also the silicon is thick and a little gummy which makes it hard to slide into my back pocket,32,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,3.0,neutral,i received the correct case and it is a very nice case however it was not the correctwhen i contacted the seller he was very nice but informed me that thei received was the onlyhe had i was extremely disappointed,46,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,2.0,negative,i personally do not like this case it comes off all the time when i take my phone in and out of my purse or pocket it is a pain in the tuckus that being said it does what it says it does it protects your phone if you drop it often this case absorbs the shock the hassle is worth it if you want to protect your phone theis pretty,73,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,4.0,positive,was not the same as the pic but i like it anyways it is more like a magentawhich was ok with me fit ok but was not a tight fit not bad for the price,36,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,2.0,negative,silicone cases overall are all flimsy that is an obvious but wherever i take my phone out of my pocket or purse the case is sliding off the case stretches way to easily i would recommend getting a gel or rubber case instead it is better than nothing although,49,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,4.0,positive,i absolutly love thismore than anything i ordered 3 cases off of amazon because they are so cheap why not and out of the three this is my 2nd choice it does fit the phone well and i was really concerned that it would be too lose based on other reviews well it fits like any other soft case does it fits but it is easy to come off meaning if you want it on it will most likely stay on but if your playing with it or taking it out of your pocket a corner might slip of i did not find this too annoying thou only takes a second to fix if you get this case your still going to have to be careful with your phone if you are a bit clumsy like be i suggest ordering a hard 2-piece case in addition also if you are ordering cases of amazon does not hurt to order multiple because at these prices they not seem like they may have great quality hope this helps,171,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,5.0,positive,i was really pleased when i received this cover it is a beautifuli have not seen anyone with thisand i really like that,25,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,5.0,positive,love this case i was looking for this exact case for a while now since all i could find would the slippery silicone cases and i had a gel one like this on my iphone before i got the galaxy so I am happy i could find one and at a good price,52,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008HPAHDU,1.0,negative,i could not get this case to stay on my s3 i almost broke my phone a couple times because the phone slipped out of the case while i was using it,32,14

Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,2.0,negative,good storyline but i can not stand the way that every time an amish word is said it is italicized maybe the first time so the reader knows it is not just a typo but not every time the story line did not really pick up although until the very end of the book until the last 2 pages i could not wait for this book to be over now I am curious as to what will happen in the next book but not curious enough to read it with the irritating italicized amish words throughout,90,3

Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,5.0,positive,i do not usually like shorter books and would rather read one long novella or novel but i found this one interesting and hard to put down i think it is one of her best and if the remainder of this series is as good as this one you will not want to miss them i enjoy reading about the simple life style although i am not amish I am a christian author who enjoys reading a variety of different types of books this one has great description and you can visualize the scenes as well as the feelings of the characters,98,5

Kindle_Store,B00ARZIOE2,1.0,negative,unimpressive no depth to story it was entirely predictable where was the suspense the hook ks not worth time or money she needs to build better story line,25,0
Kindle_Store,B00ARZIOE2,1.0,negative,i do not write book reviews unless i feel a book is an exceptional read this one unfortunately is exceptionally bad of the hundreds of books i have read over the past few years this is the most poorly written one of them all i am rather surprised the publisher would actually print such an inferior story i read the entire book in about 30 minuted and I am not a fast reader the sequel come back blizzard bride is equally as bad,81,1
Kindle_Store,B00ARZIOE2,2.0,negative,this book is extremely short and while a clever story line hardly time to get interested before this mini novel ends,21,2

Kindle_Store,B00ARZIOE2,1.0,negative,this is a short story not a book i would say it is a rough draft of a story for a book it is a fast read with not much development of characters or story could have been a good a book,41,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008B92GJU,4.0,positive,when i got this cover the black part was broken but it fits my phone nicely another i do not like is the cover makes it hard to press the power and volume buttons over all it does what it is supposed to do so i would buy it again,49,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B008B92GJU,3.0,neutral,bought several cases to try and this works great when i am at work paired with a screen protector this works great,22,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,1.0,negative,i received these in the correct amount of time and i did receive 3 as stated unfortunately they are not anti glare as they have a high mirror finish which makes the iphone very hard to read in any light i assume they sent me the wrong ones and will see if they do anything to correct this problem,59,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,2.0,negative,these are inexpensive and have the anti-glare finish but i can never get them applied without bubbles maybe it is my own fault I am going to have someone at the store do one and see if they can do better,39,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,2.0,negative,i have used several similar products for my phones and cameras and this one is on the low side of average the paper labels were difficult remove without creasing / stretching the film they were too sticky and the backing came off the film itself is very easy to fit and i managed it without any bubbles and more but i was surprised how quickly and easily it became scratched just through normal use and I am not a particularly heavy phone user another gripe was with the supplier i ordered a pack of three but only one was sent this was rectified later but not without several emails and more,109,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,1.0,negative,the ad said three protectors only got one sent emails to complain never got response great way to do business,20,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,5.0,positive,the product came as described and promptly it does take a bit of skill and patience to apply the screen protector without bubbles and in the right position but that is up to the consumer to do the research to be able to apply it correctly it worked great on my iphone4 perfect,53,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,4.0,positive,totally worth the price i have not found one screen protector that does not leave any bubbles i applied the first one to my phone and it left a tiny bubble i can live with that rather have the protection than my screen get all scratched up so i would say it is worth buying,52,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,1.0,negative,these things are junk and a waste of money they will not go on without tons of bubbles and the tab that is on screen saver to help remove it from the backing will not come off without leaving it is glue mess behind impossible to get off your new screensaver a total rip i threw all away,56,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,5.0,positive,the screen protectors shield your phone from scatches i constantly toss my phone in my bag along with my keys and even although my screen protector is scratched up my screen is not also the seller is great i did not receive the correct amount and the issue was quickly resolved quickly,51,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,1.0,negative,it took longer than the expected delivery date and when it finally arrived it was not for the iphone 4 as stated also nowhere in the ad does it mention that it is mirrored definitely disappointed with it and not what i expected at all,45,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,4.0,positive,i went to best buy to find a screen protector for my iphone and all the ones there were priced at around 20 and up plus they only had the glossy finish but i found these online and have them a try and i love them plus they come with 3 of them it is a great buy and the quality is good,62,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,2.0,negative,these screen protectors are cheap and it shows i could not find a screen protector at the local apple store which cost around 15 so i decided to give these a try thinking i would only loose five bucks in my mind i forgot to take into account the shipping cost well i had to get the protective screen at the apple store anyway the problem with these screens is that they already had some dust particles i was not sure if i had messed up with the first included screen so i took a closer look at the second one i only got two instead as three as the other reviewer got and i can confirm that it had some dust my iphones surface was very clean since it had been inside it is original box until then with dust you get bubbles so both of these screens ended in the trash can now that the price of these screens has gone even cheaper some people may still decide to buy them but even if it is not a lot of money you will still lose around 8 and end up buying the more expensive ones my advise learn from my mistake and avoid these,202,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003UO175U,2.0,negative,thewill not allow the touch portion of the iphone to work i think the plastic may be to thick i ended up throwing it away,27,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,3.0,neutral,it fits great on the phone and comes of easy the case came with light scratches around the edges my biggest concern is that it is only been a week and the paint is starting to come off completly,38,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,4.0,positive,i love the bright vibrantorange and was somewhat disappointed when i opened the package to see the cover looked slightly red in low light as you twist and turn the cover you can see a nice orangewith red tones and it seems to be durable i read the reviews and heard thewas more of a burnt orange i guess i just really wanted it to match the photo more and be more of an obnoxious safety orange the four stars were more towards thei just received the case and it seems to be substantial i will update if anything changes,108,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,5.0,positive,i love the case it is a funorange with black hue pros it is rubberized but not overly rubberized so it is easy to grip the case fits the incredible 2 perfectly the case snaps together and stays together great value for the money cons none i have had the cover for two months and so far have not had any concerns would buy again,72,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,5.0,positive,i bought this exact case in 6 different colors i switch about once a week so they wear well they snap together easily fit snugly and stay on i like the texture a lot they are matt feel like suede and do not attract dust fur i have cats or fibers like the neoprene covers they look great the finish has not worn off or chipped like some others I have read about i love these covers and they price is perfect i got 6 for what others charge for one great deal,91,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,4.0,positive,i thought thewould be more of the burnt orange look rather than the bright orange i received but it will work,23,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,1.0,negative,this case would have been fine but it does not fit the phone and does not snap in place low quality,20,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,1.0,negative,said it fit the phone i had purchased but it definitely did not fit whatsoever too small for the phone,20,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,4.0,positive,when i first bought my phone incredible 2 because I am very clumsy i bought the ugly looking black case for over 25 which did not last no more than 3 months after i took off the ugly case i had to change my phone and this time i did not want to pay that much so i got this one compared to the price i love it although theis not consistent like theof the case is not well painted i guess but it is not that noticeablei got the orange one and i like it it does not look that bright very similar to the picture here i regret so much that i had to pay 25 for the almost same case and plus the screen protector for 5times more expensive than ones online,137,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,1.0,negative,was not impressed started peeling and made accessing the phone difficult do not waste your money also more of a copper than orange,22,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,5.0,positive,very sharp looking the case is a metallic coppery looking burnt orange once on it is sometimes difficult to remove i put my left thumbnail into the little slot by the connector opening and then use my right thumbnail to pull it apart at the volume control and then work it through the crack toward the headphone jack first shipment was not received but seller immediately corrected it,67,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,2.0,negative,the case did come rather quickly by mail but 1 it really is a neon orange not the burnt warm-looking orange in the picture and 2 the case does not cover all four sides of the phone only the back and two long sides the top next to the power button and bottom of the phone are completely exposed only a few dollars so it will do for now but I shall be getting another case,73,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,2.0,negative,i have had it a couple weeks it is paint already peeling and coming off does not snap on competely i would not recommend this product,24,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,3.0,neutral,this cover does not seem rubberized and has scratched very easily the paint comes off in different spots and looked well worn after about a week i would spend the extra money to buy a product that is more quality,40,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053O8L6I,2.0,negative,i bought this case for my brothers phone and he used it for about 3 months before the case snapped it is pretty heavy duty in terms of what abuse it can take for a little while eventually like most accessories it just ends up breaking especially since you get what you pay for my brother does online school so he hardly ever leaves the house and he does not use his phone at all much so it usually just ends up sitting in his room for days or weeks on end that being said this case was supposed to be a protective barrier in case he dropped it in the kitchen or on the concrete floor what a joke he was holding the phone tightly one day and the case snapped at the corner so it does not even fit his phone anymore what a piece of junk i mean i did not pay very much for it but it attracted nasty fingerprints and broke within a couple of months of mild use it is a little bit ridiculous that this case has already been broken it can easily be said that i will not be wasting my time with these cheap cases anymore,199,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00D1PGELA,1.0,negative,the telephoto lens was utter crap dark vignetted blurry despite attaching it with great care as to alignment it went straight back,22,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00D1PGELA,4.0,positive,the telephoto lens is a little hard to keep steady in place on my iphone 5s but it has an amazing zoom works best if you put it on a tripod otherwise the smallest movement makes the picture out of focus the macro fisheye and wide angle lenses work good but you have to be careful not to bump the lens because it does not hold in place very well the macro lens just like the telephoto lens works best on a tripod you have to have a very steady hand or it will be out of focus the extreme close-up pictures are amazingly clear and detailed nice lenses for the price,111,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00D1PGELA,3.0,neutral,the zoom portion is pretty useless-sorry it really does not fit properly the fish eye is good and the wide angle lens is okay,24,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00D1PGELA,2.0,negative,i was expecting better it probably has to do with the fact that i am not removing the case that protects my phone but i am not willing to remove it i want to keep the phone in mint condition i have sold my last phones for a very good price just for having kept them in mint condition,59,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00D1PGELA,3.0,neutral,buy a tripod if you plan on using the telephoto more than once good for experimenting with iphone lenses or if you do not care about damage to the lenses,29,14
Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,this book published on february 29 2012 that is before mr arpaio released the results of his investigation does nothing more than provide yet another piece of evidence that the investigation was a sham of course it makes sense that the book could be published before the investigation results were released to the public since the results are nothing more than a rehash of wnds unsubstantiated claims made back in april 2011 and soundly repudiated by august 2011 before arpaio even started his wild west show what a joke what a sham what a shame,98,0
Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,i only have the sample download and knowing the credentials of the author jerome corsi of this book i was dumbfounded to read i was approached on this issue because i dislike of the standard on page 2 of the introduction followed on the next page page 3 with i instructed them to go at this investigation with no preconceivedthat and i personally i quit if i am to pay 10 for a book i want to buy one without obvious errors in the first 3 pages not worth the money having seen the hour plus news conference and read the report released thereafter both freebies I am sure this effort may be worth reading however not on my dime,125,1
Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,it seems the birthers are still trying to convince the world of the presidents ineligibility after reading it i am more sure that the whole movement is in serious need of facts it seems that they do not understand the constitution or any of the rulings that touched on citizenship i recommend that this book never gets purchased again and all remaining copies get sent to the fiction section of the library,72,2
Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,you will all notice that the obots realize they have totally lost their position when you read their reviews of this blockbuster e-book their reviews are all about personally insulting the readers and the authors of this book the obots have nothing to offer but gutter name-calling insults and the typical saul alinsky tactics of ridicule and slander to lay upon decent patriotic americans who only want the truth revealed about barack obama this book by dr corsi and posse member michael zullo reveals thebyprocess of honestly investigating and forensically evaluating the various documents that mr obama swears are true and accurate documents the authors of this book reveal that these documents are forgeries and frauds this book is not about race religion or national origin it is about finding the truth and facts honestly there is no name-calling or racial attacks in this book,148,3

Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,sheriff joe arpaio was asked to investigate a possible problem with the long form birth certificate of president obama he assembled a team to investigate he used no tax payer money and this is a report of what they found he has no political agenda and only facts have been presented no accusations no threats of arrest no theatrics there will be those that want to sensationalize this because they do not like the information it contains,77,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,very good clarity so much so that you have to turn the volume down with other ear pieces at maximum still could not hear convenient car charger stays in the ear perfectly 3 sizes to choose from to fit everyone,44,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,4.0,positive,this headset delivers everything as advertised by plantronics i purchased this model because it is compatible with the iphone i really love that it is so lightweight definitely the lightest of all headsets I have seen the one feature that i find most outstanding is that the headset stores in a clip-on tube that you can keep in your shirt pocket for easy access also this storage tube helps to protect the headset when it is in your pocketmy only critique is that the ear bud gets dirty very quickly and needs to be washed often it is made out of a plastic material that is very soft to help hold the headset in your ear but that type of material picks up dirt and dust i liked this headset so much that i also bought one from a friends birthday he has a motorola razr and this headset also works great with that cellphone,157,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,very good sound quality but people can not seem to hear too well when the car window is down does not drop it is signal as much as the older model actually I have had this for 2 months now and i can only remember losing signal only 2 times all in all it is a very good value and worth it is price,58,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,3.0,neutral,my complaint is mostly with the charger the bluetooth itself fit comfortably in my ear with some adjusting no problem with sound quality on either end the only issue i have is the unique charger it is a nice carrier to put in your pocket to protect your bluetooth but if you lose it or it breaks you are hosed you can not charge without it the other chargers listed with the product are attachments to the housing unit i preferred my older plantronics explorer 220 because i was able to switch between my phone and the headset for my car one less cord it says there is an accessory for the mini usb charger but I have yet to find it here or the plantronic website hope this helps if you do not want another cord to worry about check the products website to see what connection it uses,146,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,1.0,negative,i have had this plantronics discovery 665 bluetooth headset for two days and everyone i call tells me i sound very muffled i can hear them fine but they can not understand me they can hear me but can not understand what i am saying most of the time i am returning this,52,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,4.0,positive,I have tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I have had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise the plantronics 665 is great in fact i actually had to turn down the volume a bit i also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old motorolla had a slight delay i would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line overall a very clean design other than the road noise people on the other end did not know i was using a wireless headset nice small design fit my ear well the dc charging stationfor the car is great charges as well from your pc usb I am using this with my palm treo 755p,139,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,2.0,negative,the product arrived within days of the order and it was sleek in it is appearance yet that is where the excitement ended call volume was low and the amount of static was unbearable i really expected more from plantronics too say the least this product was returned due to poor sound quality,51,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,this headset is the best I have ever had people actually hear me and i hear them better when I am using the headset than when I am on the handset what more can i say it is great even the people that use to complain and tell me to stop using my bt have stopped nagging me very pleased with this one finally a good bt headset,64,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,2.0,negative,this case is poorly constructed and has problems staying closed you get what you pay for,16,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,2.0,negative,it is not what it showed on the picture and the front is way different also the front of the case want cleip together,23,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,2.0,negative,do not believe the reviews that state this case fits perfectly over a skinit i had to use a piece of tape which makes the cheap case look cheaper,28,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,1.0,negative,well i have to say I am disappointed because this little cover does not stay closed it just pops right open again no matter how hard i try to shut it around my iphone 3gs yes it is cheap but i ended up spending about 5 on something i need to throw in the trash i had to pay postage since i live in hawaii i bought it to go over a gelaskin on my 3gs maybe if the skin was not on my phone it is only less than a 1 mm thick this thing would work it seems quite fragile anyway i liked theof a clear phone cover but this one is not the one for me,117,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,5.0,positive,i bought this as a gift for my son who has some stickers from his football helmet on the back of his phone this was the perfect way for him to continue to display them and his phone to be protected at the same time only bad thing is he has to take the case off to charge it on his ihome player,63,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,1.0,negative,this case does not fit over my iphone i can get the back on it no problem but i can not snap the front part of the case on waste of money,31,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,1.0,negative,i bought this protector thinking that it would at least work it does not even work it does not hold on to the iphone at all it keeps falling off all the time and dirt gets to the phone easily,38,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,3.0,neutral,this cover did not last me long i bought two nd they both broke the actual case dosnt brake but the clips that holds it together are fragible and after they break they are loose and dangling,38,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,2.0,negative,it is very light plastic and very slippery I am not going to use it i put it on and it nearly slipped out of my hand it is just not protection except from scratches I had think it is ok for the price i need something with a little grip i think,48,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,4.0,positive,I am notorious for dropping my phone so purchasing a durable clear cover was essential when i got my iphone the cover was easy to use and snap on but always snapped off when the phone was dropped in fact it dropped one day and the plastic cover fell off and i could not find one of the two plastic pieces for the most part it was great just do not drop your phone,72,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002EOTJFM,5.0,positive,my orignal case broken in 1 day they rushed me out a replacement free of charge that is what i call customer service thanks again,25,14
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,4.0,positive,written during a different era when a persons reputation was extremely important this female narrative story authentically captures the mores of that generation with a snapshot in time and an engaging plot your reputation is like your virginity once you lose it that is it or as one quote worthy person stated i am grateful i can lose my reputation but once these are the themes that are embroidered in an account of a woman when such things could irrevocably change the course of your life this is enjoyably reading,89,0
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,4.0,positive,very good efforts well done keep it up,8,1
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed the dialogue in this book very much when the characters were interacting i found it very engaging some of the inner thought and background sections seemed to stretch on a bit for me however overall i thoroughly enjoyed the novel good attempt at a first novel,48,2
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,5.0,positive,fascinating and powerful account of a story set in the english country side and a womans story and struggle to take care of younger children this is a story of courage faith and reality with a powerful message of redemption,40,3
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,2.0,negative,there was an interesting story in there somewhere however the writing was a burden to get through and there were one too many anachronisms for my tastes I had read this author again because she can paint a pretty picture with a stroke of her words but she needs a skilled editor who would be willing to tell her when to reign it in a bit,64,4
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,4.0,positive,this is not an easy review to write why well it is all down to taste if you like classic victoriana with a good story then this is for you if you want your read to be full of depth and soul searching then dive in but if your preference is for fast moving action then there are passages in this book that will drive you to exasperation as i said it is a matter of choice as to what you like to read so we have a woman wronged who seeks to get her life back together she has the whole world against her for perceived disgraces relating to her broken marriage but is given the chance to build her life once more and to fight for what is right the writing is excellent indeed it could have been written within the time period it is set in the use of colloquialisms is knowledgeable and precise in it is accuracy not downton abbey so much as upstairs downstairs as i said if you like to immerse yourself in classical victoriana then this is a near perfect read,185,5
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,3.0,neutral,i like stories that feature female characters who have won through hard times and extreme adversity and that certainly describes thecharacter jane she has suffered great losses but takes her fate into her own hands and marches on without giving up that said i would prefer less exposition and more dramatization of janes life the plot moves along quite slowly especially in the early parts of the book when much of janes backstory is revealed the italicized voices in her head left me confused where they the voices of others or something her own mind made up there are still a large number of editorial issues in the text enough that i could not give the book a higher star rating i applaud the writer for completing the work so far but more polishing needs to done that is best accomplished in a beta reader program or critique group rather than a publication setting and what has here on the page is definitely worth the effort of polishing i received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review,180,6
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,2.0,negative,set in 19th century britain the governesss setting characters especially that of protagonist jane adams and the circumstances surrounding them are reminiscent of literary classic jane eyre noorilhudas jane upon receiving appointment as a governess has the challenge of overcoming her meager station in life as well as a past that may affect her future social standing she is also plagued by the voice in her own head which often berates her and reminds her of her past troubled relationship with her father employed by lady cavendish jane sets out to accomplish this task along the way thrown in the midst of mystery more family troubles and romance this story will likely appeal to fans of other historical fiction novels particularly those that enjoy a romantic end,127,7
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,1.0,negative,i was also spammed but i thought that i would give a read i did not like this story I am pretty sure that in 1837 yogurt was not common enough to use as a poultice especially on a childs head i had issues with the maid calling the children kids and the main male character letting his married to a different peer of the realm mistress into his breakfast room in her bathrobe,73,8
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,5.0,positive,enjoyable reading experience a page turner transports you instantly to other worlds strong characterization and good writing,17,9
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,3.0,neutral,i am generally a fan of historical fiction but i had a difficult time getting into this book much of the novel consists of internal thoughts and monologues these long streams of consciousness make it difficult to distinguish when you are in the present and when you are experiencing a flashback the story in very slow not uncommon for this genre however i found much of the beginning uninteresting and had to stop myself from skimming pages i wanted to give up several times but i pushed on through and am very glad i did once i got past the 35 mark the story began to pick up and the characters drew me in the long monologues were still distracting but my emotional attachment to the characters made these more bearable all in all it was an interesting story with characters you will come to love although slow to start do not give up on this novel i was given this book in exchange for an honest review,166,10
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,4.0,positive,obviously the author of the governess likes literary style of jane austen i personally did not mind in fact the very plot of the story is well designed and the characters are very well fit into the period of victorian england the main character jane must find a job to survive because they all rejected after her husband drove out of the house she goes out of his seat and submits a request to be a governess in the cavendish family at the other end of england lady cavendish accepts it because she liked it is simple and honest approach although it is recommendations less than the other candidates but soon rumors prejudices and lies about jane come to chateaux i personally liked the book but my only objection is that sometimes the characters too much thinking in addition the writer has managed to conjure up every detail of that time descriptions are excellent and all in all the book is very good copy provided courtesy of the author in exchange for an honest review,173,11
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,2.0,negative,i found this story absolutely suffocating just trying to get past all the psychological minutia was exhausting after all of the history on almost every character in the book and dragging through all tiring need from the author to take us on the couch it ended up just like we thought it would as the governess got the rich guy i would only suggest this story to those who enjoy delving into all things psychological,75,12
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,1.0,negative,i too am here because the author spammed some of my reviews i think it is a deplorable marketing strategy and only serves to fill the amazon review system with garbage i use the amazon review system frequently because i think it is a very helpful service when considering purchases and i think this type of behavior needs to be discouraged i hate to 1 star something that i have not purchased but hopefully it will make the author rethink their marketing strategy,80,13
Kindle_Store,B00MF8BJQE,4.0,positive,i received a copy of this in exchange for an honest review this was a well-written story about a young woman named jane jane has a scandalous past so it appears and because of that is finding it difficult to find friends or employment eventually she is able to find a job as a governess for the children of a wealthy man it reminded me very much of jane eyre and has many plot points that are extremely similar aside from jane there are many other characters introduced into the story whose situations are described in greater detail than i felt was needed but overall it was a good tale it did have mention of sex and sexual situations in it but nothing extreme,124,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,i have really enjoyed this headset i was very reluctant to buy a headset at all because all of the ones i saw were very bulky when i saw this one advertised i could not pass it up the price was just too good i have not regretted my decision one bit great buy,53,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,2.0,negative,i first received a faulty piece thanks to amazon i got it replaced free of cost pros light weight you can wear it for long time very smart looking cons poor battery life sometimes it gets very dificult to connect disconnects by itself not good to use near a microwave oven as soon as i connect a call the voice goes to minimum automatically then i have to first increase the voulume from this bluetooth and then from my mobile handset conclusion i bought it because i was getting it for a deal however i may go for another one if the problem persists,112,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,good design especially the earpiece but sometimes the audio quality is terrible i use it just when i drive and it is good enough for me,26,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,i only use occasionally if expecting heavy cell phone use pairs up with my nolia phone quickly and effortlessly audio quality in both directions seems fine a good price performer,30,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,5.0,positive,good lightweight headset it is smaller than the anycom headset my old favorite so it is been getting more use from me I have used it with my old razr and my new krzr i like that it fits in my ear canal versus resting on it no complaints with the call quality or loudness definetly worth the 20 bux they are charging for it now,63,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,this bluetooth was ok for the price initially it worked great good reception clarity and battery life but after using it for a couple of weeks everything started deteriorating one of my gripes is that it does not fit in the ear very well i found myself having to constantly push it back onto my ear every few minutes you definitely get what you pay for but as an introduction into the bluetooth headsets it is great,74,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,nice very clear sound and light weight takes some time to figure out the buttons and functions,17,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,this is a good product for the price sometimes the person on the other end has a hard time hearing all in all i am satisfied with my purchase,29,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,3.0,neutral,nothing special works and is about what i expected for the money can not beat the sale price,17,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,5.0,positive,bought two of these for the low price charged them for 8 hours before use read the quick start guide and they both synchronized quickly one to a motorola v3r and one to a v3 t reception and distance are both very good i do not keep it on continually and my battery has gone the last 6 days without a recharge the large button is easy to find and the small button is not difficult i have worn it in my right ear for 3 hours at a time twice and had only mild discomfort near the end of wear i have not used it with voice dialing so i can not comment on it i have yet to drop a call even with the phone 10 ft away volume is decent with the top down in my convertible in traffic at 40 mph great for entry level headset,145,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,2.0,negative,the look the feel and the weight was perfect but the sound quality was horrible i could not hear anyone no one could hear me and if they did there was nothing but high pitched static it was embarassing to speak to clients on it i returned it immediatley,48,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,2.0,negative,i only use this when I am driving so I am not fiddling with the shoulder-neck hold inexpensive at the time of purchase but the soft ear piece is easily lost it is really comfortable but the sound quality is poor i tend to switch back to the handset whenever i have an important call because the static and low volume really muffle the call not a bad buy but I had recommend a higher quality you get what you pay for certainly applies here,81,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,4.0,positive,this is my first bluetooth headset at 20 it is a bargain compared to what other resellers are charging for identicalearpiece feels very loose on my ear as if it is about to fall off any moment it also disconnects from my razr sometimes but i do not know if it is the headset or the phone in general the razrs bluetooth is not the best I have been using bluetooth phones for several years transfering contacts and photos from my phone to computer and never encountered any problems with the razr it always disconnects in middle of transfer all in all although headseat is not bad and I am pretty satisfied,106,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,1.0,negative,i hate this product the ear bud makes it awkward to use and it always feels like it is about to fall off my head if i would have known it had an ear bud i would not have bought it you can not see the ear bud from the angle that the picture is taken i would not recommend buying this product,62,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000BI4KKM,1.0,negative,the physical configuration of this headset is quite good and fits almost any ear comfortably i bought two of these headsets when i saw the deep discount now i know why the discount is so deep syncing this device was easy but after that it was all downhill the distortion was terrible unless i was holding my phone within 6 inches of the device i have a samsung a900 phone one of the newest bluetooth-compatible phones out there my wife as a brand new blackberry and she had the same results this is a cheap headset that is apparently also cheaply made i would not recommend it,108,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,1.0,negative,did not fit phone i ordered the one stated for at t but very disappointed it did not fit to much of a hassle to send back,24,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,3.0,neutral,the paint on the case was already wearing off when i took it out of the package the case itself is durable but the paint does not last too long,29,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,4.0,positive,product met my expectations and very good for the money value would recommend to others thought it was more blue than purple,22,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,3.0,neutral,it is really pretty fits tight but it is hard to take off the phone once it is on also the hole is not wide enough for my headphone adapter so i got tired of taking it off all the time and leave it off permanently now unless I am going somewhere,47,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,1.0,negative,i got it and tried it on my moms phone and it did not fit so it does not work sorry bye,20,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,1.0,negative,the case looked nothing like the online picture very disappointed the picture online looked better than the actual case in person,22,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,5.0,positive,this case fits my phone perfect it snaps together and covers the phone great it is snug and non slippy the design gets me many compliments,25,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,5.0,positive,fits perfect and really durable def will need to get more so i have a variety excellent and shipped faster than expected,22,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,3.0,neutral,i loved the case but had to return it my phone is a lgls860 so the case was to large i have mailed it back and would like to exchange it if possible,35,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,3.0,neutral,the design is nice but however the material is really cheap and breaks easy i still suggest thisto cover and protect the phone as it does the job,30,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AECQJ68,5.0,positive,i like this phone cover and the design that is on it it fits good and all my friends like it i like how derable it is,26,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,2.0,negative,I have had my droid for 8 months the first cover was hard plastic and cracked when i dropped it the phone store sold me this case in april 2010 telling me it was the best protector for my phone on that i would agree I have dropped it several times and the screen has not even changed however my case is now hanging off my phone in pieces long thin strips come off regularly there has not much left of the top or bottom it started peeling about two months ago so I had say this cover lasted intact for about four months I am currently shopping for a new case and will not purchase another body glove,114,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,when i recieved this product it was not new it was used top part of body glove did not fit properly it was missing the attachment for the belt loop package was opened not sealed,35,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,my husband got this for his phone and loves it it is hard to get off and on but he loves to be able to clip it on his pants,29,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,this is the only case that makes sense for this device i only rated it a 4 because the front casing can become detached or crack with some wear this is because the on / off switch is close to the top of it i do not think they could have done much more protects the phone I have dropped mine on concrete more than once and the case saved me,67,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,2.0,negative,this was a nice cover while it lasted the clips that hold the covers on the droid eventually become worn the face cover was the first to go started falling off after about two months three months after purchase the large back cover started falling off as the holding clips simply break off or become worn i will not buy another one as it is too costly and has to be taken off if you plan to use the,77,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,i thought the case was great the only thing was the thin top piece came loose and fell off while the case was attached to my belt i was unable to find this piece but i am still using the bottom piece with the clip thank you rich gibian,49,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,i purchased this case with my phone in the july yesterday i went to slide my phone open and the bottom of the cover fell off the clasps broke on one side i also noticed when i tried to get it back on that it made the plastic on my droid pop up out of place it seems very I shall fitted to this phone i do not recommend it,69,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,very pleased with this case i love the clip and the rubberized case i can sit it on my dash in the car to view the gps without it sliding around great buy for anyone looking for a droid case,40,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,i have owned the droid and this case for about 5 months now it has saved my phone several times i use the belt clip which works well make sure the tab is seated properly in the case before putting it over the droid my children are constantly climbing on my back and kicking it knocking it off and more but through several months of this the phone itself does not have a scratch on it i also use the clear screen protectors a must the case is a different story it looks like it is been through a war in fact it finally broke the other day the little tabs that go over the front part of the phone finally snapped off and that is why i am here ordering a new one actually i think I shall get two the drawbacks are that getting the case off and on is a chore and as others have noted the battery occasionally needs to be removed for a cold reboot the other drawback is the design of the little tabs could have been a bit better although i admit i am very hard on it overall a good product and one i would recommend,201,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,do not order thisit does not fit the droid properly as in the front piece comes off regularly and there is no way to securely attach it it was not worth the s and h to return it,39,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,i have had several body glove brand phone cases in the past all of my lg phone brand cases were great the droid case is cheaply made at the same body glove price i have had 2 of the droid cases and both have broken at the tabs that hold the front cover on my friend has had the same issue the case is very difficult to remove from the back but that is not really a big deal i was really hoping for more from this product that is why i paid the premium price it is on sale now but i would go to the many droid forums and look into the experiences of other to find a case that will work,123,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,do not buy this case leather cover is coming off of the plastic started falling apart after 2 months i expected more,21,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,easy to install and does a great job of protecting the droid body i bought a separate screen protector because one is not included with this product i recommend to keep your droid looking new,35,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,this is my 3rd bodyglove for 3 different phones it is hard with a little give making it very good protection for the phone but also light i love this case,31,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,the case came in a timely manner it fit snugly into my new droid it does a great job of protecting my phone also able to use it to stand up on desktop only thing there is no cover for the screen however i do not feel it is necessary highly recommended as it gets the job done,57,14
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,1.0,negative,i got this book like when it first came out it was littered with obvious typos they would forget periods to close off parenthesis leave off half of a sentence it is pathetic i found grammar errors too grammar errors that koreans commonly make this book was written by koreans i think they should have had a native-english speaker proofread it to a native-english speaker like myself those grammar mistakes are obvious so it is obvious they did not have one read it the book also has other major flaws but the other people who gave this book a negative review explain those quite well so i shall be silent,107,0
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,1.0,negative,this good was supposed to be in good condition it was dirty messy old and not useable it was not as advertised and it was worn a book that needed to be thrown out not sold,35,1
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,2.0,negative,the book itself is okay definitely can not learn korean from it but it is good for learning some basics the entire book is romanized so if you went to korea the book would be useless you definitely need to learn hangul I am not sure why they do not teach the student how to write the language that is beyond stupid but hangul is relatively easy to learn without knowing the hangul words with ss or any other double consonants would not hold any meaning to the reader overall the book is sub-par there are way better ones out there i would not buy it again,102,2
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,5.0,positive,good afternoon I am happy because i have in my hands the order it is what i expected and because to advance knowledge of korean by the book and the translator thank you very much god bless you,36,3
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,5.0,positive,fans of korean soap operas that is to say obsessive viewers of same will love this book korean in phonic english which is fun and helpful but in addition some very very interesting facts do you know why asians take off their shoes at the entrance to houses bet you do not this book tells the story and many others,59,4
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,2.0,negative,not very interesting with this book you will not write in korean-and you will not understand,16,5
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,3.0,neutral,very good primer for anyone wanting to learn how to speak and understand korean in fact the best guide I have been able to find so far i studied korean while i was stationed in korea and bought several books and tapes but this guide has been more useful than formal classes i attended,53,6
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,4.0,positive,korean for dummies the ideal book for anyone starting out this book provides all the basics for learning the korean language a good lesson book that make studying korean easy and fun,31,7
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,5.0,positive,this book is a must have for beginners excited to learn to speak korean i am a huge fan of the historical dramas and this book helps me not to rely on the subtitles you have to try it thank you,38,8
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,1.0,negative,my girlfriend is korean as many of my friends so that is why i decided to look for different ways to learn korean as other languages I have learned you start with the basics and the koreans basic is the hangul or the korean alphabet this books does not have any word in hangul so this is the first bad feature of this book another basic is some grammatic which is not one of the features of this book this book basically goes through several expressions for typical situations if you want a tool where you can learn some words and expressions this is your book but do not count on any methodology to understand etymologies neither to understand korean in such way you could create your own phrases,127,9
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,5.0,positive,i love this book it tells me things that i did not even know that korean people did and i m amazed at how complex this language is,26,10
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,2.0,negative,this book really is for dummies i had already learned how to read korean characters before purchasing this book and i was comfortable reading them this book does not have the characters just the korean words written in english letters it was so confusing i had to write the words down in hangul to be able to read and pronounce the words do not buy this it is a waste of time there are much better resources out there,77,11
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,3.0,neutral,it is critical to learn hangul and I am very surprised that it is not included in this book i speak some korean and romanization is not a good way to learn the language if you buy this book buy a book that has hangul learn the letters and their sounds which is very simple less characters than the english alphabet then translate the romanization into hangul i can not stress enough that it is more important to learn to sound the words out using hangul and do not rely on the romanization which is only ok at best,95,12
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,1.0,negative,you might be able toto speak korean w / this but will not be able to read it without the written word a vital part of the language is missing so if all you want to do is watch korean films without subtitles this may work for you but if you want a complete understanding of the language it is a sad disappointment,63,13
Kindle_Store,B0055AWHP6,5.0,positive,i got this for my husband and so far he is actually using it,14,14
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,this newspaper is great to read good for the mind of keeping people informed,14,0
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,had some business in denver that required some research regarding local activities and various demographics the denver post is a well organized paper that helped me complete my work there easily and effortlessly it also steered me to a couple of fabulous restaurants during my stay thanks denver post,49,1
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,4.0,positive,not the newspaper it use to be but the sports section is always worth reading subscription prices are too high but the kindle edition is very reasonable i will probably never go back to the post directly to subscribe again,40,2
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,3.0,neutral,i like the paper but during the two week trial period there was a problem receiving it on my kindle not once but twice in two weeks unacceptable for me so i canceled my subscription,35,3
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,i do not live in denver and getting a copy occasionally on kindle for a reasonable price is a great feature but since i am supposed to be reviewing the january 29th 2012 edition here it is not much special happened in colorado that day i guess but they sure did a spanking good job writing it up keep up the good work and i will try another edition soon,69,4
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,3.0,neutral,I have been a subscriber for going on 2 years now glitch here and there made delivery late but i survived so that i could get my bronco news a couple of weeks ago the post announced a cutback in employees and it is obvious that some must have been involved in the kindle edition content has gone down by almost 50 I am going to keep it for a little while longer to give them a fair chance,76,5
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,4.0,positive,i wanted the local paper while in denver recently for a vacation i received my paper every morning without fail so i wonder if the earlier delivery issues have not been fixed the paper was easy to navigate and easy to read i give the denver post 3 stars because there is no weather really a paper with no weather report and i found myself really wanting pictures,67,6
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,2.0,negative,i enjoy reading the paper on my time schedule when i received a message delivery would be delayed i canceled i thought they would have had that problem addressed by now,31,7
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,4.0,positive,i used to have a subscription to the denver post when they delivered it outside of the metro area but living in the mountains meant that one good snowstorm equals no delivery until later on in the day if at all then in one of their economy moves they stopped delivering the daily edition completely with the newest edition of the kindle software delivery takes less than 45 seconds after waking the kindle and it happens even if the chain law is in effect on vail pass one added advantage is that you get your local news wherever you are at home or vacationing in california or anywhere there has a wi-fi connection which means almost anywhere in the world as a newspaper reader from way back it took me a while to get used to looking at the kindle screen instead of turning pages i value local news and if you live in the rocky mountain west the denver post is probably one of the best sources and at 6 / month the price is certainly competitive with other online papers,180,8
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,4.0,positive,love it reading it is so easy love saving the trees so easy to hold easy to flip thru sections i recommend it,23,9
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,1.0,negative,signed up and got the paper yesterday today i got a download that says sorry the denver post will be late today now 1246pm and still no paper,28,10
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,3.0,neutral,the post has finally gotten it is delivery problems mostly resolved it is still the electronicchild behind their pdf version that is frustrating because the kindle edition is much easier to read subscibing to the denver post makes it all too clear why newspapers are a dying industry for almost two months the post has been completely unreliable and no one will take responsibility amazon says that the problem is at the denver post and that i need to contact them directly the post claims that they do not sell subscriptions via the kindle and that i must have them confused with a different newspaper there is no one to explain why they have suddenly been so unreliable and there is no one who can explain why and when they are likely to get better this is my local paper and i would really like to read it,148,11
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,it is great to be able to get the denver post on kindle to keep up to date with the mile high city,23,12
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,on my kindle fire each morning when i turn it on,11,13
Kindle_Store,B000JCDUFG,5.0,positive,this is the first newspaper I have subscribed to on my kindle i was hesitant at first because so many people wrote about delivery problems but those issues have clearly been resolved I have been a subscriber now for a few months and i only missed my download once and it was because i turned off my wireless on a flight and forgot to turn it back on this paper is easy to navigate easy to read and best of all you do not get any newspaper ink on your fingers which i used to hate I am a happy denver post customer,101,14
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,3.0,neutral,the abundance of sex scenes and innuendo could have been toned down a lot and replaced with person-to-person intrigue minus the skin,22,0
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,3.0,neutral,as everyone else has said the worst part of this book was all the gratuitous sex scenes my biggest problem was the fact that the scenes were completely unnecessary the scenes in question were not pornographic that is not penthouse stories but cinimax at 2 in the morning but they were non-stop the whole book it also had one of the most ridiculous plot devices to support all the sex ship go fast women get horny i liked the book as a whole which is why it is getting three stars i just would have like it a whole lot more if the constant sex and been toned down and I am a guy,110,1
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,5.0,positive,first off this is not your average scifi book there are no space battles the book follows the start of a carer of a young ensign through his first ship board assignment the characters are explained quite well in depth the onei was prepared for was there light speed travel in the book it turned them all in to horny kids but then again it was a new way of thinking about how the body handle that kind of extreme stress and the sex scenes were nice i do not think for one bit with out them the book would have turned out so well because it is a great sub point for the story personally i can not wait for the sequel to this book and the sex scenes were mild i have read a few other scfi books that have had sex in them and they were way out there this ne was just done right,158,2
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,1.0,negative,started out as a good read but as others have noted drifted further and further into the I shall-thought out female-sex crazed plot line i say I shall thought out because it is based upon high-delta v environment however as the author points out when explaining the circumstance of engaging in eva unless you are accelerating or breaking without an outside reference you can not tell if you are standing still or moving at a high velocity if that is the case what is the because of the sex nonsense it would have been a much much better book without this device,99,3
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,4.0,positive,it is an interesting take on a young mans start in the space navy where he gets lucky in many different ways on his first cruise,26,4
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,4.0,positive,ok so this book is good it is basically a space opera meets emanuel but with actual science written for 16 year old boys so yeah it ticks all the right boxes now to win the lotto and make it into a feature film wonder how much it would take to get natalie portman to star in it,56,5
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,2.0,negative,half this book is good the other half is rubbish the problem is that while the characters are quite well developed the plot line has at it is base the concept that the females on board the ship are all affected by the speed at which the ship travels they become in the authors words horny so if you like a lot of what become quite boring sex scenes buy this book if you are prepared to skip large chunks buy this book judith,82,6
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,2.0,negative,this book had to be written by a 15 year old teenager with fantasies he does not know women or men the writing is not bad except he needs to get real even although it is fantasy this kind is embarrassing for the whole female sex and probably most of the males over 25 the story parts are ok except it gets worse and worse so the real book is only short story length i would suggest he grow up before writing any more or go into porn so his readers could place him in the right genre,94,7
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,4.0,positive,fleet academy is a highly unusual story about a space cadets stay in a training ship there are no space fights against pirates or aliens on other ships but there is plenty of danger and opportunity for mishaps while matt molter the humble protagonist in this story conducts various exercises as directed by his superior officers the author pays special attention to the mechanics of moving about in a space ship and procedures in donning space suits going out in space and more additionally the author creates a sexually charged atmosphere under the guise of the ships acceleration affecting libido of the female crew i agree that the story went overboard on the sex scenes and i took off a star from my rating for this specific reason the sex scenes aside the story is refreshingly original and the writer gets kudos for attempting to envision a space cadets life aboard a training space vessel,154,8
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,5.0,positive,some of the reviewers are certainly inhibited as seems to be the united states norm being a scottish immigrant i loved it fast paced and very entertaining both in the story line and simple erotica i look forward to what i hope will be the next episode in what would make a great trilogy,53,9
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed i bought the story not really a book direct from my kindle i got the sample and it looked like a good way to spend a little time without having to think too much about it the sample was misleading very misleading it set the stage for a space academy storycharacter is really proficient but insecure and more that seems to be perhaps the only part of the story without something about grabbing breasts erect nipples and the rest of the fantasy world of the 12-year old the sex took over and covered up the story becoming more and more impossible to believe to the point our intrepidcharacter is consumed by the amazing attraction he has for every woman on a ship to the point that if it were even partially true on a real ship the crew would end up dead from inattention someone already said this but I shall repeat it if i want bad porn i know where to find it this does not even qualify as bad port just bad juvenal fantasy i feel i got fooled be warned,188,10
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,2.0,negative,i agree with most reviewers that the sex scenes were way overdone in addition the shear number of mechanical failures experienced by the crew was unbelievable they could not do anything without a suitor a mechanical failure i was waiting for the saboteur to show up but nobody least of all the captain seemed to notice the issue i can not imagine any real navy accepting such a failure rate without even commenting on it,75,11
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,1.0,negative,the author is just using his fllet academy story as a hook for all the sex scenes if i want porn i will buy it i resent that this book is sold as science fiction,35,12
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,1.0,negative,this books starts out with a strong story line but quickly loses it the focus of the book then becomes a weak plot creating tenuous bridges between the numerous sexual encounters of the main character i am really disappointed as a writer the author seems to have the potential to write strong compelling stories if only he can avoid the sexual drivel that populated this book,66,13
Kindle_Store,B005I0GXO4,5.0,positive,great action good sex it does need to have even more detailed descriptions of the sex such as the penetrations,20,14
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,3.0,neutral,i was expecting a bunch of short stories and got a bunch of intros some of them were interesting just not what i wanted what a waste of money,29,0

Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,3.0,neutral,i think this is a greatsince i now know several books that i do not want to read in the future in general samplers like this are helpful in discovering authors you might or might not enjoy i hope to see more offers like this for various genres,50,4
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,1.0,negative,i saw eloisa james and i grabbed it i love everything she has written but this was not for me i make it a point to not read the extra chapter teaser at the end of books because i do not like not having the whole story so i can read it I shall just wait until the book is out and then I shall get it this whole book was a teaser when i figured it out i deleted it just glad it was free,83,5
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,1.0,negative,i wish i would have known what to expect before i ordered this book i just ordered it with out sample because i knew some of the authors works,29,6
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,5.0,positive,i really like samplers because i always find new-to-me authors / books i want to try and it is free what more do you want,22,7
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,4.0,positive,i like theof a sampler it let us you explore different writers and maybe find your next great read,20,8
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,2.0,negative,i did not realize they were just short stories with no ending i thought they were complete stories i thought it was wasted money,23,9
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,5.0,positive,these are samples from recent releases by established and new authors it was like browsing on kindle for something to read only simpler there were three samples i enjoyed and added to my wish list the ones that did not grab me i just skipped great way to showcase new books,52,10
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,5.0,positive,such a nice card to send and receive my daughter in law is one of the authors on this with her first published book sent out to all my friends and family,32,11
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,2.0,negative,this are teaser chapters to get you to buy the books have nothing against the authors but i was expecting novellas not one chapter very disappointing,26,12
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,3.0,neutral,i too was confused i thought it was a collection of short novellas for valentines day i was disappointed but i will probably buy some of the books after reading the first chapter i just wish i had know before i started reading that these were not complete,48,13
Kindle_Store,B00B0VZSEG,4.0,positive,i must point out that this is a book of story snippets and coming attractions for books soon to be or already in print it is not a full length novel i fully admit skipping over the stories i do not really get into I am a fan of historical romance and not really paranormal but if you like all romance genres then you should check this book out to see if you would be willing to buy these full length stories once they come out,84,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,5.0,positive,this case is even better than what i thought it would be when i ordered it it is a hard case but yet it has a soft feel to the outside of it love the design and everything about it a,41,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,3.0,neutral,lots of compliments but it came cracked plastic,8,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,3.0,neutral,so pretty but broke the first time i took it apart to change my battery it might work for someone that never needs to remove it,26,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,1.0,negative,it took a month to ship from hong kong when i finally got it i was disappointed it was plastic and flimsy i broke it the second day trying to take it off,33,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,5.0,positive,this case is very easy to install and very beautiful vibrantly colored rubberized case for the galaxy s4 phone easy to charge phone while in case,26,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,4.0,positive,yes as many stated the colors are not as vibrant as shown in the picture online but it is the most beautiful case i have seen and the price is outstanding it is in use for over 1 month and i have had no problems in any way besides strangers asking where i bought it the shipping took very long about 2 weeks,61,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,4.0,positive,the case is wonderful it is looks just like the picture unfortunately the case did not fit my phone the side did not allow for my volume button i am very sad about that i also want to say this company provides excellent customer service wonderful to work with,44,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,3.0,neutral,the picture is pretty much what i got but apparently the printing was off because the one pictured is almost an inch off of what i got also the front and back pieces do not match up which to some would be no problem but i noticed right away also the picture is a lot brighter than what it truly looks like on my phone other than that i do like it and the shipping time was perfect,78,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,4.0,positive,this is an okay case for the price the case is more translucent that in the picture and it is more of a goldthan the yellow that appears in the picture overall it does the job,38,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,4.0,positive,great for the price it is good and clicks on nicely it fits secure theis bright on the pic but i have a dark phone so it is a little darker no i just have to figure out how it get it off so i can change up the different cases i have,56,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,3.0,neutral,the case i received was not as vibrant as the one pictured in fact all of the colors were muted to the point where the yellow seemed bronze to boot the case was very brittle and broke within 2 days of my owning it i live in new york city where inexpensive phone cases are very easy to get for the price of this case in comparison to those i can buy in this city i would not purchase this again,79,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,4.0,positive,the case has gotten many compliments it is not as brightly colored as the image portrays but it is still pretty,20,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,5.0,positive,this case is amazing i bought the owl one for my daughter as well the pictures do not do any justice to the neat 3d detailing the phone has so stinkin cute def would purchase again,35,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,3.0,neutral,this phone case as shown in this picture is not what i received it is much lighter than in the picture but i use it anyway,26,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00C6OORDO,1.0,negative,yes it was inexpensive but no new product should begin peeling within a week much cheaper looking in person you are better off investing in a case with better quality lesson learned,31,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,5.0,positive,nice nice nice keeps my phone running like crazy love it so far not too heavy not too big well it does make your toy larger but it worth it one minus when playing phone on side kinda uncomfortable to play but the rest is fine,47,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,3.0,neutral,was great at first now it does not seem to hold a charge as long not sure why but that was the only let down,24,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,2.0,negative,this items takes long to charge and does not provide twice the battery life would hope to have had one that can hold the life of the phone longer than just two hours,32,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,2.0,negative,so it was great for 3 months or so but then it just stopped working before that i had to play with the charging cable to get it to work which sucked all this said i am going to buy a new one as i have no choice [ gritts teeth ] there should be a law against phone manus making their new toys with ludicrously-inadequate power supplies,65,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,4.0,positive,i just love this product it gives me double the life of my battery works best if you have it on after charging over night last 2 - 3 hours longer then when trying to recharge your phone the only reason i give this a 4 is because it does not enable computer sync you have to completely unhook your phone in order to transfer your files to and from your computer other then that this product is great adds bulk but i love it gives me a much better grip on my phone if you are interested in an extended battery go with this one if you do not mind unhooking it frm your phone to do data sync to your computer,119,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,1.0,negative,i purchased a powerskin for my htc sensation in october 2011 it worked as advertised quite well doubling my battery life and allowing me to spend a whole day without having to plug the phone in unfortunately it stopped working about two months after i bought it i think perhaps because the wires that connect the case to the phone got stressed i wrote to powerskin several times through their website to request a repair / replacement as it is under warranty but they have failed to respond despite my repeated inquiries so i would give this 4 stars for when it worked but zero stars for durability / customer service i will not buy another one,113,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,2.0,negative,bulky usable but with it is size could pack easily 15 to 3 times the 1500 mah easy to plug in and can charge internal battery while plug-in the size for 1500mah is too little can easily pack 3000mah battery in the that volume of space it occupies,47,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with my powerskin not only does it give me enough battery life to last the whole day like carrying two batteries but the rubber case is very comfortable not too thick and does a good job of protecting my phone it is also extremely easy to apply and remove when you need access to the battery compartment the only negative i can give it is that the usb connector tends to work it is way out losing contact but i habitually push it back in with my little finger as I am talking so it is no big issue,99,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,1.0,negative,is this a joke that is nearly a triple the thickness of the phone the i-phone version only add a little to the overall thickness but the android version makes the phone look like it is from 1990s i do not know what these guys were thinking but the average battery is less then 1/4 thick so where is the extra thickness coming from,61,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,4.0,positive,this case adds a second battery to my smartphone allows me to use gps navigation push email browsing the internet listening music all day long without being out of battery the case material is soft and nice to touch only thing which could have been better is the bump on the left side for the power plug i think it could have been reduced using a smaller plug in order to be the same size as the right side but it is not a big deal another great thing is that the case is punctured for every little hole present on the htc sensations back for noise cancelation mikes so it will not block this feature such as other cases,118,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,3.0,neutral,ehh it makes battery last longer then it used to but i still wish it would last longer i still did recommend this product to co-workers because they have the same phone and the batteries die quick,36,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,3.0,neutral,buy from your local phone dealer that way you do not have all the drama of trying to send it back to get a replacement due to it being broke right out of the box,34,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,4.0,positive,alright if you have a htc sensation and use any amount at all you know then that the battery is at least on the verge of dying by evening or already dead when i added this powerskin to mine it seriously added on a ton of battery life i can go all day with no worry whatsoever now that being said let us move on to what sucks about it do not be fooled about other reviews this case literally almost doubles the thickness of the phone and makes it very bulky a little heavy also for a phone the thing on the side of the phone sticking out is dumb at first but you get used to it and i think it helps gripping the phone up by my ear one more thing about this case what it does is keep your phone topped off all day and then once this case is dead then your battery in the phone starts draining and shows it draining on the battery usage bar when this device is being topped off by the case the case may get really warm overall i think it is worth about 40 it does what it needs to do for you and what it advertises,205,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,5.0,positive,if i could give ten stars i would exactly what i was looking for definitely a perfect buy i had been searching for a product that was thin sleek and protective the silicone cases are my favorite they are not too rough and they are not too smooth so the grip is just perfect the battery pack really did double my htc battery life it was not heavy at all and i felt like i was just holding my phone without a case the fit of the case was really snug also for the price you can not go wrong i highly recommend this case to anyone and everyone who has the htc sensation,113,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005441EVQ,5.0,positive,i recieved these in 3 days after ordering the quality is good and they are a great way to protect your phone it is made of a silicon material that i find protects a lot more than anything made of plastic i would recommend these,45,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,it does allow you to reposition but it is not as easy as it suggests i still ended up with bubbles at the bottom of the screen but more my fault than the product,33,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,5.0,positive,good product easy to install and looks great on the price was great also i would purchase from this company again,21,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,5.0,positive,great product was easy to apply works with s-pen and feels like it is not there i would recommend thanks,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,i finally received the protector for my wifes galaxy note 101 after long delay of missing shipment applying only took 5 mins i thought it will take longer than the time that i spent for mediadevil on my iphone but surprisingly 5 mins make sure you use tape technique to remove all dusts out using the finger on the screen is ok but s-pen experience is not as smooth as i thought that is why i am not giving 5 stars,82,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,5.0,positive,love it no problems at all product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned,20,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,bottom line the screen protector works as advertised both clear and matte protectors are provided the matte protector installed easily with no bubbles as suggested in other reviews and references available the key is to clean the device well before application of the screen protector the s-pen on the note 101 works properly after installation the pen slides easily across the surface of the protector and characters and strokes are interpreted correctly frequent cleaning is still needed to remove somewhat distracting fingerprints no more or less than any other screen protector I have used in conclusion it is worth the price,100,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,1.0,negative,i followed instructions on packaging and still can not get the bubbles out no one to blame but myself for being cheap,21,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,i have a new samsung tablet and the accessories are hard to fine but this one really fit i am so pleased,22,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,3.0,neutral,matte screen protector sucked way too dark and adds a weird pattern over the screen the clear protector worked great although easy to apply and has so far held up for 6 months without any damage price is high given only one of the two protectors is actually worth using also the package does not include anything for smoothing the protectors luckily i had a squeegee from the protector i bought for my cell-phone,74,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,5.0,positive,i bought this product after i purchased my galaxy 2 note tablet and i love the way it looks and how it does not leave any scratches or fingerprints on my screen,31,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,1.0,negative,removed and threw away because it prevented my screen to function properly useless and pointless i would not recommend ever,20,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,my friend installed it so i do not know if it was easy or not but it looks great it has the matte finish on now,25,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,3.0,neutral,time excellent full compliance the article is good protection for the tablet is very good the installation is a bit complicated,21,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,3.0,neutral,the big issue for me was the fact that there were a couple of small creases right in the center of both sheets which suggested that the damage occurred during packaging or shipping as a result i have permanent air bubbles which could not be removed for the price it was not worth sending back otherwise perfect fit and i have no problem using the device with or without the stylus good visibility of everything on the screen,77,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00BWVIN9G,4.0,positive,good for it is purpose no complaints overall good experience would recommend others to buy this product you will not go wrong,20,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00B3FROF0,3.0,neutral,the case fits very nice it is really cute and comes as shown however the bow fell off within the first week i received it,25,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00B3FROF0,4.0,positive,i loved it the trouble is that the space to connect the charger is too small and it will not fit and i have to remove the cover so that it can charge it is also very hard to press the volume with the case on,46,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00B3FROF0,4.0,positive,thought the leopard design was not a sticker on the back thought the design would of been embedded in the silicone,21,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00B3FROF0,2.0,negative,as soon as i opened the package and pulled the case out the bow fell off and the case scratches really easily chager fits but not well a lot of times the charger would not connect too well and fall out,40,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00B3FROF0,4.0,positive,the only real minor problem is the bow is hard plastic attached to rubber and it keeps coming off we keep the super glue handy although,26,12

Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,5.0,positive,first of all wow teachers pet was absolutely captivating i could not put it down I am absolutely certain it is the reason why house cleaning was put on hold for the weekend definitely a cliffhanger read left me wanting more i feel like we have all been in lynoras shoes before at least i have not knowing our full potential until that certain someone wakes us up to it all i can say is more,73,0
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,3.0,neutral,i saw this book and was intrigued by the whole teacher / student concept simon foster is the hot college professor and lynora is the mousy naive student i liked the book well enough but i do not like lynn at all she has a very weak femaleshe has either speechless and dumbstruck when she has in simons presence or she has smart mouthed and says hateful things without thinking she has so naive and whiney so annoying simon is simon he seems very sure of himself and what he wants and does not have to put up with lynn and her childish fits this installment ends in a bit of a cliffhanger which i completely understand due to the way lynn acted because it was free and the next one is only 99 I shall continue reading I am invested enough to read it and see what happens i do understand that there will be at least 3 books from what I have read,155,1
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,3.0,neutral,eye opening taboo relationship born of list the back and forth on both of their parts showed their passion against logic very steamy dorm room scene ending makes you want to know what happens in the rest of series she is still his student,44,2

Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,4.0,positive,cold fire hot professor his ta definitely has some baggage it was a good read very rushed no suspense in this first book I am on to the second to read it,32,6
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,3.0,neutral,i was enjoying the story line albeit stunted but it did not draw me in enough to purchase the next one there is room to use some more descriptive scenes but considering the fact that this book seems geared to a very young genre it works,46,7
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,5.0,positive,i could not put this book down this author totally kept me engaged with the storyline i can not wait to read the next book,24,8
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,4.0,positive,i like the storyline but it seems to move quickly and i want it to build up more on the flip side i like how i do not have to wait forever to get to the meat of the plot,39,9
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,3.0,neutral,this was a different way of thinking about sexual indulgence in writing this book the characters were alright the story seemed like the author did not have to go all out for the storyline,33,10
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,5.0,positive,this book was awesome i really enjoyed reading it,9,11
Kindle_Store,B00NQ7K284,1.0,negative,needed more storyline in depth something was missing way too short characters was not developed fully disappointed it does have potential,22,12

Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,4.0,positive,solid insightful account of the people and decisions that crippled the romney campaign the pages go by in a flash and i highly recommend dedicating a couple hours of your leisure time to reading the book if you are looking for a deep dissertation on romneys campaign mechanics and political philosophy this is not it,54,0
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,2.0,negative,author seems to use this to get even with those in the campaign he did not like no real insights one suspects he was marginal in the campaign staff,28,1
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,5.0,positive,gabriel schoenfeld might tend to the neoconservative side of the gop spectrum and i would likely disagree with him on most foreign policy issues but that does not change the fact that he wrote a great book about the romney campaign or that he correctly diagnosed the political consultant / marketer industry as being the primary problem with the gop he also described the consultants attitude of refusing to acknowledge any mistakes for fear of losing their position in the hierarchy of the campaign whatever stevens was really thinking in the political consulting business it almost never pays to admit error it is better to stonewall or to spin laced with hilarious and yet the same time horrifying anecdotes this is a good book that will probably not be very popular among the rnc power brokers but will be an unexpected treat to those outside the political world go read a bad day on the romney campaign it is 299 as an ebook and is well worth it,164,2
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,4.0,positive,a delicious detailing of the disaster that was the romney campaign written by a senior speechwriter fully gives the reader the frisson that comes from watching a truly cataclysmic mistake unfold the many missteps of the campaign can be directly traced to the senior campaign staff and candidate and their detailing provides a delightful dash of disaster porn a brief brisk read that is recommended for both wonks and the public,71,3
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,2.0,negative,there is some charm in this book i especially liked the memoir of ann with her 1 million dollar flying wonder burro but he has much too kind to the willard it seems as although george romney was a decent man but his son would have been a disaster for america we dodged a bullet folks,57,4
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,3.0,neutral,wonder if the author does not have an axe to grind his overall conclusion that the candidate operated out of a flawed view of the electorate is spot on,28,5
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,5.0,positive,this is by far the most cogent exolanation of hiw a good man lost that I have read or watched it is both inside and prifound,24,6
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,2.0,negative,a decent if generic rehashing of the 2012 presidential campaign it is difficult to take schoenfeld seriously as the motivation for this book appears to be entirely self-promoting and revisionist unsurprisingly schoenfeld argues that the romney campaign suffered from blunders committed by almost every one of it is operatives except for him objectivity is entirely absent and what remains is a political hatchet job the redeeming value of this book was it is concluding argument that modern electoral politics can not be overwhelmed by quantitative data and instead should harness an emotional zeitgeist,90,7
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,3.0,neutral,much has been written about the 12 campaign and election those who have not read a lot about the election and why romney failed to capture the office of the president may find it more interesting than those who have read and studied other works regarding it,46,8
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,5.0,positive,riveting i could not stop reading it fascinating to see the role of hubris and pandering in a campaigns unraveling really gives you an insiders view,25,9
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,5.0,positive,gabriel schoenfeld calmly lays out the many ways that bad hiring choices made by one of americas most talented businessmen ended up with a campaign that succeeded only in burdening a candidate with many of his own disadvantages with the errors blindnesses misjudgments and incompetence of an overconfident unpassionate and incurious set of leaders failing to pay attention to schoenfelds book will result in gop reforms that will institutionalize the errors of the romney campaign there is very little in this account about ideological wars evangelicals against social liberals rinos against tea party that seem to captivate the political class it is a matter of basic politics candidates must care policies must have or be seen to have a soul not just a list of polling results authenticity matters to voters if you are a righty please read this short gripping beautifully written but angry book if you are a democrat or a liberal do not pay attention to it is lessons please i am a friend of the authors from before his mitt years and have no acquaintance with his political campaign work nor have i ever been involved with any political campaign after eugene mccarthys,193,10
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,1.0,negative,I have worked on political campaigns and it never ceases to amaze me that people theorize that what the campaign needs and is missing is exactly what i have to offer gabriel schoenfeld is the hammer and he has identified the problem nail it seems he rather resented having to work for lanhee chen and further resented that dr chen did not immediately recognize and appreciate his brilliance the inner circle of a campaign is a tough nut to crack and i understand the frustration of feeling on the outside the useful bits of the book are near the end when he goes after the relentless packaging of candidates,108,11
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,5.0,positive,it is a good read fast moving study of what not to do it shows that you need to think about where you want to go before you set sail,30,12
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed it most of the info i already knew but it was good to get an insiders perspective worth the download,22,13
Kindle_Store,B00CHQOT2K,4.0,positive,this is a quick read that goes over most of the material we already know this time from an insider on the romney team it was interesting,27,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,2.0,negative,i never got to use this cover it said it was for the htc evo 4 g but it was not for mine,22,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,4.0,positive,thiswas great at first fit perfectly out of the package however now a month later it is starting to sag and lose it is shape this is still a great product i would definitely purchase more then one maybe in different colors so that they can be switched out every so often to maintain their size / shape,57,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,2.0,negative,the product shipped on time and fit the phone with no problems i had many complaints about people not able to hear or understand me no more complaints after removing the case,32,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,1.0,negative,i bought this case and i hate it it barely even stays on the phone it is so loose if it were tighter on the phone it would be great could be i got a bad one but i do not know,40,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,5.0,positive,love theand the stretchiness i got it for a friend and she liked it i would purchase it again,21,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,2.0,negative,my husband bought this case for me i love thenot quite as bright as what has shown above but still a solid and bright pink at first i loved the case it fit perfectly but after time i guess it started to stretch out or something it constantly falls off and is more annoying than helpful my husband bought himself the black version of this case and it is still perfectly snug also since it is silicone it gets stuck on everything which i knew would happen but if you like to put your phone in your pocket or tight pocket in your purse you will not be able to get it out quickly so all in all good product for a short time,124,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,4.0,positive,placed order on the 12th received it on the 16th not as bright as shown but still cute soft gel not the shiny hard gel so cotton does rub off to it it fits the evo design 4 g well I am satisfied for less than a buck plus shipping which was like 150 i can not complain,55,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,1.0,negative,was not the right one i loved theand material but did not fit unable to use because its not for the phone,23,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,4.0,positive,great product does it exactly what it says this was definitely something i needed because my phone is more on the ground than in my hand,26,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,4.0,positive,i like it no problems with it stays on for the most part every now and then a corner will kinda slip off but it is okay,26,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,3.0,neutral,nothing too spectacular but fits snugly and offers decent protection I have dropped the phone a few times with this cover and it bounces off hard surfaces theis not quite as vibrant as pictured but overall a good buy for such a low price,44,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,5.0,positive,i have not read any other reviews but i received mine in a timely fashion and absolutely love it it fits my htc hero perfect the holes that open for camera and speaker are exactly where they are supposed to be and it is nice to be able to take off for cleaning of phone and more,55,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005KDF8QI,1.0,negative,honestly this case just sits in my room and collects dust it is actually a really pale pink and very see-through it is really ugly and fortunately i bought three other cases at the same time so I am not out of a case do not buy unless you want what i described,50,14
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,3.0,neutral,it was very helpffull in educating me on the reason to hire a proffessional it really is a goodto to have a good plan before one strarts buying plants with no real plan,35,0
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,5.0,positive,I am a landscape designer and contractor myself and i can tell you that ms mathews presents the true realities of the trade and art there are so many misconceptions of what landscape design is and what beauty and value it can bring to the home ms mathews presents those points very clearly she also talks about what to look for and yes avoid when choosing a designer and contractor s for the person looking to landscape their home either as aproject or to hire people in the trade her book will prepare you for both,96,1
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,2.0,negative,it might be a good book for some but i did not understand many of the concepts and decided to ditch the read and spend my time on other methods and gardening it was a waste of time,38,2

Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,4.0,positive,brief pretty general and gives a place to start,9,8
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,2.0,negative,very boring and rambles on about choosing a designer or designing it yourself but never gets to anything really concrete about design in my opinion i was looking for a more practical guide,33,9
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,4.0,positive,this book has good basic information for how to plan your landscaping it offers several options for creativity and i like how ms mathews does not just tell you how and what to plant but leads you to your own design a few more photos would be a nice addition if the book is ever revised,55,10
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,4.0,positive,to get any benefit from this book it is important to understand what it is and what it is not written by a british landscaper it is an overview of what is involved with successfully landscaping a garden it is not abyguide on how to do it see rachels other books for that rachel is careful to point out for our american readers when i say garden i mean yard or landscape for us brits garden means the whole thing not just the plant borders it is a free book which is why i have given it four stars it is thought provoking which is presumably the intended goal together with very straightforwardly nudging the reader towards the authors other products and services,127,11
Kindle_Store,B00IGSMYHK,5.0,positive,do not know where to start start here good tips for absolute beginners can help you save money by helping you plan also good at letting you know what pitfalls to avoid,31,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,2.0,negative,the plastic has a coating on it that will wear off quickly but it has a nice feel to it it provides no protection whatsoever and it is already dirty after using it for only 3 days,36,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,5.0,positive,fast shipment and cheap nice looking cover the cover fits my phone so nicely and it is so easy to insert it on my iphone,24,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,3.0,neutral,this iphone case looks great and is true to the picture it also has a nice satiny feeling to it however i find the case slightly loose not loose enough that the phone will fall out but it is just a tiny bit longer than the phone who there is a slight shift up and down from the phone i do not think it is bad enough to not take this amazing buy although,74,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,2.0,negative,i thought this case looked super cute online and the reviews seemed good so i purchased it i was very disappointed in the result it is a cute case but the hole around the camera lens and flash is not big enough or something because pictures using the flash come out foggy also when i tried taking the case off my iphone 4s it would not come off i ended up having to use a small flathead screwdriver to pry it off and the tool chipped my brand new phone not happy i do not recommend buying this product spend the money on a good case from incase or the apple store or something,114,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,5.0,positive,it took forever to get here but i love it love the way it makes my phone feel feels very secure,21,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,2.0,negative,i ordered the chinese fashion hard back case cover for apple iphone 4 4 g 4s plum flower and the whiteon the case has a blue tint to it so the white is not bright and it looks dull comparative to my white iphone the feel of it is little bit of matte plastic and the design is same as you see in the product picture i also ordered another case snap-on protector hard case image cover artistic purple flowers design for apple iphone 4 and 4s from amazon which has smooth vinyl feel and i like the feel of that comparative to this chinese fashion hard back case overall i am not sure that I am going to use this case not complaining about the price although,129,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,1.0,negative,the design chipped off the case within 48 hours of arrival the case may be cheap but it is not worth it,22,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,3.0,neutral,i love this case it is very slick and thing enough where it does not feel bulky it scratches very easily but being that it is white you can not really see it unless you look really closely can not beat the price,38,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,1.0,negative,looks nothing like the picture it is hideously ugly can not bring myself to give it as a gift as intended,21,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,5.0,positive,this is just as beautiful in person got it really fast and well worth every penny i would have and have paid 3 times the priceh,24,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,4.0,positive,the case is absolutely adorable it snapped onto my iphone very easily and I have gotten tons of compliments on it the only problem is that it offers no protection to the front cover so if you dropped it the screen would have no defense whatsoever also it is kind of slippery because there has no rubber on the case at all so it could easily slip out of your hand or something like that however i do think the case is gorgeous and if you pair it with a clear screen cover you will be good to go very reasonably priced,99,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,2.0,negative,i loved the design of the casae but trust me it does little to protect your phone i knew this might be a problem which is hte only reason I am giving this two stars i should have known i was getting out of my car and unknowingly had my phone on my lap so when i got out of the car the phone landed face down on the cement and the screen cracked the phone still worked but i ended up getting the phone replaced by apple for 150 therefore the 5 phone case ended up costing me 155 be careful,101,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055BKII8,4.0,positive,it is easy tu put into the iphone the coloros are darker than the picture the covers for the screen are good very nice price,24,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,2.0,negative,when i received my bluetooth in the mail i was so excited but that soon turn to disappointment when the little thingy that you put around your ear was not really stable it has a little rubbery piece inside the earclip circle where you can change it from right to the left ear that piece is not glued in at all it keeps falling out falling apart it does not stay on the bluetooth itself as it should and it is just a hassle the wrap around piece could have had more flexibility as well,91,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,5.0,positive,i love it excellent buy could not be happier with it was what i thought and much more thank you,20,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,5.0,positive,i really do love this bluetooth it is easy to set up and not hard to use the only thing i do not like about it is the ear piece that i can not seem to get on right but other than that it is an awesome piece for my phone,48,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,2.0,negative,the people to whom i speak find the sound quality good but i find the audio quality just not loud enough i also was unhappy that were no directions at all for it is use the only instruction was for pairing it with my cell phone although that was helpful,49,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,5.0,positive,when i first got it the rubber that connects to the bluetooth fall apart but i asked them for a replacement piece and now it is nice and steady it was easy to pair with my devices and does not take up too much room it also comes with a usb wall adapter and car charger all in compact size for me i give it 5 stars what may be implemented to make this product even better is replacement parts as a backup to eliminate any issues with the device being accessible,91,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004EYI02S,1.0,negative,the ear piece on this just will not stay on it is very hard to adjust am now using one my friend gave me sorry i wasted my money instructions were also very bad looks like someone tried to write the instructions in english,42,10

Kindle_Store,B00BJRCM3Q,4.0,positive,having lived in 5 countries over the last 13 years with only brief returns to my home in the us i enjoyed watching the authors metamorphosis from wide-eyed and somewhat arrogant american to a person with some understanding of other cultures the book is easy to read but i was bothered by the abundant malapropisms,55,0
Kindle_Store,B00BJRCM3Q,3.0,neutral,this book requires an editor who knows how to keep the storyline in sequence this one at times seems arbitrary that said i recommend this book to any student studying abroad,31,1
Kindle_Store,B00BJRCM3Q,1.0,negative,i love france i love the french language i have actually looked for peanut butter in paris this is a autobiographical text by a very young woman who is enamoured with herself and her own experiences this is a great thing when you are that young woman it is not a great book necessarily ms sparks frequently comes off as smug and self-righteous there are moments of quite lovely writing following by pity parties sad little paragraphs of filler that should have been edited out or rewritten and outright hubris note that i read to the half way point in the book and deleted it off my ipad perhaps it got better and the author redeems herself at the end but i sincerely doubt it and as i have other things to read and i only paid 099 for the book i considered it not a terrible loss and have moved on,151,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,1.0,negative,i was looking for something i could wear on my forearm to house my iphone and my keys card and more when i ran thislooked like it would fit the bill but when i received it was disappointed to find it seemed rather cheaply made and was way too bulky in my opinion it is definitely not worth 20 i ended up returning it,65,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,4.0,positive,I have had the myband for a little over a month now and it is been great for my workouts walking / jogging i did notice however that the fabric is a little torn already underneath but it does not affect the pocket for the iphone I have washed it a couple of times already and recommend putting it in the dryer on high with other clothes because if you do not it ll take forever to dry all in all a good purchase the only thing is that i wish it came in different sizes to fit the upper arm,94,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,2.0,negative,i bought this because a friend showed me hers and raved about how great it was the one i received is different from hers mine has a terry cloth band which looks like it would unravel after the first wash hers was more of a neoprene sleeve,47,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,3.0,neutral,there are times when you do not have a purse with you to carry your phone the only problem was that it was only in black which was quite noticeable,29,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,1.0,negative,if i had anythe material this is made out of was heavy fleece I had have skipped the purchase the iphone fits fine and snug and there has no chance of it coming out but the rest of the material makes me think i have a sweater on not ideal for summer running would not recommend,56,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,5.0,positive,this product worked out exactly how i wanted it the wrist gets a little hot after starting running but the band is nice and snug and the touch screen works very well through the plastic,35,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,5.0,positive,i can not tell you how many iphones i have destroyed while riding my bike i have had 2 fall out of my pocket and bite the dusk total nightmare i like that the myband is safe and secure on my wrist i can not stand the other style holders that are high up on my biceps not only does it leave a crap tan line but it also hurts my arm the myband is perfect for a bike ride and for so many other workouts,86,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,1.0,negative,was so excited when i saw this because of where it was worn on the arm but when it arrived my excitement turned to disappointment so cheaply made used it once and threw it away waste of money,39,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,3.0,neutral,i like to extra pocket for my drivers license credit card or car key but it is too large for my ipod and too tight of a fit for my samsung galaxy iii in addition it gets very wet because of sweat and is hard to dry,47,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,3.0,neutral,i like using this on my arm which is very convenient and comfortable however the material that it is made out of is very hot this would be ideal if it was made out of some other type of light weight material i might appreciate it more in the winter months,51,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,5.0,positive,it is very comfortable and you can use your phone really easy but if you have a cover you will have to remove it before because it did not fit with the case but is very comfortable and easy to handle,40,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,3.0,neutral,pros convenient when working out running biking or if you do not want to hold on to your phone because you want to your 2 hands cons after 4 or 5 uses the platic ends are breaking because the stitching material is not strong enough for taking out and putting your phone in summary love the product however it needs a strong stitching material to hold the the plastic so that it will prevent it from unstitching since you will have to put it and take out your phone several times and the current stitching material does not seem to hold i returned the product back but i am hoping for new design with better materials hire me as your materials buyer that is what i do good luck,127,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00E6AQ96Y,2.0,negative,the fabric is too heavy and hot to wear,9,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,4.0,positive,this phone cover is an excellent buy the designs are super cute with bold colors accented perfectly with some sparkle the plastic is not very thick so not the most durable but the pieces snapped together for a solid fit greatfor the price,45,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,4.0,positive,it does a great job of protecting the phone i am a huge klutz and drop my phone all the time and the cover does not even come off that being said the cover is very hard to get off if you need to remove it i like the design of the cover but it does have white borders everywhere it curves under the photos do show that but it is something i just was not paying enough attention to overall i would recommend it,82,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,5.0,positive,it was as beautiful on my phone as it was in the picture very pleased with this purchase the only thing i would change would be the ease of taking it on and off of my phone,37,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,5.0,positive,i love this phone case and get compliments on it every day but after having to take it off and put it back on several times taking the battery out when my phone freezes cleaningthe case has become compromised and does not snap into place as tightly will probably have to replace soon but it is been fun to have the design is so cool and the price was definitely right,72,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,3.0,neutral,this product was not what i expected it do be but i was still good i was a little dissapointed that the paint had chipped off in a few places around the button cut outs however i did receive several compliments from coworkers,43,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,3.0,neutral,but the pattern wears off very easily the design is already rubbed off on the corners and the white plastic underneath shows oh well it was cheap,27,7

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,5.0,positive,it is a very pretty case has a unique retro 90s afro-centric feel to it it was exactly as displayed a black case with a shimmery-silver touch to it and colorful geometric swirls and zigzags other people talk about getting their cases from mall kiosks for about 1999 per case and i love to reply saying well i got mine for 38 cents on amazoncom jaw dropping regretful reactions love love love it i am a satisfied customer,80,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,3.0,neutral,this case is just as pictured and goes on easily but it is thin plastic and feels like it will snap in two when you try to take it off I have only had it two weeks and the graphics are already scratching off in several spots i do like it for the fact that it is less slippery then my last cover so i do not drop my phone as often,69,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,1.0,negative,this product did not fit my phone model as stated it was made of the cheapest material and this was the worst experience i have ever had ordering anything,29,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,3.0,neutral,it is a very sturdy case that will protect my phone the only thing is the colors are different from the picture like the background looks like it would be a black sparkle but it is an ugly gray oh well it works tho,43,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0044MPB2W,1.0,negative,looks cheap and has a lot of sparkles and glitter not that it comes off but it is just not as nice as the picture,24,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i recently got my samsung galaxy s3 a couple of months ago i love the phone however i wanted an option to use a keyboard instead of the touchscreen so i immediately jumped at this sliding keyboard when i seen it the keyboard looks pretty much like the photo but the manufacturers accidentally printed an additional p on the key that serves as the delete button it took me a few minutes to figure that out overall the keyboard is ok if it would have been more than the cost that is listed i probably would have sent it back the option i like the most about the keyboard is the tilting screen other reviews mention how loud the keys are when typing but in all honesty it is not that bad sounds about the same as if you were typing on a laptop one other note phone cases will not fit on this keyboard it is a little wider than the phone itself i will probably keep this sliding keyboard,165,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,the good comes in nice packaging and even included a usb cable to charge it the phone fits into a rubberized case that case easily slides and attaches onto the keyboard detaching the phone from the keyboard is fairly simple so if you need to put the phone into a caror deskthat should be as simple as sliding the phone off the keyboard the phone case is flat on the back it might not fit in some docks it still fits in my i-bolt carok pairing was simple just follow the included instructions there are some holes in the keyboard to allow the sound from the rear speaker to get out the volume seems the same with or without the keyboard attached the bad the whole unit with phone is about 7/8 thick with a better design it could be much thinner if you slide the keyboard down it still blocks the camera just a tiny bit either tilt the keyboard 90 degrees or just detach the keyboard when taking pictures / videos,177,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,love this case but the clasp where the case comes apart broke i glued it together i guess we will see if it works if it does then i will up my rating,32,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,5.0,positive,bought the wife galaxy iii which does not have an external keyboard becuase she wanted to retain an ext keyboard function she loves this keyboard it attaches as advertised and works great for her i would recommend it,38,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i love touchscreen but sometimes i miss buttons this product is perfect but it makes the phone so fat i love it but it is just so big it makes the s3 literally an inch thick overall it is a really good product but it just needs to loose some un-needed thickness,50,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,not very useful do not even use it anymore the screen does not rotate to face the keyboard or at list i could not do it,23,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,it is good i love it the best one i ever seen some of my others packages have got yet can not,21,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,number keys are not separate kind of kills the point of having a keyboard,14,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,the description states it is thin and light but is quite the opposite very heavy and made the phone twice as big could not get in or out of my pocket very well and i wear loose fitting mens jeans also when you type the buttons are very loud so everyone around you can hear that you are typing this is not a big deal if you are not trying to be quiet overall i would not purchase this product again and i returned the one i bought the only good thing was how easy amazons returns and refunds are love them,98,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,i did not want to believe the other reviews and decided to order it anyways i was very displeased with the quality of the keyboard not only did the shift key not work properly the backlight was very dim and it was difficult to see the letters on the keyboard the keys are made of a hard plastic which makes it difficult to push down and loud while typing unfortunately i used the keyboard for less than 3 hours and sent it back very displeased heed all the warning and resist the purchase of this,96,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,4.0,positive,i recived the case brand new shiped very fast love the case works very well takes a little while to get use to the keyboard but is a really great case you can turn the phone on amd off by the case it also has alot of other great features,50,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i found the cover a little bulky but it did work i ended up buying a different one that was a lot lighter,23,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,3.0,neutral,this is a great case and all of the replacement frames work perfectly for about 3 months i am now on my third due to the housing around the charging port breaking on the last two wish they were aluminum or another material as it is now a 50 60ish case with all of the replacements have not found another case i like more unfortunately,62,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,3.0,neutral,i bought this as a replacement band for a case i already owned where the orginal band broke these bands are flimsy but once on it is rubber seat actually make a pretty nice case be advised however that you must use the properly shaped charger for the shape of the band it is a bit of a pain and pulling it off an on to use a different charger and leads to premature wear this band broke a few months later just like the first one like i said before it is not entirely the fault of the band but more of a flaw in the design of the system additionally it really seems like a rip-off to spend nearly 10 on a flimsy plastic part but i suppose it is cheaper than fixing / replacing a broken phone,134,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,4.0,positive,i noticed on this new one the area around the plug that broke on my original one has been modified that is a good thing now to find a headphone plug adapter with a longer end i have to take the phone out of the case to use that feature,50,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,3.0,neutral,these bumper pieces break quickly i had two get damage in less than three weeks just from plugging in the charger,21,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,2.0,negative,first let me start by saying that these cases are awesome and great quality if only if you do not change batteries very often if you do then the case will not last at all i have four batteries so i constantly change batteries during the day and after having these cases for a month the cases broke from the bottom part where the charger goes in i already broke two if you do not change batteries then you are good,78,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DD6ICX0,1.0,negative,when it came with the whole case the frame broke with in a month then after ordering a second frame it broke again in 2weeks,25,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,1.0,negative,distorted audio out buzzing on recieve on i phone and lg 925 and 920 are very good 835 very bad,20,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,5.0,positive,i already own one of these and wanted another for back up when i go on trips and are away from methods to charge it the noise level is low to none and the incoming speech is crystal clear i love that i do not need to keep looking this is it the price is awesome,55,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,3.0,neutral,i bought this primarily because the price was very attractive 15 dollars the biggest issue i have is that there is no on / off indicator the on / off button is the same and one never knows easily if the device is on or off the documentation everywhere completely omits reference called plantronics and they kept insisting that a blue light should display when on they shipped me a new product twice both times the product behaved the same which was frustrating i think this is the design and i will not contact plantronics anymore otherwise the product works fine and sound quality is good worth the price i paid,108,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,2.0,negative,over the years I have had several bluetooths all of which were plantronics i was very happy with each and every single one of them i would need a new one because i would lose it or the dog would chew it up on several occasions i found a deal on this one and i went for it expecting the same quality as the other plantronics unfortunately I am not very happy with this one although the design physically is not bad the actual device hold up to par with other bluetooths blueteeth haha the main concerns are that i sound muffled to the person that I am on the phone with and the volume to hear the other person does not go very high then there are little things here and there where there is brief static sounds my bluetooth will disconnect itself once in while but that might be my phone although i have not had that trouble before and i personally just do not like the plastic part that holds the bluetooth to the ear,171,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,2.0,negative,plantronics voyager 835 bluetooth headset received timely device only functioned for two weeks future electronic purchases will be done at a store where the warranty would be honored,28,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,5.0,positive,excellent much better than the cheaper versions of the same thing by the same manufacturer works simply and well holds a charge well,20,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,3.0,neutral,pros lightweight good reception both ways i hear clearly and others hear me clearly cons the indicator light to turn the headset on and off is directly below your thumb whenever you are pressing the button so it is hard to tell when the device actually turns on or off the ear piece does not fit snug into my ear so the whole headset is kind of floppy on my ear i am about 63 and 210lbs so my ears might be a little bigger than average volume is way too low read the other reviews it is nearly impossible to listen to someone on the other end if you are in a noisy environment i would recommend this device but i would definitely explain the above precautions first,126,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,1.0,negative,this product does not work with a higher pitched voice i can not use it when i am outside as it will not pick up my voice when I am talking when i am inside people say i sound muffled and it does not sound like me at all also the ear hook is plastic so it will not bend and it hurt my ear so i gave this thing away to a male and i bought a jawbone with works great,78,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,4.0,positive,good volume and clarity for the user those called have reported that the sound quality is good always seems like a bit of a job getting it plugged into my ear i wonder if one-size-fits-all is really practical considering you are inserting something semi-into your ear but i suppose if it works for me thebehind the in-car charger totally eludes me with some previous plantronics ear pieces the ear piece was inserted down into the charger device which was then plugged into the car great program with this version the charger is tipped with a micro male fitting like on the tip of your finger and the female fittig is in the end of the ear piece which is then plugged onto the male fitting and the ear piece just wiggles and jiggles out on the end ridiculous how is that supposed to work do not plan on charging it while the vehicle is moving and do not slam the door getting out if it is parked on the other hand i guess it is nothing a littletape would not take care of good grief,184,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,1.0,negative,i purchased the plantronics 835 bluetooth with noise cancelling features about a month yada yada yada and i have not used it after the first week i find that has very poor volume on every call that i used it for and felt that i was constantly pressing the unit into my ear to even hear the person on the line point blank this unit needs to be 599 with free shipping for those who want to take their chances laughing out loud it was a bad choice for me and i have gone back to my older bluetooth unit even with the broken over the ear clip the 835 has a good price but not worth it,114,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,3.0,neutral,i bought this to replace a motorola bluetooth and found i did not care for the shape or the bulky feeling when i used it it did work ok but kept falling away from my ear,35,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,4.0,positive,i bought this because i broke off the jack plug on my wired headset and this one was recomemnded for use with the dell venue pro it works well but the clarity is not so good for the people on the other end of the call also it is clumsy to fit to your ear in a hurry so keep it on,61,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,2.0,negative,really thought this would be a great headset because of the dual mics the problem is that i can barely hear the person on the other end even with the volume all the way up it is almost like a loud whisper,41,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,3.0,neutral,this is my first plantronics headset and i expected more due to the great reviews from my plantronics-owner peers I have been through the jawbone gennum lg motorola and sound identification headsets the voyager 835 got great reviews on cnetcom and i did my homework with the technology but i would rate this headset as average the clarity of incoming voices is above average but soft my voice is muffled on the receivers end there is minor static that i first noticed during the silence of being put on hold but now i am aware of it all the time volume definitely needs to be louder conversation is fine in quiet indoor environments but i bought this noise-cancelling wind-stopping headset for practical reasons the noise-cancelling and wind-stopping technology is good for the person I am talking to however i keep having to ask them to repeat themselves because i can not hear them in windy or environments with a lot of background noise the usable range that the phone can be away from the headset is poor have it on opposite sides of your body and the static is deafening it is a fairly inexpensive headset so i guess you get what you pay for,201,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001HVWUDG,2.0,negative,overall this headset gets the job done if you need both hands but it does not go above or beyond a low budget headset if you are looking for quality this is not the headset you need if you just need a cheap headset there are many out there with the same quality and much less expensive stay clear from this one,61,14

Kindle_Store,B00C9TRH7E,3.0,neutral,it is hard to substantiate some of the material in this article-length piece but it makes for a fun story and is worth a read for those interested in the earps the old west and or ms marcus,38,5

Kindle_Store,B00C9TRH7E,3.0,neutral,it was actually pretty well-written the author obviously did some research although there were some historical inaccuracies after having reading so many versions from the earp point of view it was refreshing to get a female perspective,37,13

Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,1.0,negative,this book is written for ten yesr olds i am appalled at the lack of cohesive plot lack of real science except for a ten year old cartoon character aliens even calling the ai hal the only character with potential is shelley sorry but truly a waste of time,50,1
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,5.0,positive,first an alien spaceship then having a alien first contact situation the bad guys show up space battles ensue wow what a first contact,24,2
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,1.0,negative,hard to believe motivations for leaping into a civil war on some side or another weak character development too many unexplained and seemingly disconnected techs,25,3
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,4.0,positive,could have been a great book if the profanity was left out great story and very good writing reminds me of some of the great sf writers of the past,30,4
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,3.0,neutral,my one and biggest complaint are the numerous editing errors throughout the book the tale it is self is very well thought out yet the misspelled / used words distract from the overall enjoyment still worth the read,35,5
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,1.0,negative,this story is disjointed poorly edited and almost unreadable there is no story development and worse the story is totally unbelieveable,21,6
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,3.0,neutral,i liked the first book then the series changed into vampires and i am sick of vampire themes i think we need new bad guy or something,26,7
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,1.0,negative,i looked the title read the summery and thought seems cool but from the first page it was confusing it was horrible and just full of words like it wrote by a 5th grader,34,8
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,4.0,positive,seems like all the authors have suddenly discovered strong women giving them super reflexes a strong will and a devil may care can not loose attitude but a good read and fast paced i liked it alot,36,9
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,1.0,negative,no flow or detailed story line book lack depth and focus author did not engage the reader with any character build,21,10
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed the story overall and the universe in which it was set the technology was interesting and the aliens were original the characters were a little one dimensional but got the job done the author uses too many cliches and needs to try and stay away from predictable archetypes the editing left a lot to be desired but that is really no big deal and should be expected in a self published book i think the author has great promise and just needs to keep plowing ahead i will continue to read his work,95,11
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,2.0,negative,i bailed on this book when the first female character was introduced appparently what is important about the executive officer is that the crew thinks she is a lesbian there was no need to mention the putative sexuality of the male character only the female character i just can not believe in a universe where we can build starships and explore other dimensions but we can not introduce a female character without discussing her sexuality,73,12
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,4.0,positive,from the first page there was action along with dialog beginning to tie together character backgrounds with the overall story plot easy reading read every evening until i could not stay awake of course that means the next evening i had to back up a couple of pages and catch up again,51,13
Kindle_Store,B00BP0EZ3M,5.0,positive,great read from beginning to end tough to put down had to read it twice because i read it to fast the first time to fully appreciate,27,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006DI8FIW,3.0,neutral,i was hoping to receive an all-red bumper but the outer rubber was a bit lighter than the inner red it looked more of a light red / dark pink compared to the inner firetruck red thankfully the seller was understanding and sent me an all-black one instead,46,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006DI8FIW,1.0,negative,this case appears to be red on the picture and the title but when you relieve the bumper it is almost hot pink also the buttons on the volume and the lock fell off within the first day,38,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,not complete protection front plate cover will not stay on 3rd cover i purchased in last 4 months from 3 different people,21,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,i never leave reviews but i can not figure out how to contact the seller and am extremely unhappy i have now purchased two of this the first one broke after about a month but i figured it was because i was rough with it and took the case on and off a lot i decided to buy another one this one broke within a week i was sure to use extra care with it which i should not have to it is a case i wish i could find a way to contact the seller and get a refund poor quality for the price paid,103,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic case I have dropped my phone countless times and it is never broken also it keeps your phone safe from scratches and cosmetic damages i love this case plus it is pink I have never had a more protective case for a cheap price too at the at t store they wanted 6999 for this same case in black i paid 25 on amazoncom,64,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i bought this case because i had heard nothing but great things about them however i had mine for a couple months and i dropped it 5 inches onto a workout gym floor which are padded the top portion flew off and the bottom portion cracked i then called otterbox and they replaced it i had the second one for maybe a week before the top portion broke in the same spot the last one did so therefor i say this product is not worth the 30 bucks it cost,90,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,this case fits to the torch like a glove and does not hinder slider operation at all offers solid protection to the phone and looks great too am very glad i bought it and would recommend to anyone,38,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,i bought this case for my new blackberry torch i bought this case because it came highly recommended from the reps at the store i had it for less than a week when the top portion cracked completely in two and it is not like i dropped my phone or something like that it cracked after just carrying it in my purse this case is a cheap piece of crap that is not worth the money,75,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,we have had this case less than 2 weeks yesterday my daughter dropped her phone and the faceplate part snapped i will not purchase it again nor recommend anyone else purchase it,32,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i have read countless reviews knocking this case because supposedly the top cover breaks off easily as for myself i usually only use the touch screen not keyboard so this is not a problem for me as i hardly ever open the slide phone torch the few times i have although i can see how it is very fragile so i take precaution honestly for a case that is supposed to protect this should be an issue but i love thelook of it so i shrug it off overall the aesthetics are great but protection is subpar also the back is hard plastic which is not safe for gripping and can easily slip out of your hand,114,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,the product came as expected everything is fine the service is fast and satisfying nothing that i can complain about but thethenot as bright as it shows in the picture quite a disappointment,37,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i had to replace my previous cover because it was too smooth and i would drop my phone regularly this cover has a texture on the edges making it easier to hold on to when i am multi-tasking the cover makes the phone a bit bulkier but it seems necessary to have some protection on the phone i would rather a bulky cover than having to pay to replace my broken blackberry the hot pink girlyis pretty great too o,82,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i purchased this case in hopes to protect my precious new phone from my general clumsiness and constant exposure to hairspray however my hopes were promptly dashed a few days later when i put this case into full use i was unable to remove the tab-sticker from the screen protecting film and it 1 left tons of air bubbles under the film 2 left a ton of glue / paper from the useless peel tab sticker the next day my phone endured it is first drop and the tiny piece of plastic holding the cases faceplate to the front of the phone was snapped and no longer would hold on the following day the film peeled right off the screen and i was left with half a case and the most vulnerable part of the phone exposed sad day i wish something silicone could accommodate this style phone,146,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i have to treat this otter box with as much care as i treat my phone i purchased this otter box with the intentions of being a little bit more care free with my phone i knew that otter box carried that reputation because my mother has one for her iphone it is just not the same quality i giving it 2 stars because it is pink and looks good on my phone the back cover is sturdy and when the front piece of my case broke i got another sent to me with no hassle,94,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,i purchased this product for my daughter and she has been very pleased with it i was very satisfied with how my order was processed and mailed out quickly i would very much reccommend the blackberry torch otterbox,38,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i read several negative reviews about this case and how the front does not stay on i have had mine for over a month now with no problems what so ever i drop my phone a lot and am really glad i got this case the only reason i gave it a 4star instead of 5 is because there is no perfect product to protect a slider phone,68,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,i am a big fan of otterbox cases and i like that they have come out with a slimmer version in different colors this case was easy to install thanks to the how to video on otterboxcom and i love the screen protector the pink / white case looks great with my white blackberry torch thanks otterbox,55,14
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,3.0,neutral,the time hopping of the narrative is a little difficult to follow but the story is a good one looking forward to the next installment,25,0
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,4.0,positive,it is very easy to get the two chapter groupings backwards if one were to begin reading chapter eight without having read chapters one through seven the book would be a mess however if read in proper sequence this can be a thoroughly enjoyable experience,45,1
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,4.0,positive,well i must say that i am certainly not disappointed with this book i have yet to finish it but so far more than halfway it is a very impressive storyline the first book was very very good i was not as impressed with the second instalment chapters 7 back but this one has more than made up for the inconsistencies the technology that the author has dreamt up is phenomenal the twists that have occurred to date are first-class a score out of ten would have to be 9 and i have not finished the book yet well done steve,97,2
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,5.0,positive,i would move forward to the day when the next volume in the omniverse goes on sale i have thoroughly enjoyed all those thus far released and frankly i am fortunate i purchased the kindle format else i would needed to tape the bindings a good bit well done mr karmazenuk story has a great pace and solid alternate vision waiting with anticipation dan in chicago,66,3
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,1.0,negative,the first book was good and it is been nothing but a slow slide with the next 3 culminating in an epic fail in book 4 it is timelines have no flow from paragraph to paragraph let alone chapter to chapter,39,4
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,3.0,neutral,this book is hard to follow the chapters go back and forth in time without any way for the reader to figure out what is going on i assumed the authors were trying to simulate some types of alternate reality like what would happen if you went back in time and prevented your father from meeting your mother but the end result was just confusing still i will buy the next installment just to see what happens,76,5
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,4.0,positive,i bought both 1 - 7 and 8 - 14 entertaining i just like to finish a series all at once hate to wait 6 months and forget what happend before,27,6
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,2.0,negative,i 've enjoyed the other books in the series but not this one way to confusing the jumping around to different time points is a complete departure from the style of the other books there are some elements of this that i liked i really hope the conclusion makes this worth while but i 'm going to wait for some reviews also this each insallment should be given it is own name calling them chapters to is pathetic,77,7
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,5.0,positive,i have enjoyed every one of karmazenuks omniverse books the story is great the characters are memorable the insights into people religion and society are remarkable the description of future technology is thought provoking this book is engaging at every level due to the masterful blend of creativity and intelligence i find most fiction and especially most science fiction childish but karmazenuk combines imagination with insight to create truly credible entertainment some reviewers were confused by the fact that time travel might logically make it possible for a person or spaceship to be present more than once at the same moment if i travel to yesterday i might find myself if the two us then traveled to the day before there would be three of me if the reader allows himself a little imagination this book makes for a fascinating and thought provoking adventure that might change his view of the real world,153,8
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,5.0,positive,the other reviewers write of how hard it is to follow and that may be but by the end i knew what was going on and was glad at the glimpses of the past future version of the grandmaster it leads up to a wonderful cliffhanger which left me wanting more to find out more about this other tribe of el-ahur i personally can not wait for the next installment,69,9
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,3.0,neutral,series overall is pretty good this jumped around to much for me although will still read what ever other books come after,22,10
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,1.0,negative,what the heck steve loved the previous books but this one was hard to follow i mean i could not keep track of who is who and what age time dimension or whatever was occurring dude put markers or years every time you flip back and forth i do not know how you kept track as you wrote it i hope you conclude this series with clarity and resolution,65,11
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,1.0,negative,i have nowhat happened to this series book one and two were great but the authors have completly lost me with the aeons war chapters one through seven were werid but at least they made sense this book is very difficult to follow and to be honest is just not interesting the series is now way to focused on religion and not nearly emough on scifi skip this book,71,12
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,4.0,positive,liked the books and to understand them all the previous books must be read anyone with a bad memory will have trouble i personably would like to see the follow up book or books to come out a little quicker months or possibly years is to long would like to see how it all comes together good story line write faster,61,13
Kindle_Store,B008327Z6O,1.0,negative,i did not even get half way through this book and i forced myself to get that far i have nowhat has going on the problem is part confusing writing and part bad editing does not anyone read this stuff before it is published what a sad ending for me to a fun series I am out no more bye bye steve karmazenuk you had some really cool ideas sigh please someone let me know what happens to everyone in this book if any of you can figure it out thank you,89,14

Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,1.0,negative,barely worth reading and do not know how it managed to get published there is really nothing more i want to say,21,3
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,5.0,positive,this book was a rather good story and you will probably enjoy reading it it is very short but entertaining,20,4
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,3.0,neutral,i really enjoyed reading murphys law what got me was the way it ended it left me a bit irritated probably because i wanted more and it just ended abruptly i hope it does not take the author a long time to write the next book in the series,48,5
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,4.0,positive,the story seemed to be going along just fine then it ended i am assuming there is a next book that continues,22,6
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,3.0,neutral,i have to say the book did not finish i am assuming the series continues but it did not just stop on a cliff hanger it actually did not even really finish the last scene if it closed off a bit better i would have given it 4 stars,46,7
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,3.0,neutral,good plot characters are of full volume and passion too bad that the book is not finished I am so tired of continuous line of half-books it turns into really bad authors habit should the readers search for the scattered pieces all over internet forget it personally I had prefer to pay for the whole book your readers are not some dogs to be teased with a free piece of treat and be chained to get the whole meal shame,78,8
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,5.0,positive,i love the book but it was way too short and left me hanging i am looking forward to reading what happens next for echo and murphy,27,9
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,2.0,negative,the book was good but the fact that it stops right I am the middle of the story just ruins it for me but if you like that kind of thing go ahead and read it,35,10
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,4.0,positive,the storyline is somewhat disjointed but good enough for me to want to read the sequel also i prefer a longer story instead of short stories with cliff hanger endings,30,11
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,2.0,negative,when you read a book it has a start middle and finish not so with this book you do not stop before the story has some kind of finish it is like the author got tired of writing,38,12
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,1.0,negative,it leaves off on a cliffhanger in the middle of a really important part i personally hate when books do that especially when there has nothing stating that it is anything but a full story i would not recommend this one,38,13
Kindle_Store,B00HEWJO7W,3.0,neutral,good story but too many loose ends hated the ending what happened to sister and son did they reunite or survive,21,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,3.0,neutral,i love pink so of course i liked this case when i seen it online the only thing i really hate is the way it looks on the back of my phone it looks as if the phone is stuck to the case in some spots which looks like bubble and my phone has collected a lot of dust as well as dirt using this case,66,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,3.0,neutral,fast delivery came sooner than expected which was great the case is ok no problem so far thewas not two toned like in the picture although it looked like a dull pink,33,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,5.0,positive,received my case today and i am happy the material is flexible but seems like it will protect my phone well theis more of a neon pink than is shown in the picture but it is still a really niceand it looks good on my white iphone i got a good case for only 200,58,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,1.0,negative,does not look like the picture it is only pink and the red was missing better of buying in stores and being happy,21,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,5.0,positive,my aunt has a similar case for her iphone 3gs and after searching for hours finally found this one for my iphone 4 received it today and am very pleased the material is flexible but seems like it will protect my phone well and i love the ridges on the sides because i think they will help me keep a good grip on the phone have not had much of a problem with this phone but i was constantly dropping my previous one before i got a case on it theis more of a neon pink with a bit of an orangish tone than is shown in the picture but i actually like this better and it looks really good on my white iphone can not believe i got such a great case for two bucks,134,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,4.0,positive,very cute case fits perfect and the price was great thewas a little different then i expected but still like it,23,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,1.0,negative,i do not really like this case the pink looks gorgeous on my white iphone but the biggest problem was coverage and the way the back looked the case sticks to the back of my phone which looks really unattractive like a shirt sticking to a sweaty body as for the coverage on the phone it could be better it feels very flimsy but it is not all that surprising seeing as it was extra cheap i probably will not be using this case,80,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,4.0,positive,case feels nice in my hands and i can use all the buttons except the hold button ok the hold button takes some force to push down but you get use to it great case,35,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,1.0,negative,this case looks absolutely nothing like the picture what so ever thethe material everything looks way different does not even look like it will protect the phone it literally looks like something you can purchase at the dollar store no wonder it is only a dollar i do not recommend,49,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,2.0,negative,this case was just okay it would have been better if it was not hard to turn the phone off,20,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004RE2HS8,3.0,neutral,this looks and feels like the others i bought here on amazon but i already had to throw it away because the back side separated i have 3 phones all with different colors of the same maybe bought separately on amazon that have all been on the same amount of time,52,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,1.0,negative,when i put the case on wrong i tryed to snap it off and the whole case broke could i get another one for free,25,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,4.0,positive,at first had little difficulty snapping the lower part of the cover once i figured out fits and i am happy with this product so far,26,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,2.0,negative,the case fit well but first time the phone dropped the case broke it did get her on time not worth returning,22,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,5.0,positive,this case is really nice I have got alot of compliments on it only thing the rhinestones are falling off of the case they fall off very easy just putting the phone in and out of your pocket,37,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,3.0,neutral,it does not look like the picture it has all the bling but it does not appear to have any design to it there are no differnt bling colors or the zebra pattern,33,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007X90DNK,5.0,positive,I am so happy with this it cost way less than my phone so it is a good investment to protect my phone/11 do not have to worry anymore,27,7

Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,1.0,negative,a waste of time this book was lacking from beginning to end do not waste your time reading it it is very poorly written,20,2
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,2.0,negative,this book content very short stories literately the first story is my favorite among all i was a little disappointed when i realize those stories are just basically sex focus i do not care to read sex book but just make a complete story long or short i do not care about it,51,3
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,4.0,positive,this was a very good short stories this is my first time reading this author this is a well written group of five short stories with nothing in common except the consenting adults theme i liked all the stories but other then that the stories is really creative i see these four separate stories as a start to their own novels the bonus story was a surprise it have a great plot the cliffhanger had me wanting more,78,4
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,2.0,negative,this book was good to read once the book did not keep me to theof my seat if you have time and the book is free this book will pass time,33,5
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,2.0,negative,there is not much i can say about consenting adults it was not poorly written nor was it overly graphic i just did not enjoy it for whatever unfathomable reason i have most certainly read more riveting and consuming stories perhaps it will be your cup of tea or perhaps you should look for other better work by lopez,57,6
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,3.0,neutral,half decent plots thin some good erotica in some stories all in all not a bad read good way to pass time,22,7

Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,5.0,positive,in this very sexy and arousing book you get to meet some very sex driven and naughty characters say yes and you fall into the acts of pleasure and promise definitely a page turner,33,12
Kindle_Store,B00CKH0X2G,1.0,negative,looking for a good romance novel skip this,8,13

Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,5.0,positive,this had a good spin on the shifter romance genre definitely interested to see what will happen next in the series,21,0
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,1.0,negative,i wanted to give this free kindle book a zero how did this author come up with this storyline poor character development and editing this author is trying to make money off the readers both of the character are unlikeable this was another free book i left on my kindle and i should had press cancel,56,1
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,4.0,positive,i liked the book i thought it was nice love story i will get the other books to see how it all play out,24,2
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,4.0,positive,i was reluctant at first when i realized this was a love story about a wolf but it turned out to be pretty good,23,3
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,not what i expected would not buy the second book for nothing this was a total waste of time and reading,20,4
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,this was a different would like to read more,9,5
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,5.0,positive,this author has really out done it and all of her books good read with interesting characters can not wait to read the next installment,24,6
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,recently i have become a big fan of paranormal shifter romances but somehow this one just did not do it for me maybe it was the whole taking of drugs to become a wolf because you are bored with regular sex kinda turned me off,44,7
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,4.0,positive,i took a chance on this book because i love the vampire series so far so i decided to try this out well it was a nice change from the normal wolf storyline but a few scenes had me a bit iffy i will not give too much away I am just saying it seemed a bit wrong at first i liked camille and richard but i felt like a little something was missing i got more out of her sweet but nutty best friends I am definitely going to see what happens next with this couple i just hope there has more to like about them next go around,106,8
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,i will say that this was a different type of shifter book usually shifters are born or created by experiment but this is the first one i read that person created a shifter in himself with serum i enjoyed reading the book and will be looking for part 2,49,9
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,1.0,negative,it is a different approach but i would not recommend this book to anyone save your money and buy something else,21,10
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,4.0,positive,love shifting books a very good book,8,11
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,quite different from what i expected for interracial romance,9,12
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,5.0,positive,this was not the normal alpha wolf story but i loved it new to me but very erotic and exceptional in it is own way,24,13
Kindle_Store,B00GZAZX2O,3.0,neutral,this was a hot read I am not sure that i liked the whole wolf thing since it was off the normal route of paranormal for me it crossed a line that i probably will not read part two,37,14
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,3.0,neutral,i cried a lot in the first part of the book janes death is heart wrenching to watch i would have loved this book so much better if there had been a true conflict yes mrs bennett needs a good smack but it is not enough of a conflict i can not remember a climax in the story,56,0
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,4.0,positive,after reading pride and prejudice by jane austen i can see how this book could be a very believable variation although a very sad one i enjoyed the book very much it is like no other variation i have read to date,42,1
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,3.0,neutral,and a long year it is darcy resigns himself to being elizabeths caretaker as she mourns janes death not a lot of romance I am still not sure why there was such detail paid to describing the coffin body preparation and mourning rings it was a bit creepy it is easy to see why darcy would take responsibility for elizabeth he loves her by then but a bit harder to believe that she would go off with him and bingley after the estrangement from her family rather than go to the gardiners a little more romance and a little less mourning and it might have have gotten the fourth star,107,2
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,2.0,negative,too much misery and misfortune the characters cry way to much and are far to depressing but have no emotional depth i expected a more tender and happy romance in place of janes death it was struggle to finish this and was not worth it i want my money back,50,3
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,2.0,negative,even although theof the book is intresting i think many austen fans would agree that the characters lost that passion they should have it was cold and spoke too much of the pain they felt and not enough of other feelings mrs bennett seems cruel intstead of just silly it is not a book i would recommend too any p p fan,62,4
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,2.0,negative,this book has unrecognizable characters and awkward wording it is sad and melodramatic there is no real way to see a relationship developing between darcy and elizabeth it seems to defy conventions of the time fanny bennet is cruel and not simply silly how can she walk over her husband so why is he so weak elizabeths relationship with the gardiners is not developed as that is a place she could have gone so much does not make any sense book ends abruptly with sudden happiness but fanny remains a villain dialogue is weak and elizabeth is a weak character skis bingley,102,5
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,1.0,negative,i have read a lot of p p alternates and continuations but this is one of the fortunately few that i could rate it so low too much misery and not enough of the true spirit of elizabeth bennett she would not dishonor jane in the way she acted in this story,51,6
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,5.0,positive,i am a fan of jane austens books and i also like the alternate takes on the romance of elizabeth bennet and fitzwilliam darcy they usually not an improvement on the original but they are fun this book is no exception it is well written and the characters are plausible they are taken to a logical place implied but not reached by austen mrs bennet is taken afurther away from being a self-centered histrionic to a malicious termagant this is not really a stretch mr darcy is the unprideful gentleman he becomes at the end of the original from the time when he first starts to admire elizabeth in pride and prejudice elizabeths unlikely infatuation with wickham never occurs and she is affected more intensely by her mothers spite and less intensely by darcys careless slur this book is a lovely conceit which i highly recommend to fans of the romance,153,7
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,5.0,positive,i read this when it was a work in progress on an online jaff forum it is one of the best variations i have ever read and i have now read hundreds of them if you are looking for an exciting out of the box read try this one it is really very good but do not take my word for it download the sample and try it first i think you will agree that it is worth a read,80,8
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,1.0,negative,it is amazing how a novel so full of misery for p ps beloved characters can be so lacking in emotional depth i suspect this was written by a computer and not a person,32,9
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,4.0,positive,what a sad and emotional story it was beautifully written the plot was full ofand downs and i could not keep crying i did not like this mrs bennet at all she was a really bad mother it took a long time for darcy and lizzy to have happiness i need my tissues again just thinking about it lewis do keep writing maybe write something less sad next time i do not want to spend money on buying tissues I had rather use it to buy your books,86,10
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,4.0,positive,i liked this story very much i read it in one sitting and reread much of it the next day there are a few issues that could be worked out better i would have liked to have seen more of elizabeths fight come out i did not find mr bennets reason for caving to his wifes unreasonable demands believable so i would prefer a better reason also i would have expected the gardiners and lizzys sisters to take more interest in her this could have added some additional conflict and tension to the story finally i think a real confrontation between elizabeth and her mother in which some kind of resolution occurs would have added to the story immensely,119,11
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,1.0,negative,I have read at least 100 p and p variations and enjoy visiting my favorite literary characters but the lizzy and darcy not to mention bingley and georgiana in this book bear absolutely no resemblance to jane austens beloved creations her lizzy would never have wallowed in self doubt and despair and her darcy was no wimp save your money imho,61,12
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,5.0,positive,love the premise great story heartbreaking as elizabeth loses not only her dearest sister forever but also her father and her home that mrs bennet can blame elizabeth for everything is devastating if the sky turned purple i am sure mrs bennet would blame her for that as well,49,13
Kindle_Store,B007Q2ZKD2,5.0,positive,i loved this book when it was being first written jane catches a cold and has to stay at netherfield as is mentioned in jane austens book unfortunately it turns out to be more that a trifling cold it becomes more influenza and the pneumonia poor jane seems to get worse and worse all the time lizzy is looking after her elder sister and is blamed by her mother for not looking after her properly eventually jane dies and elizabeth is cast of by her family it is such a sad story in many ways but has a wonderful happy ending it is a lovely story and i would recommend it to all jane austen lovers,116,14
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,5.0,positive,the best part of the previous game were the ship / pirate adventures and that is all this game is i rarely do the actual story just cruise around stumbling on to hidden missions i love when the crew starts in on their shanties highly recommended,44,0
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,5.0,positive,excellent historical music from an excellent game not commercialized and very much as it was intended to be heard without musical accompaniment,22,1
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,4.0,positive,i love the shantys the sailors sing on the ship in the game while looting and pillaging on the high seas unfortunately both of the sea shanty editions are a mixed bag you will get some of the acapella on-the-ship songs but also some of the songs you hear when you visit the pubs in the game those songs have instrumental backup some are sung by women and some are in languages other than english i like them all but wish I had known ahead of time that there was a mix of the two on each disc i also wish that there was a disc with just the on-the-ship shantys but if wishes were fishes we would all be pirates yar,119,2
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,only has a few actual songs from the game what songs that are included are not bad although just not quite what i expected,23,3
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,let down i bought it before even reading the play list it is got a couple good shanties but it is missing most of my favorites it is actually missing most of them not bad but not great,35,4
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,it was a good album but only 25 total minutes of songs makes it almost not worth it the y should have put all the shanties on the album,29,5
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,2.0,negative,there has only a few of the good shanties on the album and it is only 16 tracks they could have put all of them on the album especially since most of the songs are only a minute plus in length,39,6
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,loved the game loved the music i guess i would have liked this to come with all the shanties in the game not just a select few,27,7
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,1.0,negative,unfortunately this album does not contain all of the shanties which is a shame since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to our cadences since this album does not contain all of them here is the youtube video with 35 of the 36 shanties [ ],60,8
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,5.0,positive,this is a beautiful soundtrack to match a beautiful game the sea shanties get easily stuck in your head and you can almost feel yourself on a ship in the 1700s when you listen to them,36,9
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,like most of the other reviews I am going to highlight the fact that this only has 16 of 30-something shanties from the game major bummer prolly only the ones they got the proper licensing or permission for my hopes is that they will add a patch version of sorts to make up for it later on same thing happened with the lollipop chainsaw soundtrack very anticlimactic compared to the amazingness of all the songs you hear during gameplay i ended up just buying all the songs individually luckily amazon mp3 has this album for rightly an inexpensive price and i think it is worth that much they also have a great selection of sea shanties in general so just search that and you will come upon some great old classics too,126,10
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,5.0,positive,i did not think I had ever grow attached to another ac character after ezio died and conner well sucked i was wrong this game the plot the action the characters and everything about it rocked,34,11
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,a solid score with a few memorable themes that pop up several times some use of electronic music and electric guitar help convey the feeling that nothing in an assassins creed world is quite real while also injecting the score with energy and momentum when it needs it about half the tracks feel a but like filler more ambient type stuff that serve perfectly well in the background of your island hopping but maybe not necessary to keep on the album the real treat for me was the collection of sea shanties on disc two which seem very authentic so much so that I am curious if they were sourced from real sea shanties of the time period,117,12
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,1.0,negative,nowhere near enough sea shanties on this official sea shanty edition the shanties and tavern songs are what give black flag it is soul and without all of them this edition feels hollow and quite frankly insulting ubisoft could be raking in the black flag doubloons hand over fist with a complete edition of these wonderfully crafted shanties and tavern songs bottom line not worth the 8 dollars,67,13
Digital_Music,B00GATDL7O,3.0,neutral,i love the soundtrack to this game i really do I am really disappointed that even on the so-called complete edition we still do not get all 35 shanties in one place fortunately the companion app on the phone makes me download them to the phone in order to hear the songs so i have a collection of all but the one shanty we have not yet found that will be remedied soon enough,72,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,3.0,neutral,very good cheap case for the iphone it is protected my phone so far do not really drop it much but when i did it did not break,25,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,looks great and has a nice snug fit on the phone great buy and i will be looking to purchase more colors in the future,25,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,this is a beautiful case but it did not fit my apple iphone at t i will have to give it away it was a good price but i was very disappointed i actually have a 3 with 4 capability which they should not have given me when i renewed last year stupid me did not know any better what to look for so i was taken for a ride i hate that casecrown exo case for apple iphone 4 and 4s at t sprint and verizon compatible silver / black,88,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,this thing fits great really sturdy will buy again in differentmy wife loves it and she is really picky,21,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,3.0,neutral,as is everyone else i was looking for that perfect case for my iphone 4s i wanted something to protect the glass from getting scratched front and back while being slim enough to still fit in my pocket and have some grip this does that however there are two things that keep me from really liking this case one is the back has a peak down the center which prevents it from laying flat on a table or desk this will allow the phone to move around if you try and use it while laying on it is back the second problem and the bigger of the two is the flash back when using the camera with the flash there is a lot of pick up that really washes out the picture forcing you to have to remove the case if you want to have good pics the case is ok and some may not mind these issues but i have already ordered another case in hopes of getting what i want out of one,174,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,2.0,negative,the plastic around the volume buttons broke off do not drop it because then the clips inside the case will break and the case will not stay on not very protective for your phone if you take a picture with flash remove the case or your pictures will not turn out good,49,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,i love this case this is my 3rd one and i always go with this one i am very hard on my cases i drop my phone often which is why i am on my 3rd one and the phone still looks brand new the corners of the case chip and scratch but take a hard beating it eventually will chip off a whole piece and does not click together to stay on but they have lasted me many months each i do not like the otter box because it is too bulky this is slim and very protective,101,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,2.0,negative,I have had case crown covers on my 3gs for years and got great results then i got this one for my 4gs i broken the bar on the front bottom so i ordered one more needless to say that one broken right away also so i broke down and got the new otter box,54,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,i love this case I have had it on my phone for about 2 - 3 months and i always get compliments on how nice it looks it is very sturdy I have dropped it a few times i would definitely recommend this case,39,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,3.0,neutral,this was a cheap case i purchased for someone else they seemed to like it a lot it is better than not having any protection,24,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,i had this case since early november of 2011 since then my phone has gone through lot of traumas falling on an asphalt dropping on my desk dropping on living room wood flooring and more every time these traumas occurred this case did it is job and it did it well the case took the impact on every fall and my phone especially the screen was never damaged just a heads up this case is not perfect as other reviewers mentioned after awhile and few drops left-top corner does not snap in 100 paint fades here and therebut i consider those as normal wear and tear left-corner not snapping in 100 will not compromise the integrity / sturdiness of the case so after 8 months of use and abuse I am happy with this case and glad that i bought it [ watch out for those cheap generics ],142,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,i returned this case it was very flimsy i was afraid to even use it in fear it would not protect my new phone,24,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,good slim case for my iphone 4s does not add too much bulk and has good access to all ports and buttons the case also has a rubbery feel to it and slips in and out of the pocket easily multiple colors are available to suit your taste,48,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,there are millions of case options these days and this one does a great job of protecting the phone when dropped I have dropped it with this case at least 5 times and it never came apart or cracked it is also pretty thick which I am not a huge fan of i prefer cases that are slim and have a bit of a rubberized coating to prevent it from slipping out of my hand in the first place overall if you like the looks of it then it is a great buy,89,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,i bought this case because it looks really cool but within days of using it the bottom piece broke off in my pocket and couple of days later the side broke while i was trying to remove it to take a picture because the flash reflects from the case and flushes out the photo do not waste your money on this case,61,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,2.0,negative,i had to dump my ottor box and found an optional case that still does not fit correctly when you put your phone in the case it is so tight it turns you volumn all the way down really needs cutouts for the volume buttons the charge cable winf fit my phone with the case so i have to use it no protection the charge plug is oversized so i have opted to turn the phone over 180 degrees and use my charge cable bad design,85,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,3.0,neutral,bought this with all of the other toys to go with my new s4 the case i bought will not even come close to fitting into this thing even with the insert removed it is so far from fitting it is as if they sent me the wrong part the only case that i have that will fit this case compatible thing is the micro thin silicon case i got free with my phone and that i have to cram to get in it to be clear that is with the insert removed I am going to test it with the insert in to see if the phone alone will fit brb well it fits without a case why i did not see more reviews warning of this i will never know,132,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,4.0,positive,works well but a bit bulky for travel i do not use any sort of case for my phone so this works fine there is a removable shim that allows this to work with an s4 in a very slim bumper style case i use this when I am on business trips so i can use my s4 for gps navigation in a rental car disassembling this to put it in my knapsack results in a pile of bulky bits that are awkward to handle the only quality problem I have had with this is the rubber pad in the gripping arm was not well glued in when the mount arrived and i lost it for a few days once i found it under my floor mat i reglued it and I have been happy since if you get this check that first,139,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,2.0,negative,returned reasons not case compatible it fits extremely tight right onto your non-encased phone only from the ad / pictures you do not see that it does not clip into your phones charger jack when you place your phone into the mount as in my opinion good mounts do meaning you take your case off put your phone into the mount then you have to fumble with a power cord that is behind your phone now to get into the side of your phone so that it will charge my suggestion get a phone mount that when you close the mount automatically plugs into your phone as many do it is way more convenient than this mount,112,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,3.0,neutral,my previous car mount was designed so that when you placed the phone in the mount it sat on the charging pin you were able to lift the phone out to answer a call this mount has a cord that you have to plug in once the phone is in the mount the cord is about 2 inches long impossible to disengage while driving,64,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,1.0,negative,no where in the description does this say this is a cheap aftermarket product all it says is samsung galaxy s4 car mount implying that it is a samsung product i was shipped a generic type mount by encased with a sticker on it that says for samsung galaxy s4 really disappointed in amazon for false advertising i was expecting a mount made by samsung the one i had for my original galaxy phone was top quality this is just a generic plastic mount,81,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,5.0,positive,works great i have no complaints about the device granted i have a larger case so i have to remove it every time i use this but no big deal,30,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00CWL34IK,5.0,positive,phone fits in it really securely usually an aftermarket gps mount is just barely usable and i start counting the days until the manufacturer releases a good quality one but i was surprised by this mount because the build quality is above many others I have owned including many of the ones made by the manufacturers,55,14
