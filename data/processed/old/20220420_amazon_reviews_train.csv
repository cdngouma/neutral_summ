AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,the bandit would not stay put at all how could it help my lower belly when it kept riding up to the smallest part of my waist it was really frustrating i still wore it for about 4 weeks but measured my lower tummy weekly and it was not getting any smaller so i finally gave up it also got this permanent fold in it that would not go away i suppose if you have zero curves and definitely no butt it might work but it did not work at all for me,88,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i am wearing my bandit now it made my belly get back to it is shape sooner by supporting weak muscles and pushing it it worked for me do measure yourself i have the xsmall even my clothing is xl,39,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i was so excited to get to order this while i was still pregnant and planned to use it from the day of birth thru 6 or 8 weeks i was quite disappointed when it was far from fitting me at the hospital i ordered a cheaper abdominal binder off amazon after a few days of the bb still not fitting me it was great 4 days later i was able to get in to the bb and i was excited to switch I have been wearing the bb for 3 days now and i am still quite disappointed in it it bunches and rides up my back making it completely noticable under even jeans and a tshirt it is incredibly uncomfortable more so than just squishing all my insides laughing out loud I am constantly pulling it down and almost have to re-do it every time i sit / stand up i will say that it does seem to be working with the squishing the belly back down but so did the much cheaper alternative and it was actually semi-comfortable i would definitely recommend the cheaper belt over this one to any of my friends,189,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i was very skeptical about purchasing this but since i needed results fast since i was a bridesmaid in a wedding 2 months post partum i thought i would try it after only one week of wearing this i was able to fit into a few pairs of pre pregnancy jeans and back in my pre pregnancy shirts i am not joking either this product did the job it claims to do it also provided excelent back and tummy support needed after delivering a baby i felt great it is also helping with my stretched out skin and stretch marks i can not say enough good about this product my only gripe is that it buckles and creases after wearing it 24/7 and after washing it does not uncrease oh well it still did it is job and i have confidence only one week post partum get it,144,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i ordered the xl in the belly bandit because that is the size i normally wear when not pregnant i am 510 and an athletic build with a larger bust i felt like i could not get the bandit tight enough to suck me in and it made me really hot i do not know if it is because the belly bandit uses velcro but i just did not feel it was effecient at what it was suppose to be doing i thought my spanx did a better job at holding me in than this and was easier to move around in i think i wore it twice and was over it wasted my money,112,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i bought 2 bandits one small and one xs i worn the small for the first 4 days after delivery 41 inch waist just before labour then i moved on to the xs after 9 days my stomach was flat it is now been 12 days since my baby was born and i have 2 inches to go to get back to my pre-pregnancy waist size 26 inches i found this product very comfortable to wear even to sleep in it is ok to wear under loser fitting clothes but shows under tight shirts,92,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i bought it for my sister and she loves it even thou i did not know much about these things but she mentions that it is a great product very soft not scratchy and make her feel very comfortable,38,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i bought this bandit in the hopes that i could wear it as described the box says to wear it day and night except to shower well it dug into my ribs when i was sitting up in bed nursing and it rolled up under my clothes so it became impractical to wear all the time eventually i just began to forget wearing it so i basically wasted 4500,69,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i want to love this product as i had such high hopes for it based on other reviews I have read however i have tried to use this for a few weeks now and it is just not made for tall women the band does not cover the area it needs to in order to be effective if i wear it low it gives me major back fat and if i wear it high my lower abdomen is completely uncovered i would not recommend if you are tall or have a long torso i am 510 fyi i did buy the correct size i checked it on their website and contacted their customer service department to be sure,113,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,waste of money I am hourglass shape trying to get rid of the post baby belly budge and this thing just kept migrating to right under my boobs so uncomfortable how do they claim this is for an hourglass shape no way it is horrible sitting while wearing this only buy this if you have no hips,55,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,extremely uncomfortable tried two different sizes but could not wear it for more than 10 minutes at a time it either pushes extra fat out the top or bottom and pinches when i try to sit impossible to nurse while wearing I shall just stick with the eating right / working out to lose the gut which appears to be working fine,58,10
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,sizing on this is completely off does not fit at all did not gain any weight during my pregnancy and had my baby 14 weeks early and still did not fit into the size they said i would,36,11
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,followed the sizing chart diligently and bought it for postpartum by the time it was time to put it on it was too small and i could not return or exchange it if you decide to buy this wait until a week after you give birth,45,12
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i originally purchased thisin a size small but come to find out only after 24 hours i really needed a size extra small i really love the results I am getting from this product but there are a few things about it that are a bit annoying the material is nice and firm which makes the product really have great results but as your waist is smaller than your rib cage area and hips the band will fold once it folds it has a permanent fold in the band every time you wear it this fold will be present which causes the band to slide up in the back above the butt i continue to wear it but i am constantly pulling it down in the back and it will immediately move right back up my waist line is great just 4 weeks after childbirth i give a lot of credit to this product and breastfeeding but there are just a few annoyances you will have to deal with fyi i wore this 24/7 except for when i showered,180,13
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,shipped quick and product was just as advertised giving 4 stars for the band itself it is grear as long as I am standing and moving but if i sit or lay it rolls up and is difficult to reposition especially if you have a newborn in hand,46,14
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this did it is job but maybe i expected more it creased right away and the creases never straightened out so it stopped serving it is purpose almost but it did help when i wore it several hours a day i was only able to get about one month use out of it,51,15
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,helped me with lower back support after giving birth highly recommended,11,16
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,really helps my stomach to feel tight and help my stomach to look flat,14,17
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i got this for my girlfriend because it was on her registry she loved it,15,18
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I am 2 weeks postpartum and bought this for the flabby tummy i have wide hips and a smallish waist and this thing just will not stay in place every time i sit it rides way up and even bending causes it to slip I have had it one day and think I shall have to return,53,19
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,great belly wrap it does the job you shall see progress in a few days for me i wore this 3days postpartum it did help shrink my tummy in less than a week but then after that it just stays that way there was no more additional progress good quality wrap as well but i think price is too much for something u will only use for say about a month well depends on every woman this is my review,79,20
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i felt this product ran a little small but it is supposed to be tighter i slept in mine a lot but i found myself waking up in a dripping sweat so i would not recommend wearing at night great to wear around the house and helps things tighten up a bit after the trauma of giving birth,57,21
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,really helped me with my diastasis recti after i had my baby helped so much with back and belly pain from sore muscles after delivery sizing was spot on,29,22
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,returned i purchased as a gift and the person did not want,11,23
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i ordered large a small was delivered i returned the product if a company can not get this one basic process correct then i am not wasting anymore time on them in the end i was better off not using the band my muscles seem to have recovered pretty well after my cesarean operation the band seemed pretty sturdy but was almost too thick to be comfortable under clothes,68,24
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,cinched ok when not sitting or bending rolled up and gathered / bunched up quickly ok of you have no waist did not work for me at all,25,25
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I am 10 days postpartum with our second child and i can button my pre-pregnancy jeans sweet sizing note i was right on the border between two sizes so i sized down i had to wait a few days to wear it but it will be more useful to me in the long term,53,26
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,wife bought it and she likes it quite a bit,10,27
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this product futs great was very snug the first day but as it does it is job and my belly gets smaller it fits better and better,25,28
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i ordered this based on the companys sizing chart it ended up being a whole size too big after returning and ordering a small i had good results one con would be that the material creases easily and bunches up i ended up rotating the band so that the velcro closure was on the back and it helped somewhat,59,29
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,want to return it does not fit and you can feel and hearvthe velcro while wearing it,17,30
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,one of the reviews i read before purchasing was this stated that the fit was wrong if you use the sizing chart on amazon yes that is correct you will get the wrong size go directly to the belly bandit website and use that sizing chart and you will get the correct size i love this so far only had it for a few days but is helping my back tremendously,72,31
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i got an extra small since i was between sizes and this fit me a couple days after delivery i do not wear it all the time but i wear it while I am bed it feels really good when i wear it my backs been hurting after the delivery,48,32
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,so impressed by this product very comfortable and it really works well i did not start using it until 5 weeks pp but still feel it was worth the money,29,33
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,yes i had received a package but package was all open i am not happy about i think ais not a newi would like to return then i always buys onlime although amazon if you want me continue to buy then please unopened package or use,50,34
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i loved the material but the sizing is horrible i bought a large based on the sizing chart i was only about to wear for 3 days after now it is just too loose supports nothing,35,35
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,stretched out within the first week i wore it measured my waste correctly before i bought it and it was still too big within the first few days of wear,30,36
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,bought in large had twins too used one provided by hospital first week and then fit into belly bandit in a large one week postpartum now going on 2 1/2 weeks postpartum I am going to need to order size down this thing really works,43,37
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i had originally went to the belly bandit website for the sizing it fit just like it was suppose to snug but still able to be velcro shut I am so glad i bought it it helped a lot with core support once i delivered,45,38
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,wanted to love this and use it but it is not true to size runs small and it bends weird and does not lay nicely at all complete disappoinment,27,39
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i like this belly band a lot and the fit is snug but perfect for what i was looking for i really think this helps a lot with the postpartum healing process too i started wearing it on occasion right after i got home from the hospital from having my son although i did not have a c-section it really helped to reduce the pain i had from cramping in the few weeks after delivery and of course holds in all that extra baby fat and swelling that is still going down after birth my only complaint it that the seam is really thick where the velcro attaches which makes it hard to wear discreetly underneath tighter clothes,118,40
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i started to wear it two weeks after my c-section until i was about 3 months postpartum it most certainly helped get me back in shape quicker than i think i would have on my own people could not believe how quickly i was back to my normal size,48,41
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,worked well now i need a smaller size,8,42
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,my torso is a bit long so this creates a bit of a muffin top effect i guess if you are squeezing the fat it has to go somewhere right anyhow was using something similar from the hospital after my c section then stopped started having back pain incision pain and pain with stretch marks right under my belly button this added the support i was needing to aid in my recovery one week later and my core muscles are definitely strengthening my stretch marks are smaller and I am almost totally pain free i wear the band as often as i can even to sleep and work out wish i would have continually worn something post c section to aid in healing,120,43
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i really wanted to try this post baby but it was so awkward and uncomfortable i ended up returning it might work if you have a straighter build against hourglass i could not get it to close properly without either gapping or bunching i decided the money would be better spent toward some workout classes,54,44
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i really do not like this product it is too short I am 5 7 and it did not cover much of my torso it also is very hot it is uncomfortable and gives you a cylindrical shape with ni curves it also shows under clothing very easily the fabric creases like it said it would but in doing that it makes you look like you have really bad back fat rolls laughing out loud,68,45
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,expands soon could not use after a month i ordered small based on the instruction size chart and it become big after using less than a month i am really disappointed with this product my tummy still looks big and i could not wear the belt as it expanded and not tight enough i would like to get a refund or replacement,60,46
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,this thing is awful it is not long enough for my long torso so it either causes bulges of back fat above it between it and my bra or it fails to hold in the lower part of my belly it rides up like crazy it is incredibly difficult to close the velcro and have it aligned and it has creased making it very obvious under clothing,65,47
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,this worked great i will be ordering again if i get pregnant again i wish i ordered in a smaller size i was going back and forth between a medium and a small i got a medium I am 55 and weighed 160 at the end of my pregnancy the band was too big after a week postpartum and i switched to the bellefit gurdle the product is well made and as described,72,48
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I am a size 6 pre-pregnancy and only gained weight in the belly i thought a medium would fit according to the size chart but it did not fit after i gave birth it only went around my post partum bellu half way it is way too small,46,49
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,this was way too small and uncomfortable after my c-section i sent it back and continued wearing the wrap they gave me at the hospital,25,50
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,so uncomfortable if you actually have kids to chase around and breastfeed you will hate this thing not to mention it does not breathe and is super hot if you are in summer months or a warmer climate wish i could return it,41,51
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,wish it felt a little more secure but does the job i wish it was not so expensive considering how quickly it became too big yes i went by the suggestions in the measurement guide,34,52
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,this sucks i do not understand why they are so many positive reviews it is over priced and once you buy it you can not return it so you are taking a chance with the tummy band it sucks because of the material it is like plastic and it does not hold it is shape around your back and keeps crinkling you constantly have to readjust additionally it is not wide enough tto give you hip and tummy support which you need postpartum and i am 53 feet i ordered a medium and it fits good save your money and reuse the hospital provided bands or buy the sweet sweat band works just as good,109,53
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,sizing worked perfectly as described this was my first pregnancy so i have nothing to compare it to but i am so glad i bought this and used it postpartum i think it definitely played a large role in being able to return to my pre-pregnancy body i was able to return to pre-pregnancy jeans less than a week from birth,61,54
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,was unable to use and unable to send back which i was not aware of if you have a c section you will need the bamboo one,27,55
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i bought this for post partum and wore it the day after i gave birth my stomach shrank really quickly so i soon outgrew this it was ok the first few times i worke it but then it became too big and started bunching around my stomach worked well for a while,52,56
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,ordered size xs per sizing chart and it is too small for me 2 days post partum would like to exchange for small without having to buy another but because i bought it in march i can not exchange or return it,40,57
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,ordered according to size chart i could not close it until 2 week post partum did not notice any significant difference with use,21,58
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,would not reccomend i was constantly pulling up on this and it never really worked i would stand up and the whole thing would be below my belly,28,59
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i realy do love it but i did recomand the smal and i received the medium and now i can not return it to get the smal,26,60
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i was a size 18 pre pregnancy and ordered the xl i ordered it a week after delivery and i have it as tight as it will go i feel good wearing it and nicely supported after wearing it all day i am ready to take it off at night i wore a support band in the hospital but it made my stomach so itchy the belly bandit does not do this I am glad i bought the belly bandit and i will be purchasing a size down to continue my recovery process,92,61
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,really helps keep things in check to work out and prevent further stretch marks,14,62
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i am rating based on looks alone because i did not have the opportunity to wear the product i measured at 41 weeks pregnant and was given a size to buy this was entirely too small the only reason i gave 2 stars is because the actual material of the product is nice,53,63
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,helps get uterus and hips back in shape,8,64
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,it is useless it does not help reduce any fraction of inch of my belly after using it for 3 months and it is very uncomfortable to wear,26,65
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,used this with my first baby and again with my 2nd works wonders if you wear it,17,66
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i love my belly band i feel so much better after i wesr it around the home it is very comfortable and flexible i would recommend for anyone looking to help that baby belly shrink,35,67
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,great product everyone keeps saying that they can not believe i just had a baby i used mine the first day i had my baby in the hospital it was hard to get closed but by day 3 when i was leaving the hospital it was the perfect fit I am 4 weeks postpartum now and still wear it i think it really does help there are so many gimicky products out there for post pregnancy but this one really does help and really does work worth every penny and i will recommend this to all my friends,96,68
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,stiff and uncomfortable very hot in the summer,8,69
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i had my baby 8 days ago via cesarean and this has been such a help i feel held in and my belly has drastically reduced in size much quicker than with my first I am able to use my abdominal muscles more and do not have to worry about straining my incision i highly recommend this,55,70
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,loved this and used it for the first 3 weeks but then bought the bamboo version which is much softer and easier to wear all day long belly bandit has great products,32,71
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i measured myself before looking at their sizing chart for 37 inch waist they recommend a size small so that is what i ordered after three days it was already too large to have lasting effects the band definitely works and i started using after two weeks of delivery i like to exchange for an extra small as i love the product and sent seller an email to see if i can exchange for an extra small and waiting on their reply will update you once i hear from them due to material band will crinkle but does not affect results,99,72
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i was pumped to get this and look slimmer it loses it is shape fast xl was too big l is not just right and medium is too small,27,73
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i had heard great things about the belly bandit but this was such a bummer it was way to small I am a size 4 6 waist 27 pre pregnancy and around currently while losing weight i know you are supposed to cinch this but you would need a tractor to get this thing to velcro together not sure who they are setting the small to fit,67,74
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,this is a post pregnancy must have began using right after having a c-section in the beginning i had to use all my strength to get the velcrow to touch but within a week i lost three inches this helps tremendously to compress the stomach and jump start your body to feeling somewhat normal again ended up using around the clock for about three weeks until moving to another product by the same maker as the belly bandit became to large it did not stretch out by any means my body just completely changed,93,75
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I am really bummed I have only worn it a few times and the material seems to have pulled in the middle causing an hourglass shape I am a pretty tiny girl so I am not sure how i could have caused it to do that,42,76
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,product runs small good quality and works great,8,77
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i started using at about 3 weeks postpartum i wanted to see what size i would need since i knew i would shrink in size pretty quickly and that was fortunate because i probably would have needed to buy two different sizes of the belly bandits i do have a bit of trouble sitting in it so i only wear at night when i sleep I have seen my tummy shrink a little bit so far will see how this works out but so far I am happy with it,88,78
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,do not waste your money on this one get the bamboo one instead i am 127 lbs after i delivered 4 weeks ago with a 28 waste i got the xsmall and it fits fine however it folds so easy and crinkles feels so cheaply made i got the bamboo one and it is so soft and smooth and much more comfortable to wear save yourself the money and go straight for bamboo style,74,79
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,amazing used this for post partum to get my belly back went from 39 in to 315 in in 2 weeks would defin8tely recommend started with a large and got down to a xtra small can not say enough to good things about it,43,80
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i love the first belly bandit that i got for right after the birth i wore it every day and it was wonderful i did not have one after my first kid and it felt like my guts were going to fall out of me every time i stood up this time with the belly bandit it was much easier to stand up straight even right after birth also my uterus contracted back to normal size in record speed my midwife was impressed my stomach also shrunk much faster and i am pleased with the results once i shrank down to the smallest the first bb would go i decided to get the next size down extra small this was a mistake even although the small is now too large it was time to give up and go for their corset the extra small just rolls up on itself and causes me to look all lumpy from outside my clothes so i can not really wear it anywhere besides the house and the way it scrunches up is uncomfortable,176,81
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,slightly large in circumference and a tad short for a girl my height 510 but overall a quality product,19,82
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,shrunk my stomach in half in a few days,9,83
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,worth every penny wore this for the first week after delivery of my first baby and saw huge results also definitely helped support my back which was awesome,28,84
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,after less than two weeks of using this as directed the band is constantly scrunching up in the middle and riding up the scrunching is so bad that there are now permanent ridges in the middle of the band i really wanted to like this and i think it was working well but i do not know that i can continue using it when it is this uncomfortable due to the bunching,71,85
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,just rides up again and again very uncomfortable to wear gets wrinkles in it the first time you wear it and they never go away i hated this product it did not do anything for me what a joke,38,86
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,if you are thinking about a large purchase a medium the quality of the product is excellent,17,87
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i wanted to love his product so badly i measured myself at 37 weeks and ordered it right away the moment i was able to in the hospital i put it on within two hours it had folded over and scrunched up and would not go back to it is proper position i also got the kourtney kardashian version which worked out a little better this version is not good for people with long torsos either the kk model later about 2 weeks of 24/7 wear before it just folded too much i looked slim in this while wearing it and almost bought into it too six weeks of round the clock wearing a belly bandit girdle and at 7 weeks the pooch is right back where it was these products are a hoax,133,88
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i had an emergency c-section and am thankful for this product it not only helped my uterus shrink faster but it decreased the pain i would just put it above the incision so it does not get infected i originally wore a hospital band and it infecfed my incision i definitely plan to use the band in my next pregnancy,59,89
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,must have for postpartum recovery i ordered 2 different sizes to keep wearing as my belly shrunk wore 24/7 starting day 1 after delivery the extra support felt great too,30,90
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,love this product just be aware i gained 33 pounds with my pregnancy i usually fit in a size small it took about a week for my stomach to slim down and than i could put on the belly bandit but I am glad i did not go up in size otherwise it would of been too big better to go smaller than larger,62,91
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this at all instead I had recommend getting the leggings from this company this band s extremely uncomfortable to wear it was hard for me to bend over because it was so thick and pushed up against my breasts when i sat down and when i breastfed my daughter in the summer definitely do not buy this wayyyyyyyyyy too hot for me i felt like it did nothing and due to how uncomfortable it was i rarely wore it i purchased it at a baby fair and i think it cost about 50 - 60 this was the only thing i splurged on while pregnant what a waste of money i could have spent on my baby,118,92
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,it did get an annoying crease in the very middle of the band within two days of use I am a135 lb before pregnancy 160 at 40 weeks and 58 with a long torso however the band is comfortable and easy to use at three days postpartum i needed my husbands assistance in order to be able to fit in it the next day i was able to put it on my self it works like a charm this was my second pregnancy and at 5 days postpartum I am wearing my size 4 stretch jeans i did not fit into my pre pregnancy clothes after the first child for about 6 - 8 weeks and i was 8 years younger then late20s now I am in my mid 30s and this is amazing to me when i went out for a walk with my newborn my neighbors could not believe how great i looked i do not wear it to sleep I am happy with the results I am getting,164,93
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,this is very comfy to wear all day and all night fit was great especially at first but after about 5 days this folds and bunches and really does not seem to function as intended anymore that is very disappointing considering how it was and also considering i was hoping to wear this 5 - 6 weeks I am not sure this will survive structurally for much more than a week and yes i have the right size yes I am a bit flubbery all the way around but this product is intended to be used post-pregnancy so the target consumer will be all of these things i expected better,105,94
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i was really excited about this product but i was so grossed out when i noticed it had a brown stain on the inside of the wrap,27,95
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i have had hard time with the belly bandit the s was kind of small and the m was big i have both,23,96
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,comfortable to wear wish it was wider hope to see some results just got it last week,17,97
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,waste of money even the small size is big and did not work for me save your money,17,98
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i can not believe i went through my first pregnancy recovery without this it is a must,15,99
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i ordered 2 after having my first child and i do not feel like it helped at all in shrinking my belly i follow the sizing guidelines and it fit fine I shall admit it was a good support garment because you basically have no core after childbirth and it is probably really beneficial if you have a c section i did not i was fortunate not have much of a belly after he was born in fact i think i have more of one now and I am not sure if it is because i did not wear my belky bandit for the recommended amount of time i was able to tolerate it for 3 weeks day and night not the 6 they say produces the best results it is stiff and does not move with your body it is difficult to wear under your clothes and does not stay in place it requires constant readjusting the worst was at night when it would slide up on my abdomen and squash my sore milk-engorged boobs my biggest complaint is it is not machine washable and if anyone else is like me it would get soaked during my delightful postpartum hormone sweats not fun,199,100
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i bought a lg initially and have ordered a m now i really am a fan of these received on time and as expected i would recommend i will mention that they do bend toward the top and bottom but i do not think they would be as comfortable if they did not,51,101
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,great for the first month post partum it is easy to put on and take off it is very comfortable and is not to tight that it would make you feel like you are compressed inside of it but tight enough to hold everything in place of course after a few weeks you might want to go tighter or use a waist trainer or something but post partum this one is great,71,102
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i had a size large from belly banditcom and this size medium was wayyyy smaller than expected it is smaller than the one from the webite,25,103
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,my wife loved it it was very comfortable and did exactly what she wanted it to it help get her baby weight off much faster she said that she was able to get back in her per pregnancy jean in a week and a half with our first baby she was not able to get back into her old pants for a long time after we ended up having to buy a smaller size after the first week because she was dropping the weight and hip size so quickly that the first one we got was too small right after our baby was born she could barely get the larger size on after the week and a half she was about half way through the smaller sized one,128,104
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,extremely dissapointed i started wearing this product immediately post-pardum first off it fit but a couple days later once my belly started shrinking it became to large also it was extremely uncomfortable every time i bent over you could hear the loud crinkling of the velcro embarrassing plus it was visible through all of my clothing and made my stomach look lumpy it was also difficult to put on correctly overall it was a waste of money because after a month i became frustrated and quit wearing it,87,105
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i actually bought mine at babies r us so i got to try mine on before i bought it i also tried on the babies r us brand but the belly bandit had way more coverage for sizing i went by shirt size pre-pregnancy i wore a large so i bought a medium so it would be a tight fit for better results i went on a protein diet and i have only been wearing it for a little over a month and i already need a smaller size it works really well just wish i could trade it in for a smaller size instead of buying a new one,110,106
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i always wear a small wore a small all throughout my pregnancy this was tiny had to return,18,107
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,really uncomfortable and bulky the velcro is annoying to mess with,11,108
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,started with a medium right after i delivered my baby and about 3 weeks later i ordered the small that i can now wear for the next couple weeks i was 150 when i got pregnant and gained 30 pounds and now i am 155 and the belly bandit really helped i still have a little pooch that will only go away with diet and exercise,66,109
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,a must have for every women who has recently given birth nothing short of a life saver,17,110
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i am disappointed by the product the way it sits you can see it under clothes and i do not like the way it fits i was really hoping i was going to love it,34,111
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,way too small and there was no option to change my size i was not happy about that i will be returning this,24,112
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,it pulls up in the back and it can get hot,11,113
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,so nice to use recovering from a c-section nice support,10,114
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,not comfortable at all not happy it is not smooth under clothes makes me laughing out loud bulkier,15,115
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i bought it tried loving it but it just does not work too well it is very rough and shifts up after a long time wear it did absolutely nothing for me,30,116
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i have diastasis recti and this helps me feel more stable and put together when I am working out however it is super hard to put on myself and would be better if there were two separate pieces that came across it gets bunched easily when i try to velcro it myself but it is fine if my husband helps it does not conform well to my body although and i get painful red lines at my waistline after wearing it for an hour or so i would also like it a lot more if it were longer and covered my torso completely,102,117
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,it cuts into my back and it does not fit right i can not wear it,14,118
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i was not able to use right after birth but i was able to use it by the next day it helped significantly with the pain associated with post partem contractions while nursing i made sure to have it on before nursing so i would be in less pain i did not have this device with my first two and i wish i would have it was not comfortable but it did the job i needed it to do,78,119
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this product really helps with support after giving birth it also helps to smooth and flatten the appearance of your stomach I am not sure about long term results because I have only been wearing for about 15 weeks my only complaint is the fact that you can see the place where the velcro crosses over in the front which you can then see underneath clothes,64,120
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,have had it on for a week and already notice my belly going down in size,16,121
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,way too small and very stiff and uncomfortable could not wait to take it off the first time i wore it waste of money,23,122
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i love these things i used one for about 6 weeks after delivering my youngest naturally and it really helped with my diastisis recti that never fully healed after my first i only wore it around the house because it did show under clothes but i did not leave the house much those first few weeks anyway he just turned a year and the mama bump that i sported after my oldest 8 is actually gone and i think my stomach almost looks like i never had kids i recommend it to all the mamas i know i received thisat a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review,110,123
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,worked great for 2 days now it is too big haha which i guess is not a bad thing i got a medium prepregnancy i was 120lbs i weighed 175 at the end and am just now 6 weeks post partum 145lbs the medium is too large now it is snug tightened all the way but not tight enough i will be ordering a small in the near future,67,124
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,it rolls up from the hips is difficult to put on by myself and is not hidden under clothing i think you could probably get the same benefits from a cheaper version this being my first baby i can not speak to if it helps more or not i do like the support it provided for my back and feeling held together,61,125
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i ordered an xl and it fit for a week belly bandit has a trade in program but i will not be using it after spending 50 i do not plan on spending more to size down when i followed the size chart,41,126
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,since i am currently expecting i am not able to use the product yet but wanted to give an overall feel for the product seems well constructed but very stiff expected the product to have a little give to it to make it more comfortable for using right after childbirth,50,127
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i wore this for 3 days after i had the baby and immediately the fabric would fold over in the back it was also too big to wear after the first week so now i have to buy another band to keep wearing it was definitely not worth the 50 i paid for it,54,128
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i had the size medium from my previous pregnancy and decided to get a small as well this time after two days i was able to fit into the small and my stomach is almost back to it is regular size it is recommended to wear this for 6 weeks which i do plan to do because it gives great support,59,129
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,great product wish someone would have told me about it immediately after having my babies not 2 years later,20,130
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i started wearing this the day after delivery this is my first pregnancy so i am not sure if it helped or not but it made me feel good that i was being proactive so quickly after delivery it is not comfortable enough to wear constantly but i found taking it off to nurse and sleep gave me enough break to keep it on the rest of the time i am 4 weeks post delivery and now only wear it a few hours a day i typically wore an xs-s clothing size pre pregnancy and in maternity clothes and the xs fits well,102,131
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,not worth the money shows from underneath your clothes and slides up better off with a corset,17,132
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,soon as i gave birth i put this on comfortable and helps with swelling,14,133
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,fits as described I am not sure how well it works because it was not comfortable enough or discreet enough to wear outside the house,23,134
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i love the postpartum support this offers it is great I am not sure how much it helped my belly shrink but the support was good only wish this was cheaper,31,135
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,reviews are right way too small and i do not know how i could even wear this all day material is so rigid and has no give which i understand why but i wish there was some elasticity in it will be returning this,44,136
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i found that the belly bandit was too stiff to be able to sit down while wearing i breast feed my little one and could not keep it on while feeding it is too much work taking it on and off with the frequency of sitting it does provide support when standing but could not make it work for me the return policy is not great i bought it ahead of time and by the time i got to try it i was unable to return it i would not recommend this product,88,137
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I have really loved my belly bandit I am four weeks post partum and my stomach has come back together nicely i followed the size chart on the belly bandit website and I am glad i did i almost ordered a medium because i was borderline small / medium when i initially measured but i went a size down good thing and actually i need an even smaller size I am going to borrow my friends extra small i worked out my entire pregnancy and went back to the gym after two weeks so i think my body shrunk quicker than most so those results may not be totally typical I had definitely say go a size down if you are in between sizes you want it to be tight my friend said her husband had to help her get it on the first few days having the support around your abdomen and back is really nice when your belly is squishy after birth,156,138
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i followed the size chart but could have gone a size smaller so that i would have more use of the correct size,23,139
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,bought this after reading blogs about binders it works great the website sizing guide said i was an xs glad i did not follow that advice everyday it fits a little better as my belly shrinks i try and wear it all day and night worth the investment,47,140
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,ordered based on the measurements on their website and it was way too small,14,141
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i am pregnancy size xxs 00 petite and the xs / s stretched out too much after less than two weeks so it was not worth what i paid,27,142
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,very uncomfortable hot and sweaty under clothing and bunches uncomfirtably when you sit down,14,143
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i like the product the only thing is that it does not stay in it is place and you have to accommodate it trough the day,24,144
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,it is to big should have gotten smaller size,9,145
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i have orders a few things that are belly bandit and been very happy love the mother tucker tank and the leggings but i do not at all recommend buying the original belly bandit i was hopeful it would give a little more compression and help with my stomach after having baby 2 but it bunches all over the place itches like crazy and hurts my csection incision it is also too large and i totally used the measuring guide i do not think this bad boy works and there has no way I had be able to wear it discreetly in public would love to be able to return it since after wearing a handful of times know that it was a complete waste of money,123,146
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,helped quickly bring my belly back to normal after giving birth,11,147
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in this product i had originally purchased the medium belly bandit for after my baby was born and loved it after 3 weeks it was too big so i decided to go ahead and invested in the small size because the first one was so great when i received the small belly bandit i was disappointed to find that the quality of it was not as high as the first one i had purchased it was made out of a much thinner material and was not as comfortable the tag was also not printed on the band itself like the first one and was constantly getting in the way of velcro the band wish i had not wasted my money on this one,127,148
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,so happy to have this after my first baby to help me feel more like me again,17,149
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,at first i was worried the size did not fit but after 2 days my tummy went down a bit and i was able to get it on i love it,30,150
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,it is perfect for tucking that extra skin from having a child,12,151
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,am returning this due to the size being way too small,11,152
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,way to small i did measurements before i had my daughter just as they said too tried to wear it and it is not close to fitting i wanted to return for a different one but apparently you can not return this i would not order until after baby of you may never use it,52,153
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,fits true to size and really helps comfortable to sir in,11,154
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,fit much smaller than expected and have to retur,9,155
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,it did not fit the first few days after baby came but having a c-section it was too painful to attempt to wear anyway i started wearing it at home after i was released from the hospital but it was very hard to sit in because it is so stiff i would get up and try to walk around for 15 minutes 4 times a day for a faster recovery and i would wear it during that time i do think it helped me get small faster i stopped wearing it after 2 weeks because i was almost back to my normal size except a remaining 10 pounds i will have to lose with good old diet and exercise all in all i think it did what it claims to do,129,156
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i liked this but it was way bigger than i thought it only fit for about 2 days i do however feel like it worked it also helped me feel less like a bowl of jello so i was active far sooner than i would have been without it,49,157
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,it is a really good band in my opinion i was a little worried about the size but it fit perfectly it feels comfortable even when i am breastfeeding my baby it feels right,33,158
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,it is a little tight to put on but that is the purpose it is actually quite comfortable too you will be able to see it under tight-fitting clothes but that does not bother me it helps with the loose feeling after birth,39,159
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,the belly bandit fits great but when you apply the velcro it ends up sticking crooked especially when trying to make it tight,23,160
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,this thing is amazing i had my second child a week ago and my belly is already fitting into my skinny jeans thar were tight before i got pregnant,29,161
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,love my belly bandit used it immediately after my c-section and it was a life saver helped tremendously with supporting my torso and back and my waist was back down to normal size within 2 weeks fits true to size chart great quality and very comfortable,46,162
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,first day i wore it i was 3 days post partum it was barley closing in less thana week it was too big it would close and be loose the sizing is very different going to purchase a medium but afraid it might be too small i wear an 18 in pants but my waist is small a large lasted me 3 days,64,163
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,it did not work for me my belly is mush and I am so sad i wasted 50 on this it might work for others but it did not help me since i spent the money i just wear it around the house but still no difference at all,48,164
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,this was a great belly band it really helped me a lot after i gave birth it felt like it helped to hold me together it is nice a wide so it gives lots of support it never irritated my skin of course wrapping a band around your stomach is not the most comfortable thing in the world but after birth it was more comfortable to wear this than to not,69,165
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i got the smallest size possible and it was to big after a week of wearing it but i just sewed it it helped me have a flat tummy after just 2 weeks post twins i highly recommend it to everyone that asks me how i got my flat stomach so fast,52,166
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,did not fit right away but now i can make it fit have only been wearing it a day but hopeful it will help me get back down to size,28,167
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,thought i would be a medium but based off other reviews i read i got a small glad i did two days post partem and the small will overlap by about 4 inches with 4 inches to go i felt a difference immediately in my back my mid section has felt a little gumby-ish since giving birth and the belly bandit has given me a lot of support back glad i purchased,72,168
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,seemed to do what it said it would do,9,169
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,belly bandits are a must have to help your waist shrink back to it is pre-baby position this band is very comfortable and easy to care for my only complaint is that i needed a smaller size after a couple weeks and they are expensive,44,170
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,stretches out quite a bit so if u think it is too small give it a shot anyway,17,171
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,this is way smaller than their site directs also is very uncomfortable did not use at all postpartum waste of money,22,172
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i bought this for post partum purposes over all i would not recommend this product the bands material is stiff and folds / buckles in areas when being worn which looks terrible under clothes also I am long waists and it does not cover my entire stomach it is cheaply made you would be better off getting spambot an simply wrapping an ace bandagearubd your waste,60,173
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,really helped with post partum healing not always the most comfortable on the skin so i wore it on the outside of shirt and it was perfect,27,174
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,the website suggested a large based on my measurements but it was too big once i returned it and got the medium the sizing was spot on,27,175
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,hard to figure right size material feels rough on skin bought mine and returned it,15,176
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,it does it is job decently to shrink your belly first weeks postpartum but i gave it 2/5 stars because it made my belly sooo itchy that after several weeks of wearing it i started wear it only for couple hours a day and now at 5 weeks postpartum i do not even want to wear it because of how uncomfortable it is also it bends really bad so it becomes really uncomfortable to move around i believe for 50 the material this belt is made of should be of better quality,89,177
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i would have given zero stars it did not fit worth a lick and did not have instructions in english not that it is not self explanatory or in spanish it did not even fit around my super skinny tween niece so how is it going to fit a new mama who just had a big baby this product was not at all what was described and i ended up returning it as soon as possible,70,178
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i love this thing it really helped me and made me feel comfortable after my c-section it was a little tender in the early going but over all this product was great,32,179
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i bought thisin anticipation to giving birth to my third child i had read a lot of the reviews and had heard great things about this brand in particular i was very excited to use it and hopefully see results i have been using it for three weeks now starting immediately after birth and I am extremely disappointed with it within the first week of wear it bunched up in back and has never been the same to the point where the crease is aso bent out of shape it is visible through clothing b painfully pushing into my back at this point it is so uncomfortable i can not wear it anymore and because i bought it before i gave birth it is over the thirty day return limit so that was basically 50 down the drain huge huge disappointment,142,180
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,helped me get back into fighting form in no time was helpful to feel strong again in taking care of baby,21,181
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i had to return it i know some people love it and it may be recommended for c-section but can i make a suggestion get one for free from the hospital i had a c-section and got a hospital grade one that is more stretchy but gives great support i would ask for two sizes one bigger one for when you are still there and a smaller one when your stomach gets smaller do not waste 50 buy some educational toys or books instead,84,182
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i had a c section this was just an awkward fit and sort of wrinkled and was hard to get on there straight and tight,25,183
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,went down a size in a couple days kinda exciting and frustrating at the same time i would need to buy 3 - 4 of these in each different size to use postpartum i would size down had great support,38,184
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i just got this today and i already love it i was using a stretchy band but i feel the bandit offers more support and you can adjust it when your stomach gets smaller you can see it under clothes but that is not an issue for me since I am a sahm the other band cut into me so you could see the fat bulge so i could not wear that one under clothes either my only issue with the bandit is the sizing i went to their website and used the size calculator it told me to get a medium but i only have an inch and a half left before the band is too big i should have gotten a small,121,185
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this is great if you wear a second compression garment underneath it because it has a tendency to roll it definitely served it is purpose but I have also bought a corset type waist cincher because i got a small and it is as tight as it goes also it is not very long so it is not compressing as much as I had like I am definitely glad i got it although,66,186
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,it definitely helped suck things in after my c-section not sure if it made things go down faster this time second baby but it was definitely worth the try it did feel nice because it felt like it kept my stomach from moving which is not always the greatest feeling the first 6 weeks after surgery my only complaint is it does bunch up a lot so you can not wear it under your clothing inconspicuously,75,187
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,at first when i tried this on i thought it was going to offer great support but within a few hours it was creasing and rolling up when i sat down it did not stay in place at all it did seem to support my back when getting in and out of bed the first few days but it was extremely annoying to have to adjust it every time i moved positions,71,188
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,came on time and as promised I had say that this is true to the sizing guide so make sure to follow that only downside is that it is sort of difficult to put on by yourself that said I had still buy it twice over i had a csection and the binding helped support me,53,189
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i wish i would have paid more for the bamboo belly bandit this one is extremely uncomfortable and itchy i could not keep it on for more than an hour at a time or i would break out in a rash,40,190
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i was concerned about fit bc i have a long torso it did fit as far as that goes i do not think it helped my belly pp def not worth the price,32,191
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,go down a size if you are near the lower end of the size range for your size i was within two inches of the low end and within one day i was at the end of the velcro,38,192
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,great product but stretches out easily wish i would have sized down for what was recomended,16,193
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,good for after having a baby slim up and tighten that belly back into place,15,194
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,the product is ok just that it folds a lot at the waist and back,15,195
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,felt like it did not fit very well bought the medium and I am not exactly a small lady but it was still too big after having my baby i ended up using it for some back support but that was about it overall just did not fit well,46,196
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,it was too small but i was sent the wrong size so now just waiting for my new one but loved the way it felt,25,197
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i just wish there was more velcro so you could make it very tight,14,198
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,bunches up more than the bamboo version helps with back support and compression although not to mention helping me feel less flabby and more like myself postpartum,26,199
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,fit perfectly i found that it fits better under my pants it does not move or ride up when underneath,19,200
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i like the concept but it did not work as well as i hoped it would ride a up i might have gotten it too big although,26,201
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,awful hard stiff and apparently you need to be 6 foot tall for this to fit I am 55 and this thing legit goes past my boobs can not even wear it,30,202
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i used this with my first pregnancy and it really works it can bunch up at times and be uncomfortable after wearing for awhile but the results are worth it because there is not much velcro you will end up having to buy a smaller size which can get costly i think i may buy velcro to sew on myself to try and make this one last,66,203
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,too big and i can not exchange it material is too stiff for my liking,14,204
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,purchased a medium per belly bandit website specs the band fit for one week postpartum and then was was too small and velcro would not catch tight enough i could have purchased several different sizes of another product for the price of one of these save your money and buy something else,52,205
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i wore the shrinxx first over the cpanty and the velco wore out so i decided to try the belly bandit at a local store they had the belly bandit made out of the organic material only in an extra small i tried the extra small and i could barely get it velcroed so i felt like i needed to get a small the small is almost too big which is frustrating i decided to save a few dollars and order the original i do wish i would have ordered the organic it was much softer than the belly bandit original also after only wearing it for one week the band has folded in half in the back and on the side which is quite annoying i do think the product works so i rated it four stars however i am not impressed with the quality of the original belly bandit,151,206
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i purchased before delivery according to the suggested sizing calculator on the website a couple of days after delivery it was hard to put on and seemed too small but a week later seemed like it fit just right fortunately i have not had to use much due to breastfeeding so i do not have a long term review,57,207
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,product as described and looks like it will be helpful once I have given birth,14,208
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i had ordered a medium through target and it was too big I am 54 and pear shaped 137 lbs pre pregnancy i ordered the small and put it on lying down and sucking it in with my husbands help I am giving this 2 stars because it folds up at the bottom and folds in at the waist and the front it does not move well with you you either have to be lying down straight or sit up straight in order for it not to fold best advice is to wear it backwards i wear this over a cotton tank top to avoid sweat i recommend not buying this and searching for a better postpartum wrap,116,209
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i really like this product seems to have worked pretty well for me seems like it fits a little big although i was a size 6 before getting pregnant with twins i bought a medium 3 days after the babies were born and it was too big i had to order a small instead do not worry they will not take items like this back for sanitary reasons but they did work with us about receiving a product we were in satisfied with,81,210
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,fits much better than the medela band that i used after a previous pregnancy easy to use and can feel a noticeable difference in lower back support,27,211
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,too small buyer beware when sizing they do not let you exchange,12,212
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,hate it do not waste your money on this it bunches up horribly,12,213
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,thank fo giving me my tight tummy back after baby wish it was more convenient to wear but boy does it work,22,214
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,my measurements had me between a medium and a small so i opted for the small thinking positively after delivery i could velcro it about halfway already on day 3 i was able to velcro all the way with no more room to tighten i will have to get a smaller size honestly I am not complaining this is a good problem to have and i know it so the sizing can be tricky however it feels awesome it could cough and laugh more confidently and i just felt like i was not fall all over the place I am hoping the smaller size will help me get back to pre-pregnancy shape faster but even if it does not this just feels good after 9 months of stretching,126,215
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,bigger than i expected as far as the support is great especially after c section it supported my back and the flappy extra fat from pregnancy hanging from the incision i was able to walk and take care of my 15 month old toddler and a newborn my healing is definitely a lot better than my first c section with this belly bandit support,64,216
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,was not what my wife was anticipating did not live up to other more superior products wife wore once and put it back in it is box,26,217
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i found it too big i feel there is no compression and the bel row you can see under your shirt to thick where it over laps,27,218
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,product worked well to bring my stomach muscles together after giving birth i could not wear it all the time bc it was long and would hinder breastfeeding it also would because my milk to let down if i sat too slumped in it all in all worth getting but has some issues,52,219
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,this is a must have post baby helps hold everything tight so it helps with comfort and pain it helped me get back to pre-baby belly in two months,29,220
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,beware of this product as with any binders it can increase your incidence of prolapse this really helped with my c section when i had it on i did not feel as much pain moving i would use it again but i will be careful as my friend ended up with some pelvic prolapse after using one which according to my ob can be brought on by these not worth it at all,72,221
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i was a medium before i got pregnant and i thought a medium belly bandit would work i love it and i think it is helped me but i wish I had gotten the small so it would be more snug for longer great quality although,44,222
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,folds constantly and is uncomfortable only works first couple of days before it starts to fold on the sides,19,223
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,while this was completely uncomfortable with the first pregnancy i had and i did not wear it much at all it helped me so much with my second i was able to lose so much more in inches in the weeks right after birth and i had diastasis recti so it also helped with the discomfort and side affects of that the fit is a bit small but obviously as you shrink back down the velcro can be pulled in more so it will fit you as you need it to while i agree that you can see it under your clothes it might not be the most comfortable thing and more but this will help you size down quicker will help your uterus to shrink back up and in and will help you with diastasis recti it is well worth the money and i would buy it again if i was ever to have another,154,224
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i used the sizing chart from the belly bandit website the band was still too small it is been 7 days since I have given birth and the band still does not fit sorely disappointed,32,225
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i am 56 and 136 pre-pregnancy weight i gained 30 pounds while pregnant and 10 days postpartum i have lost 18 pounds the size small i ordered fits me and there is room to tighten the velcro as i loose more weight in the coming weeks not sure if this band will help tighten my stomach or just help me hold it in for a while it is easy to see under a thin shirt or tank so i think a cardigan or second layer will be needed in order to wear it out in public,96,226
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i bought this just after having my 8th baby i wore it for three days and it seemed to be making a big difference however i developed a terrible rash with large itchy red welps around my entire waist i stopped wearing it and it has taken 5 days for the rash and itchiness to go away it is made with 75 polyester 25 lycra so I am not sure what my skin reacted to but I am not able to wear it and can not return it so for me this was a complete waste of money,93,227
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i bought this when i was 39 weeks pregnant and it fit as needed after my c section i do not wear it around the clock because it is kind of uncomfortable for me to sit in I am 53 it keeps everything tight and is doing what i wanted it to do,50,228
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,horrible i guess you have to be a certain shape in order tonwear this but it is suppose to fit after pregnancy hmmm,22,229
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,only issue is that it creases which can be an annoyance,11,230
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,great post baby shaper the small fit great and i highly recommend,12,231
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i originally bought the more expensive softer version of this for after my c-section that was a good purchase for when i was wearing it during the day because it was more comfortable as recovered i have transitioned to only sleeping in my belly bandit and for that purpose the version here has been great i would love to see belly bandit create a product that is adjustable as you lose weight as now i own a medium small and x-small,81,232
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,this would be a great product if i was standing a majority of the time it held everything in and you could visibly tell if i had been wearing it during the day or not i would pooch out more if i had not been wearing it for a while as a brand new mom however i did everything i could to stay off my feet when sitting the belly bandit would get pushed up and off my stomach to mash painfully into my tender breasts i used it daily for a week starting two weeks postpartum off and on for another two weeks then almost never after that now 7 weeks postpartum i look pretty much the same as i did before i started wearing it i might have had better long-term results if i had been able to wear it until i could start working out again but it was just too uncomfortable to sit in there has really no curve to this product nor anything to keep it from riding up next time I shall be looking into something that goes between the legs like the bellefit,187,233
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i am currently 25 weeks postpartum and i feel that the belly bandit has been very helpful at getting my pre-pregnancy stomach back i started wearing it the second day after my daughter was born and i usually wear it both day and night my husband and family have also noticed how well it seems to be doing i gave it 4 stars because like other reviews said it does not lay flat and can be seen under certain outfits I shall usually still wear it anyway because depending on if i suck it in or wear a looser shirt it is not that noticeable i would definitely use this product again with another pregnancy and will continue to wear it with this one update i have come to notice that if the product has become loose after wearing it a while you can take it off for a few hours and it will tighten back up,155,234
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,best purchase I have ever made i started wearing it the day after i had my son and my belly definitly went down alot it also gave me a lot of back support if i was having more kids i would def buy it again i always recommend to my friends,50,235
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,fitted as expected and shipping was on schedule loved the deal,12,236
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i like the product kind of hard to get used to at first according to the size chart i needed a medium but actually needed a small,27,237
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,love it it fits well and is very comfortable,9,238
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this is a must have for postpartum belly support wow this was my fourth baby and first time using one of these i really noticed it a difference when i took it off my back and belly felt wobbly and unsupported my stomach shrunk down much faster than it did with my 3rd babe cons i live in the desert and it is way hot now that it is in the 90s i can not hardly stand to wear it luckily i am not needing it much longer fabric is not so comfy i do not know what it is made out of but i think next to bare skin it would feel scratchy my friend let me borrow her bamboo belly bandit and it felt so much more comfy if i did this again i would fork out the extra and get the bamboo but it is a good product,149,239
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i guess i thought this would fit like the belly band they gave me in the hospital post-hysterectomy which was very soft-textures and super stretchy and very comfortable to have on all day and night this one is nothing like that it is a gritty scratchy rough fabric very rigid in the shape way wider than other bands and super uncomfortable to wear unless you are standing up tall I am returning it,70,240
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,it is too large and now i am stuck with it waste of money,14,241
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,great product it was delivered on time i would recommend it,11,242
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,fit great helped slim my stomach after having a baby,10,243
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,does it work i want to believe it helped post baby,11,244
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,larger than i anticipated but i did not follow fitting directions just ordered xl because i wear xl in almost everything,20,245
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,there are way better things out there for post partum it does not cover your entire abdominal area and I am 52 i recommend a latex corset a long one for post partum try ann chery,35,246
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,very helpful after having a baby it made me feel more confident walking around post baby after having an unplanned c-section i also had a fractured rib which helped with recovery worth the buy,34,247
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,slightly uncomfortable when seated but so supportive otherwise that it is worth it,12,248
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i had an emergency c section and i wore it 6 days after it it is thick rides up bends and made creases that just will not go away wen when i wash it and try to iron it i do not know if it did my body any good because i ordered a medium according to their measurements and it is just soo big so I am really disapponted I am now wearing a regular victoria secret waist cruncher and i feel it is tucking and applying much more pressure than the bandit maybe if i got the small i would have wrote a diffrent review,97,249
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,comfortable fit some results i think i bought this too late best result likely right after delivery,17,250
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i out grew this very quickly i even went by the size chart on the website as other reviews state it creases in the back and makes extra rolls on top of the band can not wear it under any form fitting clothes because of the crease / gold it makes i was so looking forward to using it too,58,251
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,semi-rigid and uncomfortable to wear it kept riding up and bunching up so it did not stay where i needed it to did not wear it much because of this,28,252
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i like this product but not as much as the shrinkx band i also purchased this band is flexible but not comfortable enough to wear while sitting i do believe it has helped shrink my belly although,37,253
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,i think there needs to be a petite version this reached far too high on my chest and if i fastened it lower i could not sit,27,254
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i guess i ordered bigger size but it ok i like it it holds ok,15,255
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter after she had a c-section and it is helping her shrink back into her clothes quickly she loves it,25,256
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,the size small only lasted a week and i had to order the extra small this product has been amazing and really helped sheink my waist after baby i was back in my pre preggo jeans in under 2weeks,39,257
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i measured it exactly as the directions explained and it is way too big do not know if i an return it if it fit I had like it but now I am just out of 50,36,258
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,did not do anything for me but maybe for somebody else,12,259
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,this is my third belly band and is by far the worst i loved the other two brands I have gotten but this one was soooo itchy and miserable to be in i took it off every chance i got the best one to get is the bamboo belly bandit do not waste your money on this one unless you enjoy scratching yourself all day,64,260
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,i ordered this cincher to help with post partum recovery really just to help support my organs while my abs regained strength i have the cheaper medela version of this too and it worked much better the both move around a bit but the belly bandit was very stiff and wide so that if i adjusted it to fit my hips and belly it would extend halfway up my ribs and have a significantaround my waist it was a little like wearing a cardboard tube i returned it for later recovery leonisa cinchers and post partum panties worked really well and are shaped like womens bodies rather than tubes,111,261
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,the sizing estimate on belly bandits website was correct i should have taken their advice but i felt so much larger i got the size up and kinda regretted it my friends that needed c-sections swear by this product i got one just in case even although i got the larger size i would recommend it my belly was back to normal in about 3 weeks maybe that is because i am already a larger person but I am happy about itbelly bandit original postpartum belly wrap,88,262
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,not sure why this thing got such great reviews bought it one month post-pardum and could not wear it too stiff and folded when i sat down or bent over showed through clothes so uncomfortable very warm to wear terrible product,39,263
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,works well for post c-section belly helps me feel like everything is in the right place received a lot of compliments on how i looked great post pregnancy all thanks to the help of the belly bandit,37,264
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i would like to have given this 5 stars but it is definitely visible under clothing and will roll if you do not immediately go back to a size 2 post-partum however i still love it because it made me feel whole again after giving birth if that makes sense it makes walking around in the hours and days after birth so much more comfortable and definitely helped me feel like i recovered a little more quickly than i would have without it it also offers a small measure of back support which is always welcome,95,265
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,this is great waist band make sure to check your size with chart i followed the instructions and i got the right size if you are stuck between sizes i would go with the smaller one the plan is to reduce your waist size and it will eventually fit well,50,266
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,i purchased this for my daughter and she loved it after 2 weeks she had to order a second one in a smaller size great product,26,267
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,i bought this for my wife and she recently gave birth to our son she says that she likes the way that this feels especially when she gets up out of a chair or out of bed she tells me that it helps to make everything feel compressed and in tact the only reason that my wife rated it as 4 stars is that she says that she wishes that the material was more breathable since she has wearing it so often she also says that the velcro area is a bit stiff so when she sits it tends to ride up a bit overall although she says that she would definitely buy it again if she needed to for a future pregnancy,122,268
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,follow the sizing on belly bandit website worked perfectly for me,11,269
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,i give it a 3 for style and price really runs small so if you are a true small you will be ok if you purchase a large it was a nice gift for a friend,36,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,5.0,positive,perfect i love it just remember that it runs small in size,12,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,something told me to order this in a xl and i am glad i did it fits well although why the neck opening is so narrow is beyond me it is very pretty otherwise i probably should have purchased a xxl as i wear a us size large but as said before xl is good should be fun to wear when the weather warms up,64,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,this was a beautiful shirt that being said it was tiny i usually wear a large sometimes an xlarge i knew they ran small so i bought the xxlarge but it was still way too small,36,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,cute shirt pretty sheer so expect to wear a tank or camisole underneath runs slightly small but overall I am happy with this purchase,23,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,1.0,negative,i compare this to something found in the gutter,9,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,beautiful lace blouse but was too small in the bust area gave it to a friend who loves it too,20,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,the blouse is lovely but very much smaller than expected i would guess that their size xl is truly a size m in this country blouse is made in china,31,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,5.0,positive,fits as expected is nice and comfortable but you need to order two or three sizes larger than what you normally wear i ordered xxl i normally wear a size 14 due to my bra size which is a 40 c this is very important because i had received them way too small you get what you want for the price it is not perfect but it is nice,68,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,beautiful but i forgot to check the sizing it is asian sizing which means xxx size 12 but it is gorgeous,22,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,it was two sizes to small china sizes are smaller than united states sizes i even followed their size chart it was wrong however if you get one that fits like it is supposed to it is a very nice and comfortable shirt,42,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are very thin pull off easily without residue rare the only odd thing about these is that on the crease it actually had cut out slits along it so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket / shirts,45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it not the best,14,1
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,so far they have not really worked will not stick to the fabric of my jacket,15,2
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,i have tried several brands of shields and most do not stay attached all day / evening this purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed love them and am hoping that i receive an equally excellent product when i need to reorder,46,3
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,they do not stick well to the fabric bunch up not comfortable,12,4
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,it did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,my wife thinks that these things are great,8,6
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,thedoes not adhere to clothing very well it is basically pointless to use this product very disappointing indeed,19,7
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,these shields were too flimsy did not sick and bunched up will not purchase again,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,the shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket i had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well just be mindful when you take the jacket off / put it on i will continue to use these much improved from older versions that would come off,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,perfect for the victorian era ball now i do not have to wash the whole dress after every event,18,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,very hard to position not worth the hassle,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,theseems great but once i started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat it is kind of a give and take on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side it is not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck,70,12
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,great product i used these for a series of interviews that i would not have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview they worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i bought 3 brands of dress-shield and i tried these last these were thinner like the 2nd brand and i understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin they are useless people who buy these sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time money and embarrassment if you perspire avoid these if you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes good enough,75,14
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,helped prevent stains but did tend to slip a little,10,15
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,i can see how these may not be the best for a shirt however they have saved me on dry-cleaning for my work blazers a nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it is awesome to get a few wears out of each during either a big client meeting or a hot spring / summer day these will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure,63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,these are good in theory but they do not stick to my clothing,12,17
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,barely sticks to clothing ends up bunched and then unattached,10,18
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not seem strong enough several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when i applied them to silkier fabrics on the plus side these pads are quite thin and quiet,41,19
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,it is not sticky and the material is poor,8,20
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,they did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I have only used this once it worked fine,8,22
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product very bad quality for the price i paid,14,23
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,greatbut held up poorly kept peeling off and sticking to my skin no bueno,16,24
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,great concept in theory but i find they do not fit well in blazers as I had intended to use them,18,25
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor i use these in blazers mostly they are perfect i will say that if you are sleeves are tight this shield will be difficult to apply / stay in place when you put the blazer on they are the perfect size for the underarm and you can not tell they are there these are must-haves for long work days,66,26
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i was very impressed i plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i really like my gun run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,when i got this it had a few problems including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it,21,2
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,the power supply went out on me and never worked again,11,3
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also,12,4
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,it is doing good so far i highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos i love this,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just does not mix well with skin i guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe,34,6
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,this kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,21,7
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,it is a good starter kit but over heats with bigger tattoos power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems very nice people i would recomend this kit,34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,the machine came within 4 days of me buying it but the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily a warning to first time tattooers this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own also please for my own sake do not use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing on fake skin or fruit but I have never heard of the brand and something tells me it is bad ink other wise it is a perfect machine for beginners,102,10
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,the kit came 1 day late but it is cool laughing out loud the grip is not the one they show it is straight n ink caps white no biggie thanks you,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,it did not come with a grip i waited forever and i searched everywhere and there was no grip,18,12
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i like dragon hawk products because your tattoo kits have a great price for people like me that is starting out tattooing and i check out others brands of tattoo kits but no one had a better deals but dragon hawk is the place to start if you love tattooing and want good deals of tattoo kits ps wow your kits only have a big black ink bottle that will last me awhile and saves me money thanks and you got a costumer for life,86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,good for the money everything is working well just do not use this ink,13,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,great fun product looking forward to the next dress up party going as the tattooed lady,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,what a waste of money this product is waaaaayy over priced for it is poor quality i bought this kit to have my best friend pro artist draw ani had for a tatt on my arm we followed the directions to a t and it still came off within the next day the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use one marker never worked bc it was dried up and the adhesive is a joke it is messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross you would honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice invest in a real henna tattoo kit,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i would not recommend this product it is just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,pens work beautifull but after 3 days sometime less you need to remove definatly not lasts lasting for weeks the latex covering feels gross and does not last long i will not purchase again company did send out quickly,38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with these they are basically sharpies they function the exact same way and the colors are not true to the lids it is fine to have them if you are expecting markers but they do not make convincing or lasting tattoos,39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,product does not stay on for more than a day ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo nice colors although,22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love love them where have these been i love to change up my tattoo never permant thank you love it,20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,they do not stay at all it says 2 - 3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and i was sadly disappointed,20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,this was really fun and I am glad i got it because i enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough they all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones do not work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos do not usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long either way i still really like it and recommend it,66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,needs many many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly they are not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead these are just permanent markers with glue / adhesive do not waste your money on this,51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the product is not as advertised mine did not come in a box the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil the tattoo remover is very dry without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper the topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what the pens are ok with good colors too bad the kit is so poorly put together bewild get your act together,86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the ink washed off without the sticky stuff if you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week it is like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it also the yellows and light green pens do not even show up on skin,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,not what i although there just likemakers not worth the money,13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,we had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies we bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised colors bright and vibrant all the pens were in new condition not dried out like the store pens had been my only disappointment was that there really is not a lot of ink in these they dry up much faster than regular markers for the price you would think they would last longer I shall be buying more wish there were more colors or choices of colors,110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,one pen was dried out when i got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones very disappointed,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,this was a gift came in a cheap plain box a lot of the pens do not seem to work the fine tips do not seem to work,27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the product is ok you are better off getting the 18 piece version or none at all because i got multiple red green and yellow markers the yellows hardly show the tattoo remover wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants the most impressive part of the pack is the sealant which is essentially watered-down glue you are better off with sharpies or other thin permanent marker that does not run through the creases of your skin mind you elmers glue water and rubbing alcohol things you probably already have if you do decided to buy this kit i suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue this sometimes keeps the sealant from collecting lint,117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer it fun to design things,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the thick sides only worked on all my pens could not get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the fine point on the markers did not work,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,these markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily even with the protective coating having a lot of fun with them at parties although,27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,ok my daughter does cosplay these pens were so great for her costume they stayed permanent and no smudging she had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days i do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it,44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,so i got them in the time frame it which was wonderful and all but like several people have said they come dried out i had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up one had mold on the fine tip I am like what the heck also they do not last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing very disappointed,76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out so honestly i will stay with the sharpies,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love them i think my daughter loves them even more so fun to work with i like being able to change not really into permanent body art these are perfect for that,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,some of the pens were dried out which i did not expect did receive it in a timely manner,19,27

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,some colors do not look nice on the skin one pen was open and thin side do not work,17,29
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this kit was a gift for my teen daughters they have a lot of fun with it the tattoos do not last long even when you put the protective material supplied but they still enjoy it i would recommend it,39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,i was so happy when they came in the mail i opened them up used them and thought all was well the ink did not run when i took a shower but when i went to use them again they would not work if you happen to be looking for a one-time use then you found it,55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,did not work well did not last the two black pens stop working before i could finish the first temp tattoo not worth the money just use eyeliner or a sharpie,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter loved this gift awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each,19,33

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get all of the different colors however i found that it was not that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks it is fun but i was disappointed,52,36
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more ink less,19,37

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i did not buy this and I am not recommending using temp tattoo markers use sharpies they have cleaner clearer colors that show up well you can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it is simple so please do not waste your money when you can use sharpies,51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,i like to play with them they are a bit to easy to come off fun to play with although,20,43

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,they are good colors and even without the coating the design will last a few days only issue is that after you first do them you need to let it dry a bit and even then a bit can rub off very fun,43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,it was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,looks real had several people come up to me and comment hard part was telling them it was a temp glue is sticky even when dry use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash,44,47

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased the inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as although it had no case at all,42,4

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,advertises the case is for the trio stealth g2 however in order to take a picture you must remove your tablet from this case before you can take a picture most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures also this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture it falls over just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless,68,58

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,the cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it did not was a let down,25,62
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,the tablet case was much better quality than expected it is truly nice and at an excellent price,18,63
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,could not get the bluetooth to work with my tablet the holder for the tablet was not able to keep the tablet in place,23,64
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected at a reasonable price,8,65
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,i bought this as a gift for my dad since he also got the newest kindle fire the kindle fire hd 101 and he loves it not only that but it fits perfectly the grips that wrap around the corners hold it tightly and safely i recommend this to anyone looking for a case that will keep your device safe while still looking awesome,64,66
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,i liked it a lot it looks really nice on a hand and it does not look cheap the only thing that was bad few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly so i had to fix it with pliers so that it would not fall apart,50,0
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,it is okay and i like it however it is cheaply made,11,1
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,the bracelet is very pretty but not well designed it does not stay in place,14,2
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,i bought another one of these in silver and they both lose theirafter wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather I am never buying these again,28,3
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,i purchased this bracelet and ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter because it is so unique also it is a cute and inexpensive gift to give for no special reason or to add to her christmas gifts i hope she will love it,41,4
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,very I shall fitting ring too small bracelet too big,9,5
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this is very flimsy i bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked,29,6
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways i steel like it but is crapy,17,7
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,product as expected but although stated it would be slow was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas on the same day can a week sooner,30,8
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,the ring part broke off from the chain the first time i put it on,15,9
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,broke i kept the ring part because it was cute laughing out loud,11,10
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,got thistoday and it was already broken,9,11
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time i wore it,19,12
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,i bought thisas a joke for my grandmother knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only 200 when she received it the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring or the bracelet part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo instead of soldered together even if you want to make someone laugh or buy for throw away jewelry do not,68,13
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,a sleek exotic piece they were beautiful on my model and my date was complimented all night i will check and buy from this company again,26,14
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,thiswas well worth what i paid for it it was good quality for the price and i received it very quickly,23,15
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,this is a really cute accessory the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right the chain to the wrist is a good length the one real drawback is it is actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight but i salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate,62,16
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,kinda big i have small wrists very cute although,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this thing fell apart like 10 min after i gave it to my girlfriend i would not recommend this to anyone do not buy this cheap thing we did not expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for halloween but it did not even make it to the party,50,18
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,no sizes on it biger than my fingers,9,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,hate these pens the pens are not multicolored and the ink runs out after a few uses would not buy again,21,0
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a nurse so i thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder this first one exploded the first day i used it all over my scrubs and i looked like a slob all day i thought it was just a freak accident so i decided to give another one a try the same thing happened there is definitely a flaw in the design and i will not be using them again,80,1
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use these quite frequently to take notes since i do not have a smartphone the only complaint i have is that sometimes if you push the pen into it is cap too hard it will break this is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain aside from that although they work fine great for carrying around in a pocket,63,2
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i have no need to write with pink purple or green ink blue is ok but black is the best,20,3
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times i have always used the mini rsvp pens from pentel most stores in my area are not carrying them so i found these sorry but i hate them they are very small for writing and since i attach them to my keychain the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day my other pens never broke thicker plastic if you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok i will not buy these again since i have found the pentel pens i want on amazon oh and the chain they come on is a joke totally worthless,120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I shall have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion as described and intended however i was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket and it works very well for that i unscrew the little keychain attachment and the lid stays on in my pocket so I am always ready to write in a notebook i carry i frequently have a better pen but not always this one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen otherwise it is a little too stubby the product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter but it works well for what i wanted,130,5
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,honestly if i had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily i never would have purchased this product i should have looked for push button or twist pens instead these pens are small fit well on a keychain and writes okay but i almost lost the cap s quite a few times due to the price point it is not worth the time returning but i will not buy again,70,6
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are the perfect size to put in my diabetic meter bag thank you so much,17,7
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,good deal for the number of pens definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys / if they will be yanked around a lot,43,8
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these come in handy when you do not have a pen ready just put it on your key chain and you will always have a pen handy amazinglove it I have given away 6 already close friends and others i tell them where to buy them keep up the good work with fantastic ideas,53,9
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,love these little pens they work great with post-it note holders,11,10
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the caps came broken this is the second time i ordered these just because i like the size and i can not find any other brand,25,11
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,pen constantly slips out of cap preventing me from keeping pens on the key ring more of a pocket pen than anything,22,12
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,worthless product and i assume because it is cheap i lost 2 pens already in 2 days so obviously i bought the pen caps not the pens because it is the only thing it stay very lose and weak,37,13
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,nice pens good size for small geocaches which is why i bought them,13,14
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,chains break easily caps do not hold pen well pen often falls off my hospital badge,15,15
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I have had these pens for less than a month and I am on the third one as the pens have fallen out of the caps i have the pen attached to my work badge i work in an office setting so there has not a lot to grab / catch on the pens but they continue to fall out I have been walking across the office and had coworkers stop me because my pen is laying on the ground some feet back i would not buy these again nor suggest that others buy them either,90,16
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not stay in the cap using it as a keychain is useless because it falls out too easily,20,17
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted hard to find in office supply stores,11,18
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,got these for my husband who makes deliveries and needed a pen to attach to his lanyard they are good but as they are used over time one fell out of the cap and got lost however considering how inexpensive they were I had still buy them again,47,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,not happy after giving these out in stockings a few of them did not light up,16,20
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,terrible the pens are very loose in the caps resulting in them falling out frequently I have lost practically all of them waste of money,25,21
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i still have nowhy 6 colored pen with all black ink,13,22
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wore them attached to my lanyard after less than a week the pen did not stay in the cap the fit is not tight enough,24,23
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,the pen writes well the cap does come off easily so it is not suitable on a lanyard or keychain it is perfect to put inside a purse or pocket,30,24
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,I am always in need of pens when going out to events dinner movies when i have a small purse with me these are small and perfect they are 3 inches long black ink i will buy more well worth the money,40,25
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,i love these these are great little pens and i have already re-ordered more they write very well and i love the different colors i am using them inside small survival kits,32,26
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,great little pen just what i was looking for,9,27
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i am a teacher and always need a pen handy i tried to keep this on my lanyard but the pen does not stay in th cap I have already lost 3 from the pack,33,28
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,this work great with my passport love them,8,29
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i needed very small pens for wallet and small handbags these are almost perfect the cap separates from pen barrel too easily a dried thin strip of water-proof fabric glue inside opposite sides of cap takes care of grip for cap now to keep my daughter from adopting them,49,30
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,too small and pour plastic broke in one week,9,31
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,loved the pen at first worked great and convenient to keep on my badge for work always had a pen to sign documents with however the caps continually fell off not worth the buy,34,32
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are great as they fit in your pocket i use them on a lanyard for taking notes in the field and they do not hang as low as a regular pen would amazon seems the only place you can actually find this pen size,45,33
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly as ordered perfect for lots of places where a pen is too large,14,34
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted to hang it from my lanyard but the hardware did not hold up and i lost the pen,20,35
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,time will tell whether the caps fall off but so far so good the pens write well no skipping they do not feel cheap in the hand the little o-ring on top of each cap is small but i did not have a problem fitting it onto a small flashlights o-ring after i removed the chain the chain itself is not sturdy to the eye or feel essentially useless i would not trust it to hold otherwise I am pleased,76,36
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pens themselves usually worked fine for me but the caps do not attach strongly enough to the pens for them to be a good keychain pen i lost all of these within about a month because the caps where the keychain is attached just did not stay attached to the pens,52,37
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use them allways one in each bag,8,38
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,no ink clogs easy to put cap on and off great for nurses who never can keep up with pens,20,39
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,do some geocaching they are not the best quality but they are great to leave in a larger geocach container for other cachers to document their find,27,40
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i work in a hospital and purchased these to wear on my badge i was hoping for a pen that would be easily accessible and would not get lost or misplaced greatbut not so great product for it is intended use i could not make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap with normal use some of the caps cracked and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen it is pretty frustrating when you try to grab your pen in the middle of examining a patient and there has nothing dangling there but a pen cap,106,41
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i do not know why i did not look at the reviews first i wanted to have pens on our keychains so we always have one the cap fits the pen so loosely i really do not think it is going to stand the test of time if you are going to make a keychain pen maybe you should make it so it will work on an actual keychain,64,42
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not like to stay in the cap,9,43
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,they all fell apart rather quickly and got separated,9,44
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted these pens to keep on my work badge / key ring so i would always have a pen handy but the pen constantly falls out of the cap so i lost 3 pens within a few weeks before i gave up they would be better if the cap stayed on and if they had colored ink to match theof the case,63,45
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,thewritersedge dot com space pen store reviewed this product and found it to be of excellent quality yet recommends that you go to our website and take a look at the authentic fisher space pens that write upside down through water dirt oil and in freezing temperatures,48,46
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,the pens are not tightly held to the caps so they are lost within hours seriously all 6 were gone within hours of attaching to my key chain,28,47
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,plastic cracked and broke in less than 24 hours,9,48
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,cheap and a greatbetter in some ways than the nite eyez ones because you do not have to unclip anything to get your pen just pull free of the cap and write my wife clips one to her scrubs pantleg loop plus they are dirt cheap lose one goes through the laundry no tears,54,49
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i used these for work peds nurse for labeling so i always had a pen handy attached right to my identification i even attached one to my wallet but the pen itself eventually fell off clickable minis may be a better option if you expect a lot of movement / use of whatever you have it attached to convenient otherwise,57,50
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,cap will come loose after a few weeks in your pockets thus i end up with a cap on my key ring without a pen on it if these were threaded caps it would be perfect,36,51
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i am definitely impressed with the pens i quickly put one on my work keys and on my car keys never have to borrow a pen again within a week both pens had fallen off without me realizing it caps need to be tighter,44,52
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,just what the doctor ordered when you need a pen and do not have one some more words to get past the minimum what a silly,26,53
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i like that these pens all have black ink the orange green and more ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl these pens are half the length of typical pens but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing the small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you are on the go and the cap style prevents leaking construction is cheap and lightweight but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen the keychains seem pretty flimsy and i discarded them did not really want that feature anyway,110,54
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,pens go in her pocket so when a patient calls she has got the pen right with her to write with great product she loses them a lot i will be a frequent flyer on this one,36,55
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a pe teacher and need pens to be handy for quick writing i was totally disappointed of this product the eons will not clip back into the cap after a couple uses it got to be who can find that bright orange pen in the grass first activity save your money not a good product to attach to a key ring,62,56
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,maybe I am just hard on things in my pocket but these things break very easily on every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap stripping the hole I have tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely much prefer the nitepocket pen by inka,74,57
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these are great for my purposes i always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I am the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great because they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans i never noticed them until i need to write something down I am not sure why the description listed the product box with product dimensions 65 x 28 x 04 inches but the pens are 35 inches long and they are all black ink i was worried since the description mentionedred / blue / black / green / purple but these are describing theof the casing not the ink i needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors i can not believe that I am excited about pens,131,58
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are great for keeping on your lanyard and are always handy perfect for teachers and the colors are great too,22,59
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,especially for pre-teens kids b4 their growth spurt all grandkids enjoy these in their xmas socks along with a small empty book they can fill with their ideas,28,60
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you the chains are reasonably strong I have only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner the pens are moderately tight in the cap they do not fall out with normal use but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be friction locked allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap the pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks such as writing a signature or jotting down a note there is no way you would want to use it all day unless you have small hands,128,61
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are not meant for writing papers or business i gave away as little tokens and i can tell you that right now my co workers still have these little cute pens hanging from their desks they are fun and great since they can be pinned on a refrigerator magnet they do not write bad either,56,62
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i should have bought the retractable kind of mini pen without caps that can be lost,16,63
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,although the pens write nicely attaching the keychain to the cap of the pen was a horriblei keep losing the pens throughout the day because they are not designed to stay in the cap under stress,38,64
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are a greatbut because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge and be lost other than that it is a very handy tool,36,65
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the true utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off i fixed this problem with these buy wrapping a piece of tape electrical ortape around the part where the cap seats on the pen now i need to really pull hard so i hopefully will not lose them,62,66
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked,14,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,looks real and stays on my lip great almost gave my parents a heart attack when i wore it to go eat supper with them it does stick a little if you use it on your lip because of the moisture from your mouth also would not suggest eating with one on your lip food gets stuck on the sliding thing quite easily,62,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little thicker than i expected but they work wonderfully,12,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,they definitely serve their purpose and look realistic although they are not made for daily 24 hour use they are excellent for pictures and testing to see if you would want a piercing the colors you receive vary so do not expect an exacti got more pink than i wanted but i was okay with that i definitely recommend them,61,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,pretty came 5 days late but nice two purple three silver,10,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,just do not buy it it does not look real it looks so fake and you do not even get different colors they are all silver and break at the slightest touch,29,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,i thought i was getting differenthoops yet i got all silver and broken hoops horrible product very disappointed,20,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,did not receive all colors only black and silver aside from the that they are great,15,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these were great and look so real but super easy to lose if you are not a very organized person,19,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,the hoops are huge and they did not come in multicolor all hoops were purple way to big to wear anywhere but upper ear lobe,25,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,if you wear it for to long it irritates the skin where it is and it might leave you with a scar but would buy again,26,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,work exactly like they say they do work well as a faux septum / cartilage piercing although it was a little too big for my nose to wear it as a nose ring,31,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this was an amazing buy it came in fast and nothing was broken or missing i received three gold one red and one purple i wore it around town and i had to go to walmart and my friend saw me and asked if it was real i did not want to lie so i said no it is a fake and she said it looks good on you i was quite surprised someone actually thought it was real i love it I am going to buy more and hope for more colors,90,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love the prodect it came early and i love them i got 4 red ones and 1 blue i wear them all the time my friends think that there real when i wear them,35,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,they do not come in all the colors and i only got 4 not bad but still next time I am going some where else,24,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,too big i think for it to pass as a real nose ring,13,15
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i really like them and use them a lot i got 2 gold 1 red 1 purple and 1 pink i was hoping for on to be black but it was fine would recommend does not leave a mark but can tend to hurt for a while if you leave on for a pretty long time,55,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love it it comes with 4 and came really early,11,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,these left awful soars on my daughters noise way too tight,11,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,arrived a week early which i thought was kinda nice until i saw the quality of the product itself it came with only four even although the product clearly says five and they were all blue no variety ofthere and they are all broken either the silver clip part fell out or is jammed open honestly the worst purchase I have ever made i do not even want new ones or anything to do with these guys ever i would only recommend these to people who want to waste money,89,19
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this is a great product shipped 2 weeks early and looks real i got them to feel like i have piercings and to trick my friends because I am not allowed to have piercings yet anyways this is a great product that looks real the only problem i have with the product is getting them on they are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place they are so small you have to practically rip you lip off but when on they are secure and feel great also if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials this is for you i am very sensitive to certain materials and this i was having a reaction to so be careful but the product is great and looks real and theis fantastic i got 5 rose gold colored rings they are beautiful i can not blame the small size to get on your lip although because it makes the product more secure when on so overall i am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars,185,20
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i absolutely love them came 7 days early and even although u can not pick the colors i received two red two pink and one purple sense i do not fancy pink i just used nail polish and painh the pink ones black and held them till they were dry enough to set down and then when dry i put a clear coat on and they look like they came black i also altered purple to silver and then to blue i just used nail polish remover and then changed theso super simple and i totally recommend them do not threat if u do not get the right,108,21
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i just got these in today I have had multiple piercings in the past and my skin always rejected them so this is a great alternative for me it came with 1 black 1 green 1 pink and 2 red rings they are comfortable and easy to use and look like the real things great to use as a nose ring lip ring or septum ring,65,22
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little uncomfortable but they work fine for fake piercings also that you do not chose your own colors which sucks and they took a while to get here but they are good,32,23

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i originaly thought they would come in assorted colors but they all came in this really nice light purpleso I am not that upset as for wearing the actual product itself it feels a little painful when you wear it for long periods of time i wore it as a lip piercing and it felt a little weird after an hour or twoi could talk just fine but i could not drink with a straw because it would shift around uncomfortably but the feelings easy to ignore if you distract yourself from it,95,33

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these are awesome they look very real and I have been convincing everyone i meet the only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you do not feel it after a while i also did not get muchvariety i only received 3gold and 2 black rings which is completely fine with me i can not complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they are great i also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected,81,44
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i bought some of these and they do not hurt and they did not put a hole on you no matter where you put them i wore them all day long on my lip because that is where the original piercing is and ther was no hole left by these fake ones the reason i wore this was because i was taking a break from my real piercings i was quite comfortable with these and i will buy them again,78,45

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,sleep with this every single night not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs oh my god so fricking painful anyways since becoming pregnant i want to sleep on my side a lot and so i am worried about wrinkles too i guess but the pain dear lord it is so bad i tried using a pillow but this just slides in place and stays better i mean it does not even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom score,87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,dumbest purchase of my life do not let it be yours cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best i was shocked to say the least roll up a towel and use that instead,33,8

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,does not work very well it is very small better use as a baby or dog toy better to just use a pillow,25,13
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i bought this bear on another website the other reviewers are right this would only work well for very large boobs i bought the isima breast pillow and that has straps that secure it in place sometimes i put a comfy bra on too over the pillow to secure it even more so and also i like sleeping in comfort bras i would recommend the isima breast pillow i have size c implants,73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,this works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place my primary complaint is it does not rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts I shall wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still need a tight sports bra to hold it in place at least for me I am 58 tall slim build with breast augmentation might work better for natural breasts still use it although i do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place,116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product works as advertised according to her she finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place,39,16

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,might work for some but was too thick for me natural 34ddd the bear design is adorable but i went with the bosom buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me,36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all not worth the money,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,well damn i missed the return window by a few days i have dds and this thing is too big it has to be for someone with fffs or someone with nat geo tits,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it is pretty useless unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this does not stay put at all,32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,love it after researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles i saw this and thought ah ha it is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 ddd breast from smushing together i notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place h m has great long stretchy tanks i use,77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed it is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place even with wearing a sports bra to sleep ultimately it does not do well what it is advertising to do,51,25
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,funny gift for a friend love the name,8,26

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,great product for a great price easy to clean and good product,12,1
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,they are ok a little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult,17,2
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,gave it 4 stars because the product is good but i found out I am not a fan of sponges for applying makeup i like brushes better,26,3
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,four stars because thought they would be bigger overall there okay i still need to try them out so I shall update in a few,26,4
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,not worth a penny sponges broke off handles within days do not waste your money,14,5
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,good price but not very good quaility in this sense you kind of get what you pay for sponges are very stiff,22,6
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a breeze every time i need to do a heavy contour i reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender i find this product easier to manipulate they are sturdy and well built and everything arrived intact the makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful i was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon this bundle is a great value for the price and i would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup,103,7
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,only one of these sponges i was satisfied with and that was the teardrop the other two seemed a bit flimsy when i used the cleaningthat came with the sponges it tore through the sponges so i am no longer able to use them not very satisfied with this product wish it was of better quality,58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like i want,17,9

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,cheap handle came out of all of them,8,11
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,waste of money too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product,15,12
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful they were smaller than i expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator blendor they get the job done and i love them,36,13
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,it feel a little to harsh for my face,9,14
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice,12,15
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,cute they apply concealer very well no messy fingers,8,16

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,lighter than i expected but i love it,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this stuff does not work like i had seen it in makeup reviews,12,2
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,my lips are stained pink so are my teeth and my tongue after brushing my teeth the toothpaste foam is pink my finger tips are also pink i would definitely say it does it is job warning do not apply on the go you will stain everything,47,3

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,interesting thisis a much darker pink than expected but it is a pretty pink toned stain,18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this is a fun product goes on very sticky you wait til it dries and then peel it off the longer you leave it on the darker the shade i would say it looks like you have eaten a popsicle,39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,do not buy this horribly disappointed i anxiously applied this and immediately knew i made a bad purchase lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry when i separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips it was gross then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,product exactly as expected after watching some youtube videos of girls reviewing this product apply quickly before it starts to dry also make sure like are dry and do not put chapstick on prior or the product does not stain as well impressed this did not try out my lips like most lip products do,52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i love these they are really great they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink they do not leave any marks or anything once you have finished applying it and done it right however for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so although and leaves a thin outline on theof my lips but that might be because i often lick my lips my favoriteis lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark redjust do not apply it to dry and flaky lips,104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,this was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss i had fun experimenting and applying it i just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen i was done however since i did get it close to my lipi had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well it is a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips would buy again,100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,this just did not work for me on any level I have heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try i followed the directions and put the gel on my lips it was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky after leaving it on for some time i tried to peel it off but nothing really peeled it just was stuck and i ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth what i was left with was no visible difference inwhat has so ever i was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash,106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,i would give no stars if possible extremely messy and difficult to apply it is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible i threw it away,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,absolutely useless the gel is sticky clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it there has no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off extremely disappointed,38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I am kind of 50/50 for this lipstain i like the fact the last long in ur lips and does not dry out my lips it is a greatthe only problem is very hard to apply sticky and messy it difinitely need some time to get used to it this is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off overall i would buy it again,83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,love it it is weird to apply at first and it is pretty goopy but once you have gotten the hang of it it is amazing dries out your lips what lip stain does not so have chap stick ready to apply after the watermelonis more red than i had expected lovely peach is a nice light pink just bought another in the peach,62,17
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,do not buy this cheap terrible lip gloss it is the worse it is does nt even apply to my lips it is like plastic in a tube absolutely terrible,26,18
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this stuff is so gooey it is hard to keep it on your lips for more than 30 seconds it feels gross and does not really peel off,26,19
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,too dry on my lips difficult to apply and it barely shows,12,20
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,to hard to get on straight needs a better applicator,9,21
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this applies horribly burns the lips and is just gloppy it does not ever dry to peel off and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips,33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,the peach is a little lighter than i expected more of a very light pink it is a little messy but once you get the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it is easy to remove i just scrub my lips and it comes off when i do not want theany more,56,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,nice i really like it but unfortunately it is a bit messy when applying but other than that it is great,21,0

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,does not peel off well gets stain all over fingers lightstays on for few hours at most not worth the money sadly a disappointment it did make for a funny facebook live post because it does not work like it should,41,5
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i did not like the tintit was too light the lipstick stain did not lady as promised,18,6
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,these are great before going out to a big event it is very pigmented and it will literally stay on all day i usually apply mine with just a little lip brush and let it dry completely before peeling it off thelasts all day without having to worry about reapplying anything else,53,7
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is not long lasting at all once you drink or eat it just disappear,15,8
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it was not a rich red like the advertisements show also would horribly stain my teeth,15,9
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,the top almost popped off at first use the applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so could not smooth it onto my lips super funny texture and unfortunately left a weirdi really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i bought two different colors of these i am that girl that hates wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day these are great i use a small lip brush to apply that i bought cheap from cvs make sure your lips are mosturized before using apply it slowly covering lips and do not close your mouth and let lips touch until dry it will look funny but do not worry i let it dry for about 5 - 10 minutes then peel off it looks great i sometimes put chapstick over top of it if i want that shiny gloss look after about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone i love these for nights out or events where i do not want to keep reapplying lipstick plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and i can eat and drink with no problem last pic i posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch cherry red was applied that day i recommend to all the lazy girls that still want to look great,187,11
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this does what it is supposed to do note that if your skin is dry peeling off this lip treatment may hurt a bit so i just rubbed with tissue paper,31,12

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it does what a stain does in the begging a little goes along way once you get to the end then it is a little stickier but overall pretty good,30,16
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,it is very pigmented really hard to put on it is sticky and takes a long time to put on but overall it is really good i like it,26,17
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,very hard to apply very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry the tint also did not actually peel off but i had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces thewas lighter than i expected and it was not long lasting,57,18
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is impossible to get a clean line the container was approximately 25 full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked it deserves no stars,57,19
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it does not go on easily too clumpy and stiky,9,20
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,takes to long to work then just looks like i ate something red,13,21
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,shipping took like a month and it does not work good it does not stay that long it taste nasty you are better off buying a lipstain,25,22
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,coolbut deff not as easy to put on as we see in videos ends up on teeth n stains your fingers but does leave a nice stain on lips when everything else is cleand up,35,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i love theof waterproof lipstick that does not get on anything but this one does it was soo liquidy pretty sure that is not how it is supposed to be and the top part was torn off but i fixed that after a long time of keeping it on my lips i pealed it and the lipstick did not take affect at all i was really disappointed this is not how it is advertised,72,24
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,my daughter uses this occasionally and likes it,8,25
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip and gets on teeth when i smile,23,26
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,cuteand staun but is really messy,8,27
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh there are much better brands this is loaded with chemicals and i can not help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just is not worth it,42,28
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit this brand peels off nicely,18,29
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i bought two of these the red one is completly unusable it is so clumpy does not go on smooth the taste of this product is gross i would not buy again,31,30

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i loved this product it works quickly and almost instantly at first i did not know if this was the peel off one but it was and it stayed in for te whole day i strongly recommend this,37,32
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it was in perfect condition when i recieved it and it arrived like a week sooner than expected theis just what i wanted and really lasts all day i love it,33,33
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i like the product but i do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application,25,34
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it is super messy to put on and really really sticky i had to apply it like every hour because thecame off very quickly and the my upper lip did not not get the samemy bottom lip did very sad it does not work on my skin,50,35
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,these are not meant for tan to dark skin ladies i think my lips are somewhat dark so you can barely see theon my lips i picked out the darkest shade too but it is still too light for a tan girl like me,45,36
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,love theand it is final look a little bit sticky when putting on but easy to peel of do not hurt at all highly recommended took 1 month to arrive,30,37
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this stuff is horrible it got all over the place and stains everything fingers teeth cabinets consitancy of product is awful has huge globs that come out seriously do not waste your money,36,38
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product it was super new the shipping was way faster than i had thought it would be the product got here in perfect shape overall the lip colored stayed on all day i would recommend you to buy this,45,39
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,applying lipsticks would not be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo,11,40
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,this is a terrific little addition to the make-up case it is a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great first you should use a cotton swab to apply it this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does it takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you will have a mess on your hands cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva not attractive but effective you can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process however the longer it stays on the better the results interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal on average thelasts around 8 - 10 hours with eating drinking and smoking I have recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more,165,41
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,terrible it feels like chalk on your lips,9,42
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,just received mine was very excited I am not allergic to anything put this product on my lips it is was burning and made my lips swollen will never try this product again,31,43
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love it i ordered the cherry red it is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying it came super early and in great condition it is a little smaller than i thought but it is worth it the application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous,57,44
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,seems like it would work really well but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency,19,45
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect,12,46
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,too thick to put on properly was hard to get out of the bottle the top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out which comes out in a giant messy blob it popped off and stained my nails and hands worst mess i ever paid for and if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off it stains your lips but it is a dry mess also do not use with your favorite lip gloss it will put theall over your wand,95,47
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,this product is alright it does drain the lips however it goes on clumpy and sticky and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips it takes forever to dry and it does not peel off like it is supposed to i would not recommend it also if you have cuts on your lips it may burn use with caution,63,48
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I am pretty satisfied with this product it is a bit tricky to apply because it is gooey so you have to apply in a quick swift motion i watched a tutorial on an application suggestion and that helped i left it on for 10 min and it dried with awesome results it delivered a nice deep cherry red it even stayed on even after eating dinner i would buy this again,71,49
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it works really well easy to apply if you just take your time and lasts a long time it also came earlier than expected,24,50
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it looks like i drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red it is nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade it is super splotchy plus you can not stay in the lines of your lips well at all and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry definitely not an on the go lipyou need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry not impressed at all,74,51
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,overall thelasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off which is a mess it just looks like I have had a glass of red kool-aid,45,52
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,highly recommended it is not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil aloe natural fruit essence and also with vitamin e i have very sensitive lips so i choose the lipstick that i am using jeny,39,53
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is thick and messyimpossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain there are much better choices i would not buy it again,27,54
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product i got it in cherry red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick and it is a pretty good sized tube I have only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all and it feels like you have nothing on my only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides of the top but it did not drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it was not a big deal I have been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding and this is definitely at the top of the list,115,55
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,very bad product tathurt my lips and blood came when i remove,12,56
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i got the cherry red i really like it isthe longer you have it on the darker it gets i really like it a lot,26,57
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,i think mine came defective the gloss came out of the tube extremely thick almost like old glue it was virtually impossible to apply theis pretty in the end but the mess is not worth it,38,58
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,so although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful,29,59
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,zero stars i was not happy with it at all i first seen it on facebook and it looked like something i would like but no i was safly wrong came late hard to put on dries way to fast and it does not taste very good,45,60
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it provides long lastingand safety on my lips every time i use it,15,61
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like this lipstick the only bad thing it is that is not very easy to apply the smell is delicious i would recommended if would be easier to apply and if it would not dry fast,35,62
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i live how it stays on all day,8,63

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,a great value and a terrificpayoff to be honest the only issue i had was waiting for the product because it did arrive a month late which does not surprise me since it only cost 3,37,66
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i received it today and tried it on and live it perfectit looks great,16,67
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,pros works really really well i applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain did not bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips and no transfer on my pillow either cons it tastes really bad like there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you do not get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste but i mean it is not meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault would i buy it again absolutely shipping was decent i ordered it the 26th of december and got it on the 4th of january,135,68
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,excellent receive the product in a perfect condition,8,69
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,as soon as i tried squeezing the product out applicator popped off and all of the product came out plus someone previously opened it because the safety seal was broken,30,70
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,super disappointed with this goes on the inside of my mouth when that is obviously not where I am placing it super icky and the stains i try to clean off from inside of my mouth causes the entire stain to be removed,41,71
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,went on thick and gloppy ugh not easy to apply at all very disappointed i do not recommend it,19,72
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,theis lighter than expected and does not stay longer,11,73
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,feels like glue and i do not know if it is toxic my teeth are pink s,15,74
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,nice kinda hard to rub an lips but it so awsome love the resolts,14,75
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like the fact that this lip tint gives you a vibrant natural rid lip tint it smells good but taste horrible I am glade i bought it it works with every skin tone including women ofladies i recommend this product,42,76
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,could not stand the feel of it while it was drying it grossed me out,15,77
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist my sister gave me some and i thought it was lip gloss got some out of the lines as it were and yes it definitely lasts my hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now if you can get it where you want it I am sure it would be a lasting and lovely lipbut you really need to get it on perfect the first time or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon,108,78
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it is a really cool concept the application however is a mess i would recommend using a qtip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube the stain does not turn out that red once it is peeled off it honestly looks like you just ate a popsicle so if you are into that look this product is for you overall it requires too much time to put on i have used it twice in the year that i have had it,83,79
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material does not seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,worst product i have ever purchased in my life not only is this a sloppy mess that does not really work but it burns to put on,26,81
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,love my new nail polish essie have a great selection of shades and i am very glad they have this one back,23,0
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,greatbut horrible formula it goes on thick and gloppy like a polish that has been sitting on a shelf for years i expected more from essie,28,1
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,i love thisI have heard a lot of complaints about the formula so i was worried when i ordered it but the bottle i got is a nice formula it is not jelly-like not thick it is great,37,2
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i love theand the consistency was ok for me but it does not wear well at all I have worn it twice and both times it chipped almost immediately I have only had it on for 36 hours and it looks like it has been on for a week it is so chipped this is not my usual experience with essie polishes,60,3
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i had the original chanel ciel de nuit back in the 90s and loved thei never had the original essie starry starry night but i bought the revival today and like all essie polishes i loathe the formula they are always streaky and clumpy and the brush is too small and hard to controlpayoff is good after two coats not as sparkly as the old chanel it knocked off but i would not re-buy about once a year i buy an essie polish and then remember why i hate them i should stick to zoya,97,4
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,all the colors are great but this one was the best,11,5
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,i am sure the formula is great but thejust did not work for me it was very shimmery and almost had a multisheen to it even my 2 14 yol twin daughters said it was too young for them however i am sure someone else will love thisi had really hoped it would be kind of a blush-champagnewhich it looked like in pix my bad,71,6
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,beautifulbut chips after two days even with expensive base and top coat,14,7
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,well it is a prettybut that is about it chipped of the first day and the gel formula was very difficult to work with,24,8
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,theis amazing i just love it so glad it came back,13,9
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,do not buy nail polish bottles arrived broken with nail polish coating everything and they will not honor a return,19,10
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,such a greatand really good coverage for a polish with glitter,13,11
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,greatbut chips way to easy i do wash hands a lot but not long lasting,17,12
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,love essie polish this particular mix is pretty thin but a couple of coats once dry is super cute will be using for the rest of the summer,28,13
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,the consistency was too tacky and it was not as shimmery as advertised i believe the original formula was better however one coat was ok for my toes,28,14
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i do not know why essie comes up in the luxury category I have never liked this polish the colors are mostly bland it chips quickly really this stuff is overpriced it is not terrible but it is not high quality either,38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,very prettyperfect for a suttle look,8,16
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure would not recommend i am not a fan of essie nail polish especially after buying this,24,17
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,i love essie their nail polish is one of the smoothest applications I have found thehas always been one of my favorite it is light yet striking i am normally not a fan of light colors but this one has always been elegant sophisticated and timeless i am so happy to have theback on the market,60,18
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,first essie polish of mine and i must say besides the formula being a bit thick it is a great polish overall 3,22,19
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,i have no issue with the coverage or consistency i took the polish to my favorite salon and had them do it however I am 26 and i think theis too blue for me maybe for new years or vegas but for work it is a little much looks like what a 16 year old would wear to a dance pretty but not for every day wear,66,20
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,got the nail polish when they said i would and it is great love theand the ease of putting it on,23,21
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,it certainly is not identical to the original but it is still a great polish semi-sheer gelly layer with slightly chunky square glitter it does resemble a night sky in a van gogh kind of way in that way this one is probably more appropriately named than the original lasted a normal amount of time and no staining,56,22
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,greati really like it the only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal i hate it,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,they were given as gifts they loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,not at all what i expected it is not navy or dark blue it is very much a bright royal blue and i guess all the sparkles in the polish adhere to the glass bottle or get completely buried under the blue because there were little to no sparkles on my nails if i had known this i would not have bought it because I have never used it,67,25
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,very thin formula it takes way too many coats for it to even look like you have nail polish on i would not recommend purchasing this one unless you want to go for a more natural look,37,26
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,very clumpy and goopy did not go on smoothly only used once,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,not what i was expecting at all usually essie colors are true tothis is one exception once applied theis iridescent with a lot of yellow greens tones and even with three coats it is still translucent i have a few other colors from this retro revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost 900 i paid,65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,love thiseven more beautiful in person,9,29
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,either i received the wrongor they are knowingly sending out something completely different i received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them no flowers or leaves at all and the beads do not even look like the little ones in the picture either so I am getting a refund for this disappointment,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,when i ordered these the description said silver the ones i got were gold they have since changed the description still i was not happy,25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,the gold on these pins is very yellowy gold i initially did not like theat all but they ended up being pretty in my hair so i wore them anyway for my wedding,34,2
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding the pins looked very cute i wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette and i gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well the pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding great product for a good price,66,3
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold overall it looked great and is reusable,26,4
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,I am actually pretty happy with these they are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I am not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy but overall it is not a huge issue they still look so pretty i used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well i plan to use them for my wedding now as well i do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well but i could not find them anywhere,89,5
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,i was looking forward to these and in the silver / white version and instead i got this ugly yellow golddisappointed will not use these,25,6
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,i got these to match my jewelry and maid of honor and they were perfect i loved them and they stood out nicely against my blonde hair they stayed in really well throughout the night and i got multiple compliments on them,42,7
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,these hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day during my trial my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle i bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair we decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive these hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost i definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day,103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the metal had a cheap look to it did not end up wearing it,13,9
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,they are very beautiful and of good quality unfortunately i only received 2 out of the 3 pins the package looked like it had been returned overall beautiful,28,10

All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,i ordered these for my wedding day and they worked great easily adjustable to perfect your look and such a nice but simple embellishment,24,12
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,the goldis very gold almost cartoonish gold but i have dark hair and the accentfor my wedding is gold so it will work out fine but it was a bit of a shock when i first saw it quality product,43,13

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,so cute i love them and so cheap good for bohemian look,13,0
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,they were really cute but left my fingers green,9,1
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is the green is not even noticeable if you leave the rings on and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I am still loving the others,43,2
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,i would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent not that it was a problem because i fixed it like that but still not the best quality,31,3
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,great gift good variety of rings with a nice finish worth the money by far,15,5

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,the rings snapped easily and the midi rings were not very adjustable,11,10
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,i totally thought these would be cute for the summer / pool / beach i would not want to take these in the water the paint on it is all chipped and cracking there were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area 3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not the ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we are not comfortable the metal is garbage the paint is chipping and the sizing is weird i might be able to use a couple as toe rings not worth what i paid for them,96,11
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,came in as pictures the material is not flimsy cute rings,10,12
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,they are made out of plastic reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old,16,13
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,so i received my rings early which was a big plus they came in a small package and i was very pleased to see that they were perfect although the rings seem to have the black paint chips or something like that stuck on the inside,46,14
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,they are cute they are super affordable they are just little trinkets after all i got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures / nail art I am doing for me not to wear for real,34,15
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,poorly made broke as i put them on the first time cute style it it was made out of something else dont waste your money,25,16
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,only one of them broke and i did not like that one anyway laughing out loud they are surprisingly sturdy for what you are paying they are all different sizes after a while thestarts to get a little coppery these rings are pretty good for the price,43,17
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,i like them but they came it says it came in from wish,13,18
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these are okay cheap metal so potential breaking,8,19
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,these are really cute they kind of bend but it does not seem to be a bad thing one of them bent almost all the way open while i was running around at work but it did not break as far as accent rings go they serve their purpose paint them with clear nailpolish so the will not make your fingers green,59,20
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,these rings are a cute design but the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers,29,21
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these rings are very cheap the metal is almost plastic-like the designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped only three of the six were sanded leaving sharp burs on the other three i am dissapointed but contented with the few rings of the set i can wear i would still buy from this seller as their service is wonderful and everything else I have bought from them has been excellent,76,22
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,i was so excited when i received these they are such a cute design but they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding / soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on,38,23
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,plastic like not what i expected most of them broke you get what you pay for,16,24
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,love these little rings but you get what you pay for all the open / adjustable rings break within the first two wears the solid bands are a bit stronger realize these are a trendy short term accessory,36,25

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,nice for the price some of the colors are pretty much the same so I am giving a few away as a gift to a friend feels good on lips not too glossy and not too heavy some do have a shimmer which i do not prefer but can deal with they did come early in mail but still took 3 1/2 wks to arrive overall I am happy with purchase,68,1

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,love the colors they glide on and feel very expensive,10,22
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,the colors are very pigmented and easy to apply but may have to apply more throughout the day because they are not long lasting other than that the lipstick containers are very cute and came quick,36,23

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,my order still says that the earliest it will arrive is feb 26th but here it is on the 25th which is nice the lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy they were all pretty colors but i guess because I am dark they do not transfer so well but whatever I am happy to have them either way they are not super pigmented when applied but that might be because of my skin the colors i wore were 10 first pic and 13 second pic edit I have concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others also known as the light pinks,104,27
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,these lipsticks were very cheap i used one once and it broke right off and the other have been very hard and do not apply very well i would not recommend this product at all,33,28
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,this is a complete waste of money they break easily and does not look well in dark skin women,18,29

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i was skeptical at first but i love azorro hair brush straightener it works super amazing wish it would let me post my picture with the before and after well worth the money and support is amazing,34,0
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,my hair is quite short so i use this on my top layers with much success on the shorties underneath i still have to hit it with the flat iron as my hair grows back out to chin length i look forward to only needing this brush it is quicker and effective,51,1
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it i really like it a lot it is a great addition to my styling products so it has a great feature of shut offing if it is not in use for a long time it heats up in seconds and keeps the temperature constant i love how it makes my hair look and feel i can do my hair in seconds,73,2
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,was not the same brush shown in the picture did not work when plugged in sent it back,16,3
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,horrible did not work and burnt my hair do not bother,9,4
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,pulled out my hair and did not straighten at all,10,5
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,does not work on curly hair as it states,9,6
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,this works great it is much better than a regular flat iron,12,7
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,heavy and awkward to use you almost can not use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings it does make a little difference but not enough to really notice the bristles will scratch your neck if not careful would not buy again,43,8
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i really like this brush and despite the fact that my hair is short it still worked quite well 10/10 would recommend to a friend,25,9
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,the product inside the box seemed like a duplicate brush did not have the temperature indicator on it plus did not even work when plugged in,26,10
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,hair does not get as straight as advertised it seems to snag african american hair,14,11
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,unbelievable piece of junk i used it maybe six times i wrote them and explained the condition of their product to them and they ignored me,26,12
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,this hair brush did not work for me and i would like to send it back,16,14
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,i was not sure this would work since i have extremely thick curly hair so here it goes it does work i let my hair dry naturally and used the ionic hair brush it really did work but not as well as my flat iron the pros is that is great for touchand it is easy to use this will be my everyday straightening tool but when i want pin straight hair i will continue to use my flat iron the cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and i may have to order another one for myself,103,15
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,love this product it heats quickly easy to use and provides great results worth the price,16,16
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,too heavy and bulky and I have burnt myself several times using it i only used it 4 times now it is collecting dust,21,17
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it works a bit better than i expected still experimenting,10,18
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,great for straightening your hair i use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron,26,19
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,like it just not pleased with the number of the heat overall it is good,14,20
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,did not work and my hair is not even curly just wanted it to smooth,13,21
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,works good on hair that is not too naturally curly,9,22
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,this brush works amazing on my course dry hair i only need to run it thru once and move to the next section of hair there is 1 draw back the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it,49,23
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,easy to use and i get great results which is important to me since i have very coarse frizzy kinky unmanageable hair,22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it was a gift for our daughter she tried it but it did not work on her hair it left it as frizzy as it was before she started,28,25
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it really works great but the only problem i have is the buttons should be in a different place because i held it i was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as i held it to do my hair other then that i do like it,55,26
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not impressed i have short hair with swoopy ends the brush is not able to do my ends at all,20,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,perfect it is a bit difficult to use on shorter hair but i did expect that,16,28
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not happy with the quality of this product at all and being i paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy,24,29
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i ended up returning it it was so big and bluky and it did not stop the frizz it actually made my hair more frizzy but the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair this would probably be perfect,46,30
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i am so happy that i bought this it really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener,25,31
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,it is an excellent concept but this brush just does not get hot enough to do my hair and i had it maxed at 415 i have thick long and kind of wavy hair and when i read the manual for the recommended heat and i had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10 times through the same section to get it even mildly straight plus i believe it states that it is static free def not,77,32
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i had some difficulty using the brush if my hair was not 100 dry and tangle free when using the brush i kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature i got this brush so that i could straiten my hair everyday but it is a bit to difficult to do that,51,33
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,it takes half the time to straighten my hair and not get burned,14,34
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,good morning i live in brasil and i boughy on my vacation after30 days it is broken and o use only 3 4 times i sent this product to my son he lives um united states is ir possble to change,42,35
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,works great my daughter has curly hair and this straightened it qith minimal frizz,14,36
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i purchased 3 two for me and 1 as a gift i hope it works but i used mine 1 time each they both stopped working amazon refunded my money and i bought a better unit thanks amazon,37,37
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this hot hair brush the power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush so you are constantly turning it off super poor design i had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush but i noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron it would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large even after straightening with a flat iron using the brush to give it some lift body and/or curl i just could not make it happen without investing much more time than i had patience,137,38
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it broke one week later when my aunt used it it is basically a blowdryer,14,39
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,gave as a gift did not get hot enough,8,40
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very very dim also thetemperature of the lights are cool blue wish i could return,17,0
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,this is such an awesomei do not have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup i hung this on the wall right next to where i have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows it has a light so it is very easy to see the one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows or eyeliner i put it up so the installation is very easy i received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,99,1
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,the amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate a good source of light from somewhere else close to your face is needed the hardware works well easy installation looks stylish useable area of mirror on the small side,48,2
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,just like in the hotel very nice and makes me feel pampered no more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and i love that it pushes back out of the way i would recommend this mirror lights up nicely i did receive a discount to review thisand this is my honest opinion not biased,60,3
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well mirror functions perfectly my problem is the lighting which i needed for shaving in a dark location i could use a brighter light hence a 4 against 5 batteries were not difficult to install overall a goodproduct,50,4
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,disappointed when i pull it out to use it will not stay in place,14,5
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,terrible product the quality of this mirror is awful i bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke and i thought the light would be great the light flickers and will not stay on and even for the few moments it is on it is so dim it is worthless i have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries not easy to do either and no improvement the mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good i tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply,101,6
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,i love this mirror i did not want to spend a ton it does exactly what i need it to looks great too,22,7
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,wall extension seems flimsy but i never got far enough to find out the battery case extremely difficult to twist open once it is the edges of the open case are sharp yep it cut me returned for refund,39,8
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror was easy to install and works fine but the reason we bought it was the lighting the leds are very dim and almost useless,26,9
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,mine appears to be defective needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror i could not do it myself also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation,33,10
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the product appeared to be exactly what i was looking for but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke there really is not kind of hack or easy fix either appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing,43,11
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,was what i wanted and worked great,8,12
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,broke rivit so need to send back,8,13
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,the screw jackets are hard to install but i do not fault the manufacturer for that i think it is my walls overall great purchase,23,14
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is just fine however the perimeter light is so soft or low that it is pointless do not buy this product for the light feature you will be disappointed,28,15
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirrors and extension are great the light is worthless,10,16
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,got this for my 92 year old dad so he can see better to shave works well and arrived on time,21,17
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,now i can see myself without my glasses,9,18
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it is very wobbly i could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries so i can not rate the usefulness of the lighted feature,35,19
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,good quality mirrors both the plain and magnifying sides good quality construction the light leaves something to be desired,19,20
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very flimsy and takes a long time to balance also poor lighting,13,21
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,great mirror the light is worthless do not buy it if you need a light,14,22
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,light is not bright magnification not good will give away,10,23
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,impossible to open the mirror to install the batteries i guess i have to return it worthless,17,24
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,works for our small bathroom not as bright as i hoped,11,25
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,it was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done the light is really quite bright not sure why others said the opposite installation was very easy and it seems well made not at all flimsy,41,26
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this product is heavy as it is expected to be but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better i have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and i am going to end up with 7 years bad luck the mirror is beautiful although and the led is just bright enough that i can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights overall i probably would buy it again I had just invest in a better mounting screw set,97,27
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the led light is not as strong as it sounds like it should be the construction is not all that sturdy either the mirror part is wobbly and I am always afraid it is just going to fall off onto the floor,38,28
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this mirror works great the light is not too bright,10,29
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,this has never worked the switch is bad and it will occasionally flicker but will not stay on,18,30
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,all in all it is decent for what it mainly is a mirror the magnification is exactly what i was looking for the light was a perk but it is not very bright and really does not light up anything extra that my bathroom light does not so i do not really use it the arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall it swings slowly back towards the wall but this could be from how it is mounted but basically it works just fine for what i need it for,89,31
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,the quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming / thinning / styling there is a lot of hair evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease it was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk the write up clearly states themay be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting the wig i see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights the wig i received is theof the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown if you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights you may be disappointed i like to play with different wig colors and styles and i am ok with theat this price you are getting a quality product and really can not go wrong unless you are not willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different,186,0
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,theis darker than expected with an auburn tint so it did not look quite right i donated it to a charity because it is pretty and well-made,28,1
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,loved it a little shorted than i expected but get lots of compliments,13,2
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,actually a very cute wig too small for my head,10,3
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,my mom loved the quality and fitting of her wig,10,4
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,wonderful wig fit very comfortable the style is well kept when you get get it and shake it i have to rinse it in water to rinse off some residual product that is on it but fine after that and the style holds brushing the wig makes it look even more satisfying these wigs exact same product are sold at a large online store for double the price buy it here you will love it,72,5
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,nothing like the picture too much hair on top looks silly andwas a red tint,17,6
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,did not look this good not nearly as full returned,9,7
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,way too dark for my complexion it is light brown not blonde at all i guess it is the lighting in the studio that makes it appear thus i had to return it,32,8

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,although the brushes were good the makeup was cheap heavy cakey thick and terrible,14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,this kit is very small everything is way smaller that you may think but the makeup itself is good quality the beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless i threw it away it is almost like a novelty toy the brush is great and so is the makeup but it is creme that means you have to put a few drops of water on theyou are using and water on the brush before using i really like the palette colors i would recommend for the price,87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like the tacky-ness of the product it really makes powdered colors stick and look vibrant the brush and sponge did not come with the makeup i received amazon refunded the money for thisback to me and said it was ok that i kept the product since i did not receive all the pieces this made the experience super positive for me i ended up spending more money on amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one,86,25

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,i would never buy this product again or recommend to anyone the creams are so terrible they can barely be applied they are not spreadable i might just throw this right out a day after it came in the mail so disappointing,41,48
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this sucked did not work at all i would never buy this again i was extremely dissapointed,16,49
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,the beauty blender was smaller than expected but everything else was perfectly fine and came on time,17,50

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this was terrible it almost looks like a kids set for makeup plastic i could not even use it really because the contour will not even come out of the circle with the brush do not waste your money,38,55
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,2.0,negative,it did not fit my bemis humidifier without modification i had to trim the little bead on theof the plug off and then it worked fine,27,0
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,2.0,negative,power cord unsuitable for appliance cord receptacle had to have polarizing feature cut out find an appliance parts dealer and buy without outrageous shipping and handling,26,1
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,4.0,positive,it looks like the cord that we need with the slot in it is no longer available i have read on other sites that people used a utility knife to cut the slot into this one and it worked fine when the part you need no longer exists you do what you have to do to make it work,59,2
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,1.0,negative,i just got my cord and it does not fit the filter is useless without a cord confirmation said it would fit all,22,3
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,1.0,negative,cord ordered does not fit bemis humidifier back and forth with seller he kept insisting it would work however it was missing a very important part the groove in the plug to fit into the back of the humidifer so much for that purchase,44,4
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,2.0,negative,this did not fit i sent it back and i am waiting for a refund,15,5
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,2.0,negative,website told me it would fitit did not i melted it and jammed it in to make it fit so it works but is not ideal,26,6
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,5.0,positive,i wanted black but they sent white bemis dis continued cord,11,7
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,5.0,positive,quality cord and no flaws shipped on time as other reviews say i had to use a knife to remove the rubber between the two female receptacles in the plug so the cord would fully engage this was acceptable to me and not a big deal,46,8
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,4.0,positive,the cord is not an exact fit you need to cut a small grove to make it fit in humidifier and it will work,24,9
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,4.0,positive,this cord worked for us we needed a cord for our bemis humidifyer and somehow over the course of the summer we misplaced the power cord i was grateful that i was able to purchase just the cord otherwise i would have had to purchase a new humidifyer,48,10
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,5.0,positive,because i was prepared that this was not exactly the cord for the bemis unit i have from previous feedback on amazon and that a modification to the end of the cord that plugs into the unit had to be made all is well i am happy with the purchase and would recommend this product to anyone who is in need of a power cord that bemis is not supplying any longer the modification makes it work perfectly,76,11
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,5.0,positive,just what we needed to put our humidifier back into action our power cord had accidently been tossed in a clean out and we were facing a new humidifier for 150 200 found this cord and we saved big time i would definitely recommend this buyer and this product speedy delivery was great,54,12
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,1.0,negative,buyer beware this cable says it fits bemis humidifiers and that is untrue you will get a white cable in the mail if you order this product and it is incompatible with a bemis and is made to fit honeywell brand humidifiers do not buy thisunless you want to get ripped off and the photo above product listing is deceiving because it does not show the correct chord that will be sent to you,76,13
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,4.0,positive,as previous reviewers said you need to doctor it up a little in order for it to fit into the bemis 600 series motor take a dremel tool with a very small round spherical drill bit grind a small groove on one side of the plug between the 2 female plugs about 1/4 long the whole process will take five minutes,61,14
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,4.0,positive,you need to cut a groove in the appliance cord end for polarity no big issue for a rotary tool or something with a mild removal effect razor blade i used a 3 cut off wheel tool air powered to make a small groove on the outside of the appliance cord end to somewhat match the end of the old cord and note the polarity wide outlet tang to the same wire on the appliance end to match the groove you need to cut,82,15
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,1.0,negative,power cord does not fit my bemis humidifier too much trouble to return it,14,16
Appliances,B0006HKZ2U,5.0,positive,works just great for delivering electricity from my wall outlet to my humidifier,13,17
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,this thing is awful it does not connect securely to my dyson for an airtight fit it is permanently bent and a pain to use i can not get it to suck hardly any lint I am too busy trying to hold one end connected to my vacuum i hate it worst money i ever spent,54,0
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,i purchased this after thinking that since we have bought our house we have never cleaned the dryerand who knows the last time the previous owners cleaned it so i sat down one saturday morning to clean it all out starting with the shorter brush and vacuum connector i cleaned out the dryer itself the best i could it was amazing how much junk came out of it then i moved on to the in wallmy house has about 15 feet of dryerin the wall after working the brush around in thefor about 5 minute i removed the brush and then it immediately fell off the wire extention this could have been disasterous had it fallen off inside of the wall i made due to get the rest of the lint out of theusing things i had laying around the house but i would not recommend this product to anyone,160,1
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,i read a negative review on thisand figured there was no way it could be that bad i was right in part it was actually worse than the review i read the cable for the brush is not stiff enough to do anything it simply bends like a wet noodle i do not even dare try the brush for the vent hose as it fell off in my hands the vacuum attachement is folded up and when you try to use it the area where it bends collapses so you can not vacuum anything you will find that using an empty paper towel tube less aggravating to use instead of this poorly conceived contraption,113,2
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the plastic brush rod has not the strength to stay straight and move the brush through ductwork it remembers it is coiled shape and broke when attempting to straighten it out,29,3
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,this is awesome it was able to break through an 8 inch lint block in my dryer vent line and possibly prevented a fire,24,4
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the brushes are ok but the vacuum attachment is plastic came folded and cracks on each fold,17,5
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,the way they fold this flat vacuum tool it closes the opening to vacuum also the long vent tube brush created a block by pushing lint all up to a point of complete blockage instead of loosening it to be removed the little brush was pretty good,47,6
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,complete set to keep the dryer free of lint great product,11,7
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,this lint removal system does work but it is not as easy as you might think the end does get caught in places when pushing it down into the back of the dryer through the lint trap i did get it out although and it did have lint on it i will use it again,54,8
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,this works exactly as described i only wish it was longer it also has a bit of trouble going around sharp turns,22,9
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the vacuum attachment does not work diameter of the vent brush is less than 4 the wire is very stiff and does not go around corners can not recommend this,28,10
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,pos when used it came apart so a easy job turned into a complete disassemble of the dryer vent and wall clean,22,11
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,universal vacuum hose attachment is not universal does not fit my dyson,11,12
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,i wish i could have the time back that i spent trying to use each of these ineffective tools i would have used it toward the time required to do the job right save your time and money take your dryer apart and vacuum out the vent it is a dozen bolts and 40 minutes of your time the universal vacuum attachment did not fit our vacuum all the other tools simply pushed the lint further into an area that could only be reached by removing the vent,86,13
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,received quickly and as described was able to clean out the lint receptacle and rest easier,16,14
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product packaging was the first issue the tube was so badly kinked i still have not been able to get it straightened out the second issue is that the tube does not fit my vacuum before you comment on this i have a variety of vacuums and i was concerned about damaging vacuum s or product i was finally able to force the product onto an older vacuum i have when i used it in my dryer lint catcher i did not get anything at all i wonder if this is the norm for most dryers the advertisement led me to believe i would get tons of lint out last the flat tube of the product did not fit under either my washer dryer refrigerator or oven overall i am very disappointed in this product i gave 1 star rating because i was unable to leave a no star rating,153,15
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,do no buy unless you want to spend your day taking apart your dryer first the vacuum attachment did not fit on my vacuum hose the attachment has 3 pieces the small piece on the end of the rubber attachment fell off inside the lint trap took 3 hours to get it out would have ruined my dryer and possibly have caused fire if someone tried to run dryer not knowing called customer service and took 4 calls just to get someone to talk to me save yourself the trouble and a ruined daybuy a different kit,96,16
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,amazing got out years of lint trapped way down where you can not get to,14,17
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,worked perfectly the long wire helped me get a ton of lint out of my metal hosing,17,18

Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,great product clean my vents with no issues,8,20
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,it works pretty well the brush on the end really loosens up the lint i do wish the wire was a little firmer,23,21
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,the three attachments that came in this kit worked fine i was very pleased with the end result yes the hose attachment was folded in the box but when i took it out of the box i inserted a yardstick into it so it would reshape the next day i took the yardstick out and it worked just fine it really came in handy in sucking the loose lint out of the dryer itself it worked well with our shop vac all in all i was very pleased with my order,90,22
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,apparently works well husband uses it and has no complaints,10,23
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,this product was very useful in cleaning my dryer,9,24
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,did the job it was designed to do my problem was more extensive than this tool was designed for but it did get all the lint from the back of the dryer and the lint that was stuck in the vent from the wall but my clog was further up into the wall,53,25
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the vacuum hose attachment arrived folded to fit in the box this is not flexible plastic and where it had bent it had also cracked i tried to seal the cracks up with some glue but it still did not work the places where the vacuum attachment had been folded worked like kinks and kept the air from moving since the plastic is not flexible i can not un-kink the vacuum attachment the plastic just cracks more i attached it to my shop vac but it could not suck air past the kinks the way the vacuum hose attachment arrived made it useless the brushes however did work fine,105,26
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the wire was to stiff for manipulating the brush thru the vent stack total waste of money,17,27
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,opening is very thin so have to have good suction from vacumn and hose does not fit my shark,18,28
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,you will be amazed at how much debris that you get out of your dryer,15,29
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,not worth it poorly made the second time that i used this the round brush separated from the handle i thought that i was going to have to take the drywall down to retrieve the brush because it was beyond my reach lucky with a claw device i was able to retrieve the detached brush would not use this again and would purchase another product,65,30
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,did not need to use the hose piece but the brushes worked very well worth the price and good product hoses did not fit my machine dyson roller ball but I am sure it would work ok on a normal machine my machine was fine without the hose tho and i really just wanted the brushes anyway,54,31
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,does what i need it to do without searching for the right tools or object,15,32
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the metal cord on the vent brush was coiled and impossible to straighten out enough to be useful sent it back,21,33
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,the vacuum attachment took some finagling to work with my shark pro but the crud it sucked out was amazing,20,34
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,wish there was a zero star option the vacuum attachment cane cracked i fixed with tape and managed to at least use it for a bit before the hose jammed it is such flimsy plastic that it just broke down the middle i was not even eligible for return,48,35
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,dryer was taking longer to dry used this and saw why,11,36
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,works as made shipped in smallest box possible causes everything to be curled up and smashed it will never be straight as when made causes some problems,26,37
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,sadly this kit was terrible the person who wrote a raving review of this product on pinterest should be ashamed of herself i actually feel like i was taken advantage of by wasting my money on this kit the flat black hose is made of paper thin plastic that cracked immediately making it unusable the brushes are attached to very flimsy wire which offers very little rigidity making it extremely difficult to feed the brush into the areas of the drier where lint gets trapped i tried really hard to get the brushes to work effectively but eventually gave up feeling totally defeated i will never recommend this kit to anyone,111,38
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,cleaned my dryer nicely helps to avoid lint fires,9,39
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,this was not as flexible as advertised i found it difficult to turn as the steel wire was not flexible do you have a more flexible wire i would like to return / exchange,32,40
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,rery easy to use and does a good job,9,41
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,i bought this kit because i know my dryer is most likely full of all sorts of lint and dirt i clean the grate regularly but our clothes are taking longer and longer to dry however this kit was not easy to use and hardly got out any dirt or lint and the vacuum attachment claimed to be universal but it did not fit the hose on our vacuum altogether i am very disappointed,74,42
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,great concept the flat tube that u use for the dust removal came folded up to fit in the box the tube is so cheaply made that it collapsed at the folds and will not re-instate so to speak will look for a suitable replacement as the concept is good,50,43
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,buy the gardus lint eater instead chuck it into a drill and feed it in the reach of thebrush is limiting to me since i need about 20 to get the entirecleaned and it is not very easily used the lint eater can have extensions added to make it as long as you need the black corigated lint trap attatchment does not fit my shop vac but the bigger issue was that it was folded so tightly in thee places to fit in the packaging that it cracked so it had air leaks making it nearly useless the rat tail brush is nice although,107,44
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,just used and it really did the job i just wish the cable was about another foot longer but everything worked,21,45
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,was not great the plastic covering came off the long brush and was afraid it would rip the aluminum tubing so stopped and the long thing to clean under the dryer was bent so it did not work,36,46
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,exactly as described have not actually used it yet,9,47
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,waste of time the tube that was supposed to clean out the lint was bent in half when shipped so it could fit in the box but of course that just made the opening even narrower which resulted in it picking up nothing at all think like when you kink a hose and no water comes out the brush was not that great either my tip is to use your vacuum cleaner attachments as they will probably do a much better job,80,48
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the tip of the vacuum attachment fell off inside my dryer and caused a 200 repair,16,49
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,used it once worked pretty good was disappointed at small amount of lint recovered since my dryer has not been cleaned this way in 12 years,26,50
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,barely worked was so kinked that i had to continually bring it out and try to get the suction to work again,22,51
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,i wish i loved it i am so disappointed in this purchase i would high recommend not purchasing this the primary reason i would not purchase again is that the vacuum hose is constructed from dollar store type plastic the type that cracks when it kinks well it comes folded in three sections in the box and i had to mold it as i was vacuuming for it to suck a tiny dust ball the kinks made it very difficult to use then after three minutes of attempted suction the plastic in the kink from the fold cracked i am so bummed i wasted money on this i ordered it and have been visiting my hubs overseas so i have not had a chance to use it until after the return period passed,135,52
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the vacuum attachment was folded in the package it never rounded out enough to provide suction so basically it did not work,21,53
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,works great the tube that attaches to the vaccum is a bit small but it works great with some tape over it,23,54
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,the brush set works as advertised i docked it a star because the vacuum attachment does not fit tight on my vacuum and it comes folded up in such a way that it is kinked it was still usable just not ideal,40,55
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,i could not believe how much lint came out of the foot-long hose and out of the body of my dryer i had just moved into the house and it was really a fire hazard i am so glad to have this product i am going to share it with my daughter next,52,56
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,great price and they worked when i cleaned my dryer vents,11,57
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,this was a disappointment in that only 2 of the tools would work for me the little brush and the dryer hose brush the vacuum attachment would not fit my vacuum which is the tool i really wanted to be able to use maybe it fits some vacuums but it did not fit mine,54,58
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,works fantastic probably saved my house from burning down shop vac recommended to get all the lint out,18,59
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,the two brushes are fine they met my expectations the vacuum attachment is terrible although it comes coiled in the box and the plastic is permanently creased out of the box after about 5 minutes of use those creases were already cracking the other annoyance is it just did not attach to my vacuum my vacuum hose and three attachments were just not sized for this thing to attach to it would be loose in the wide ends and not big enough to fit around the small ends of the attachments in the end i do not expect the cheap plastic to hold up for more than one or two more uses so i guess i will not have to make it work much longer I had recommend just buying brushes separately,129,60
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,the flattened vacuum hose clogged easily and then flattened itself was not very useful the skinny long brush was useful in loosening lint i probably would not buy this kit again,29,61
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,brushes are great attachment not so great hole is to tiny to pass anything,15,62
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,the long and short brushes worked great i did not like the plastic flat hose for two reasons it kept falling off the vacuum hose fit is too loose the hose was not pliable enough the way it was packaged put bends in the hose resulting in poor suction and lint removal,52,63
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,this gets that extra fine lint that the regular lint filter does not pulled alot of dirty lint out grains of sand with lint on them have the vacuum ready,30,64
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,i tried to figure out how this thing work but i can not,12,65
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,useless the cable is not flexible it is a couple of stiff steel thin bars encased in a clear plastic tube it can not go around a 90 degree right angle turn i guess it would be ok for a straight run but any stick 10 long is good for that only ten feet my vent is over 15 feet so it is too short for most applications the brush is too soft the vaccum tube is crushed by being folded in the package i bought this at the local store and returned it piece of junk usually just a shop vac can suck and blow the lint right out and/or for 10 bucks i bought the nylon electricians fish tape and tape a brush or lump of cloth and snake with that it is super flexible,133,66
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,the brushes worked great the vacuum cleaner attachment that is supposed to be universal did not fit either of my vacuum cleaners that are very standard the extra long handle for the pipe brush was what made this purchase 5 stars,41,67
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,vacuum attachment came already broken where the bend is brush coil not sturdy enough gets stuck,16,68
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,happy with the 2 brushes but disappointed with the vacuum attachment it was bent and would not straighten out nicely for cleaning it also would not fit my vacuum hose nozzle if i want to use it i need totape it i would not buy again,48,69
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,good tools to have if you want keep your home safe,11,70
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,the hose cracked on first use theis great but the components weak dryers certainly need to be hosed out,21,71
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,did not really buy it to work with a dryer but in cleaning out our auxiliary pellet stoves nooks and crannies it was perfect of course used in a cooled down not hot coal area at all on the pellet stove but perfect,42,72
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,i really like the brushes that come with it the vacuum part does not work for me my vent has three curves in it one being a right angle and it does do a goo cleaning for me the only draw-back is the the vent brush is not long enough for my vent it would be nice if i could get an extension to push the brush end to the outside end of my vent,75,73
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,kit was as described and worked very well to clean out lint trap and hose howeve the vaccuum cleaner attachmetn does not fit my vacuum cleaners,26,74
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,this cleaning kit worked well and cleaned my vent very clean this is also very easy to use i think the dryer is working better now,26,75
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,definitely worth the price compared to a service call to clean out the clogged dryer ventto the outdoors we did have to work from both ends of theto remove the lint clog cons these tools were so compressed and folded up to fit into a very small box from the manufacturer that it was hard to un-spring them to use as tools it would have been helpful to know that one must turn the extension brush only clockwise in theor the brush will un-screw from it is cableprobably in the middle of thelength somewhere in the end these tools did the job,111,76
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,as in the picture there is a snake-like wire which is the primary tool you can reach a fair bit into the dryer to a particular point it works pretty well but will not clean out the dryer to an as-new quality,41,77
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,one of the tools worked ok the vacuum attachment did not attach and did not work particularly well,16,78
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,works very well always clean your dryer vent and inside and the vent hose too,15,79
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for the vacuum attachment comes folded in four which leads to creases and prevents suction and weakens the plastic the piece broke on the very first use at multiple folds and along the sides the brushes are brushes,44,80
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,the vacuum tube is pinched closed at the folds where it was boxed and keeps clogging and getting sucked flat,20,81
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,does not fit standard vacuums as advertised no suction,9,82
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,vacuum attachment is not wide enough to suck anything up into the vacuum,12,83
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,brushes work as expected the hose attachment does not suck you know the one job it is supposed to do,18,84
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,1.0,negative,really disappointed this did not come with the fruit / veg slider bar defeats the purpose tricky to switch out without breaking the plastic,21,0
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,5.0,positive,fit my drawer for the fridge perfectly i had a question and it was answered very quickly also,17,1
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,1.0,negative,the drawer was the correct size but it was missing the humidity control so it did not function as needed i returned thein the original box with the return authorization from unlimited appliances on 12/7/16 and am still waiting for my refund not happy,45,2
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,2.0,negative,arrived broken and no slide for the front,8,3
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,it was fine except for the fact it did not come with the slider component i had to remove off old crisper and install on new,26,4
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,5.0,positive,exact fit excellent help with getting the right figment,9,5
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,good replacement for the oem drawer which seemed a bit flimsy right off the bat hence it broke and needed to be replaced,23,6
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,1.0,negative,arrived missing the fruit and veggies slider and all other plastic moving parts,13,7
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,5.0,positive,fits my refrigerator model as noted easy to install competitive pricing and delivery as promised the adjustment tab had to be removed from old unit and broke on removal could be better if this unit came with crisp adjuster,39,8
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,i can totally pull it in and out of my fridge it is like it was made to go there what will they think of next fyi although it is only the drawer rip all the fancy bits off the old one and put them on this replacement or you will not have as amazing of an experience as I am having and do not be a slob clean those fancy bits first before reusing them,71,9
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,5.0,positive,this drawer was a perfect replacement for the one that was broken,12,10
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,giving this drawer a 4 because it fit perfectly in my ffhs2612ls4 frigidaire refrigerator shipping was also quick and had no damage only issue is that you have to purchase the humidity control lever separately frigidaire 240362201 slide refrigerator and there are no instructions on how to attach it to the drawer which made things unnecessary frustrating once i figured out how to do it although it was very easy just insert the handle portion of the lever through the back of the left side hole on the drawer give it a little twist until it sits in the hole correctly and then you should be able to snap the right side clips into the right side slider hole,121,11
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,5.0,positive,it was a pain and pretty expensive to have to replace a drawer in the fridge but this one fit perfectly was delivered quickly and was the lowest price around worked great,32,12
Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,some people have given this product a low rating because it does not come with the slider bar but this is not the fault of the product nor seller that piece is sold separately which could perhaps be made more clear but that is a standard practice if you look up the parts to your refrigerator you will see that each and every piece is sold separately if you want the slider you have to order that and connect it yourself this product is exactly like the one i am replacing so i gave it a high rating the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it is made of plastic and cracks fairly easily hence the reason i had to replace it,125,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i was very happy with these buttons for crafting thank you for having these buttons available when i needed them,20,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,i bought these buttons to add to a cardigan I am making they are a good size for womens or childrens clothes there was a sticker on the package that said 279 so I am not sure why they cost a dollar more than that if you have a good craft store around where you could get buttons for cheap you could probably find a comparable product i bought these online because the local craft store has pretty high prices and these were a better value,84,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,great for little projects especially baby items there were two different sizes of white two different sizes of black and one size of clear i ordered these not know what size they would be because i did not see it anywhere on the description i would order them again,48,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,too small i needed to sew some new buttons onto my winter jacket but these certainly were not the buttons for the job the sucked poor enterprise,27,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,nice mix of black and white buttons sizes are pretty standard and just what i was looking for delivery was a little slow,23,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this purchase i had ordered these in 7 different colors thinking i could do a lot of crafts with them after arriving 3 days after they were supposed to i was not happy to see how small the amount of buttons was and how many of those few came already cracked and broken what bothered me the most is that i paid over 6 for each package then saw that it has 229 printed on the label you are better off getting a better deal at the dollar store,93,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i have nothing bad to say i ordered 130 black and white buttons and got 130 black and white buttons,20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,it is really hard to find basic buttons at a good price these days but as usual found it at amazoncom used a lot and still have plenty more in the pack than it looks like in the picture,38,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,they will work very well for a the need i have for them without a doubt,16,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i received these today and instantly did a product refund they are smaller than what i need and to make sure i did not miss something i went back to the post to see if there was a size and there was not one listed it did say mini i guess i just missed it in the detailed description then the package it came in says 229 for the price if you are going to sell something to make profit from it maybe take the original price off since i paid 536 what a waste of my time waiting for these to arrive now i need to go to the store to find better buttons boo,113,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,buttons are very very small not many matches disappointed,9,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,the buttons are mostly very thin and no traditioal hour hole buttons were included only two hole very disappointing,19,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,i have no complaints about these boxes i have to use them for larger photos although because i found none that would hold 8x10s exclusively this is larger but will serve the purpose,33,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,perfect for storage i am using them to store each of my four childrens pictures and moments until i can get to putting them in a book they look nice on the bookshelf and are sturdy,36,3

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,2.0,negative,the box is fine but giving it 2 stars because it is misleading in the picture is 5 boxes says assorted colors in description and features it keeps saying boxes it did not specify one box and there were other sets of 2 - 5 that were similar in price but they were plain if i had known it was one i would have gone with the plain ones,65,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,i only received one box nowhere does it say only one box comes and you do not get to choose thethe picture shows six boxes and the ad says assorted colors buyer beware not worth the money for one box that looks used with marks all over it,50,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,very misleading thought i was purchasing 6 boxes as well should have read the comments before ordering,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,2.0,negative,i must have missed something i thought all 5 boxes were included when it stated it came in assorted colors,20,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,lovely box i thought i was getting the set of boxes shown especially since it did not ask forchoice the price for one box is not marvelous and i thought i was getting a great value for the six,40,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,yep a single storage box for 16 not the 6 shown in the picture deceptive,15,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed i thought that i was ordering assorted storage boxes and i received one dark blue box i will be returning it not worth the 15 price,30,11

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,5.0,positive,product fit the bill for the project in hand just remember to let the stencils dry out after use or they will tear easily,24,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,not worth the money only good for one use do not recommend if you have to tape letters together,19,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,awful awful awful absolute wast of money i did not think anything could be cheaper than thin paper but these were,20,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,4.0,positive,it is difficult to use this with spray paint it is hard to keep the entire stencil on the surface you want to stencil which allows the paint to pool and run they do work but it might be better to use a brush or paint sharpie I am still messing with different techniques,51,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,4.0,positive,these should be good for a few uses for the price that should be all that is reasonably expected,19,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,perhaps i received a bad package but over half of my letters were not punched out i did not return them because i had a craft fair the next day and did not have time to find new ones i went through each one with a utility knife to cut them out,52,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,a lot of the stencils were not perforated enough to punch the letters out i used a straightrazor to cut through on some of them but i should not have to do that in the first place i tried to return them but it saidwas not eligible for a return i guess at only 3 and change it is not that big a deal but i wish i had not ordered 2 packages of them,74,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,these stencils are really only good for one use i was hoping to use them in my classroom but after the first time of using them with washable markers these paper stencils have started to fall apart if you are only expecting to use them one time then these may be fine,51,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,they are horrible if you get paint on them they are paper do not recommend them,15,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,very cheep looking i guess since it was inexpensive i get what i paid for,16,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,I have lost count as to how many buttons I have thrown in a drawer in hopes to get to it and fix the garments that had lost them after a long period of procrastination i broke down and bought this to remedy the growing collection of items that were not being worn due to this issue below are the pros and cons pros compact and clever folding box lots of colors to choose from plenty of needles and other accessories cons kind of cheap quality ie the mini scissors barely work the rest is not bad the compact cute box i spoke of came slightly broken one of the hinges was broken but that could be due to usps being careless and throwing things around the box still folds fine just when it is open kind of goes off line all in all for 10 bucks you can not complain,145,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,i was looking for a small sewing box for the small amount of simple sewing that i do and this fit my needs perfectly it is well-organized and compact,28,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,great product for the price and useful especially for a student or a single person who needs an occassional button to sew on and more,24,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,is a bit small but you get what you payed for,11,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i thought i was getting a seriousat a good price but no this is about the size of a square box of kleenex the spools are tiny and the rest is just cheap junk my fault it was absolutely too good to be true,46,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,save your money i was very disappointed with this product the threads are the cheap ones you would get with a travel sewing kit the scissors would not cut even the inferior thread if they had to i opened it once and then the case pretty much fell apart there is no part of this product that is even mediocre if i could i would have given it no stars at all especially for the money this product is not up to the typical amazon sellers quality i am returning for refund today,92,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,this kit had nothing to do with sewing machines wanted to get a cheap starter kit to go with a sewing machine purchase it arrived in good condition but the contents are almost useless the scissors can not cut thread once again the title of this product is misleading it has nothing to do with sewing machines at all,58,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,i gave this to my granddaughter that was starting college she was so happy with it very compact but has a lot in it great sewing kit for where space is limited,32,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,this is such a small box really thought it would be bigger box,13,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,cheap poor thread like you would expect in a travel kit but too big to be used as a travel kit,21,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,the worst it fell apart in my hands so small it should stay together it is made of the cheapest brittle thin plastic they counted each straight pin and the measuring tape is made of paper so you will know what a real one looks like i did not expect much but i thought at least it would come in a case i could refill was i wrong the box is the best part,73,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,I have been looking for a compact sewing box kit to have around the house i can not count how many times I have needed to sew on a button or fix a piece of clothing only to find that I have misplaced the string or the needles this set is perfect because everything you might need in a clothing emergency you will find in this set it comes with 24 different colors of thread 30 needles and a bunch of buttons safety pins and little tools i love that the box folds out the way it does it makes it easy to open up the little compartments or choose which spool of thread to use i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review in my opinion this is a great kit to have around the house i will definitely be buying one for my mom,150,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,this little compact foldaway is so cute it is compact but not super small it has everything you need for simple repairs and stitching garments i love using this sewing box it has all the normal colors that would be needed for just about everything has a few different types of needles and has other pieces to fix buttons latches and more i received this product for my honest review the price is extremely worth the product i recommend this to anyone and everyone it should be a necessity for everyone is home,92,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,i got this product at a discount for my unbiased review these views are my own i love this little box it compact but opens up to has so many thing anyone would need to fit a garment i was surprised at how many thing can in this little box from buttons to pins to hooks i was impressed i would give this as a gift to anyone whom is moving out for the first time of travels a lot,80,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,love wverything it came with perfect if you need an emergency kit for your car or office perfect just to have next to the machine as well very handy,29,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,the smartec compact foldaway sewing box kit is a cute little kit that contains the essentials to do minor repairs like sew a button back on or replace a snap but the sewing scissors that came with it are more a childs size than useful the small spools of thread that came with it break easily the plastic case seems brittle and would probably break if bumped or dropped and the sliding plastic closures are difficult to close once you have opened it i could not call this a serious sewing kit the size and brittle nature of the it is plastic construction would make it a poor choice as a travel kit and i would be very leery of giving this to any child due to the number of small easily swallowed accessories it contains if you need to buy agift for someone then this will work for you the rest of us might want to continue shopping aroundprovided at discount for my honest evaluation no obligations my review is based upon my examination evaluation and actual experience in using the product,186,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,i should have closely read the dimensions of this box it is great if you are looking for a small sewing kit,20,17

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i had a box that was this same design back in the 70s and 80s it finally broke down due to old age and much use so when i saw this one i was excited to be able to replace it this is not the same it just looks the same it is a scaled down child size version of the real thing the outside slot in this one will barely hold a slim note pad in the original the outside slot was big enough to hold 1 or 2 full sized sewing patterns the spools of thread in this one are teensy toy spools just enough thread on each one to sew on a couple of buttons the original held full sized spools of sewing thread if you want a stocking stuffer for a child fine but anyone who has any sewing acumen will scoff at this ridiculous gimcrack being called a sewing kit,155,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,this is a cheap sewing kit but that is exactly what i wanted i love how there are so many different colored spools the scissors are not that sharp but either use them or use your own pair i love how it folds up for easy storing however when you go to close it and lock it by sliding the little tabs be gentle i accidentally slid mine right off and had to fight with it to pop the tab back on i adore all the cute little compartments for organizing perfect for every once in a while sewing i would not recommend getting this if you are a high end sewing person or like to sew a lot however i would recommend getting this if you need to sew on buttons or holes every once in a while I am happy with my cheap little sewing kit,147,21

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,when i closed the box for the first time the plastic hinge snapped immediately i could not believe how this sewing box is so poorly made and constructed i believe it is such a waste of time to create a box that holds usable products but breaks instantaneously sewing is a work of art and it requires a duty box to hold the threads and sewing supplies truly i was very disappointed,72,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,it is really small and feels cheap it has a ton of different stuff a sewer may need but they are all tiny and break easily this might be good for a teenager or younger but even if you are a beginner this is not something you should spend money on you will need to replace everything in there for bigger and better things in about 1 week just save and buy everything separately or a better kit,75,29

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,I am certainly not a seamstress nor a serious sewer i just needed something that my boys and i could use to fix buttons hems split seams and more and this does it it is got all the items one will need to keep on top of those little emergencies it is got safety pins thread scissors they are very poor scissors but they cut the thread as needed snaps hooks and eyes needles and more all in a compact little box if you are looking for something serious look elsewhere but for the rest of us this has it all,94,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,i purchased thisfor my 10 year old niece who has just recently shown an interest in learning to sew i was not with her when she opened it but was told that she screamed hugged it and began to explore it is contents immediately i feel like this kit was a perfect starter kit although after it arrived i was a little surprised by the size when checking it out on line i thought it was much bigger overall very pleased with the purchase,85,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,the threads that come in this are the only type that fit in this and are the small kind the small white side pannels are decent for storing very small amounts of tiny things like bra clasps or button snaps i took these off and purchased a large briefcase and some normal sized craft boxes and thread cases and placed the small white sides in my kit to hold small button snaps thiswill not fit a normal size seam ripper or tiny pair of scissors there is a piece of plastic that is raised in the storage compartment that makes it too snug to even fit a circular pack of hand sewing needles this is not something i would recommend to someone who is serious about sewing or even a beginner i am miffed i spent over 200 for thisbecause i have seen better containers at the dollar store,153,42

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,I have searched for a while for a mini sewing kit to have on hand to fix things and came across this the sewing kits accessories are in-fact sturdy it is not a cheapat all i have absolutely no issues with it and i handle it just as rough as i would a lerge sewing kit there are various colors to use and the thread is strong and the needles are all durable and different sized I have hemmed several pairs of slacks adjusted belts and even fixed a few of my daughters outfits with this sewing kit i am very satisfied with my purchase and the tiny plastic scissors work just fine just use the tips of your fingers,120,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,theis very small about one quarter the size i had expected with little timy spools of thread that have enough thread to make one minor repair i was really shocked by th size of the box although it is made rather well i just was not expecting a doll size sewing kit it would make a nice sewing kit in a barbie doll house,66,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,pretty good for the price a few of the sewing needles were rusty and one side of the kit broke after the first time that i used it the kit has all of the tools to get the job done so overall it is a good deal for the price,50,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,I am a bargain shopper and thought i was getting a good deal the product arrived as described however the quality was horrible the eyes of the needles are barely big enough to fit the thread the threader broke right away and the quality of thread was poor i give it up for the entrepreneur who can source product from china but can not give a good review if the product does not meet the bar,73,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i was sent the wrong product it took them ten days to refund my money and then they told me to order it again instead of just offering to resend me the correct product why would i want to order it again when they will just send the wrong product again it does not make sense,55,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,due to the very low quality plastic construction the case arrived in several pieces but the contents made the case seem well made by comparison it is a childs toy sewing kit especially the scissors i had a pair just like them in my kindergarten crayon box really the whole thing is a useless joke i took one look at it and set up a return through amazon you will not like or find this product remotely useful unless you are five years old and want to pretend you are sewing,87,50

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,i was looking for a sewing kit that had all the necessities such as needles pins varied thread buttons scissors and measuring tape as well as a good variety of notions there is a great variety of notions which i frequently need but hate to buy a large package for one or two uses this fills the bill i have gone to it numerous time for some smalland it has not failed me yet that said i should point out that the case is not very well made it is fine to sit on the shelf and use at home but do not travel with it as i expect it would fall apart also when you do use it open it carefully as it may come apart none-the-less i would buy it again just for the large variety of items it contains,142,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,it is made from cheap materials and is not high quality string or anything but it meets my expectations for the price,20,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,disclaimer i did not buy this on amazon i bought it through one of those websites that offer a daily deal I have learned to check amazon to see if amazon sells it for same price many times amazon does and to read the reviews reading the negative reviews would have saved me frustration this is awkward to open awkward to close the small thread spools fall off as you open the stand-up for sided case i just used it and one of the sides just fell off i was able to fit it back on but i expect the hard plastic lever pins will break off and then I shall have to throw the whole thing away save yourself the 12 cost here and go to your nearest dollar store for needles thread pins and a plastic lidded box and you can save 8 and have bigger sized needles thread pins,150,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this very very small and cheap a person would be better off to wait for a sale and create there own i gave this as a gift to my 8 year old niece and it is not impressive i should have known i thought maybe the case would at least be bigger,57,57

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,5.0,positive,i ordered this product after looking at other paper flowers and nothing else was what i wanted so i gave this a try making the flowers was very easy and quick to do i rapped the wireabout 3 times to just add more mass to it and it makes the flower more stable i will be ordering more to use them as centerpieces for a party i get comments from people who are not very crafty and complement me on making something that looks so complexed but it will be my secret that it is not hard at all,102,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,2.0,negative,half came broken and i was almost upset until i tried using them and realized they only break if you touch them colors are not very intense either but i was using blackboard stickers and not a real blackboard so your mileage may vary,44,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,4.0,positive,like the colors but they all came broken if i was a kid i would be upset,17,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,4.0,positive,great chalk to be used on a green board where the white does not show much i am student teaching 7th grade english and prefer to use a blackboard rather then a smartboard yellow seems to work best and hopefully some of the others will be bright enough so the students can see i like that it is small but i would have preferred the bigger ones i do not know why people go into mad cow attitude when they get their chalk broken it is chalk buy the sidewalk one if you want it to endure,95,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,2.0,negative,once i received them they were just about like dust every one was broken and was just about unusable i would recommend just spending a little extra and buying them from a local store,34,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this thing is the size of a quarter you are better off buying the larger roll which is for some reason cheaper,22,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it never peeled off not even the openon top some tapes the topdoes not stick but I have never had that problem with this tape it sticks and stays tight,32,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,my granddaughter ordered this for hertape crafts and she absolutely loves this the colors are awesome and it is exactly what she wanted,24,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love these rolls of minitape the width 3/4 is great for crafting and small fixes around the house or on-the-go perhaps use it like you might use washi tape and get creative it comes in basic black and silver plus some colors / patterns there is not quite the same selection of patterns as the originaltape line yet but perhaps after being on the market for a while they will expand the options available i recently made my dad an emergency car kit for christmas and i made sure to include one of these rolls as a mini version of a very useful tool,106,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this is going to be more expensive than regulartape per square foot but if you do not want to split tape or want a thinner width for a project these are great the tape is good quality and sticks well with burnishing rubbing down firmly and the width makes it perfect for trims or small fixes the finish is the same as regular blacktape glossy water-resistant and thick enough to be strong plus i just love the size of these rolls they are incredibly cute the inner core is printed it does not have the logo like the full size rolls do but it is clearly a mini roll oftape it is also labeled as made in the united states,121,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it works well and stays glowing for a long time but if you put it on some thing that your hands are going to be on such as a controller or a door nob then it wears down really fast,40,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,I am not sure how this ended up being mislabeled as 15 yards when it is actually on 72 inches 2 yards i contacted amazon to let them know of the mistake and to return thebut seeing as how it still says 15 yards i figured I had put this out there for anyone else who might end up ordering this and getting a much smaller roll of tape than expected the tape itself does glow but i never took it out of the package since i returned it so i can not say much else about it otherbrand tape I have used has been great i imagine this would be the same i would have kept it if it did not cost so much for such a tiny roll,128,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,make sure you understand the length / width of this product before purchasing it is a very small roll despite the picture looking like a normal sized roll the tape does function well however glows bright and adhesive holds well,38,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this does actually glow pretty good i did not read the description very well although and was surprised how small it was,21,8

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,tape was easy to cut off the roll but i used it on light switches in the hallway to be able to see them to click on to be able to see down the hallway you could see the piece if you stood right in front of it not any longer and just did not work,56,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i obviously misread the size see picture so far i have not seen it glow at all I have had it on the floor with lights on for days and when the lights are out there is no green luminousfrom the tape very disappointed in this,46,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,used on my flashlight in my basement that i have placed near my breaker box if the power goes out I shall be able to find it going to put some on the front of breaker box too it glows well in dark too,43,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,this is extremely tiny i thought it was going to be a big roll oftape from the pic and name but admit i should have studied the measurements more closely it also does not glow very brightly,38,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love this tape it does the job of what i purchased it for it is just too small not only do i recommend it i suggest you buy 2,29,17

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is my own lack of reading up on the product but when i purchased i did not realized it was going to be so tiny it is smaller than a normal roll of scotch tape i thought it was going to be as large as a regular roll oftape i feel that i could have read more into it but the way the pictures made the product look were a bit misleading because you can not tell how small it actually is,81,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,be aware that this is smaller than a roll of electrical tape,12,21

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i read the reviews so i knew this is a small roll of tape no surprises it is the size of a fifty cent piece that was perfect for the project i needed it for and i did not have to pay for a large roll i did not need i found that it glows seven to eight hours you do not necessarily have to put it under light to get it to glow i found that the tv in a dark room also works i am very satisfied with this product,89,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,why is that tape so small it should be 25 cents,11,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,ok ha ha you got me my bad you have to put it in the sun or light,18,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,if i was in the movie downsizing it would be perfect as the whole roll is not much bigger than a quarter haha thank goodness i have a great sense of humor because i was very amused and like miniature things but do not buy it if you think y ou are getting a standard roll they should tell you it is miniature,64,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,well i was expecting my tape but when i opened my box all it had inside was a wad of paper notape,24,28

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,should have looked at the size more closely if they could title this mini tape or something that would help a lot it is tiny it glows okay not great,30,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love these minitapes i put one in each of my grandsons stockings they can put them in their glove compartments for an emergency fix i may order more so i can have one for myself handy littlethat will not take up much room i may be over 75 years old but i have learned in these years that you can fix a lot withtape it was a go to for my deceased husband and i use to kid him about it i thought it was a man thing until he died and i began using it for small fixes outside and in laughing out loud,109,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,do not know how else to say this but it is tape that glows in the dark i have charged the tape with a black light and seen it hold a charge for a minimum of 4 hours works as expected,40,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,absolutely useless it looks like a roll oftape but it is the size of a roll of electrical tape the dimensions are clearly readable in the picture so it is my own fault i guess but i had noduct tape came in such a small useless size,49,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,adhesive did not stick at all ducks products usually sticks quite well but this was not even as sticky as masking tape lasted less than a day,25,36

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,kinda tiny but it works used it along the side of stairs so we do not trip at night the roll is very small although,24,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,pay careful attention to the dimensions this is a ridiculously small roll of tape that as other reviewers have noted is virtually useless,23,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,thistape is microscopic it roughly 1 tenth the size of a real roll oftape see picture attached,21,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is not small it tiny do not think this is a regular size roll oftape only shorter because it is not this is tiny a little large than a quarter in diameter and only 3/4 of an inch wide never saw a roll this small before,47,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i will never buy it again it does not glow in the dark as advertised wasted my money,18,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,poor quality and not worth the price in my opinion these rolls are truly mini sized the roll i received seems to have been stored in an extremely hot environment because the tape adhesive is so melted that it is very difficult to pull the tape off the roll to even use it do not bother purchasing thisgo to your nearest craft store or walmart and get a full roll of patternedtape for the same price quite disappointed with this purchase,83,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this it is a goodtape to use for safety it is only 6 feet and only one little roll and only 3/4 wide but it will glow when the lights go out it lasts only a short while depends on how much and how long of light it gets to charge it so times very for how long it glows,61,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,very small amount of tape and barely glowed,8,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,yes i can read 3/4x72 but it is still shocking to see how tiny this room of tape is a roll of frogtape would be something like 45 if sold at a similar price per foot at this price you should be able to see it glowing from space,48,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,it glows it istape but the photo is decpetive because never in my life have i seen a roll oftape that is not the size of a roll oftape,33,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i was expecting a typical size never would i imagine something this small i guess the camera really does give it a bigger look,24,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,i thought i ordered a lip gloss by mistake it is tiny but i just used it on my tiny remote control so i can find it it seems fine i really did not notice any glow in the dark,38,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,just a 1 inch thing of tape what a ripoff i knew i should have read the reviews,18,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the pictures did not depict that this was a very small role of tape i was extremely disappointed with the size and wish this detail was amplified a little more,30,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,okay yes it is small other reviewers who gave it a poor review based on that need to read product descriptions more carefully that being said this is great tape bonds to itself well and seems to be extremely tough it has a rough cloth-like surface as opposed to a more traditionaltape plasticy-ness and it is rather thick it glows a bright strong green and does so for a long time it will not shine super bright for very long if you hold it up to a light but it does have a low glow that lasts for an hour or more which is totally perceptible in the dark would highly recommend they also sell a regular sized version if that is what you need,123,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,did not like the glow feature of the tape because the glow was not that strong did not bother to return the product since s / h was pricey,27,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i did not read the full details was blown away when i saw how small this was not much bigger than a quarter so if you want tiny to maybe put on your phone then it is for you i was just shocked i guess i should have read all the reviews my bad but not worth the money I shall go to walmart next time for this product normally i am a big fan of amazon i get all my sewing and quilting from amazon with no problems hope this helps someone,90,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,good tape just watch out for the size of the roll it is smaller than you think it is about the size of a roll of washi tape,26,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the photo makes this look as although it is regular sizetape when it arrived it was tiny smaller than scotch tape but about 1/4 do not recommend if you are going to sell a product why put a deceptive photo up put an actual photo up and let people judge if they want to spend money on your product as it actually is,65,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,tape did not glow as expected was a bit disappointed not sure why either the light was dim and not bright,20,63

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,as many people mentioned in reviews this is a very small roll of tape almost comical in size but it is just what i was looking for i needed to put a tiny bit of glow in the dark tape on a light switch just inside the rv to know which to turn on for the inside lights i literally cut a piece about 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch for this purpose it does glow in the dark as advertised the tape has almost the feel of that white bandage tape that comes in a first aid kit not the feel of slick regulartape if that matters to anyone,109,65
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,pay attention to the size this is a very tiny roll of tape works great,15,66
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i am so happy with this tape my 1 use for this genius invention i use it to mark the corners of tables in my screened-in porch i do not always want to turn on my patio light but i like to sit outside after dark just a couple little strips that you can barely see in the daylight and no more stumbling into things the uses are endless that is just my own quirky fave,73,67

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,beware this tape is sooooo small pay attention to the dimensions not the picture i wish that i had,19,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i do not really hate this tape but i hate the perspective it is listed as in the list of differenttapes it had the exact same size in the picture i makes it look like a regular rolls but it is tiny more like a roll of electrical tape,48,75
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,worked very well for me for marking camping gear and outdoors on my property the pic is from a peace i put on my she had two years ago it is been in direct sun / wind / rain / snow for both years it is a bit dirty but still glowing,43,76

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the glow-in-the-darktape glows for a while then stop not worth buying,13,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,look at product description very small picture makes it look large tape needs extensive time in light for very little time of glowing,23,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this tape is sooooo tiny it looks big in the pic but it is not,14,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,itsy bitsy it defense of the listing it does say the size on defense of the consumer we most likely would not look because who has ever seen such a smalltap i automatically assumed it looked the same as every other sizetape especially at this price,48,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i did not know thattape made these micro rolls glows in the dark well but this roll cost almost as much as the full size glow in the darktape at lowes wish i had read the reviews,41,90
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,do not waste your money if you read it is only 72 inches by 3/4 wide too pricey for so little roll is barely bigger than a half dollar in size buy paint instead,32,91
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this comes on a tiny little roll but it does exactly what it claims to do it glows in the dark expose this to some light and it will glow like crazy and it adheres like crazy too i bought some glow in the dark paint at the same time i bought this and i bought the best glow in the dark paint there was based on ratings thistape glows just as brightly as does the paint so for whatever reason you may need this do not hesitate because it really does work but this is a very small roll about the size of a half dollar but you can buy bigger sized rolls,115,92
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i should have read the reviews this roll of tape is tiny,12,93
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the one time i do not read the reviews,8,94
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,had a project requiring smaller sized tape this worked of limited value otherwise,13,95
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,what i wanted tho thought the roll was bigger than it was for the price,15,96
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this is a very misleading product i did not think i needed to read the dimensions but obviously i did when it arrived it was tiny see pics to compare to standardtape i will be returning it shortly,38,97
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,works nice but very small and small roll,8,98

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,glows well lost a star although because this is a tiny roll not your regular size roll oftape should be called out more specifically in listing,28,101
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this stuff is great i use it on all my remotes so i could find it easily in the dark a little smaller than expected make sure you pay attention to the dimensions that are listed on the page other than that it is a great product I shall probably be looking to buy more because it runs out quick,58,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this product is inferior it does not glow in the dark and it is a waste of money,18,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,very very tiny roll maybe 15 feet of the stuff in a 1/4inch wide section does not glow very well would not buy again,23,104

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,works great it is just as sticky as othertape and it is small width makes it good for precision fixes i used it to fix a broken bike pedal and it fit through each crack nicely and blended in seamlessly with the surrounding colors i rode for the next week through rain and over speed bumps and it held together through all of it,64,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i put this alongside a light switch to help find it in low light situations without my glasses it pretty much is useless ambient daylight is not enough to charge this tape you really need some sustained bright light to make this work there might be situations where it is useful but mine was not one of them i ended up putting in a new illuminated switch which was about the same price as this stuff,73,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,the picture of the product makes it seem like it is a decent size roll this roll is tiny and i would not have paid this much money for such a tiny roll i also ordered 3 other rolls oftape and the pictures all appear to be the same size,52,108
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,how disappointing shame on me for now reading details this roll oftape is slightly larger than a quarter,20,109
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,probably my own fault for not looking more closely at the dimensions but this is not a full size roll oftape it is literally the size of a silver dollar terribly disappointed in the small quantity for a relatively high price over 5 / roll,45,110
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,picture for this product is very misleading this is a tiny overpriced roll oftape while the description does clearly specify the dimensions the photo is misleading,28,111
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,check the size i can not believe i paid this much for such a tiny roll of tape absolutely ridiculous,19,112

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this stuff really sticks especially to your fingers and itself as for anything else maybe-maybe not the most frustrating thing about this brand is that it does not tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll this is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this you are far better off with something like 3 m of some other generic at the hardware stores this junk is just not worth the frustration,80,115
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,read description carefully this is a tiny roll oftape i misread the description,16,116

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,not reallytape at all it is more like masking tape that does not stick when it gets wet it does glow nicely tho,23,127
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,i ordered yarn and these hooks on the same day knowing it would take a while to receive them the yarn came in 13 days but it took a month for the hooks to get here they are ok but would have been better if i could given them to my niece as a christmas present,56,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,bought these as a spare set until i can find my boye needles they arrived promptly the larger sizes look and feel sturdy they are plastic so i would not get too rough and tough with the smaller sizes great value for such a large variety as a side note love the colors,51,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,i bought these hooks to take on a flight next week and they will not work at all these hooks are very poor quality the hook end does not catch the yarn at all i would not recommend purchasing these hooks you can find susan bates plastic hooks for less money and much better quality they did not come in a case like advertised just a clear plastic bag the larger sizes would work sufficiently but the smaller sizes would not work for any project,85,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,these crochet hooks look way better on amazon than in person what i had in mind was a very hard / firm acrylic and these are cheaply made and very flimsy,29,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,they are light wt they do the job i just have to get used to them the hooks do not have their size written on printed on them i taped the size to the hooks for convenience for me,38,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,they are okay back up hooks they said they would come with a case and a free gift which they did not the hooks themselves slide kind of weird and squeak,31,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,go to your local craft store with a coupon and get quality product that actually makes it to your hands what you think your savings g does not make up for the frustration and aggravation of trying to actually get your product,42,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i love the acrylic crochet hooks but have not used these yet cool colors,13,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,they are not only cheap but when i received them they were missing the 11 mm hook and they took a month to get here and the needles i needed the most were the large ones super disappointing,37,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,well i am very sad 2 of the smaller size have broke i do not see any guarantee for these hooks the larger one my be ok they look stronger not worth buying,27,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,it says a 9 acrylic hooks i got 5 hooks that are flimsy plastic and four sticks without hooks and no case beyond disappointed i know it is only 7 but not worth a penny do not buy,37,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,shipping took a good three weeks but for the price and the quality it was all well worth it,19,17

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,these hooks are ok the smaller one that was the 20 mm hook broke during a project i guess that is to be expected due to the plastic i like these colorful hooks but i know now to stick with stainless steel for tiny projects,43,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,disappointed in the picture the hooks look like they have a design,12,21

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,i used them once then never again i suppose it is a matter of preference but I had never used an acrylic hook before and i just did not like the feel of them nor the way they slid through the loops of the yarn,42,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,so pretty i use these all the time since i got them because they contrast so brightly with my yarn the smaller hooks are pretty thin so be gentle but mine are very well made and have no snags,39,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,these were so horribly flimsy that i just gave them to my kids for them to practice with i wish i could get a refund,25,25

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,product came fast exactly as listed however 4 stars because of the resistance of the hook against the yarn not smooth like aluminum but still useful and worth the,30,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,piece of junk not at all what i waited so long and patiently for do not waste your money,18,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,the description said these hooks came in a case and they do not they also do not list the alphabet size on the hook just the mm size and you can hardly see the numbers i do like the feel of the hook for the most part although,48,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,they arrived much sooner than they estimated and are as beautiful as i had hoped,15,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for these but was rather disappointed the second smallest size snapped shortly into a project with very little tension the tops and underside of the heads have sharp and rough points i easily sanded these off with a metal nail file but they were unusable prior to this lighter than an aluminum hook but much heavier than bamboo i would not purchase again,66,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,shipped super quick butdoes not look like picture there are 5 different colored hooks in the package but they are not marbled or tye-dyed like the photo and yeah as someone else said the smaller hooks are a little flimsy ok for the price,46,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,they are really nice to work with them they look like colorful,13,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,a little rough at the loop but i fixed that by filing it down,14,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,these plastic hooks have terrible burrs that pull on the yarns and tears them up i had to sand them but the plastics just burr again,26,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,there was no case the needles were in a cellophane wrapper like you would buy at the store definitely not a case,21,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,very poor constructed and quality take the time and buy locally,11,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,nice and durable feels weird to use since i am used to using a metal hook plastic feels like it catches on some fluffy yarns,25,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i absolutely love these hooks the only con is i wish that it had the alphabetical size on the hook it only has the numerical size,26,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,they are great work just like they should no complaints had to hit a few spots with some sandpaper but besides that great,22,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i love my hooks and my cousin seen mine and she ordered a set the colors are yes catching awesome,20,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,firstly the description is incorrect and the seller is aware but never bothered updating it claiming that someone else had changed the description without their approval how hard cud it be to change the description back to being correct if it were that easy to change t without approval secondly while the seller as polite they did not address my issues which is the description is incorrect there has no case and no free stylus thirdly when i pointed out that my issue was not addressed they stopped respinding to me as lastly the smallest hook broke reported this product to amazon got most of my back less taxes and bought a metal set instead better to get that metal set the yarn glides with these plastic ones there has a lot of friction,132,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i like this product because it have all different size of the crochet hooks all my crochet items look amazing,20,44

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,i ordered this set just for the big hooks and they are just great they are smooth easy to work with and do n't catch the yarn the smaller ones are not so smooth 300 mm and 400 mm but anyway if you are planning more precise crochet project it 's better to order metal hooks,54,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,arrived timely and good value but several of the hooks are unusable the grooves were fused together so the yarn just keeps slipping the larger hooks are better but needed to filed down as there were pieces of acrylic still stuck on them i would buy these again for sure and just spend the money on higher quality ones,59,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,i bought these more for the larger hooks in the set and could honestly care less about the small ones which look about as sturdy as those plastic sword toothpicks but another reviewer said they hold up well they do have some rough edges mostly out of yarns way on the end but annoying enough to want to sand off there was no plastic wallet / case to speak of either just the hooks i must have gotten lucky because shipping was actually pretty quick overall i got what i paid for and expected nothing more,94,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,only issue is it is difficult to see the sizes but that is the acrylic aspect of them overall the product was good took some time to get it from china but i am pleased with the product and would buy again if needed,43,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,like the sizes feel a little flimsy but so far so good if i find a flaw I shall let people know,21,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,great they were coming off a but in the cornerns but not a big deal they served it is purpose for my scarecrow pants,23,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,easy to work with these go on fast and easy the colors are great these came fast and i will reorder again,22,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,followed directions went on just fine after first wash they pulled away from the edges and were almost completely off waste of money I am going to had to actually see them on and even then they do not stick to my jeans,39,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,seller was good and thisarrived promptly but this produce is horrible selected these and paid more money because i thought they were nicer looking followed instructions and all the patches did not stick to the jeans or they stuck and then immediately fell off before wearing jeans would return them for a refund if i could but i have used them feeling totally ripped off they do not work and nobody else should waste their money on these,80,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,i got great use out of these work like they should and easy to put on,16,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,did not last through more then 2 - 3 washes,8,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,does the job and very easy to apply no complaints except material is kind of cheap,16,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,they work just make sure you do it right because i got another hole in my jeans at theof the patch because i did not make it overlap enough,30,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,the good you can cut these to the size you would like the bad they would not adhere at all i tried every single patch that came in this packet and not one would stick to the fabric it would stick partially if at all and then after cooling would peel right off I am a seasoned pro at ironing on patches and so i feel confident saying that these are simply poor quality 11 for a handful of patches is bad enough but 11 for patches that will not even stick is just insulting i feel like I have been ripped off frankly and i do not usually feel that way after purchasing something off amazon i ordered some iron-on patches from another company off amazon and those adhered beautifully these are a scam,130,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,thisdid not stick as per instructions i had to sew,12,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,saved my favorite sweat pants the patches are great for large holes easy to cut for smaller ones one can cut any design in the patch holds great during washing and drying without tacking the patch just wished there was more than one sheet of each patch,47,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,unfortunately these patches did not work very well for me at all applied one onto a pair of jeans which came off within 5 minutes i had also followed the instructions exactly as stated i would not recommend these even although they are very pretty if you want to sew them on then buy them but if you are looking for a quick fix these patches are not your answer,68,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,one of the patterns was an exact match for my favorite robe and i was able to match the plaid so well it is undetectable very easy to apply,29,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,i love these they are really cute they were easy to apply but after two washes in the washing machine one of the patches came off the others are still going strong but i was a little disappointed that one came right off,43,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,maybe you are supposed sew them on too but they came off after one wash,15,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,fell off the jeans i ironed them onto within minutes disappointing,11,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,cute fabric but did not stick to surface and lifted almost instantly bummed,13,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,the look great but did not adhere to my [ clean dry ] pants total bummer,15,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,these are cute patterns / plaids but the material is thin and the adhesive is weak i used them for my sons jeans and when i washed them all the patches came off you could reinforce with stitching but the material itself might not hold that either,45,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,will go nice on plain material shirts in the boys closet,11,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,these work well adds a stylish touch to an old pair of jeans,13,20

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,horrible you do not get a variety of colors it is nothing like what is pictured i only received four different colors dark blue light blue red pink oh and one yellow button,33,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,i am planning on returning these the picture shows bright colors and the ones i got were pastels and it does not seem that there are 40 of them,29,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,2.0,negative,there colors were as pictured but the quantity was no where near 50 i only received 36 buttons,18,4

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,5.0,positive,the buttons look beautiful and exactly like the ones in the picture i did expect a little more but i did not count how many buttons there were so I am not sure although you can not really expect much for 3 - 4 overall seems like a great product,45,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,i thought buying this was a good deal until they arrived over 10 were broken when they arrived in the envelope package not happy about that at all,28,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,4.0,positive,the buttons are vibrant colors and are perfect for making button necklaces when paired with some painted buttons also sold on amazon the price is very reasonable the only complaint is you do not get over 50 but i would not want them to decrease the size of the buttons to meet the quantity advertised to satisfy the 40 g weight indicated so i can accept this issue the colors are more vibrant than the picture shows I have ordered more,76,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,2.0,negative,very cheap guess you get what you pay for,9,13

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,as most other reviews have said these are not coaster sized I am not sure i even had a piece that was 4 in diameter more than 2/3 of my bag was the size of a silver dollar not what i needed at all i had no choice but to cherry pick the largest ones to use for my ornaments if i had more time i would have sent them back great price but change the advertising,75,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,these were great for our sons wedding reception,8,5

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,they are great however this said 50 pieces i did not receive 50 pieces like it states which is really unfortunate also i was unable to locate the specifications of the pieces on the mobile app so they were a lot smaller than anticipated,43,13

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,I am disappointed because these wood pieces do not look nothing like the pictures shown they look so much bigger than what they actually are it is misleading if i would of known how tiny they are i would have not purchase these wood pieces now look at my pictures the first one is almost this size of a tape look how tiny the other two are I am going to keep them because i do not like returning anything i already paid for,81,22

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,image does not match items recieved wood is very small twig pieces not the disc size 2 to 3 inch image shows deceptive,23,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,used them at a craft day with my sisters and we made christmas garland tripods coasters and ornaments with these read the size although as some reviewers did not and blamed the seller for their misfortune,36,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,if i could give it no stars i would it came very quickly and the box was fine the wood slices were packaged in a plastic bag when i opened it there was a really moldy smell and sure enough over half were blue also many were crumbled or cracked in halfit is true to size although most were on the 3 cm side,63,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,these are great they are small but if you read the description and are not surprised when they arrive i think you will find that they are excellent quality for small craft projects I am having a blast with them,35,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,pictures made it look big and never was,8,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,nice quality but far smaller in size than advertised,9,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,these slices are pretty and will work fine if you need tiny wood slices however the pictures are misleading and i think this product is too expensive the majority of the slices measure 3 cm which is the small side of the 3 - 5 cm quoted I had maybe pay 020 each but not 033 the pictures are misleading if you are reading quickly and not reading the fine print the picture of the slices in a box also shows 3x the quantity you get and makes the slices look a lot bigger than they are however if you want this size they would be fine just make sure to get out a ruler before ordering and think about what 3 cm really means cute for tiny ornaments or kids crafts,128,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,were supposed to be the 3 - 5 inch not cm i had ordered some that size in the same order and wanted bigger ones for a wreath very disappointed i wasted my money on these when bigger ones were the same price,41,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,was not a big as i hoped but i love them will order more heres what i used my for after the first project did not end up the way i wanted,30,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,so these are a lot smaller then they look in the picture i guess i should have read the size but the picture makes them look very big like the ones i needed well i made them work and am very happy with what i have done i will actually be buying more so yes small but happy it worked out for me,63,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,some were warped some were molded horrible product price explains a lot,11,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,much smaller than i thought but great for trinkets or ornaments,11,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,no stars for this one i had to put one to submit comment they where discribed as coasters 3 coasters are not very useful,24,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,absolutely tiny picture is not realistic super unhappy,8,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,they were just as advertised and worked perfectly for my craft project there were only 2 out of the whole bunch that were too small,25,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,perfect for what i wanted i plan on using these as key chains to hand out at a baby shower i probably should have ordered them a bit bigger,29,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,they are fine just smaller then expected i wanted to woodburn letters onto them to make a welcome sign but they are just a little small for that was hoping for coaster size not tea light size,35,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,these slices are much smaller than they appear in the photo and much smaller than i would have preferred quite a few are the size of a 50-cent piece and none are as large as what appears to be a 2 1/2 3 slice that said they are clean and they are aged so they will not split,57,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,was under the impression that these round wood slices were coaster size i planned on woodburning them for my wedding guest now they will all get a magnet to put on their fridge they are about the size of a silver dollar,42,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,many smaller and irregular in size than expected,8,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,i love these markers it really brought my artwork to life good thing i already owned a blacklight flashlight because that is the only way it is going to glow it would be better if the markers came with a mini lamp so it would be more convenient and easier to work with for those who do not,68,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,the product seems beautiful and practicali think it should be pretty goodill try it in a minute,17,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,received it very fast but it is not as bright as i thought it was going to be,18,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,two colors were noticable under blacklight and some not so much,11,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,these work great and are fun to use they glow like crazy under backlights i used them at a glow birthday party for girls to decorate t-shirts they had such a blast and made all sorts of designs with them they had to laugh when they saw their brilliant work under normal lights of course the colors are softer rather than brilliant neon while under backlights they were super easy to use and there were no duds,78,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,just as effective as highlighters which are naturally somewhat phosphorescent under black light in fact these are highlighters with a supped up label to make it feel like your are getting something worth your hard earned money let me tell you a secret you are not ps i tested it under 3 different uv black lights by the way two different led uv flashlights one a screw in bulb side by side with standard office depot highlighters they are indistinguishable from one another,82,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,only lasted one day went back to use them again and took off the cap and none of them would write,21,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,i tried on both black and white boards white boards work best,12,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,these barely glow under uv light not a fan and will not be using them,14,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,shows up well with black light recommend to buy,9,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,it is not good it does not glow in the dark i got it for my birthday and i was shy to say to my friend that it glows in the dark,31,10
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,installed bright he shall yes no doubt crisp white / blue tint light he shall no you can see by the pics below make sure your headlight housing and wiring can withstand the extra heat generated by these 100 watt monsters this is my second pair of 100 watt halogens I have bought to try and match the main outside headlights which are 6000k leds not even close nice price tho if you are just looking for more light and do not forget about heat generated if you have to run these long periods of time make sure your electrical system can handle the extra power draw,98,0
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,they do not look bright white they actually look like the cheep blue head lights you see kids rolling around with they are supposed to be brighter than stock head lamps but they are actually dimmer and annoyingly blue,38,1
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,much better output over stock bulbs cool white light so far so good,13,2

Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,they work good bright light exactly what i needed for my truck,12,5
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,it was not the xenon whitethat i was hoping for if anything it performs just as good as regular halogen bulbs giving it 4/5 because the price is relatively cheap compared to other gimicky bulbs,36,6
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,i bought these to replace my stock high beam lamps they are not even distinguishable when turned on i had to stop my car and get out to see if they were indeed lit thedoes look to be whiter than the stock ones when looking at them however the lumens are simply not there do not waste your time,60,7
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,about same brightness as regular bulb but has whiter appearance,10,8
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,I shall start by explaining that i have a 2009 toyota corolla and was looking to upgrade to an hid system these cars have two sets of headlights there is a dedicated low beam set and a driving / high beam set i got the low beam switched out pretty easy with 9006 8000k single beam hid system i looked up the type of bulb for the driving high beam set and it was 9005 so i ordered a 9005 hid system thinking it would be an easy swap like the low beams nope after installing that system they flickered and did not get bright for the high beams after further investigation i discovered that toyota is using a voltage change to achieve the difference in brightness obviously this will not work for hid so then i decided to find a white as possible halogen bulb well when i got these bulbs i was under the impression that they would be whiter and or brighter than stock do not let the blueof the bulbs fool you they not only do not shine blue they do not even act like they are closer to cool white than stock now they are brighter but not whiter kinda disappointed,201,9
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,these did not change the brightness of the drl or high beam theis ugly yellow my drl is still factory yellowdo not waste your money,28,10
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,great colour blue light is pretty white installed on a forester xt 2009 they are 9005 hb3 light bulbs but do not fit in the stock light fixture took me a while to figure it out it is because of the o-ring which was too big i took the o-ring off the old bulbs and put them on the new ones they fit right in now 1 star off for that would have been more if i did not solve it did not expect this from a hella product thought a standard was a standard will update if they fail but a decent priced product just remember my little hack if they do not fit do not touch the bulb as well,116,11
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,when i saw it was for off road i returned it,11,12
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,20 times better than my old bulbs super bright super white going to buy a set for my dad,19,13
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,these are great high beam bulbs however because the glass on the outside is a distinctive blueyour headlight lenses will reflect this when the car is in direct sunlight not a big deal although,36,14
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,these are very bright being 100w fit my 06 si perfect and are a very bright drl and high beam light,21,15
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,not any brighter than the stock bulbs disappointed that 100w is not brighter than the 65w bulbs,17,16
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,they work make sure you check your local laws,9,17
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,do not fit prongs are too big tried these on 2 different cars with same bulb size,14,18
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,these did fit my car they did not pop up any error codes the lightis nice and clean white with the faintest hint of light blue however light output was really poor as these are for my drl and highbeams I had say they do great as drl but damn if the highbeam was just a poor amount of light output against the factory yellowish halogens,67,19
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,can not really write a review as although the amazon system said they fit my car 1996 e36 bmw they do not,20,20
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,nothing about the bulbs output is white they are incredibly dim to the point that they are useless what has even worse is that these 9005 bulbs do not fit into my vehicles 9005 slot in order to get it in i had to unscrew the slot and essentially screw the bulb in place seriously do not waste money,59,21
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,bulbs worked great with no issues came quickly in a sealed box have no issues i can ever talk about,20,22
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,they are not the blue that you are expecting but that was not why i really puchased them they are substantially brighter than the stock bulb which is all i really cared about very white bright light and still burning bright good buy,43,23
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,i know you usual get what you pay for but was optimistic about theseis barely whiter than stock bulbs if you want bulbs to match hid headlights you will be disappointed,33,24
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,not work say they are and are not white light is the same standard is light yellow light not buy this product,22,25
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,excellent product these bulbs perform as well as the factory hid xenon headlights on my 2005 corvette the low beams outperform most other so called high performance bulb for the high beams i would not hesitate to recommend these high quality bulbs to everyone who wants to see farther down the road those who have,56,26
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,i bought these from ebay due to lower price they are much better than phillips and any other brand and about the 100w it is ok but i do not think they would last much,33,27
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,product code correct to what i needed but did not fit lighting plugs when i attempted to install thewas said to be compatible with my vehicle,28,28
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,compared to the stock bulb these hellas make them look like a house light they have that cool coloring and are the brightest lights I have seen,26,29
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,i got these to closely match my 4300k hid kit these are bright im still using the stock wiring harness but it is ok because i do not really use my brights for more than 5 mins anyways i will be upgrading my harness soon although to prevent anything from getting too hot since these are 100 w bulbs,57,30
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,these are not very bright and one of the bulbs seems to only be at half bright only i know it is not the wiring or such because the old bulbs were equal in light output i v had these for almost one month and i feel they will not last will not be buying these again,55,31
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,you have to considerer for what do you want this only work for the high light,20,32
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,i bought this for my is300 for the drl and i tried everything it did not fit into the socket like the original ones i wanted this to give my car a true bluebut it did not i do not recommend these bulbs if you want to have blue lights,51,33
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,halogen lights will always be yellowish tried sylvania ultra 4100k and piaa xtreme 4100k these are very bright they may look white if you are staring directly at the blazing bulb but the light cast on the road is distintively a halogen yellow if you have an hid low-beam but do not want a yellow high-beam then this is a good light used on a 2001 x4 with factory 4300k hid the bulb has a royal blue bulb that changes the yellow to a white light about 5000k just barely a hint of blue compared to the factory hid any halogen that attempts to change thetowards hid will compromise brightness this was acceptable to me since i rarely use my high-beam to flash other drivers,126,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,bought this for my central ac unit outside that had a lot of mashed spots there were no instructions on how to use this or put it together so i had to youtube it it looked easy the way the guy just combed through the fins but when you actually go to do this unless your fins are only slightly askew you are going to get stuck i ended up just sitting there using the comb for over an hour on the spots and eventually noticed that the individual combs started to break or get bent it is plastic and not very sturdy plastic at that after losing 3 prongs i just ended up getting a small thin blade and using the flat side to coax the dents out worked better than this fin straightener pros well it works for a bit cons cheap plastic bottom line if the fins you are trying to fix are only slightly out of shape then this would be easy to use but if you got some big dents and a lot of them you should look for one that has metal prongs or just get thin sturdy blade and spend a bit more time and patience,199,0
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,this tool arrived in new package and very handy for straightening those bent fins on my air conditioner could not find this product in stores,25,1
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i actually bought this to straighten the fins on my carrier air conditioner unfortuantely the packaging says it is for radiators and i attempted to use all 6 sides on my air conditioner and none of them fit,37,2
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,so this does what it is supposed to and seems well enough made i was able to straighten my radiator and condenser fins on my car with it so it does work,31,3
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,i was doing some maintenance on my home ac unit and discovered that some of the fins on the unit were pushed in thus blocking some of the air flow this little gadget easily opened them back up in a matter of minutes,43,4
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the comb at least the 15 vanes per inch part of the tool is not very durable at all within a few minutes of use the teeth began to break off making it all but useless i was not even able to complete one of my 2 condenser units,49,5
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,honestly could not fit the tool in my outside ac unit at all would not recommend,15,6
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,what a life saver efficient and do not see how i did not have this tool before,17,7
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,i have tried using this on central air unit and a car and it does do a very good job on either i end up using a screwdriver and be very careful and very patient,35,8
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,never have my fins been so evenly spaced laughing out loud,9,9
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,this worked fine on my rv a / c for about half the job as others have commented the teeth break off way to readily i got enough done using both the correct size and one larger when that one was toothless i small fraction of the cost a repair guy would charge I am sure if i were to buy one again i might research one with metal teeth it did work easily while it lasted my fist time trying this at the price i guess i can always buy 2 - 3 and consider them disposable,93,10
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,keeps unscrewing while i am trying to use it very difficult to use,13,11
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,used on old radiator to straighten fin slow process but gets the job done,15,12
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,i got this today and with all the sizes available there was none for my airconditioner i threw it out,20,13
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,bought this to straighten the fins on a window unit that got hit by a hail storm comes with 6 different fin spacing sizes to fit different cooling fins unfortunately not of them fit mine so it was worthless shoved it in the toolbox drawer and never touched it again,50,14
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,plastic teeth were too thick and not deep enough it was frustratingly clumsy to use i finally gave up and had better luck finishing the straightening job just using a small flathead screw driver that meant i was going row by row instead of being able to do a bunch of rows at a time so it took forever but at least that way the end result was perfect,69,15
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,ok for minor repairs i have some hail damage to my a / c fins and this worked ok to straighten them out at first but due to the large area of damage the tool plastic became bent and stopped working before i could finish the job this product is designed to straighten 8 9 10 12 14 or 15 fins per inch needs to be a more durable material,68,16
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,very nice device works well and is reasonable priced,9,17
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,as this was a replacement for a lost tool it matched perfectly,12,18
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,i suppose this worked about as good as could be expected but it did not get the job done before the the teeth started breaking the condenser on my air conditioner has about 15 fins per inch and they were flattened by hail about the only method that seems to work is picking them back up one by one with a grapefruit knife,62,19
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,works well for a variety of radiators and some condensers but older radiators and condensers have fin counts which do not fit the provided combs,25,20
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,unfortunately it does not exactly fit most of the gauges on my condensers i bought this to improve the air flow of my window air conditioner units probably not really the fault of the product I had lay more blame on the a / c mfg a decently made product for a difficult job,50,21
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,this tool just filled the bill for straighting out condenser fins as it has many different sizes for the bill and i have been able to use it more than a few times and it keeps on working,38,22
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,do not waste your money it was totally broken in less than 5 mminutes very poor product should be removed from this site,23,23
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,the fin straightener does do the job i did not anticipate the fins being so deeply bent and going deep is an art that I shall perfect with the straightener soon,29,24
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,none of the combs seemed to fit the fins i had to straighten does not feel well made would buy a different brand / style next time,24,25
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,did not work i do not think i can send it back now but will be more careful with other purchases in the future,22,26
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,a couple of old window ac units given to me had dented fins this straightened them out so they run more efficient,22,27
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,does not have a smaller separation setting for most a / c fins the insertion end could be more pointed to ease getting in between the fins handle angle is awkard when trying to straightened the fins,35,28
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,as other reviews does not fit and i measured really not sure what to do with it now wondering if they will take it back,24,29
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,does what we bought it for it is light weight and very compact it is perfect for our rv air conditioner,21,30
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i bought this tool because the fins on my a / c were completely bent and mangled it was starting to affect the performance of my unit i was quoted several hundred dollars to get this fixed by a professional instead i picked up this tool it does support several different units since it has heads for different numbers of fins per inch i was able to use this tool and spend about 30 minutes to fix the fins on my unit i am rating this only four stars because this is not the best quality for only a few uses it is wonderful but a professional would never want to use this tool because i could not imagine it lasting with that much abuse,122,31
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,during the first minute of use the fins in the 12 broke off poorly made plastic fins are too brittle,20,32
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the fins on this little tool do not fit with any of the fins on either my window air conditioner or the central air conditioner which got damaged during a recent hail storm so I am back to square one i found success by using a razor knife which is a tedious process although I had return it but after the postage my refund would not make it worth it so I shall just put it with all the other tools i have have no use for it does not come with instructions which was disappointing even if it is supposed to be obvious what a guys supposed to do,103,33
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,i have four different-sized window ac units and none of the sizes on the tool fit the fins on any of them i have noif it works or not it is too much of a hassle to send it back to amazon so for me the tool was a waste of money i wished i had bought this tool from a local store so i could just return it i guess you live and learn,76,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,one of the tines on the 15 side is bent making it nearly impossible to insert into the radiator grill,20,35
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the white plastic part has way too many irregularities i was not able to straighten out my ac condenser it is easier to take a knife and run it down the condenser and straighten out the fins,36,36
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,this tool is destined for the finest garbage pails you can find it does not work it is flimsy and i think a rubics cube is easier to figure out if anyone knows how to use this thing effectively I had like to nominate you for president of the known universe,48,37
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,this tool works but you might want to buy 3 or 4 of them since the plastic teeth break after a few pulls through the fins i had to resort to dragging the tool sideways across the bent fins to straighten them after a few of the teeth broke a tool like this with either high-impact plastic or metal teeth would work much better if it helps i have a coleman-evcon heat pump / ac unit and the 14 count teeth worked well on my fins until they broke of course,89,38
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,anazon is a good place to buy this tool is almost useless for what it is made for there has to be a better tool for this,27,39
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,after getting a little carried away with the power washer i was forced to buy one of these worked well for all but the verywhere our ac unit has a 1 inch metal frame that got in the way of the tool,44,40
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,i used this on a very large 4 x 3 refrigeration condenser which every square inch had been severely damaged by hail the entire job took me a good 5 hours and required a great deal of patience and a little wd-40 this little tool worked beautifully and proved itself tough and versatile not one tooth on this tool was damaged or broken thanks to this little tool my refrigeration unit has been completely restored saving me a tremendous amount of money for replacement,84,41
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,great price and made with quality red handle the white plastic comb is not made to specs the comb teeth are spaced right but the comb teeth are too wide you will have to use sandpaper to make this product work i also had three of the six combs with another problem the teeth of these combs were either bent too far outward or inward and there was no way to correct the problem i think it is a great design but maybe if it was made with a better process and too more ridged specs it could be worth the money and the time if you need anlike this keep searching for a better made product,118,42
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i have a whirlpool window unit that is about five years old this worked just great for it i need to try it on my other unit now but i was impressed with the simplicity the only reason i do not give it five stars is because the plastic tines look they will not have much longevity very happy with this purchase,60,43
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,unfortunately this would not straighten out the fins on my a / c unit i just could not get any section to fit well built and nicely priced if you can get it to work,32,44

Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i have it for both my car and my office they work great and the beads increase circulation which increases male performance after the car has been sitting in the sun all day the seats cool off faster than the steering wheel no need for expensive ventilated seats like amerigon my back and behind are less sweaty the beads also relieve my back pain in the office i get laughed at but it is better than having a loud desk fan to cool you off and my shirts are sweat stain free i wish they made this in black or dark brown because the lightdoes not match my seats,110,1
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,not happy with the product after using the seat for two days the seams came apart after contacting the company i received a full refund without having to return the,31,2

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i have a large leather chair for work i spend most of the day in front of two computers so when the temperatures in southern california go up the leather ceases to be comfortable for me so i purchase this seat from amazon i have used it everyday for the last 2 months and it is very comfortable infact I am sitting on it now quality seems good so far i do not expect to have to replace it for quite a while,82,5
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i was worried the first time i tried this beaded seat cover it was stiff and hard after fifteen minutes it became uncomfortable but like new pair of shoes it is very comfortable after being broke in it keeps my back from sweating so much and feels nice to sit on one thing the band to hold the back to the seat is just barely big enough to go around my seat i do not have anything to hook the loops on the bottom part to but that is not a problem for me i think i would work well enough just sitting unsecured in the seat it is solidly constructed I am 200lbs and have been driving on it for two weeks and can not see any signs of wear or breakage update i use these in the summer time they stay in the back seat during the winter after two summers of sitting on one it fell apart i noticed it tearing one day and a week later it was falling apart all over,171,6

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i love bead seats used them since the 70s when i heard that cab drivers in new york city used them the seat part more important than the back rest at least for me my dogs tore up the back anyway beads are sewed on well i guess because have not lost a bead yet car mfrs do not seem to use a variety of bums to design seats so we have to find something to make them fit our bums better,77,8
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,did not work for my husband in his truck seat he just threw it away,16,9
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,these seemed like a great thing and were cooling to sit upon however the rattan is made of some material possibly nylon that breaks down extremely quickly in our intense southern sun within a few weeks my covers were disintegrating into flakes of beige plastic that infested my car in a huge mess and the covers lost any use as they fell apart i do not recommend these unless you just need something like it for a short car vacation,79,10
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i like the beads but these are actually very cheap they are tearing up already,15,11

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,after one week the rattan on the back portion came apart to be fair i do weigh in at 230 lb i would suppose a lighter person would do better,30,22
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,beaded part is way too small for an adult size rear end I have not had this long and the weaving is already breaking also even before it was breaking it was pulling my hair out i was bargain hunting and now i will just go ahead and buy a real one i love shopping amazoncom but this is terrible quality,60,23

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,summer in florida can be pretty hot these will at least keep a bit of air running between you and the seats these used to be all the rage before the days of a / c but none of the auto supply stores carry them any more,45,26
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,basically it is good and comfortable but one of the bead went off the line after about two weeks since i got it,23,27

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,love this helps me with long drives i wish there was a feature to keep it more in place when getting in car,23,34
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i wish it had a strap to hold it down in place but overall it is as what i expected,21,35
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,it has a 4 weeks shelve life the elastic broke after 3 weeks and i do not even drive every day it shifts all over the place and than the sides get stuck and they rip this is just not up to par avoid buying this,46,36
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,left it in place on the front seat and after a month uv rays had made the plastic edging brittle it started to to disintegrate and leave plastic bits store it in the trunk if you want to keep using it,41,37
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,this seat cover only has on strap that goes over the top part of the seat so the bottom cushion that you are sitting on moves very easily since there is nothing holding it in place or to keep it stable when you go to sit on it it is going to move out of place,55,38
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,it is not as good as the ones I have owned previously the edges curl the beaded portion does the job if i do not get too frustrated with the curling,29,39

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,this did not work very well for what i wanted i was hoping it would be bigger but it was not worth sending it back,23,43
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,the seat cover is fine it does not have the wire insides which after time pokes you in the back the beads are great the only problem is the borders they should be firmer they fold over when you get in the car your leg will catch theafter you are in it is necessary to straighten it out,58,44
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,the product is okay although i expected it to be of better quality well it appears to be cheap as in this looks like it will get ruined in just a short period of time laughing out loud,34,45

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,if you want something that will last a season and then you are just going to thow it out this is ok if you want something that you plan on using more than a year buy something better the outside material started to fall apart after 3 months and i was not putting much stress on it regards james,58,47
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i use it in hyundai elantra 2012 works good i do feel difference for my back during long drive the only concern no fixes on the bottom and top fix too weak as i see you should be a bit accurate,44,48
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i never rate anything excellent than there is no room for improvement the beaded seats are all right not like my old ones but they will do i enjoy sitting on them,32,49
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,this seat has to very significant problems first it is too small for the seat on a chrysler seabring convertible which is pretty remarkable considering the chrysler has an average size car seat second the back strap that is supposed to hold it on to the seat back broke after the third time it was used in the car it rips right at the sewing seam on the attachment point on the side of the seat cover it general is of flimsy poor construction i would definitely not recommend this product and i plan to return it stay away from this one,102,50
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,it keeps my back from sweating in the hot summer here in texas but it curls up in the seat when i get in my vehicle the manufacturer should have put tie strings,33,51
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,i was dissapointed when i unpacked the seat covers for the money i paid for them they are very fragile i already had some beaded seat covers in my car but i wanted to replace them since they slowly started to fray but they were in my car for several years and it was expected these seat covers will not last long judging from the material they are made of,69,52
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,this seat cover is made well it seems durable but it does not put enough space between your seat and you so expect to sweat when using this,27,53
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i was worried the first time i tried this beaded seat cover it was stiff and hard after fifteen minutes it became uncomfortable but like new pair of shoes it is very comfortable after being broke in it keeps my back from sweating so much and feels nice to sit on,51,54
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,product does not have sufficient straps to secure to the seat slides around when entering the vehicle and does not stay in place much too small for a full sized truck,30,55
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,hope they hold up as long as our last pair we love them specially in the summer when the last pair did wear out the beads still stayed in place it was the outer mesh that got worn down from getting in and out so much also you do not even have to use the elastics to hold them in place if you do not want to,65,56
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,the wire surround on the seat is very uncomfortable and cuts off the circulation in my legs would be further off paying more for better quality product,27,57
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i got this because i am trying to protect the seat in my car from sweat after i go to the gym if there was some way to secure it to the seat it would work great it only comes with an elastic band that wraps around the back of the seat and it gets stretched out and moved every time i sit down either cutting into the backs of my knees or blocking the seat belt,77,58
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i am very pleased that bought it I am glad that the quality is excellent and all the normal love it,20,59
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i needed a simple seat for my car that would allow air to flow around my back and seat I have tried others one year later this one is still intact and working fine the strap to hold it to the seat busted a few months ago but that was the weakest part and i expected it otherwise no sign of the main part of this seat falling apart it is good to go,72,60
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,thisis was not worth my time or money true it was inexpensive but this thing will not stay in place on the driver sear of a civic and it is too light-weight to do much in the way of adding comfort it is like putting tissue over the seat on day one one of the wooden balls that you sit on cracked not recommended at any price,68,61
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i bought 2 one for each car the price is good and they did what i wanted which is to keep my back cool only problem is they do not fasten well on the car seats over time the nylon strings got strained and some started breaking in about a years time but still functional i think i got my moneys worth,62,62
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,purchased one of these for my mother n law they are very therapeutic for back and comfortable to set on as well sort of a massage as you go for sore ache backs while driving you will truly love these for drivers or passenger seatswagan in9912 bead and rattan cool seat cover,54,63
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i had this seat cover in the car for one summer and the sun destroyed the weave part it fell apart like straw the only thing left was the wood beads and the fishing line the beads are not wide or long enough to cool you off,47,64
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,this 15relieves back ache and my back is not sticking to the leather seat any more i own a toyota prius and the seats are horrible,28,65
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,the seat was uncomfortable mainly because it could not be secured in place and did not fit my car seat i took it out,24,66
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,these are exactly what they look like beaded car seat covers that are ticky tacky and crappy however that is exactly what i wanted a low cost comfortable way to sit in my car I am happy with the purchase but beware these are not a high endcomfort does not have to be high end,55,67
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i have trouble with my legs going to sleep on long trips so far I have used this beaded seat cover on two trips involving all-day driving each way and have had no problems with my legs the beaded surface takes a little getting used to but after the first 20 - 30 minutes of driving it actually became quite comfortable the seat cover slides around on the seat making it a little awkward getting in and out of the car but that is the only problem i experienced some have complained about poor construction but so far i have had no problems i would buy thisagain,106,68
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,buying this cover was my big mistake it has fallen apart apporximately one month after installing the previous cover was similiar and last for only 3 months,27,69
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,another hot day and I am sitting on my bead and rattan cool seat cover sadly it does not provide the relief I had hoped for it is just not that comfortable or cool it is better than no cover at all but not by a lot also as other reviewers who i bought in spite of reported the fising line that the beads are strung on is after a couple of weeks starting to come loose I am now in the market for another seatcover for my overly-warm desk chair,83,70
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i was looking for a relatively inexpensive beaded seat cover that would allow me to scoot in and out of the drivers seat easier i just bought a new vehicle that has cloth seats and i found it somewhat cumbersome to slide in and out of the drivers seat I have been using this seat cover for about a month now and i have no complaints about it it is durable and comfortable and fits on any sized car seat i would recommend it,82,71
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,first off amazon packed this thing in a massive sized box so when my skybox had to ship this to the caribbean everything cost me 300 us secondly it came apart in 9 days it was also way to small and never covered any part of the chair more like 50 do not let the size on the pic fool you this thing is for a child rubbish,67,72
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i have not experienced anything wrong with it,9,73
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i bought these seat-covers hoping to avoid the summer unpleasantness of sitting on my cars original vinyl seats after about 1 months use the woven edging surrounding the beads began to deteriorate and she had pieces everywhere i swapped passenger driver covers and made it through the summer before the second one similarly deteriorated she had and generally fell apart only the outer surrounding wovenfell apart not the center bead area previously i had used the larger bead-only covers and they lasted several years until the fishing-line string for the bead began breaking i had hoped for longer life from these covers I am a pretty careful person and at 60 and 175lbs i do not think I am oversize for this product on the plus side they did provide relief from the summer vinyl-stickiness however both my covers are in the trash just a few short months after purchase thumbs down for this product,155,74
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,this peice of trash started unraveling within 2 weeks of sitting on it in my office the fishing tackle they use to hold the beads together is already separating from the frame of the chair do not waste your money this thing is cheap junk,44,75
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,the quality of thisis extreamly poor i have 3 of them that are falling apart after 30 days use in 2 different cars the metal on the rim is all bent out of shape the fish line on the beads is coming apart the fish line is sticking me in the back the construction of thisis poor if i could return all 3 and get a refund i would i can not recommend thisto anyone,80,76
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,very comfortable my previous seat lasted for more than 5 years they wear out eventually because you sit and move on them i bought 2 one for each car,29,77
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,have used a beaded seat for years helps with back ache can not find them in local stores anymore so decided to check out amazon the rattan seat still will not conform to my seat and have used it for more than a month still feels stiff and hard to adjust so I shall pass on to my daughter plan to order one that has material around the edges this is the type I have always used so lesson learned,77,78
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i purchased this product a week ago i am in the heating and cooling industry in and out of the van all the time also i travel all the time from customer to customer do not purchase this cover it is falling apart after a week in use the fishing line that holds the beads together is poorly woven the beads are separating from the line,64,79
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,classic and elegant describes this accoutrement to comfortable seating allowing ventilation of what was once a hot leather office chair it transforms the office chair into a vintage antique work of art the blond beads contrast with the black leather background and evoke a celebration of days gone by the caning and stitching are impeccable originally purchased with theof detaching the seat from the back i decided to leave it intact to allow even greater comfort and ease of movement i did not notice or find that there is an elastic strap to hold it to the back of the chair until days later with all due apologies to j peterman,112,80
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,worked fine on my 2000 4runner my recommendations use the clamp method 2 shop clamps not too tight low pressure only need to pump to 5 psi do not put brake fluid in the bleeder use it for pressure only remove old fluid from mc refill install adapter pump to 5 psi adjust as required to hold pressure bleed brake furtherest from mc rear pass side use care not to completely drain mc break seal refill mc and repeat took 30 mins to do all 4 wheels taking my timedid not spill a drop when i did this job 1 year ago i put brake fluid in the bleeder and it leaked at the mc despite passing an initial pressurecheck i also have a 2005 miata for which i have the correct mc adapter threaded even so i prefer to just use the bleeder as a pressure source and continually add brake fluid to the mc as i work my way around the vehicle added benefit no clean up of bleeder required update 2 - 2 - 2018 built this rig and now use it with the power bleeder see pic this works way better holds pressure no leaks again just using as a pressure source 5 - 10 psig i depressurize and refill for each wheel quick and efficient keep level above low level in your mc,203,0
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,first things first get rid of that j hook and chain if you want to keep your sanity if it was not for a reviewer who posted he used clamps instead of the hardware that came with this i would have literally thrown this out no joke the seal just would not happen on a 1999 toyota corolla to even allow proper pressures to hold and it required all this fiddling and screwing for nothing i guess i just could not believe the manufacturer who sells an otherwise excellent product would include something that would not work with that out the way i went to my local hf store picked up 2 inexpensive clamps and man i was amazed at how well it turned out it even seals better than my 1107 requires little fine tune turns to seal does the only downside to using the clamps is not having clearance around the mc to use the clamps but if you do the go for it,162,1
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,this has to be the biggest pos i have run into in a long time no matter what i did it leaked and leaked i removed and cleaned several times tried every position and placement imaginable and when i was done had a puddle under my car and brake fluid all over everything in between suspension a complete waste i will be returning this for sure,66,2
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,the picture shows a male and female hose fitting along with two hose clamps those are not included with the 1101 adapter that i received you must have the two fittings to be able to cut your existing powerbleeder hose then be able to use both your existing adapter and the universal adapter 1101 the powerbleeder does not have a compatible fitting that this will connect to,66,3
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,works well as long as there is a decent flat portion of the body of the master cylinder to hook a chain underneath you will also need space above the master cylinder cap to place this on top tighten it a lot or you will get a slow unnoticeable stream of brake fluid running out of it i noticed by the pool of brake fluid underneath the car then had to crank the wing bolts another 4 - 5 rotations each worked great on 2010 honda fit did not work at all on 2012 camry due to the cap-side of the master cylinder slanting upward meaning the chain would slide right off during tightening this is not the adapters fault I am not sure i could get any adapter to work on that darn thing instead i used a pneumatic air bleeder which works but it is waaaay slower but again it works pneumatic air bleeders do not work on all cars because they do not create a lot of suction pressure,166,4
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this worked excellent to bleed the master cylinder on my toyota mr2,12,5
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,works better than expected use it a a dealership one man job,12,6
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,anything other than a factory fit cap adapter willi have the metal cover with the chains pure torture to use it may feel like it is tight so when you pump it up and start working you see fluid leaking down because the pressureis allowing the fluid to fill too much then brake fluid starts to run out of theyou can get a replacement cap and make your own adapter or pay for theirs,79,7
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,to be fair I have had the motive power bleeder for 10 years without issue however honda and acura among others have to do things a little differently including the caps to their brake reservoirs unfortunately this catch-all solution did not acommodate hondas design flaw imho and i opted for a mityvac-style bleeder instead motive is still my top choice for our other cars,62,8
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,this thing is terrible to use iimpossible to get a good seal on the opening of the mc reservoir i had fluid all over the engine bay and the garage floor i did the set up and tested under pressure without fluid as per the instructions held 15 psi for a minute but about halfway through the job it started spraying fluid all over the place then to add insult to injury when i removed it the tapered seal fell down into the fender and is stuck for life or unless i decide to disassemble the fender off the car i have their machined aluminum caps for my other cars and they work great,114,9
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,will not fit a gen 5 camaro no way,9,10
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,supposed to work on honda but does not work for 2012 crv the ears on the cap are too big and do not allow it to sit on the opening of the reservoir,32,11
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,I am sure with some braking systems this might be a great solution however on my 2005 gx470 there was no way to effectively route the chain beneath the master cylinder without risking interfering with damaging the electronics that are proprietary to the cylinder in the end i had to do it the old-fashioned way have someone press the pedal while i opened the bleeder valve rinse and repeat at least the rear calipers have a brake booster those were a cinch,81,12
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,great concept that is why the 2 stars but tighter than he shall even after i seated it properly and tightening it it still leaked out making a mess want my money back for this and the pump bottle,37,13
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,it works for 2011 rx 350 finally i removed the metal bracket of the brake fluid reservoir and drill a holes on the left side to install a 8 screw which stops the chain to slip out of the bracket during tight the j bolts of the the adapter i add the brake fluid to the reservoir and use motive to pump 10 - 12 pis air for the process wish motive make a better adapter for lexus / toyota without chains and j bolts,81,14
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,unless your master cylinder is completely flat directly under the cap this adapter will not work bought it for my wifes es350 which this is listed as compatible and there is no room to wrap the chain around I have been using motive bleeder for years but this is the first universal adapter I have bought it is not motives fault that toyota use a oddly shaped master cylinder but they should not have listed this as compatible with the es350,77,15
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,universal fit for different size cylinders and does not,10,16
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,the adapter appears to be well made but was larger than i anticipated and did not fit my subaru clutch master cylinder so i was unable to use it,29,17
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,it does not fit the toyota sienna as claimed,9,18
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,used this to do a brake bleed on my 2002 mitsubishi eclipse worked great make sure you do not tighten down too much or it will bow and break the seal definitely worth the price for the add on to an already great system,44,19
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,work great i added a quick disconnect and now it is even easier to use,14,20
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,have attempted many times to use this product and have yet to have it seal well enough that i can actually pressurize the system and bleed the brakes,28,21
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,worked amazingly well unsure why so many have issues with the chain and j hooks sealed fine for me with no issues what so ever i have a suspicion the complaints come from those that are over tightening the wing nuts it takes very little tightening sorry some people should leave vehicle repairs to actual mechanics,56,22
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,do not waste your money poorly designed buy a replacement cap and fitting and make your own cheaper and more effective then this product extremely disappointed i have a european car as well that they make a direct fit cap for and it works great did not expect their other products to perform so poorly,54,23
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,worked well on my old toyota supra the plastic adapter plate and rubber gasket are thick they are able to withstand a reasonable amount of clamping pressure without warping it helps to use some silicone or synthetic-based grease on both faces of the rubber gasket to maintain a good seal i was able to achieve up to 15 psi without any issues the chain and j-hook clamp can be a bit fiddly but not too bad i use the motive system for air pressure only so i was frequently taking the adapter off and putting it back on as i topped off the reservoir during a complete flush of the brake lines i could only wish there was a toyota-specific adapter that might have made the process a little quicker,130,24
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,needed attachment for modern cars to bleed brakes with motive product 105 pressure bleeder system should be included with 105 bleeder as a complete kit,25,25
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,bought this to use to bleed my clutch line although it is for the motive brake bleeder i was able to use it on my clutch master cylinder since it is universal i just had to move it around until it got a nice seal once i got that it worked the same like when using it on the brake master cylinder works great definite must have if you work on different brand cars since it is universal,76,26
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,application guide is wring and is does not for my car called to replace and they said they know it does not fit but will not update their application guides nor were they willing to refund me my money i have pictures to show that despite stating this parts first my car it doe not even come close and there is no alternative part that they make the company was not willing to help in anyway and i will never buy anything from motive products again,86,27
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,5 stars but too much work to fit it on cuz u need to tighten those 2 nuts so 4 stars,22,28
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,used it for a 2006 honda accord it is not a perfect fit and took some adjusting but luckily there were no leaks as i was able to hold it around 10 - 15 psi,32,29
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,received in a timely manner product was as presented,9,30
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,it is not very easy to use on my 07 g35 since it is a universal cap it does not seal 100 the metal chain that goes around the brake and clutch fluid reservoir to create the seal works but the reservoirs are not perfectly flat on the bottom to prevent the chain from moving therefore the chain can move loosening the tension and breaking the seal i would recommend to either pump the brake and clutch pedals the old fashion way to get an actual cap for the vehicle you are working on to make sure there has an appropriate seal brake fluid is very abrasive and having it spill all over the paint is not good which is what happened to me,120,31
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this was just the ticket for the subaru brake bleeding has never been simpler,14,32
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,buy it no more needing to buy multiple taps that are too costly to even bother to buy the tank this should be added to the tank system as an option,31,33
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,this adapter is a pain to use it was difficult to attach to the brake reservoir for my rav4 and corolla and once attached it leaked and was not secure at all i was very worried it would slip off and spray brake fluid every where so i kept the pressure low around 5 - 8 psi i seen alternative ways to attach this adapter to the reservoir with ratchet bar clamp and hopefully if i try the clamp method it works better,81,34
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,i do not know what others are doing to let thisi started and it leaked so i cranked down the wing nuts and no leaking at 15psi in my bleeder used it on my 07 toyota tundra overpriced for what it is so no 5 star review,48,35
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,a great addition to my motive power bleeder and works nicely with a little mods to the sealing of the master cylinder i use this for my 2001 tacoma and my 95 camry a nice tip to make it seal better to your master cylinder is to use a cpl squeeze clamps to help it seal better and hold pressure,60,36
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,two stars because i had to do a 8 upgrade to make it work i purchased this along with the motive products power bleeder european black label which i returned see other review i could not find a black label that is metal instead of plastic for the universal adapter problem is the cap is not rigid enough to hold pressure first time i use itall over the floor since i could not found any metal universal adapter i used a rectangle piece of 1/2 inch thick plexiglass and drilled 3 holes for the center hose and the two j-screws materials and labor from tap plastic cost around 8 slide the plexiglass on top of the cap and tight the j-screw worked the first time i place a small amount of adhesive between plexiglass and adapter so it does not move around too much used on two honda without pressureproblems if there is an option do not buy the plastic adapters at all,165,37
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,is a good fit adapter piece required to bleed brakes on my 1998 toyota corolla,15,38
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,motives website lists this as the adapter for a land rover discovery ii bottom line is that it simply does not fit the application staff or marketing department never bothered to check fitment have used the power bleeder on my other cars and i am please with that product disappointed with the false marketing of this product zero stars,59,39
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,design requires you to secure the universal adapter top down with the provided j screws and chained around the master cylinder however the 2008 honda civic i tried to use this adapter with does not have the master cylinder right under the reservoir so there is no way to adequately secure the adapter down without getting air leaks nicein theory but unless you have a metal master cylinder to secure this piece down tightly with it is completely useless,80,40
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this work perfectly it can be a little bit of a hassle to put on but patience is key follow the instructions and all will be good in the world,30,41
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,2.0,negative,from the description on the website as well as one of the reviews i thought this would work on a motorcycle scooter actually with a 4 cycle engine it does not the packaging on the unit describes it as for automobile engines only after getting it i went to the companys website it too said autos only and recommended a different product for smaller engines like motorcycles this may work fine for autos i do not know but for my scooter it did not work at all I am a bit mystified how the one user got such good results on his motorcycle engine my advice unless you want this for an automobile engine this probably is not the right product for you,120,0
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,5.0,positive,i used this to provide rpm data while rejetting and fine tuning the carburetors on my motorcycle it worked well and seems to have a decent build quality make sure to clamp the tool on the plug wire in the right direction know if you are testing a two or four stroke engine and know something about how many spark pulses are sent per engine cycle,66,1
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,to my surprise when it came time to use the product did not work having waited to long to use it the return warranty had expired so no return for me,30,2
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,did not use it right away but when i did it did not work at all too late to return so just threw it away seems like you just never know about electronic equipment,33,3
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,funny they do not show the packaging in the add it clearly states for 3456 or 8 cylinders also states for smaller engines please see our model 321 now i want to send it back as it will not work on a 2 cylinder harley-davidson and they want me to pay shipping insurance and a return fee not disclosed guess i will not purchase from unbeatablesale inc again,67,4
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,this worked well for my needs i was worried at first because of thebetween the sensor and my plug wires but it gets a good consistent reading every time i do not have a tach on my bike so i need this to set idle when syncing my carbs i bought this after a few good recommendations and fully recommend it as well as usual amazon had the best pricing,71,5
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,i am very satisfied with this product i repair small engines and this unit does exactly what i need it to do,22,6
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,this tach works pretty good only drawback is it is directional sometimes that puts the display on the back side and makes it hard to read but overall a nice tool,31,7
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,works as advertised and performed it is function just like i had hoped it would i needed to verify the rpms on my v twin motorcycle,25,8
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,5.0,positive,i found the digital clamp-on tachometer the tool i have sought since buying my motorcycle in 1999 setting the idle speed was a constant challenge due to the motorcycle not having a tachometer i finally have a reliable idle speed and found the tool to work as well on automobiles and other engines,53,9
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,this tach does not work well at all while you can hear that the engine is running at a steady speed the tach reading will vary by as much as 400 rpm or more with an engine running at a reasonably steady 1000 rpm at idle the tach will read from 800 to 1200 to even 1300 or 1400 at times worthless as a engine tuners tach if i had not already disposed of the packaging i would have returned the device and gotten my money back do not buy this tach for engine tuning totally unreliable,97,10
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,just received this lights and got done installing them as night arrived i coulnt wait to see them at night well the lights make the car look better but i was expecting them just to be a little brighter overall I am very happy with them have no regrets you can not beat them for the price,57,0
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,awesome head lights bought this set to replace the set i put in my truck 8 years ago,18,1

Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,shipping was quick and I shall give kudos to the vendor who replaced bulbs and refunded s / h for return bulb was in my foglight assembly for 3 days and it blew up inside unit yes i cleaned bulbs prior to installing i had to take fog light apart to clean lens inside and remove glass debris bulbs have been kindly replaced by vendor but in the interim i bought a cheap set of hyper yellows for half the price and they are still working and going on 2 months without any issues do not recommend the bulb but i recommendf the vendor for their customer service excellent,108,3
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,dim barely bright enough i was not expecting such a dim bulb but i guess you get what you pay for lesson learned,22,4
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,received the product fairly quickly put it in and it works it has been a week and it works so far i am not that picky on thestyle and more of my headlights just need something that works hope it will last long,44,5
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,fast 2 day delivery got them for my 1999 oldsmobile intrugue gls with a bulb size of hb4 or 9006 these bublbs are amazing nice white light with a touch of blue light it is a whole diffrent world driving with these bulbs they allow a larger angel of view my only problem with them is that i do not know if these are dot department of transportaion approved but minus that these are awesome for 1850 with shipping,77,6
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,bought these because when i got a front end repair the dealership did not know where i got them from looked very similiar to what i hd before untill after a weak the blue part of the headlight was melting off did not even bother returning them did more reviews and learned some of these are imitation and not from nokya so be careful who you buy these from,68,7
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,i have tried different headlight bulb from the silverstar to ultra and different asian made bulbs this particular product gave me what i was looking for which is a brighter and consistent light at night travel on the freeways fantastic highly recommended,42,8
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,do not waste your time or money on these lights received them in a reasonable amount of time and they installed without issue after 20 minutes of use i realized that these were junk heres why 1 while they shine white they do not shine bright dangerously low light output while driving at night 2 they put out so much heat after the 20 minutes on drive time that my headlights were too hot to stand in front of or touch if you disregard my warning make sure to get a wire harness to protect your oem wiring 3 the blue flaked off of these during my drive time i have to assume from the heat do not buy,117,9
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,i had an issue with my headlight that i think where stock well anyways they were real nice and blue and after looking around at the normal spots i found that no one caried ones that where similar to the ones i wanted i was willing to wait for the shipping time and I am glad i did because these were much cheaper then one would be at the dearship i think,73,10
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,i bought these for my wifes 1997 honda accord gave a nice light blue tint to the light unfortunately after 2 weeks one of the headlights died spent a few dollars more and got ge ones and have had them since these would have gotten a better score if they would have lasted longer than 2 weeks,57,11
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,this has to be the worst headlights ever made they are coated with a transparent blue paint that cracked and fell off after 20 minutes of driving time i had to put my old headlights back in because these were so dim i could not see the road the yellowish ones you can get at walmart are brighter,57,12
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,i purchased these bulbs for my low beams in my 2009 mitsubishi lancer because i wanted hid style lights without the hid price i have to say these bulbs look great a much whiter light almost with a blue hue to them it gave my car exactly the look i was going for at a fraction of the cost the only downside is that they are not very bright about the same or slightly less than the stock bulbs so if your looking for a hid look but not a super bright light then these are a great buy,99,13
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,the bulbs look nice and give the crisp white light that is promised but at less than half the light output of the stock bulbs and closer to a quarter of the silverstars that i had prior if your purpose is to see better at night do not get these bulbs i have been useing my dims which are silverstar ultras since installation because they allow me to see better i bought the nokya for my highs,77,14
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,after talking with the manufacturer in canada i purchased this kit so to mount my rack that i had on a 2005 silverado because the beds are a little different i was able to use the older rack by changing the mounting hardware very easy to do and the kit includes the plates that sit on the rail as well as the channeled bracket that the actual rack sits in took about 45 minutes with the help of my wife who threaded on the nut to the pocket bolt so to secure it enough to snug every thing down,99,0
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,i ordered this thinking it is a safety back-rack like the description says but it is not it is a additional part i guess to make the rack complete look as hard as i may i can not see anywhere on the picture this bolt-on addition i thought the price was a little low but reasoned it was an introduction price to get it on the market a complete waste of time and money this is the third time i have ordered from amazon and i was sent something different from what was pictured or advertised,94,1
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and just as described thank you,8,2
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,just wish these kits were not so damn expensive,8,3
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,needed some modifications to work had to drill 2 new holes to mount back rack,15,4
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,the backrack 30119 safety rack kit served it is purpose except that for a 2015 silverado the rail plates and pocket bolt are not needed if you have an inside rail tonneau cover installed so you need to purchase the tonneau cover adapter kit plus the exposed rail pocket mount bolt could have been better thought out update almost 2 years in use now no regrets at all,66,5
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,very nice and fit excellent but why can not the bolts be black to match the rest of the system,19,6
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,the kit was high-quality and easy to install,8,7
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,the mount was totally rong for my 2012 f150 i went on youtube after i received my mount and found out the model number to order so research before ordering to find what works best on your truck,38,8
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,exactly what i was looking for perfect fit,8,9
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,i have been ordering from amazon for years and never had a problem until today i purchased thisthinking i would get all that the description detailed i did not brackets came and nothing else after talking with representatives of amazon it came down to they did not support what they advertise and will not stand by their website offers i am very disappointed and will certainly be very cautious if ever buying from amazon again dissatisfied customer,79,10
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,2.0,negative,this kit has to be bought to fasten the backrack to the truck box however the image included two runners with the rack kit even showing the whole rack kit the rack kit includes only two bolts and washers another one of those sales tricks by backrack,47,11
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,1.0,negative,a real piece of junk the worst 10 bucks spent in my life it does not hold anything any type of bottles coffee cup from any brand will not fit and it will be quite dangerous to drive with a beverage in this cup holder especially if it is a hot beverage because it will fall down on either your legs or your passengers 100 of the times not to mention the fact that with this cup holder on you can literally forget about using the emergency brake again you will not be able to reach it if a bottle or a coffee cup are sitting in it and the brake will not pull all the way i do not know who designed / projected this piece but he / she was definitely not the sharpest pencil in the box do not waste your money like i did,141,0
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,blocks mirror switches limits parking break s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s,21,1
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,got here just on time great shippment pros easy install took 2min tops and dose not get in the way dose what it is suppose to do and best of all it matches the hard pastic cons not much to say just that large drinks will tend to tip over if your not holding them correctly uther than that i just drink out of cans it is a must buy,69,2
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,this is an excellent product it is easy to install took only minutes to install still allows me to use my emergency brake and looks like it came from the factory it holds a 12 oz can or a small drink from mcdonalds perfectly and that is the problem a 20 oz drink bottle most medium drinks my eco canteen and every large drink will simply not fit you know those plastic cups they have at 711 quick trip and arbys that get smaller at the bottom to help them fit into older cupholders well they fit this almost you can shove it down a bit and it will stand up when you are sitting still but if you do not keep a hand on it it will definitely fall over under even mild acceleration or cornering still this is better than no cupholder at all some time ago i saw a cupholder that fit into these small ones that held bigger drinks i found the kaz e kup [ ] which is sort of like what i remember seeing if i can not find anything better i will definitely order that if the drink holes were only bigger this would be a 5-star product,200,3
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,i had the cup holder in my 1990 xj for 4 months until it broke it gets in the way of the hand brake and met it is demise by a hard yank when i parked on an uphill it will not let the hand brake lift enough to lock the wheels the only good thing i found about it is that it is made with durable plastic that matches the center console but unfortunately mounts into it poorly you are better off with one of those one dollar cup holders from the auto store,91,4
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,goodbut it has very shallow cup wells and dramatically limits the movement of the brake lever not safely usable,21,5
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,work as well as expected it was an afterthought and designed in the 80s works great compared to not having anything at all,23,6
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,did not fit in my jeep it said it would for the year mine is and it did not,17,7
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,this fit perfectly into the 89 jeep cherokee that my husband bought as a work truck it came well packaged and made it before christmas,25,8
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,if the handbrake is the maladjusted the cup holder does not work crashes with the handbrake my truck is a cherokee 88 and this not worked fine,27,9
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,purchased this for my jeep because if you have one you know that they do not have any up front only drawback i see is that the cup spaces are not quite deep enough and the smaller deeper holes are not big enough for a large sized drink depending on the cup obviously otherwise it is totally worth the money for the upgrade,59,10
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,it is exactly what i was looking for could have been a bit bigger than it was but it still works,21,11
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,fits nicely over the emergency brake handle and installed very easily with the two screws under the armrest between the front seats,22,12
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,the cup holder works and fits perfectly i was so glad i found this if ur cups do not fit as deep as you want all you have to do is cut the bottom out and this thing works perfect steal deal for the money,44,13
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,I had give this a 5 start but i had to modify in between the tabs slightly so my arm rest would latch shut otherwise awesome product,26,14
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,easy to install it fits very well very secure if your parking brake takes more then 3 clicks to hold the back brakes you will be lifting up the holder and if you need to do it you will have about 2 to hold the handle to release the brake i use my hand brake every time i park so it is bit of a pain size works great for 12 oz cans a thermal coffee cup is a bit wobble if it fits mine do not i use mine thought the summer the remove it for wiinter,94,15
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,ok so it are not perfect you will have a serious problem in finding one that is they are not out there had mine for six months and would not be without it hate those that hang on the door sill we tend to use 12 oz cans and med cups it would be nice if it held larger cups but gargantuan ones are asking a bit much so we are ok with it fit was good and installation was easy looks good need to cut the e brake hole out for a better fit but we will buy another if this one happens to break,102,16
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,finnnially a cup holder only cons are that i have to tighten the brake cable so it does not hit it,20,17
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,the cup holder will only hold a soda can bottom size i did find a thermos that fit perfectly in there,21,18
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,we bought this for our 95 cherokee country and now i do not know how we ever lived without a cup holder this is a great product the only drawback is that it does not quite fit some of the larger cups that being said it is much nicer than not having a cup holder at all great fitment and a solid mount,60,19
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,this was the best price and theshipped fast it was just as decribed and works well in my vehcicle,21,20
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,1.0,negative,soda cans is all that will fit in the cup holders and they will not stay put the holders are too shallow for a 4x4 there is not enough clearance to set your parking brake,34,21
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,the cup holder installs quick and easy and it looks pretty good but that is all my biggest problem with the cup holder is that nothing fits in it my coffee mug does not fit 20 oz bottles do not either i have tried all kinds of bottles and the only thing i have found that fits is a can of soda i would not buy again and would not recommend anyone else to buy,72,22
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,muy bueno es lo que buscaba excelente producto lo recomendare a otros porque en estos tiempos hay que estar seguro de lo que se compra aunque choca un poco con la palanca del freno hay que subirla con cuidado thanks,39,23
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,it is nice and works like a charm only draw back is it leaves your e brake virtually useless and it does not come with hardware 2 screws so all in all it was very nice for the 6 dollars i payed for it i recommend to anyone who wants a small cup holder in there jeep,55,24
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,easy to install took me 2 minutes tops works great better then not having 1 at all great price looks factory arrived earlier then expected,25,25
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,picked up one of these for my 96 you will notice 2 things when installing first your center console lid will be more difficult to close second you do not have as much room for your e-brake handle and if it is not lined up with the slot perfectly it will hit the holder and crap the very thin screw mounts overall not a great product check out places like jeepforum and naxja for better methods I have seen a few that use a short piece of pvc pipe and work great,91,26
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,good jeep cherokee cup holder who ever says they suck no they do not took less then 2mins to put in my 1988 jeep cherokee also they hold med cups like from mcdonalds i only got it for it to put a cup in it to dip works good and i order it last friday and just got it today not bad shipping well packaged also will order from again soon thank you,72,27
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,perfect fit fast shipping good packaging makes the crv standout with these slim but stylish deflector followed directions and some quick you tube videos,24,0
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to enable me to leave the windows open without the rain coming in on rainy days i have a big dog that needs much window space as possible after some tweaking and ligth pounding the items began to fit well while allowing the windows to fully close when wound up,55,1
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,i filled in the information online to determine if these weather tech deflectors would fit my 2012 honda crv the website came back with a green check and indicated they would fit my car i ordered based on that information when the deflectors arrived they did not fit the car even after sending the vendor a screen print of the window showing the items would fit i still had to pay the freight to return the deflectors i ordered honda oem deflectors online they fit great and look fantastic,90,2
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,would have given a 5 star rating because i think the fit could be just a little better the design is great and it stops the rain really well and matches the look of my crv black i just think it could have been made to fit into the corners a little better,53,3
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,thisdoes not fit 2012 crv too bad because i love the weather tech side vents noticed that amazon still advertises them for this model looks like more people will be disappointed and have to return them at their own expense,43,4
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,i wanted the side window deflector that went in the window channel and these did that and so easy to install love them and great here in fl as i can now leave my windows cracked and not worry about rain getting in well one of the rear deflectors is missing off my car and now weather tech tells me theyweathertech custom fit front and rear side window deflectors for honda ridgeline dark smoke did not come from them yes it did and if i want to replace it i will have to buy a pair expected that but 55 and i only had it on for one month,111,5
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,i was very impressed with this product great quality perfect fit i would highly recommend this product to anyone satisfaction guaranteed,21,6
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,I have purchased weathertech products since 2005 and they are consistently high quality this product is no different i even got a great deal although the amazon warehouse deals it said it was used but the only thing i saw that was slightly off was the box wrinkled and shelf worn the weathertech product was in new condition and it installed with no problem whatsoever functionally you can drive with your windows down to the level of the deflector or slightly lower and not get that huge rush of wind and attendant noise that comes with it you can also leave your windows cracked open so the heat escapes when it is parked and to everyone else from the outside it looks like the windows are up dark tint,128,7
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,the front deflectors fit well but they tend to rattle when the wind hits them just right the rear deflectors are terrible since they do not prevent water from entering in a 2010 honda cr-v the problem is the honda rear window design is not suited for rain deflectors i left the rear window deflectors in however since weather tech would not offer my installer a partial refund note that the metal clips that are used on the rear deflectors have permanently damaged the rubber trim on the windows be careful how you install them so you do not bend the rubber window trim eventually the rear deflectors kept coming loose and kept falling off so i eventually removed them bottom line i recommend that you do not buy the rear deflectors on a honda cr-v i also bought a pair for my wifes 2014 honda civic 4-door lx and the right passenger deflector is constantly coming loose and falling out of the window after 1 year,165,8
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,i received a different brand of window deflector for christmas but knew that i really wanted the weathertech product i ended up purchasing these deflectors at a great price through the amazon warehouse as a product that would come in a damaged package yes the package was damaged but the product was undamaged i have not installed them yet but have no doubt they will work great i really like the fact the front windows do not require any adhesive to keep them in place weathertech makes some great products,90,9
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,front door shades installed easily w / easy to follow directions rear door shades had to have about 1/16th of an inch removed from the rear tab for proper fit and even then did not really fit the contour of the window opening the first time the right rear window was opened after apporximately 30 hours the shade fell in the street a little more trimming of the rear tab and it fit well enough to hold for the past two weeks i expected a better fit from this manufacturer,88,10
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,2010 cr-v ex-l the front deflectors do not stay attached i have received replacements followed the online video and talked to tech support they are installed correctly they stay on for a couple weeks but when the climate heats up in birmingham al and you close the door firmly the visors fall off the left visor has fallen off driving down the road yet when installed they feel very solidly attached they are priced right look wonderful and i am so against paying honda 230 plus labor to install the honda version but since these were a gift for my fiance i have no choice bottom line the front deflectors do not stay in i have an acura tl the weathertech visors i installed stay in and look good i have a pt cruiser the weathertech visors i installed stay in and look good,144,11
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,came as described very good classy quality and fits really well 2008 honda cr-v easy to install it just took me 10 minutes overall nice deflector,25,12
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,like user james f wadford in a previous review i too received the visors in terrible condition there are deep scratches on all 4 visors and the front visors both seem to have fingerprint-like imprints in the plastic itself worthy of note the underside to all 4 visors are super clean and clear with no scratches i returned the first set and asked amazon for a replacement which i received the replacement is in worse shape there has even white film of dust on the underside of all 4 visors but none on the outside facing surface one bad batch is understandable 2 products with the exact same problem speaks to a bigger problem i returned the replacement and will look for different visors for my vehicle,126,13
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it works it fits but the double sided tape that came with it sucks just replace it with something better and it does what it says,26,0
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,a great product holds my mic and do not fall off dash in rough and bumpy construction roads i would tell my friends about this product,24,1
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,got this to hold my cobra cb radio the sticky tape does not hold more than a few paperclips before it falls off i had to use a 3 m yellow weatherstrip adhesive glue to affix it to my dash i did not want to drill holes now I shall probably have to scrape glue off if i ever want to move it,59,2
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,after two days it fell off the tape was still on the truck but the holder was not on the tape any more i put a few drops of superglue on the holder and put it back on two days later the adhesive tape came loose from the truck i was hoping to have a mic holder without drilling holes in the truck but this product did not fit the bill it is pretty much worthless if it falls off i would not buy this,81,3
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i like the product works well i have not used the adhesive part of it yet so can not comment on the stickyness of it from the way my dash is in my truck it worked better to gorilla glue it from the side so did not use the adhesive part but it fits perfectly with what i wanted to hang on it the only reason it is 4 star is because i have not used the adhesive part but it is a sturdy piece,80,4
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,came with an adhesive tape for mounting on the back my mic fit perfect inside and seems to hold strong i like that it is black and blends in,28,5
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,bought this because i did not want to drill holes in the interior of my truck to hang my ham mic reading all the past negative reviews about the tape being cheap and not sticking l went ahead and bought some 3 m heavy duty double sided tape and replaced it with the one that came with the holder over 6 months with now it is still holding with no signs of it coming off awesome holder you shall just have to upgrade the tape yourself,83,6
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,junk actually all of these adhesive mike holders are junk cheaply built the adhesive is worthless and all of these adhesive mike holders use the same 3 m adhesive use this and no matter how well you clean the surface it sticks to your mike will soon be on the floor along with the adhesive mike holder this one worked just as well as the rest of them mike on the floor use the supplied mike holder and screws that come with your mike instead threw this in the trash not worth returning,90,7
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,ok had to put new tape on back,8,8
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,these work well for holding the yaesu button type microphones models like the feet-891 feet-7800 and more the included adhesive pad is garbage and did not even last a day scrape it off and use some good 3 m double sided tape,39,9
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,it works well and looks nice does not have a lock on it like most metal ones but i knew that as other reviews said i had to replace the double stick tape it did not even last a day with the tape it came with,44,10
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,purchased this to hold the control for my hospital bed so that i am not always dropping it on the floor,21,11
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the tape does not work it keeps falling off,8,12
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,depends on what you attach it to I have moved it three times on my car 2009 cadillac cts to find a place where the adhesive will stick without loosening suffice to say I have replaced the double-stick tape a couple times before i found a good attachment point,47,13
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it is a piece of plastic with tape on it it gets the job done but it is overpriced also make sure you know where you are going to stick it before you do because you only get one shot this thing probably cost a penny to produce,46,14
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not work at all i installed and it fell off within seconds i bought this so that i would not drill holes in my dash luckily amazon gave me credit for the 2 that i bought i like thebut beyond that,48,15
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,works a treat until it does not very light mic it might hold for a day then the whole things winds up on the floor i re-stick the black plastic to the sticky back and it stays for maybe another few hours then again the whole thing winds up on the floor going to try the sticky back from 3 m command hooks and see if that works if this were just a hanger type mic i would already have used the 3 m product,82,16
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,adhesive does not hold replaced with gorilla tape mic fits clip well,11,17
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,do not waste your money the glue on the pad will not hold the holder and the mic it holds the holder just fine but as soon as you put your mic in it the holder separates from the sticky pad it is not sticky enough,43,18
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i installed this carefully after cleaning my fjs smooth dash panel and left it overnight to bond on properly as soon as the fairly light handset of my cb radio was placed in it the adhesive failed and it fell off the dash,43,19
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,just what u needed for the limited space in my jeep holds very well,14,20
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i had a place for this thank you,8,21
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,hooks great but the double sided tape did not take nothing some glue can not fix,14,22
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it did not stay stuck on clean plastic and in the shade longer than a day,16,23
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the double stick tape was not strong enough to hold my michadto add a screw,16,24
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,as others have stated the adhesive is not strong enough to support a mic i immediately replaced with some 3 m auto double-sided foam adhesive that i already had this holder works perfectly with my yaesu mh-48 mic in my car can not beat the price,44,25
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i bought this knowing that i would need to purchase better tape although i did test the provided tape first it did not stay up more than 5 minutes after a trip to the hardware store and spending more on 3 m tape than i spent on this holder everything is in place and holding minus 2 stars for worthless tape 1 star back for still providing me with an alternative to drilling into my dash,74,26
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it was an add-onso I am not terribly disappointed but it tried i guess the adhesive backing is not strong enough to do anyone any good mine fell off before i even attempted to stick a microphone into it,39,27
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off within a few hours the truck never moved from it is spot either,14,28
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i used some super glue and fixed it to my dash next to my steering column and it fits my mic perfect and has worked for me for 2 years,30,29
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,adhesive backing fell off without even holding the mic yet giant fail,12,30
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,terrible will not stick do not waste,8,31
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,even after cleaning the mounting surface the cheap tape on mic holder will not hold for very long had to purchase 3 m tape which has worked so far this product is not worth the money because you have to spend more money to buy 3 m tape to make this product work,50,32
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,this is so i inexpensive but absolutely great i attached this to my rear view mirror and love it you must buy this,23,33
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,overpriced but it does what it is supposed to the included adhesive tape is sketchy,14,34
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,fell off my plexiglass boat windshield after 3 days in the backyard under a cover glued it back on with marine adhesive hope it works,25,35
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,bought this exact hook in a truck stop what a piece i held firm for about an hour then flop ford my microphone and this thing down into the floor under my feet and looking at where it was on the dash it left a ridiculous residue took me close to 30 minutes to clean a 11 inch square if i could give zero stars i would,67,36
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,does the job very well looks better in my truck than those shiny chrome holders and you can not beat the price,21,37
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,looks good because its black adhesive does not work should come with a screw so it works,16,38
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off every surface in my car the adhesive on this is a joke,14,39
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the double sided tape is crap old news but goop glue and a few seconds and it will never move again this thing is like a rock and works great in my van even with the kids climbing all around it with the mic is on it,47,40
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the adhesive does not work very well do not waste your money,10,41
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,although it arrived on time and in good condition the quality of the product is poor the double sided tape failed after less than 20 minutes and i found my mike on the floor of my truck the tape stayed where i had mounted it but the holder fell off i replaced the original tape with a 3 m product and everything is where it should be for the price i expected better,72,42
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,i had ended up purchasing 2 of these the first one fell off not through amazon when i bought a second thinking maybe it was a bad batch of adhesive nope they all suck i did get the product a little cheaper although at a truck stop so buying 2 was not so bad 250 ea i ended up buying some 3 m double stick tape and now works great with the modified tape i would give it a 5 star but as sold defiantly a 1 star as no stars is not an option,93,43
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,there is not much to say it is a very simple solid piece of plastic but it holds my midland cb 75 - 822 perfectly the tape provided did not hold up very long so expect to buy something stronger and be sure to clean the surface well first alternatively you could also drill it into your dash if you do not mind altering your vehicle,61,44
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,cheap plastic and the mic does not fit very well i mounted it with velcro so it did not spoil my dash,20,45
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i thought this would look nicer than an aluminum one the adhesive is very cheap it will not support my mic and fell off after about 60 seconds certainly would not hold up off road might work better with some quality 3 m adhesive strips,42,46
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i bought this for my jeep a few warm summer days and the adhesive backing gives way with out any weight on it i keep my mic in the glove box while not in use so the mount has only it is weight and it still falls,46,47
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,the product was fine but i found a different the filled my needs better the size was fine adios adios,20,48
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,I am recommending against this holder back in the olden days you could almost never count on backing-adhesives doing the job but I have been surprised over the years how much better those products have become unfortunately this product does not exhibit those improved characteristics even although i carefully cleaned the surface to which this product would adhere the adhesive failed hold almost instantly the adhesive fell apart at two points amazon did refund my account also thisshould have costs 49 cents not 379 it is just a tiny piece of plastic,91,49
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the self stick tape lasted less than one hour in my car before this thing fell off of the dash to make it works i had to by a better double back tape,33,50
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,perfect fit for a typical cb handset but will require either a screw or some real tape the surface material included is just plain poor i ultimately just drilled a small screw into my dash works perfect,37,51
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the slot is just a hair tight for the mic but I am sure it will loosen up after time looks great in my new car,24,52
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i lost my cb radio mic mount so i bought this one i read the reviews saying that the adhesive is weak no problem right away i tore off the old adhesive tape and replaced it with scotch extreme mounting tape which claims to hold 20 lbs got it at home depot the tape is insanely strong i used to have my mic velcrod to my dash and so i would always pull it straight off I have accidentally tried doing that several times with this mount instead of pulling up first and it has held with no problems good stuff,100,53
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the adhesive is very strong and can withstand the excessive use my little sister puts on it when she rides with me i really can not complain looks nice in black interior of vehicle as well,35,54
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,my husband wanted a holder to put in his car to hold his microphone for his ham radio system his old one kept falling off the dashboard this one really did the trick,33,55
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i tried this once used it for 15 months it broke got another used it for two months same problem got a third use dif for a couple months anther problem thankfully amazon refunded my money and i opted for another brand i am usually a fan of dorman products bunt not this one buy it only if you want to have that pit in your stomach wondering where you will be when you window just rolls itself down and will not go back up am i bitter you could say that,91,0
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,installed two weeks ago saved 6000 over dealer price so far so good I shall have to see how it holds up of course it is made in china,27,1
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,junk i purchased this switch dorman 901 - 002 in april to replace the failed window master switch 3 months later the driver window down stopped working,25,2
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,very affordable easy to install and now all my power windows work again great product delivered and works as stated online,21,3
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i purchased the dorman switch after a few month it started to not work properly i contacted amazon and was told it was out of there warranty and they told me to contact dorman i asked for contact information on dorman they told be they did not have any contact information i was told to google dorman to get the information i find it hard to believe the have no contact information on one of there vendors thanks amazon for sub-standard service,82,4
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,the worst part was figuring out how not to damage the cover and remove the old switch after that it was simple i saved at least a hundred dollars not too difficult,33,5
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,yeh this was the right one i ordered and now we have working windows in our car thanks for being able to designate the parts to the originals of my car,31,6
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,had bought one for my buick from an online auto place about 18 months ago the drivers down switch failed dorman has a lifetime guarantee returned the bad one got a refund and bought this for 30 less on amazon perfectamundo,41,7
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,it looks and works just like the original for a fraction of the price and it is easy to install,20,8
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,the switch did not work i had to go to the dealer and get a switch very frustrated it appears to be an after market,26,9

Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,jus bought this dorman 901 - 002 window switch march 302012 and it has stop workin sept 162012 not a good look,21,12
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i have had this switch for just a bit over a year and it has been not working 100 right for several months the buttons simply work when they want and one failed to the point of me unplugging the power connector to the window motor to keep from getting stuck with it down very frustrating two of the four switches are junk in less than a year cmon i paid 36 38 ish something for it much less than a dealer for sure but i just replaced it with another that i got delivered for 2299 off e-bay much cheaper price probably about the same quality buyer be warned read the other reviews and as for trying to warranty a piece of crap my philosophy is this if the first one is not good why in the world would i want the same aggravation again even for free under warranty I shall take my chances on another imported brand,156,13
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,first the warranty dorman limited lifetime warranty at dorman we take pride in the quality of our products and your satisfaction with their performance thus dorman warrants it is products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service as your exclusive remedy dorman will replace free of charge any dorman product that in dormans reasonable determination does not comply with the foregoing warranty this warranty is voided by non-recommended use improper installation or physical damage in addition dorman will not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages and your exclusive remedy shall be replacement of the product that did not comply with this limited warranty i replaced both the regulator / motor and this switch on my 1997 buick century the switch is working properly but i just put it in the form factor was exact and i had no installation or fit problems if there is a problem i will addendum this review,158,14
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,fit the a-pillar of my 2002 audi a6 bi-turbo very well right out of the box can be molded better if desired comes with 1/4 insulator pad to take up gaps as well highly recommended especially for the price,39,0

Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,i bought a glowshift transmission temperature gauge and later bought this pillar pod as an after thought it worked great fit like a glove on my 91 ford explorer pillar post after painting it to make the colour of the interior it looks like it was factor oem a trick i learned is to heat up the pod with a blow dryer then form it to fit the pillar screw it into place and let it cool down then remove and paint to match works like a charm,88,2
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,4.0,positive,did not fit my truck but a little heat and fit perfect,11,3
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,ordered two different holders and both did not fit,8,4
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,this is not universal i had to do a lot of modifying to make it fit poorly,17,5
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,after waiting to collect theit is not a universal fit and the guage does not fit so it is totally useless to me total waste of money,27,6
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,had a good comment on this from the repair shop looks professional,12,7
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,thanks for the pillar pod i recommend this product to anyone who decides to buy gauges they fit the way they say they do and this will be the second one I have installed so far and i am very satisfied,41,8
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,did not even come close to fitting the a pillar in my car would not recommend to anyone this at all,20,9
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,how this worthless frankenpod can be described as universal is a mystery to me i bought one for my suburban and there is no way repeat no way this thing can come anywhere near close to being made to fit the pillar i frankly can not imagine it fitting anything short of a piece of heavy earth-moving equipment such as a bulldozer or the like it is just one of those things i wrote off to experience can not win them all good luck getting any use out of it if you have the misfortune to buy one,97,10
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,when used with the included sticky rubber mat this holder securely holds my iphone or garmin nuvi gps the dashboard on my honda odyssey has a nice flat spot that it can sit very stable the material of the holder is a foam so it will not damage your electronics and you can easily squish it into your glove box too the stickiness of the rubbery mat is a downfall as it attracts dust and dirt if you would like to see additional pics of this holder please see the ones i posted in the photos section,96,0
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,whether this works for you depends largely on what type of car you drive it seems to work better in my car than in my husbands but the dashboards are totally different even in my car i did have some trouble with this falling when i accelerated quickly or took a sharp turn also it really is not an attractive device in any way but when it works it gets the job done people may want to try something like this before getting one of the mounts you need to attach or suction-cup to your window,95,1
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,this was a decent product it sits on the dashboard and holds a portable gps it allows your hands to be free for driving i find it handier for holding an ipod than a gps on the negative side it is a large block of foam sitting on the dashboard which i do not like but if that kind of thing does not bother you go for it there are several well-placed holes for running cords through it also came with a sticky pad for the dashboard to keep things from sliding,89,2
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i was truly hoping this might be a viable solution when traveling through states which do not allow for windshield-mounted gps units i have tried vent-mounts previously with relative success but found turning corners to be an issue when the vent-mount would swing away from view the concept of the commutemate navcup is a good one the execution of the concept however is poor first the cradle will accomodate only the thinnest of gps units which rules out the use of my navigon gps second in spite of power cord cut outs in the cradle for routing the cord they will not accomodate a standard length micro usb jack in the bottom of one of my gps units to say nothing of the offset micro usb jack on a secondary gps unit i own the cost of return shipping does not make it cost effective to return so perhaps my review will spare another from making an unnecessary purchase i think if heininger holdings would redesign the cradle they may have a good product on a positive note the dashgrip mat that came with it should be useful for securing loose items on my center console,196,3
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,would not stay on dashboard ended up using them in the home for my iphone 4,16,4
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,this product was ok but it is very light and when you make right or left turns in the car it slides off the dashboard to easy when you make a turn have to hold it or it will not stay,39,5
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,navi-cup does what it is designed to do put your gps where you can see but not in your line of sight on the windshield,24,6
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,fine for the gps but the iphone falls out fast delivery would order again,15,7
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i love it it makes it very easy to see my gps and it does not move or slide around,20,8
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,do not like the product at all first it does not fit on the dash of our car and second it falls overtime there is a somewhat sudden stop,29,9
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,this holds my gps and other things very well no problem traveling and handling the portable gps unit anymore may be expensive for some but it is worth it to not have to pick the gps off the floor everytime you make a turn the holder keeps it stable,49,10
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i just received my navcup yesterday and i am very happy with the ease of use the simplicity of design and the visibility of my gps unit while sitting in the holder i wish i had one of these years ago instead of the suction cup method i had been using with the suction cup i had to permanently attach a plate to the surface of my dash not good if you ever want to switch to a different gps unit also the gps unit always seemed crooked while being held by the suction cup holder with the navcup my gps unit sits perfectly straight i am not familiar with the durability of the sticky pad but if it continues to be just as sticky i just do not see any reason not to give the product a heart felt 5 star rating i love everything about it,147,11
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,not thrilled the gps did not fit well so i am not using it the cord was in the way so it did not lay correctly,26,12
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,so happy to find a way to support / display the gps without it being stuck on windshield stable yet removable if needed made of foam but sturdy,26,13
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i was skeptical about buying this but it has actually worked a lot better than i had anticipated you do need the sticky dash mat to go between this and your dashboard to keep it in one place it is worth more than it is price,45,14
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,thisdoes not do what it professes to do hold your gps unit it is made of cheap rubber the cavity is not deep enough to hold gps it has to be glued to the dash and more etc do not buy i have an extra one pay shipping and I shall send it to you free,54,15
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,the heininger 1040 commutemate black navcup presents the following problem i own two portable 5 screen gpss in las vegas nevada most days of the year are sunny the navcup angle causes the screen to be unreadable due to sun glare if you only drive at night you will appreciate it is design marvee,53,16
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i thought it looks nice and might even stay but after five minutes of driving around next left turn i took my gps was out on the passenger seat if only i can keep it on the dash the rest is fine i can route the power cable from behind through one of several holes in the back and the gps does sit on the mount cleanly now i have to put may be a velcro to keep this on the dash the sticky mat that is supplied with the product also did not work well on my camry sedan and could not keep the navcup in place for too long,110,17
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,it had a tendency to slip off the dash during sudden acceleration also the cable of my garmin 1490 interfered with navcup causing the garmin to rest crookedly in the navcup,31,18
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i have to say i am very happy with the addition of the navcup to our jeep there is no dash sliding as i take those turns a little too fast and it does not take up too much room would definitely recommend this,44,19
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i was excited to get thisbecause it seemed like it would do a better job than the traditional suction cup method however after one day out in the sunlight i was left severely disappointed the essential problem with thecomes down to the fact it is not adjustable it convienently fit our tomtom and sat sturdily on our dashboard a rav4 it was when we pulled out of our driveway that we realized it sat too far back and you could hardly see it with the glare our particular model of rav has the dashboard swoop up in the center where you would put such anthis made it unreadable if your car is different and has a flat dashboard you may have better luck for us although it was pretty useless in the sunshine,139,20
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a holder that would allow me to access my touch screen the dashboard models are difficult to reach this really does the trick,28,21
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,there has nothing to using this tool out of the box unpack place the sticky pad on the dash put the navcup on it and you are off to the races i live in a mountainous area with lots of inclines and downgrades and turns in all the time I have been using the navcup my motorola droid has never slipped out in any direction the gps which is quite a bit larger than the droid also has never slipped out regardless of speed or direction of travel everything stays in place as if it were glued on bear in mind that this is during the height of winter and everything in the car is cold i wonder what it will be like during summer highly recommended for now update 05/17/2012 lo these many years and this thing continues operating very well the heat did not faze it one bit the rubber mat is accumulating dust rather quickly now and so requires a good clean from time to time otherwise spot on upgrading to a five-star review it deserves it,176,22
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,it does a pretty good job but it is pretty big and bulky to put on the dashboard we put our in the console area down below and it works just fine pros keeps the phone upright we use our phone with gps for navigation has a spot where you can place the charging cable through cons too bulky and light to place on the dash without concerns of it falling off the stickypad that comes with it is very sticky and i do not want it leaving a residue on the dash wish it did not hold the phone / gps so upright since we use it down in the console area it would be great if it were angled back a little bit,137,23
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,i have a 2009 honda civic and an iphone 4 with the tomtom car kit which has a suction-cup mount and charger problem is they way the charger / mount is orientated it is impossible to position in a place that is viewable or practical in my car I have decided to try the commutemate navcup gps dash mount holder while it was clearly not designed to hold the rather unique shape of the iphone when in the tomtom car mount it does the job it does on occasion come tumbling down but for the most part stays in place and I am pleased,100,24
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,i tried this in my car and absolutely hated it first of all you have to put a sticky mat on your dashboard then you put this foam cup on it i found it to be not only ugly but bulky and big i hated it give me my windshield suction cup any day,55,25
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,looking for a stable holder for your gps device this is the thing for you I have got a tom-tom gps system and i was very pleased at how well this worked with it it held it in place firmly but was it was still easy to remove there has also a hold to allow your power cord to go through so you can have it plugged into your car lighter like anyone uses those for their intended purpose anymore the holder itself is made out of a black foam substance and sits easily on the dashboard really there has not much more that i can say about this thing it is sturdy and it gets the job done,115,26
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,i am not a short person but when my gps is mounted to the windshield of my suv i do have toway forward in my seatbelt to change anything on the screen the navcup puts the gps within easy reach of the driver and lowers it out of your line of vision [ which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences and level of distraction often when at eye level drivers find themselves watching the screen rather than the road ] in the event of a wreck the gps unit may go flying as it is not secured beyond it is power cable but the soft navcup will not because harm to passengers the pad mounts easy just slap it down and sit the cup on it,131,27
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,mmmm i one of these light bulbs an i tested with my white reg lights an it show a different on them on my high beam that is were i put them because i drive at night i have a night shift but not bad at all for this product lot better then my old ones,55,0
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,I have had success with halo lights in the past but these are not so great the purple tint dims the lights so that they are not very bright in comparison they are about half as bright as previous sets of halo icis blues or nokya arctic whites that I have had if you are looking for a purple tint the best way to go is just convert to hid,67,1
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,got these bulbs for my fogs i was looking for a blue / purple light not so much white they have as muchto them as you can get legally with a decent bluish purple tint however it is still white when i changed this into my fogs i already had a blue optic protection film on the fog covers so with the film and the bulbs together it gave me a real nice bluish / purple light on the road i was looking for with a blue tint front look also they are brighter in terms of light then stock bulbs but since it is a tinted bulb to generateyou lose some of the brightness still a good bulb thyre cheap as heck why not try them out,127,2
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,these lights are amazing they are very bright and have a good purple tint to them they are also legal so that is good too,25,3
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,i purchased these 9005 along with 9006 halo these are very low powered headlights i like the 9006 low beam they work fine but these 9006 hi beam are the dimest headlights i have ever seen and i m 52 years old i have went out of city limits 5 or 6 times to try these lights and they are just plain useless i had to put my old lights back in till i recieve different lights i would sell these but they would be a hazard to use,87,4
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,these lights are just plain garbage you might be able to use them in the city where there is lights and speeds are slow but to use these out of city and where speeds increase is not safe they hardly light up the road at all and only for a very very short distance i tried to adjust them but they just do not put out any light almost like trying to drive in the dark with your lights turned off i will not try to drive with these purchased a differnt brand guess these will go in the trash,98,5
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,the number one thing for a headlight is to illuminate the road ahead these headlights do a poor job at that the light output is very faint compared to the sylvania bulbs i had previously the purple tint is cute but not worth sacrificing visibility i do hope these lamps burn out fast so i can replace them with something brighter,61,6
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,the purple lights are awsome the high / low series are so much better easy install quick shipping,16,7
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,definitely do not have a purple look to them just look like an ordinary yellowish fog light and not very bright,20,8
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,i could not tell when my high beams were on or off i went to a pitch black area away from all light sources and no difference was made when high beams were on do not purchase product if i still had the box i would return as soon as possible,48,9
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,i had a hard time finding these but I am glad i found them on amazon the purple look is very unique,21,10
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,i have halo automotive purple white 9006 12v 55w bulb twin pack asome work good some do not like i love it,22,11
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,when i received thisi was dissapointed to find that it was not the right bulb as it was advertized and i now have no use for it,29,12
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,wanted some purple hids but was short on cash so went with the bulbs instead quality product ignites to distinct purple / white would recommend,23,13
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,bulb is bright but as far as purple white definitely not looks like a halogen bulb very disappointed with it,20,14
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,i purchased these fog lights to replace the ones in my srt8 charger i was originally disappointed because they were not as purple as i was expecting although i did not return them and still have them on my car today they are great and have a very light purple tint to them most people i know can not tell that they are suppose to be purple white honestly they really do not seem much different from an hid light coming down the road but overall great purchase and quality is good,89,15
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,i would not purchase this product not for a main head light anyway thewas ok but the light out put was terrible i could hardly see signs or the reflectors on cars they are cheap and you get what you pay for,44,16
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,had purple halo headlights in my truck for a month and noticed sediment inside headlight housing found the coating of the bulbs is flaking off all over the headlight,29,17
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,took me awhile to get these on the frame rails for the half doors they fit very snug and a little tip is to make sure you unzip the window 2001 wrangler,32,0
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,got these 48 hours after ordering really easy to install nice fit a really good cheap alternative to buying complete upper doors,22,1
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,rampage sent my door skins before the promised date had instructions on how to cut old skin off and install new one everything went as predicted new skin looks as good as oem and performs much better,40,2
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,i bought the door skin replacement for someone in our family it fit very snuggly and needed to be in the warm garage to be install the warmer the skin the easier the install she loved it and was happy to have her jeep door fixed,46,3
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,good fitment get them warm first before trying to install,10,4
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,be careful you get what you pay for these are cheap quality look good after installing but next time i will spend the extra money and get a better set of door uppers no instructions included either which was disappointing but youtube has a couple of helpful videos thank goodness,49,5
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,i particularly wanted rampage door skins to match my rampage top unfortunately the door skins were too small to fit on my 1999 upper door frames even although i followed the instructions and left them to bake and stretch for several hours in the florida summer heat and sun despite multiple attempts i was not able to get more than one of the four corners to fit on the frame at the same time i finally gave up and took advantage of amazons excellent return policy and returned these i subsequently purchased the smittybilt door skins and they fit easily on the upper door frames,104,6
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,as others have said after the actual struggle to get them on they are great,14,7
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,very good product fits really well i read a lot of reviews on these and a lot of people had problems with install but they went right on and fit great i did not have any problems,36,8
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,spend the extra money and go with bestop i had to make a slight tear at the bottom corners to install they still are not fully around the frame,29,9
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,they did not fit i heated them and stretched them they even ripped and they still do not fit properly on the stock door frame they are not nearly as high quality as the original jeep skins and windows but they are adequate for the price and i would have given them 5 stars if they actually fit the frames,60,10
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,ok so here is my say on these it is a great looking product but i feel it can be manufactured way better to not rip in certain areas hands down quick but painfull assembly buy them pre fabricated on the frames and save yourself the anger and hassle,49,11
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,incredibly difficult to install it ripped after a few tugs to get it over the frame,16,12
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,they did not fit at all and i have been waiting two weeks for the new set,16,13
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,wish i read reviews before ordering both doors we set out in july louisiana heat for hours and as it helped some at first both still tore and are no good blamed the first door that tore on myself why i do not know but just did so we laid the other door out for an extra 6 hours in straight sun and the same thing happened again so nope it was not us heat or any other bs i see some people have been given to why this happened to them it is just a bad product since we have has jeeps for almost 40 years we thought we would just buy the skins this time because we wanted to save and already have several sets of frames because we normally buy them with the frames nope they do not go on heat only helps somewhat but can not work miracles and both of mine are worth nothing also known as trashed now with that said just spend the extra money people and have your new skins come on the frames for ya or just throw your money away,185,14
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,these are great for the price the window is flexible and clear the cloth is great quality and matched the top that i purchased at the same time the only thing that i wish that they would have included is the velcro like the oem windows had it helps when you need to put the windows up while you are driving,61,15
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,like others that have posted i had one heck of a time getting this to go on the metal frame i actually pulled the skin off the end of three of my fingers after about an hour of heating with the oven and a blow dryer i gave up and went to plan b i got the three corners on bottom two corners and the rear corner on the top and then lubricated the metal frame at the front / top with wesson oil i then used two adjustable wrenches to pry and lift the final corner over the metal frame i used small adjustable wrenches and used the bottom of the wrench where it is flat and round and smooth so there was no concern about poking a hole in the fabric i put one wrench bottom over the top of the frame and the other over the side of the frame inserted them into the fabric and slowly lifted and pulled the corner fabric over the frame it went on the first try not sure if it is because i had heated and stretched it already or not but it worked I am going to wait until next weekend to do the other side,203,16
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,did not fit would love to sell did not fit the radius around doorstill have stored if anyone can use them reduced priceblack,27,17
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,good quality product really tough material only complaint is that they were extremely hard to put on but look great once you put them on wish they had tinted ones tho,31,18
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,i bought these to replace a set of smittybilt windows that was a bit faded and had been cut broken in to on one side it surprised me that the smittybilt windows were a higher quality product than the rampage pros the fit is pretty good and installation was not too hard zippers do not jingle like the smittybilt due to the zipper pulls being cord and not metal cons the windows are wavy at the top which distorts your view out the sides i do not see any reason that they have to be wavy one zipper has broken on each window in only 3 months luckily there are two zippers so i can still close and open the window I am not very happy with this purchase and will likely go with a different brand in the future,141,19
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,recieved them in the mailtried to put them on yoo cold so i waited for a 100 degree dayvery tight fitting ripped both doors on the insides where they should be reinforcedwindows are very thini took smittybilt uppers off and replaced them with rampagebig mistakesmittybilt are much better qualityi also bought the rampage framless top and have issues with it tooand rampage customer service sucksthe do not return emails or phone callsi will never purchase another rampage product ever,78,20
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,the materials of the doors are exactly what i expected for a replacement and the pictures the only real message i wanted people to know was that the velcrow that is used to keep the door together and tight is a real pain if you are looking for a snug tight fit be ready to find an alternative way to keep the material from slipping over time,67,21
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,these windows looked great fit great and were shipped fast easy to install and would make anyone a great replacement,20,22
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,if you are looking for some well priced door skins that are easy to install keep looking these are awful both doors ripped installing i have a 98 wrangler and of course once torn they can not be returned awful product will not order from rampage again or recommend,49,23
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,for the price these door skins are ok they were very difficult to get onto the frames and i ever tore part of the left window skin also the weather stripping does not fit well in the door frames and sticks out you get what you pay for,47,24
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,first i must say that the phone support folks at rampage are great patient with all of my questions always inviting me to call back if i had any more issues when you first unpack these skins and hold them up to the frames you will say no way i almost gave up and sent them back a couple of times finally i heated them with a hair dryer as i was stretching them over the frames and they finally slipped into place note get a partner to hold the hair dryer while your stretch it is much easier the gentleman at rampage explained why they are so tight it seems jeep made two sizes of door frames those years 97 - 99 i think so the skins were made so they could fit the larger frame yet not be too large for the smaller frame not sure if that is the case but it sounds logical to me otherwise great quality and service,162,25
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i bought this for indoor use with occasional exposure to mild weather the 142 size fits 09 solstice coupe fairly well wraps down to cover about 75 of the wheels even elastic band makes it tricky to put on a slippery waxed car for one person keeps dust out nicely and some oil that dripped on it from my garage door hardware did not penetrate interesting texture feels finely woven with a light plastic / teflon film coating light strong but not quite what I had call soft or velvety no experience with rain or wind yet but based on the non-custom fit i suspect it could mar the finish if the non-snug portions flap around excessively over time,115,0
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,i ordered this for my solstice and it fits great i like the fact that it covers the whole car down to the wheels and has room for the antenna i do not drive my car during the winter and this allow me to store it in the garage without letting all the dirt and dust settle on it,58,1
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i would give this cover no stars if possible i purchased in march for my lincoln and by august i had to throw it away it was rotting to pieces it got several holes that i patched withtape but that only lasted a few weeks and then more holes and rips everywhere so it is now in the dumpster i bought a good quality cover for 20 more from a large online auction site it is a five-layer heavy and durable cover like one i had up until this junky one gave up do not buy this unless you like throwing money away i can assure you that this is an honest review of a very inferior cover amazon probably has good quality durable covers but this is not one of them,133,2
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,i purchased this product to cover my car while i commute on my motorbike during the warm months although it did fit my car reasonably well it is simply inadequate for outdoor use people buying this product should be aware that it is made of paper think of the cotton paper gowns of surgeons and clean room technicians it is not as tough as canvas after only two months in the elements occasional rain and wind mostly sunshine the cover has developed punctures that i have repaired with tape it still covers the car but i predict more patches in the future and eventually the whole thing just will not be salvageable is this worth nearly 90,115,3
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,very thin does not hold up we purchased this for our 1965 mustang as it was the one that was suggested on their site for our car it was not the most expensive but not the least either when received and put it on we were not happy with the fit but hoped it would work ok it has already ripped across the rear of the trunk and looks really bad / thin and taggered with less than 2 months of use i would not purchase another of this brand wish i could ask for my money back,95,4
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i purchased this car cover for my new lexus ls 460 although the car is parked in a garage i need a cover to prevent scratch marks on the paint finish you see my cat loves to roam the garage and he jumps up on the car sometimes scratching the paint the cover is large enough and is fairly easy to put on i will say that it is better if 2 people handled the cover when attempting to cover the car taking it off is no problem but the cover is a bit bulky and does not fold into a neat little shape very easily I had say it is a mid grade quality cover if you go much heavier you would be looking at something made out of heavy canvas all in all this cover does the job for my purposes,139,5
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,the product users instructions indicate an attenna patch that once removed the car cover will lay flat with the anttena in place trouble is there is no antenna patch furhtermore the car cover is an absolute example of an I shall-fitted product such that when installing the cover i had to stetch the product and once on my vehicle good grief what a horrible result the cover does not follow the shape of my vehicle just barely and finally one would expect that the tie-down gromet holes would have been put in place during production well alas no so as the instructions state simply find a place in the cover and place the gromet cardboard and the pierce the cover in the gromet hole i will not say anymore except i advise no one to purchase this product,137,6
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i finally took the cover out to put on my car for storage today i guess i should not have been so trusting although i entered the year make and model of my car and i bought the one that was recommended it did not fit properly too small thanks for taking away my piece of mind that my car would be fine,63,7
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,car cover came quickly and was excellent quality for the price,11,8
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i wanted to cover the car while our home is being remodeled because our garage is full of stuff this cover works well good price and fast delivery it needs to be tied down when it is windy and that was a slight challenge the fit was not precise for our subaru which was based on the instructions for ordering it if i had it to do over again i probably would buy the next larger size,76,9
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,what ever i received is not what i ordered i ordered the 200 inch cover for my 197 inch challenger however what i received is impossible to be installed on my 2013 dodge challenger,34,10
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,works fine if you do not mind replacing it every 6-months mine complete disintegrated after 6-months no antenna sleeve so you must poke a hole in it for your antenna,29,11
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,material is bad after a few rain and weather storms it will start to tear bad bad material for 8000 also it does not fit my car right one side ok otherside nope in the cart does this fit my car it says it does but it do not do nt buy this product do not over priced by 6000 easy bad bad bad i can make this at home,68,12
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,budge car covers are the best at protecting my car from weather and cement dust pollution from the nearby plant this one is a perfect fit on my kia optima,30,13
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,nice to have something that fits for your car not a generic cover for just any car one size fits all,21,14
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i would rate the cover 3 stars for durability but 5 stars for uv protection the tyvec fabric is thin and does not do well in windy areas but the sun does not get through this material it is amazing it can be 110 degrees outside and the car remains at the ambient temperature i have one for my truck in white and it is great i bought the grey one for my new car but the manufactures recommended size did not fit so i had to return it amazon is easy to deal with when you have to return a product if you need protection from the sun and do not live in a windy area then this is the cover,121,15
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i have a lincoln mark iii 1971 it is 2161 inches long i had to stretch the edges and to rupture the she shall such that the cover sits just on top of the car if you look for a cover for a 210 inches long car look elsewhere,48,16
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,i gave it 5 stars because it is made very will i like it because it fits around my car great light weight so it is easy to handle i would recommend this cover to any one that is wants a great fiting will made cover,43,17
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,ours after not too long at all started flaking millions of tiny bits all over my car every single time i used it not usable now bought it walmart it was their high end offering and cheaper than waterproof high end covers at other retailers it lasted less than a year my advice if it says budge then avoid it,61,18
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,i purchased this car cover for the very hot southern california summers it is not even a year old but already has lots of little tears on the surface and now one large tear that is about three or four inches long right at one of the taillights it seems that this cover can not hold up to the weather and i do not recommend it,63,19
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,well i bought three of the budge 10 year warranty covers at oriley auto parts the first three lasted january february and march by early april 2012 they had disintegrated i returned them to oriley and they gave me three more the exact same problem by august 2012 i do not understand how they can make such a poor product i would not recommend any of the budge covers in the past i would at least get 2 - 3 years use from a 10 year cover and i could live with that but 3 months realy do they think i just fell of the truck,103,20
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i saw the promo video and was impressed i ordered two units and installed them on the helmets one fit well without the adhesive the other required the adhesive which i did not want to use the sound from my mp3 was great and i was impressed however the communication between the two units is horrible you have to maximum out the volume and you get an echo effect if you can hear the other person at all both of the units have a problem getting the plug from the microphone / speakers to stay properly plugged into the main unit if they are not plugged in all of the way the sound does not play for both ear speakers it usually will only have sound in one unless you press and hold the plug into the main unit in addition the unit has a hard time staying place in the mounting device connected to the helmet it comes out too easily i have not checked other brands but i was disappointed to find that it only has a 90 day warranty i would expect the typical year as most products have i would not buy these if i could do it over again,201,0
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,just bought 2 of them and set them up in the helmets full face the instruction was a little confusing but after the second time reading it i got it then maybe it was me I shall give them a good work out this next weekend on our road trip so far i like them but word to the wise read the instruction cover to cover oh there is one more thing i blue tooth to my iphone but i can not get both sets to play music at the same time got any answer,98,1
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i was so excited to receive my blinc m2 and finally be able to listen to tunes while riding what a huge disappointment i had the volume maxed out which causes the speakers to distort terribly and could just barely tell there was any music at all playing when riding 30 mph the fm tuner did not receive channels very well either,61,2
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,it is great to have music wright up to you are earsfm radio not to good does not lock station but ipod is perfect and also being able to answer the phone on the move,31,3
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,should have bought the sena in the first place it worked fine in the drive way but on the road not so good batter on one of the units would cut out after 25 hrs or so sound was garbled at low speed under 50 mph and this is behind a full wind screen on a stock mufflered bike with full face helmets we re adjusted re-set to no avail it was purchased from road rider of reno after he called the distributer in el monte ca mike at r / r said he would give us a refund but blinkteckcom would not it is ok around town at low speed but if you need a real intercom system buy the sena,122,4
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,radio did not receive very well liked the boom mike better than the uclear one i ended up with that has mikes built into speaker hard to set the sweet spot so for answering / talking while riding blinc was great however the uclear hbc 100 really does get quite loud without distortion much more so than the blinc m2,57,5
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i like the blinc system i purchased two for me and my husband but one does not work,17,6
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,just make sure not to install this on the throttle side for all those nonleft handers out there so far the product works great as an intercom completely changes the riding experience for those quick unplanned cruises with friends,39,7
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,super greatthanks very fast shipping aaaaaaaaaaaa,8,8
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,the sound is clear feels like surround sound voice phone and music it is great,14,9
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,it works i would recommend blinc should upgrade the background noise elimination set up,14,10
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,unit to unit pairing only worked with the m2 version not backwards compatible the purchased unit only lasted one ride for about 30 or so minutes before turning off and never turning on again even after recharge attempts while it was working i could not get the volume high enough to hear the other rider the other rider could hear me and everything else no noise canceling what so ever the website provides nearly no help thewas returned due to the device failure and not exchanged for another due to the other issues while it was working,98,11
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i could not connect to most radio stations where i live at and after a few months the plugin for the ear pieces that goes in the helmet snapped off,29,12
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this unit for the sole purpose of the fm tuner by far the worse decision i could have made the fm tuner gives me 90 percent static,29,13
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,intercom feature is really bad very difficult to have a conversation with passenger once you turn the engine on would not recommend it,22,14
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,love his unit especially the blue tooth connection with my i-phone i added a handle bar holder for the phone and i can use gps answer calls listen to my tunes and use voice commands without ever having to look down or remove my hands from the handle bars if i do not want to,54,15
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,it works for a while after two months it does not starts at all and the other device led does not work either is an expensive device for me and i had to deliver back twice they change the device and the second one have problems too i need my money back,50,16
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,garbage clip does not fit my helmet poor reception and it freezes everytime sorry but for what the price is horrable,20,17
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,a decent product for the price but not worth it in the long run i bought this product about two years ago and it worked for about 9 months and then kicked the bucket i had contacted the manufacturer and i have to this day not received a follow up the module had great sound around town but forget the music and sound quality when you get on the highway i did like the ability to change the song with the twist of the knob another thing to keep in mind with the knob is that if you twist it a little very little bit to hard the knob will strip out overall go with the sena headset more money but you will not regret it,125,18
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the cable is not long enough for the helmet part then it just turns off for no reason I am not happy with the product but i can not return it,29,19
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,just as the article said and was on time,9,20
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the only reason i am giving this a one star is because zero star is not available if you are thinking of buying this do yourself a favour do not unless you have a lot of luck like the folks who rated this product highly the are unreliable get something else any thing but this it is a total waste of money,56,21
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the way the speakers connect to the module is a malfunction it connects from the bottom just over your shoulder on the bottom of the helmet this causes the wiring to rub everytime you move your head and damages the wires i had mine for about 4 months before the wiring started to sever I am looking to buy more speakers and i will stick it to the side of the helmet with some kind of adhesive because i like the way it works and sounds just bad wiring design,89,22
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i could understand a price range of 40 - 50 but the fm function is completely useless not water proof at all never use or have on you in the rain it will short it out the charger is proprietary and a pain the speaker wire is the same as the charger so you have to unplug it and every time and there is no way to secure it the speaker wire always falls out and is loose over all worked at a mediocre level for a month then is garbage save your money and go somewhere else,96,23
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,worked great and all even tho calling and the voice communication is terrible i liked it for music but now it charges and does not turn on makes no sense,29,24
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this blue-tooth headset in september 2013 it is very rugged nice design and enjoyed it thoroughly for a few months never liked the fact that this device uses a proprietary connector but i figured with finesse it may last a good while over time i have noticed the connector has worn making the charger intermittent does not seem to charge unless monitored to make sure the battery indicator is showing the battery only holds a charge now for about 30 minutes on a good day i have purchased another headset to mount in my helmet i did like the ui and portability of this device but with having to disconnect the connector each time to set the helmet down or to charge was a turn off for me excellent product for the price just expect the battery to die relatively soon,143,25
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,the only issue that i have is that some times it has trouble connecting to my phone other than that it would get 5 stars,25,26
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,nice and great product but the manufacturer needs to provide more details on the installation process most especially mounting the device to the helmet took a while for me to figure out the mounting clip is detachable from the device will update after a month or two,47,27
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,just what i expected works wonderful it fits snug and the battery last pretty well well worth the cost certainly,20,28
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,went on a long ride to test the blinc m2 on my helmet and the one on my wifes helmet clear sound especially with my wifes full helmet i wear a half helmet and the sound came through the wind noise clearly communication spotty in some situations the fm tuner is difficult to tune to a station if the station does not come in full power you will hear a lot of static if you can even connect to a radio station,82,29
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product exceeded my expectations compared to the chatterbox but after a day of use the speaker connection started to stutter the connection for the speakers goes on the bottom of the bluetooth and it is also used to charge the unit you must constantly unplug it if you are going to set your helmet down so you do not because any damage to the connection but no matter what it is very sensitive therefore you will constantly struggle to get a good connection between the helmet speakers and the unit the clarity between helmet to helmet is not very good and after a few yards you start loosing connection once that happens the units will not automatically reconnect and you will have to pull over to synchronize them again i will recommend this product over the chatterbox which i also returned look into the sena smh10 which is well reviewed compared to other helmet bluetooth products i hope this helps,161,30
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,the product is small and very basic it does the job for a quick ride or quick dayley commuit the speaker are modertly loud as long as your bike does not havepips meaning after market pipes it does come with a fm radio mode and works with some stations meaning like 10 so you kinda learn to like new station or you can just make a play list through your phone and use that but the prouduct is what it is cheap n you get what u pay for a simple but affective device for someone not looking into paying so much money,104,31
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought the blinc m2 last year hoping that i got a good deal worked well for about 3 months and then boom it stopped working it will not turn on anymore even after i tried reseting it it just died save your money guys and do not buy this product,49,32
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i received this as a gift last year and liked it so i bought one for my wife this year works great,22,33
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,delivery was fine i went back to my country and the first day of use a little rain fell on my and the module just died in the middle of a phone call after 4 days plugged to the wall it came back again used it for two more phone calls and died again i 'll be traveling next week to miami where i expect to return it and ask for a new one,73,34
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,awesome great sound calls are clear easy to instal and the price is just right a must have for any rider,21,35
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,bought in advance of motorcycle trip purchased two first one did not charge exchanged and everything looked ok but once we got on the road realized one of them never held a charge no matter how long i charged it now on our trip we could not talk to each other used the working one for bluetooth to my iphone which worked great however if i tried to use the fm radio function it could never pick up a station even in a big city like washington washington dc when we got back i tried to return via amazon and they denied because it was beyond their return period i sent several messages to seller and manufacturer and no one will respond to me 220 wasted super disappointment do not waste your time or money,133,36
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,does exactly as advertised my only knock is that the charger is not a standard usb plug neither micro or mini so if it gets lost you are back to the manufacturer for a replacement,36,37
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i like it a lot sounds great when riding my motorcycle good product to buy if u ride ride bikes,21,38
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i am returning it because it work only 7 days it die at 8 th day rip i was happy 7 days and not now,25,39
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,quick delivery and good packaging the product is easy to use and install i own two and have never had a problem with either of them,26,40
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,works alright can not hear very well with it and the controls are difficult would not buy this if i knew how it worked,22,41
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought one that did not work from the time i took it out of the box even tried to reset it with the key provided so i returned it and got a replacement the replacement i got would not work either the large button to would not do anything when pushed so gave up and got a refund,56,42
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i really enjoy my blinc m2 my only issue is i have had it less than three weeks and now my microphone is not working every time which makes it frustrating when trying to take a call or talk to my passenger,42,43
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the phone link works wonderful the fm tuner is well crap it will not connect to the strongest stations nor stay tuned into any station,25,44
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,too bulky hard to know if you are turn in dial in the right position and hard to control with gloves on,22,45
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,produt came in good codition but some time it getting frozen and you have to use the unlock key is working ok,22,46
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,love to ride my motorcycles but this has made the long trips awesome being able to switch between mp3 and intercom and still answer the phone is amazing,28,47
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,it was easy to mount easy to install upon testing the speakers were crackling when the music was up all the way when a call was placed i was told several times that they could not make out what i was saying even with the microphone right in front of my mouth on a full face helmet also was stationary with the bike not running i do not recommend this product to anyone spend more money and do your research sena or scala are better products,85,48
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,pros voice control compatible lcd worded display at least it is not a chatterbox cons it had no volume even cruising on my bike at 60 could not hear it at all clunky and awkward fm radio you are joking does anybody still use that it kept inadvertently getting stuck in fm mode now when I am stopped the last thing i want to hear is static on maximum volume terribleand probably the killer for this product if you want a headset that is good and has rider-rider functionality and good volume and voice / siri control go with the sena smh10 please do not waste your time on this product,105,49
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,before you pass this product up i want you to understand I am riding a punched out 103 v-twin with vance and hines headers so anything that loud your probably not going to hear someone on the phone but with that in mind i can still hear my music just fine,50,50
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the blinc m2 is great device if only the plug for the speakers was consistent it occasionally comes out to the point where you spend the majority of your ride trying to push the plug in properly to listen to your music this defeats the purpose of enjoying a ride the fm modular is worthless because it rarely gets a good signal and all you hear is rushing noise the speakers do sound good when it is working properly for the mp3 i do not recommend this product to anyone you will whine up disappointed as i am about this purchase,100,51
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,everything works great except for when i want to forward to the next track the turning forward on the dial is kind of broken,24,52
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,it is a very helpful device for the bikers to receive and make calls when driving the intercom awesome i like it,24,53
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,bought as a gift love it mostly for listening to music never to answer phone which in theory also works may buy another set for second helmet this is transferable between helmets but prefer not to do that,38,54
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,they have a proprietary charging device that right there should make you not purchase it it should come with a standard 12v charging chord and be able to charge it via usb as well you know what everyone has on their motorcycles to power and charge devices with this you run out you have to stop somewhere or just wait until you get home to charge it worthless in my opinion i should have thought about that before i purchased it music and audio does sound alright although in my opinion i do not use it anymore although looking for an alternative trying to get my hands on a replacement propriety charger so i can sell this stupid thing,118,55
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,what the fuck is going on here you ripped out the damn headphone jack and left it as ahole without anything left and u throw this crap headphone and boom rig that plugs into the charger and it only lights blue fake ass m2,42,56
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the radio reception when riding was basically non-existent yet oddly enough after i mounted it and tested it at home it pulled in stations quite clearly this made absolutely no sense at all my other complaints are that it was not glove friendly and the volume was insufficient to be heard when riding 0 btw i do not understand why the radio frequency is displayed on it when it is outside the helmet my old parrots which sadly died and are no longer made actually spoke the radio frequencies as it locked on them i wish parrot would introduce a replacement for the sk4000,101,57
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,everything seems to work great on it if you spend the time to tinker with the installation abit the speakers are more then loud enough for both music and voice if you make sure to get them close enough to your ear i had to put a piece of 1/4 double sided sticky to mine to get them to properly placed in my helmet i do not have any problem with it losing connection to my android phone as of yet I have only rode about 60 miles with them so far so hopefully they do not develop any problem there can not comment on rider to rider only one so far but plan on getting a second if this continues to work out the fm reciver is really weak and looses signal easy i have fixed that problem by using an old fm antenna wire from a old ati tuner i had laying around and working it around the top inside of my helmet and then wrapping the ends around each side of the earphone wires and taping them now it never seems to drop,182,58
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,we installed this product on two brand new helmets with ease however the sound quality was poor and the intercom feature is completely useless we had to turn the unit off and resort to the old fashioned method of yelling at each other we got this primarily for the intercom feature and now will sell both units also the battery life is only fair we go on long rides and it does not last we did not bother pairing with the phones as we do not like phone calls when we get to ride the music quality i although was poor at best and the fm feature is very weak a cheap set of ear buds are far better in sound quality we are very disappointed with this product soon to be sold,129,59
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,buetooth link was a snap works great some difficulty using siri but otherwise fine only drawback is that you can not hear it on the highway even with a full helmet and visor closed,33,60
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,funcional excelente practico bonito m e g u s t o m u c h o g r a c i a s,23,61
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i ordered used ones and they came with missing parts and frayed wires so i did not give it a fair shot i went ahead and got a different brand and i love that one,34,62
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i had the surprise than there is not reception on the radio I have been really disappointed with this purchase beside I have lost sound when the helmet moving to the left because the cable is not real fixed even the bluetooth is ok,42,63
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,overall this is an ok model the speakers could be a little louder but other than that and trouble pairing and connecting to my mp3 not bad,27,64
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,thisis still under review so far it works great in the city but once you hit the freeway forget about it it is useless,25,65
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,this communication device is great to have it makes riding more ejoyable it syncs easily to cell phone for easy listening of play selections in additon to fm radio securely fits on the side of the helmet the only minor issue is the loud beeping sound for incoming calls would definitely recommend,52,66
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product is ok and does what it says it is nice to have a dial for the radio that tells you the station you are on and it has worked with no issues the only problem i have with is is exactly what i have seen others already say the volume on this sucks if you are going more than 45 mph you will not hear anything or if you have any type of loud or aftermarket mufflers on your bike forget it i would find something better,89,67
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this device to enjoy while commuting around the phoenix metropolitan area it continually loses connection with my phone I have tried mp3s streaming audio podcasts music a variety of media it does not matter the source this device will not maintain a constant link with my phone i originally thought it was my phone I have reinstalled apps and players and sure enough when i use headphones i have no problems my phone plays for hours without any problems when i sync with the blinc m2 it may work for 20 minutes it may work for 2 min I have cleared and re-synced the blinc m2 with my phone several times without success heres the kicker the fm radio feature is terrible I am using this device in and around phoenix az where i can literally see the transmitting tower on south mountain this thing will have a signal for 30 seconds then go to complete static and lose the station tune it to a different channel and you may hear it clearly for 10 seconds before it is overcome by static how can i give it one star i got one phone call without a problem save your money get something better,199,68
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,nifty little gadget works well solid connection to phone notice that voice prompts from my phone do not come in over the headhones but I shall figure it out also the multifunction button is one of those buttons that can be difficult to press if you know what i mean sometimes you need to press the button or hold the button for different periods of time and it can get a little confusing when you are not sure whether you are actually pressing the button or not especially not good on a bike,89,69
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i had to order thistwice first one had a very weak bluetooth signal the m2 was also not loud so i returned thethe 2nd m2 i recieved works great amazon was great and hassle free with the exchange thanks amazon,44,70
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this unit works good for music loud an undistorted when it comes to bike to bike or a phone call forget it you will not hear them unless your stopped,29,71
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i have been using this product for a few weeks now i do enjoy it i had some trouble with the fm tuner but works well where i am now unfortunately it does not sync to gps models out there but will sync to just about any phone even my really old motorola razor that is pretty handy if you have gps on your phone speakers are great,68,72
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,these are ok but i fear ruining an arai helmet to put them in they come with 3 m tape and velcro pads i suggest they have better velcro,28,73
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,does what it says works just fine i do warn you do not over tighten the clip base i have it linked to my htc evo could use some improvement the speakers work good but would be nice if the unit had a equalizer setting not enough bass presets for the fm tuner would be great better antenna and fm and mp3 buttons are kinda hard to find with gloves on other than that it is still an awesome device,75,74
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i have a helmet with a version of this integrated into the helmet and love it my wife however did not have one and since we often ride together she had to have one too but we already had a helmet it took about 2 min to install and works great all we had to modify is a spacer behind the speaker to get it closer to her for clarity has fm radio and bluetooth capability also after pairing they act as an intercom that is one button to start and stop a conversation i think the integrated version is a lot less bulky but they added a few more buttons on this version so it is pretty user friendly and the ability to temporarily mount it with the clip means it can move to the next helmet if my next helmet is not integrated with one i will have to buy another like this one,155,75
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,very good product very clear sound when riding and easy to use connects with no issues and has great battery life,21,76
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,well the only positive thing is that it mounts nice and installation is easy speakers are weak mic picks up every noise if u have a bike bigger than a honda 50 or go more than 15 mph this product will be a let down,44,77
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought thiswith the hopes that i could ride easily without breaking the law using earbuds what i got in return was an expensive and broken product support is non-existent from the manufacturer install was easy once i figured it out the instructions were not very good that came with it after 2 weeks of use the bluetooth reciever was busted i sent it back to amazon for a refund now the speakers that came with it were terrible the mic was very good although but really do not waste your money your better off getting a pair of 30 dollar over the ear headphones and modifying them to fit in your helmet like what i just did,117,78
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i listen to my music mostly and answer my calls that is all i need only one complaint is the speakers need to be upgraded or upgradeable i am still looking but i still have not found anything to replace the speakers with but once again it still gives me what i want for the price,55,79
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,the bluetooth is great if you like to listen to music as you ride and with the fm feature i can still catch my morning radio show with traffic updates too i advise every rider to get one as soon as possible,39,80
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this is a great product from any way you look 1 it has fm radio function is great the only point against is that every so often about every 25 minutes off i guess this function for saving energy security in case you forget to turn off 2 excellent volume but this aspect should be very careful for safety and to hear the other cars around us the sound of this product is very good but a bit lacking in bass when you plug your phone as mp3 player it is great fun and makes you a ride or simply the way home or work 3 the multifunction button does not seem very strong construction so you must use care not to damage it the button is very easy to use even if you use gloves to handle your motorcycle 4 for sure if you need to leave and locked the helmet on your motorcycle you can remove the bluetooth 5 the battery lasts a very short two days if you do not use a lot without many calls or listen to radio,182,81
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product is not universal if you got a hjc helmet forget it the instructions are also poor quality that do not thoroughly explain the installation process disappointed to say the least,31,82
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i purchased 2 of these and i feel it was worth the money i can hear the music at highway speeds clearly however the intercom function is a different story it works well up to about 40 - 50 mph then there is a lot of distortion overall i am pleased with my purchase and i would recommend this product to others by the way i have full faced helmets,68,83
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i compared kher products and they just do not hold up the blink is easy to nstall and has the longest battery life out of all the bluetooth devices I have ever used,31,84
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoy robin hobbs work but i do not know if i can truly say i enjoyed reading forest mage it turns everything we saw in shamans crossing on it is head and indeed shamans crossing becomes simply a prologue to nevares ongoing story the book itself is relentless and challenging and i suppose that serves to give us someof the life nevare finds himself facing at the end of shamans crossing we thought nevare had triumphed over multiple adversaries and he had but won those battles only to lose the war we meet new characters and old friends return almost all changed for better or worse save epiny who is the strange combination of selfless and selfish she always was lastly the magic of nevares world is really a character all of it is own in this book in a way rarely seen in fantasy fiction forest mage is an enthralling story but one that is truly in the mold of the empire strikes back only bad things happen and the protagonists world is in ruins at it is end i look forward to the final soldiers son volume and hope to truly enjoy reading it,198,0
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoyed reading forest mage the storyline was well written and character development good i look forward to reading book three i would recommend this book,26,1
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,a very disappointing story if you have already read robin hobbs fantastic fitz and the fool series there are flashes of her incredible skill with words as she weaves some beautiful forest imagery but the story drags and could have been much shorter i did not read the first book and will not read the third in justice to robin hobb every writer has to begin crafting her talent somewhere let us have more novels of the same quality as the farseer trilogy can not wait,82,2
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,ok it took me a little while to get to the end of this series but the journey while mildly uncomfortable leads to a conclusion that is profound and touching i was amazed at the talent displayed here because it seems the author is treading such a fine line most of the time there are certain times in the book when you know that if it had been written differently it would have been offensive and/or uncomfortable to an utterly extreme level but the artistry behind the way robin herds your brain into thinking about something a certain way is plainly astounding it is an intelligent book and it requires a certain appreciation for the writing that i think might escape some but for others it is well worth the read,130,3
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,hobb effortlessly transports you to a new world to follow the life of a soldiers son in gernia beautifully captivating and incredibly detailed side note you will get hungry,29,4
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this is not my first time reading forest mage but it is my first time really giving it enough thought to review it i do not know that i can be disappointed with hobbs works it just does not seem like a possibility for me the balance of introspection and activity makes this book a true first-person wonder the richness of the world around nevare rivals our own world gernia is a real place it is that simple it is just a different reality from ours forest mage truly feels like hobb has traveled to that place plucked a book from their world and brought it back for us to enjoy this is simply a masterpiece of storytelling and one i am pleased to have uncovered fantasy lovers hobb is well worth your time i promise it,132,5
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,the entire story in this book could be summed up in a few chapters and tacked on to shamans crossing or renegades magic i love robin hobb and I have read all of her farseer-related works but this series is just painful to read book one was not a masterpiece but it had promise it was slow but i thought it was leading up to action in this book except this book is even more ponderous more plodding more woe-is-me no action 50 different ways of saying the same thing until she has filled enough space to sell it as a trilogy i wish i could say to slog through because book 3 gets better but honestly it does not although at least the plot has action in book 3 in this one it is just pages of introspection and pity partying i read through the series just so i could have resolution but i do not think I shall pick it up again,157,6
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,the creativity of robin hobb never ceases to amaze me when so many writers are incredibly predictable she continues to keep you guessing,23,7
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,the second book keeps you on your toes following all the characters it is another great book by robin hobb,20,8
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,great book by one of my favorite writers robin hobb weaves sociological issues seamlessly into her novels without disrupting the narrative this book put me in the body of a big fat man with all of the self loathing and prejudice from others that goes with it her hero goes from the usual fit young soldier-officer-student into a morbidly obese misfit i found myself cringing and understanding what it must be like a writer of courage and vision,78,9
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i have never read an author male or female who takes such pleasure in breaking down the main character in such a way that she does after reading the tawny man trilogy i tried to start th e soldiers son books i loved the fits so i finished the series even although she tortured that poor kid but as soon as i got to the part where the main character gets fat and loses everything i realized this author hates guys period,82,10
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this is the third book of the soldier son trilogy and just like all of robin hobbs other trilogies it is brilliant the depth of the storyline is mind blowing and each and every character is poignant real and intrinsic to the story,43,11
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i have not had to read as much repetition in any book ever the writer ether has alzheimers or believes the reader must,23,12
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i feel like you could skip this entire book because nothing happens i still have not read the 3rd one because I am just bored with the whole series i love robin hobbs writing definitely and the forest mage is full of beautiful descriptive language that really makes you see the scenes and you really understand nevare but the thing is i guess i am used to fantasy where the hero accepts the strange magic dumped into his life sooner seriously you do not spend 2 whole books with frodo refusing to believe the ring is magical or rand althor wandering in the forest refusing to believe any of this has anything to do with him i am annoyed by how reluctant nevare is to accept that magic is real so yeah i think you could skip this book and just go to the third one because nothing important happens just read the wiki instead,152,13
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i loved all your other books / series i got this one because of that but i found none of the great qualities of your writing in this book at all i surprised your publisher allowed it really a disappointment,38,14
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoyed other books by robin and so i bought this one it is an interesting concept and although it is draw out at times i like the book,29,15
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this series is fantastic i love the changes with the characters through all they have to endure will have to try out another series by this same author,28,16
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,it defies logic but i could not put these books down even although i thought they were quite awful hobb is that talented at writing if you want a quick review of this book it goes like this he nevare gets fat people laugh he gets fatter people start to hate him he gets fatter everyone hates him he gets obscenely fat and realizes it is due to speck magic yes being able to use magic turns you into an obese creature whom i can only assume resembles jaba the hutt from star wars yet i still read it because hobb writes so well it lulls you in trust me it is totally not worth it,113,17
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,it become very boring and tended to draw out in so many places i know however this needed to happen once i started book 3 this one was disappointing,29,18
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,robin hobb writes such a good book this series is slow to start but then not long and you are hooked you fall in love with the characters well maybe not in love but you have so much empathy for them you just have to know what happens and you want to know them all of them enjoy this series soldier son will stay with you for some time,71,19
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,another good story from robin hobb charactors so real they leave you frustrated with them a easy to read novel that leaves you wanting to pick up the following book to see how the saga will end,37,20
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,just was not what i thought it was going to be i loved the first one this just turned into how bad can we make neveares life and it was not fun to read,34,21
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,very underated by most reviews I have read if you like hobbs you will like this although it is not action packed throughout she makes up for it in stunning detail and riviting story I have read nearly everything she has put out and never even knew about this series until i dug a little deeper in her website I am glad i did because the story of nevare burvelle is one i will always remember,71,22
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,another excellent book from robin hobb a well written final book in the soldiers son trilogy strong and interesting characters riveting plot and great imagery hobb is one of the leading authors in the sci / fi fantasy field and this series is amongst her best work,45,23
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge robin hobb fan especially after reading the farseer and liveship traders trilogies i also really liked shamans crossing the first book in the soldier son trilogy but after reading forest mage i am afraid to read any more of robins books forest mage was a brutal and awful book with very few redeeming qualities there is so much more that could have been done with nevares character instead i found him obsequious disgusting and cowardly and that opinion has not a thing to do with the fact that in this book nevare is battling magic-induced obesity it has more to do with his depravity he was an amazing character in shamans crossing but now i actually despise him and do not want to read another word about him i kept hoping as i read on and on skimming some of the worst passages that things would improve that nevare would do something to make me like him again but it never happened if i had not been on an eight hour transatlantic flight with just this book i would have stopped reading it which is something i rarely do robin hobb what were you thinking,198,24
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,once again i read reviews bemoaning lack of action and emo if you have read the first book you know by now that there are not any epic battles with swords or guns you also know that you are journeying with a man through all of his thoughts and fears what is different in this book is the emotional intensity of navarres experiences relationships are destroyed i mean not just killed but ground into the dust revived and then beaten back down for good measure navarre is often helpless frustratingly so and i yelled at him quite a bit although a lot of the time I am not sure i would have made a better decision the problem is none of the choices are great choices there is nothing that will make everything right that is true enough in the real world but in this one there is powerful magic to distort and magnify everything little is left for human dignity well this book kind of took me through the emotional wringer in a lot of ways and it is hard to believe there is another one i read it pretty much non-stop,189,25
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,I have liked hobbs other series but had not read the soldier son trilogy i read the first shamans crossing and thought it was not quite on the same high level but ok I shall reserve judgment I have just read forest mage and will not read the final title forest mage shows the hero at the beginning as in a bad way removed from the past prospects that he originally had he is essentially down and out the novel then proceeds to show him failing at every single test at the end he is a despised fugitive from society his family the law all of this is unmerited and he is entirely passive if anyone enjoys reading a fantasy of complete destruction of the main character then this is the novel for you making it even more amazing he is touched with magic but never comes to the smallest understanding whatsoever about himself or the nature of the magic nicely written as always if the reader is not depressed at the outset then his / her depression is guaranteed by the end of this sodden fantasy no stars a failure,184,26
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,amazing world beautifully described and fast-flowing this book is one of the very few i have ever read twice ranking with enders game lord of the rings and orwells 1984,30,27
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i was disappointed in this book partly because my expectations of robin hobb are so high her characterisations are excellent her plots full and thought provoking she writes with a passion and makes you think about your own assumptions and actions but in this book nevare burvelle is fitzchivalry farseer the protaganists are so similar that it quite spoiled the book both are procrastinators both are cursed with an unacceptable magic both are forced to break all ties with their family and end up being believed dead by the ones they love both share a similar morality the list goes on robin hobb has simply recreated a character that she lovingly brought to a conclusion once before i still enjoyed the book enough to read it and the next one but this will not be one of my all time favourites unlike her previous works,146,28
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i got very engrossed in this trilogy the second and third books more than the first however i think it is worth noting that for some readers these books may be triggering for body and eating issues however if you are okay to read books that discuss eating and body shame forge on the series is fascinating and unique,58,29
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,received within two weeks which is excellent at my location small city in mindanao island southern philippines condition almost as new give highest recommendation to this supplier i did order anotherbook 3 in same series from a different supplier unfortunately not available at this one but still waiting for it to arrive,55,30
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have a 3 hour commute each day and survive that by audio books i am so excited to hear robins work that i can not wait to get on my way each morning john keating is a gifted storyteller and robin must be happy with his treatment of forest mage as well as the rest of the series what i am most in awe of is robins swift arrow to the bulls eye of being fat and how the world looks at you as one who is overweight and has been for most of my life this work has stirred me the story is fascinating to me with rich real characters and a stunning world of magic and misery you rock robin,122,31
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,although i read the whole series i did not particularly enjoy it I am not sure what kept me going but i think it was my loyalty to the author I am a huge fan of her other series including liveship and assassin / farseer this series could have been written by another author the characters were too few and too simple one of my most favorite things about hobbs books are that her characters are so dynamic you can relate to them they change over time and there are so many while technically this world is as creative and as original as her others i did not find the overall reading experience pleasurable most of the time i was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines if you are a fan of hobb and looking to explore this series I had say you are better off missing out if you are new to the author please for the love of god start with another of her trilogies,162,32
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have read a lot of robin hobb and believe she has to be my perfect soul mate the story of the soldiers son is compelling as usual i really like her character development and believe that the individuals who gave marginal reviews of this book are simply not developed characters themselves yet I am still a work in progress too the philosophy of her main characters the good guys clearly illustrates the battles we all wage on the road to being good people and does so in an entertaining fashion the bad guys are extremely frustrating and well constructed call me robin,102,33
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this has got to be one of the biggest bore i have read in many years i actually have read her farseer series and enjoyed it til the end and enjoyed the first one of the soldier son trilogy but i agree with also known as diary of a depressed fat man s review this is absolutely one of the worst books i have read in ages and i tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else i could not stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up not going to read the final book it is that depressing i started on way of kings instead and that is so much more satisfying,121,34
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i agree with gr johnsons review with one addition of the characters total stupidity i have never wanted to smack a character so bad in my life,27,35
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i greatly enjoyed other series by this author for examplethe farseer series but this series has been a big disappointment i thought the 1st book was ok and hoped the forest mage would break free however this volume crashed and burned for me i do not understand the authors equating obesity with magic maybe it will all come clear in the last book but i will not read it so i will not know it sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight this book was hugely depressing and i can not fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book i lost interest in nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing as well as having many obscure plot moments what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the plains folk magic weird once i find an author i enjoy i generally trust them and buy future books without much thought however I am afraid i will check the reviews very closely before i buy another one,173,36
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,again i was surprised that i enjoyed this book i had read the reviews for the second book and was again cautiously pessimistic at what was to come with that said i must say that i enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one i enjoyed the pacing and story my only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking other then that i like the world she created and the characters as well if you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you he is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero he has kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation i find it entirely very interesting although i think the author is at her best with this story the story might not be as enticing as the farseer series but her writing is topnotch,171,37
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i personally need to see a protagonist to get through a book and this series offers none i never cared about the main character and by the first quarter of the second book i hated him the characters seem to follow a script rather than a pattern of normal behavior and this becomes blindingly obvious when he gets fat and everyone rejects him to the point that they want to kill him conflict is driven by a malicious unseen force that no one has any hope of overcoming it is like reading about a hobo who walks along a train track knowing that he has going to get hit by a train and he keeps walking and he has got his wife and kids with him but i do not care about the hobos family either because i have no reason to there is no good or bad it seems just a constant force of nature that is going to kill everything but it happens three books too late i did not finish the third book i got so sick of all of it do not waste your time with any of them bad plot devices and worse character writing tied together with an awful story,199,38
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this book was part of the authors last trilogy it was good but not as fascinating as the twelve books in four trilogys that she had written before i will keep them and add to my permanent library but just saying it is not my favorite,46,39
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,definately not up to the standards that her previous books have set the story was intriguing but the entire series seemed to drag on and on and on could have done this easy in two books,36,40
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,ok i set this book down at page 211 i had pretty much given up hearing about nevares weight issues come on already i started reading another book and i just could not get into that one so i decided to pick up forest mage again and give it a shot well long story short I am glad i did i enjoy the depth of characterization ms hobb creates for the most part i also enjoy the story of the day to day struggles of nevare and his ability to overcome nevare is flawed which makes him a more interesting real subject as are all the others in the book ms hobb has a gift for fleshing out the characters and the story a sign of a good book for me is reading at every opportunity forest mage has turned into that type of book i look forward to the next installment,148,41
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this book was completely depressing as well as utterly dull wasts of time and money,15,42
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge fan of the earlier books that hobb wrote when i discovered this series i immediately bought both books the first book seemed to drag a bit for the first 60 of the book but i soldiered through it giving the author the benefit of the doubt that it was setup for the larger story i started the second book glad that we got all the setup behind us and could move forward how wrong i was this book was a challenge to try and get through and i have no intention of buying the third book I have been punished enough already,106,43
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge fan of robibn hobbs and consider the farseer and tawny man trilogies among the best books i have ever read i have not read the liveship series because they sounded sort of dumb i had high hopes for this book because i really enjoyed the first one in the series hobb has a way of really bringing believable characters to life and shamans crossing was more of the same however the more i read forest mage the more appalled i became the minute nevare began to gain weight he was insulted and shunned by everyone except the specks i think only one character at the end was nice to him i am hoping that the reviewer who called nevare a fat slob was being fasecious and not as insulting as hobb i wonder if hobb is working through some issues of her own and chose to explore them in this text i will not be wasting my time with renegades magic and although i will continue to enjoy the previous trilogies again and again i will view her future novels with skepticism,186,44
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,the first book had the small benefit of leaving hope that a plot would eventually start to evolve or at least characters would become interesting to the reader after the first 100 pages of the second book in the series it is obvious that this is going nowhere beware the 5 star reviews who admit it is slow but it is tedious period,59,45
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i was not sure what to think at the end of book 1 but I am hopeful for book 3 now I have accepted that i do not like these characters or the settings as much as her other trilogies but i think finally i can get the main character and finally we get to the meat of the books the issues that the main character faced were interesting but quite frankly i found them uncomfortable once i decided that i was really into the book although i realized that it gave the novel a pretty unique twist,94,46
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i consider the ' assassins ' series one of the top ten fantasy series I have ever read and I have read a lot therefore it was with keen interest that i picked up the ' forest mage especially after reading the first book ' shamans crossing this book should have been titled ' diary of a depressed fat man yes i like complex character development it is one of the reasons why the assassins series was so good but give me a break i stayed up till 230am finishing this book not because it was so captivating but because i could not believe it would not somehow get better and justify the time i wasted reading it let me save you the time he gets fat everyone hates him he discovers that he has magic but does not know how to use it he is still fat,139,47
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i noticed that a lot of people are giving this book bad reviews i wholeheartedly disagree with them it has been ages since i have picked up such a well-thought out book in the fantasy genre hobbs nevere faces challenges which frankly any of us would have trouble with live the way of your own people and be scorned or adopt a new culture who welcomes you with open arms and betray your people the fat stigma which nevere faces was well chosen as this is something that hits home with readers our culture too despises fat readers can face the same internal loathing as nevere there are no easy answers no sudden magical solution no sugar-coating just good insightful writing,119,48
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,nevare was the least likable character in the book arthur w jordin in comments to other reviewers keeps telling people to become more familiar with western history as if the world of nevare is real get real art this is fantasy and not very good I shall keep slogging in renegade just to find out how it all ends but will probably just skim it there were other more interesting characters in this book that could have been developed to make it a good read epiny yari actually nevare was portrayed as a poor stereotype of a female from some misogynist novel,101,49
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,forest mage by robin hobb takes up where the first book left off and it does not miss a beat i was so caught up that i could not put the book down good stuff this is what i call fantasy at it is bestshamans crossing book one of the soldier son trilogy forest mage the soldier son trilogy book 2 renegades magic the soldier son trilogy book 3,73,50
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,if you enjoy books about characters who have a million and one problems but never seek out solutions for them congratulations forest mage just might be the book for you imagine a man who is slowly being overtaken by a controlling magic he does not want is being impinged upon by an unwanted personality who makes him do evilly evil things any other writer might make their main character fight their own fate but not robin hobb and we love her for it and do not worry even if nevare seems to be making an attempt to turn his life around take a deep breath and relax because he will not hell have sex with a speck instead and then complain about it later,123,51
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,after having written 9 of the greatest books of all time i can see how anything else she wrote would pale in comparison but after struggling through the first book of this trilogy and looking forward to some substance i was disappointed it was more ameteur romance and it took forever for anything to happen basically i read 700 pages to really only get excited for the last 6 i will still read the last one although and i still love robin hobb,83,52
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,you go into this book and you think a certain event is going to occur that moves the story along you think it will happen in the first 100 pages but at the very worst by the end of this book but here it does not maybe this event will happen in book 3 meanwhile 500 pages in which 400 of them serve no useful purpose in moving the storyline along this is a classic filler middle book of a trilogy it is not very exciting not very interesting not worth reading this is sad as when megan lindholm is on it she rocks she has not here,105,53
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i love reading robin hobbs but my god is she gut wrenching i love the outdoors and forests are a real treat for me but after reading forest mage i wanted to buy a chainsaw and head for the nearest redwood what the main character in this book went through and all the people that died around him because of his curse was just terrible rarely does a fantasy book get so gritty but that is what robin does best in a time when the bookshelves are loaded with mundane writers robin shines can not wait for the next one,100,54
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i love robin hobbs previous books but this trilogy does nothing but dissapoint sure the writing is still wonderful and williams style is essentially unchanged however the main character is just so unlikable he is whiny melodramatic and annoying this made it really hard to get in to the book because you just do not care what has going on all of the genuinely likable characters seem to throw themselves in the way of the often well deserved troubles of the protanginst all in all the books well written imagary and well rounded characters just can not save this book from it is protaginist,100,55
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i love robin hobbs books she writes wonderfully and attaches you to the characters in her story when i started reading forest mage i was once again pulled in by her first person writing and attention to detail i could feel nevares pain and humiliation unfortunately the pain was to acute and i could not make it past page 200 when i realized that he would never loose the weight that he had been cursed with from the speck plague hobbs writes this tale of a man cursed with majic fat this fat can not be lost through diet or excercise the fat changes the way people perceive him gets him kicked out of the academy and disowned by his family i would love to know all that happens but the first person telling of this poor mans distruction was to difficult i stopped reading this book several months ago but i can not get nevare and his plight out of my mind i mourn the loss of this book and hope that one day i will be able to confront nevares life again i highly recommend her other three series i could not put them down,195,56
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this had to be one of the most relentlessly miserable and depressing books I have read in a long time absolutely nothing good happens to anyone and it spirals into one disaster after another with nothing to redeem it or any of the characters I had strongly recommend avoiding it,48,57
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,every time i pick up a robin hobb book i seem to lose days of my life i just finished forest mage and somehow read the 700 page book in less than 3 days do not tell my boss i was very sad when i finished the farseer liveship and fool trilogies luckily the soldiers son books have brought me right back to the vivid worlds of hobbs imagination no the soldiers son books are not in the same world as the farseer ones were but the world is just as imaginative forest mage the second book in the series follows nevare as he travels home from the academy to widevale for his brothers wedding he expects a happy reunion in much the same way he expects a happy and promising future afterall he survived the speck plague and defeated the tree woman and severed her power over him or so he thought no doubt about it this book is tough to read because nevares suffering is brutal but you will not be able to put it down,176,58
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,the soldier son trilogy is nearly as good as the farseer / liveship stories the first book takes a little effort to get into but the second one is strong from the first page this prolific author deserves praise and attention,39,59
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,robin hobb does not disappoint in this latest offering i was transported into this delightful saga i did not want to come up for air more please,25,60
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,interesting characters well developed storylines great imagination i was a bit disappointed in the darkness of this second book of the series but ms hobb is an excellent storyteller,29,61
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,a really long awaited sequel to book one i could not wait to get my hands on it i was not dissappointed vintage hobb read it practically in one session yes i guess it is crazy but books from this author do it to you definitely a must read book,50,62
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this book is serious fiction it deals with some very difficult issues in an interesting if not entertaining way a great writer will sometime make a difficult subject easy to read hobb is a good writer so the story sometimes seems hard to read this is not a book to take to the beach but it is a very important book and well worth reading,66,63
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,hobbs tale casts the forest and human progress as antagonists neither are without sin the peoples of the forest and of the king suffer but no one suffers more than nevarre who is caught between the two worlds in volume two hobb abandons any pretense of a heroic main character turning him grotesquely fat cutting him off from home society and all that could give him support the pacing is slow but the telling is rich nevarres slow understanding and acceptance of what is happening to him and his world is all the more believable for his not accepting the changes too easily too quickly,105,64
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,gosh but i feel even more sorry for this guy hurry up and write the third,16,65
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have read everything that i could find by robin hobb and this latest installment is great i do not know of another sci-fi authoor who can weave a story with such complexity and still allow the reader to care about the characters involved forrest mage is full of suprizes as well as explanations and i can not wait for the next book to come out,64,66
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i absolutely love robin hobbs style you may actually dislike a character or what they are becoming but still can not stop reading in this book the main character struggles between two worlds and you actually struggle with him even to the point of disliking what he is becoming but in the end when the final decision is made you want to stand up and cheer for him overall a very enjoyable book from start to finish,77,67
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,forest mage is a refreshing exception to the usual fantasy book formula the narrating character is wonderfully and believably imperfect the plot revolves around challenges to and changes in his psyche detailing his internal journey of self-discovery rather than relying as so many books do on a clear-cut good-versus-bad conflicts i imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow but those who take an interest in a characters internal development will have trouble putting it down although i must add that once you adjust to the pace there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy with a touch of horror for spice i found it quite gripping robin hobb has once again demonstrated her masterful skill in creating complex and fascinating characters and everything from the storyline to the setting reflects this an excellent read,151,68
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this story has no redeeming value at all the primary character is portrait as a fat slob who can not do anything of significant not only is his life a waste but this story is a waste do not buy it,40,69
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,excellent i loved this book but i love all of robin hobbs books to date i can not wait for the next book in the series the thing i love most about her writing is you can close your eyes and see exactly what she has describing she has a one of a kind writer if you have not read anything by her you must if you have then you will love this series as well i still miss fitz,76,70
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this is the second book of robin hobbs latest trilogy but it reads like she has trying to start right over again in less then three chapters the young cavalry officer from the first book turns into a self hating tub of lard theof a fat hero is rather original but the appeal ends there he just gets fatter and fatter more full of magic and periodically makes some social blunder or has sex with a who are the sex scenes are both frequent and disgusting with far to many details i was considering throwing this into the donation bin at a libaray or perhaps a book burning but i did eventually finish it the suprise ending is somewhat original even interesting but not nearly enough to save this train wreck hobb was clearly trying something new here and that is always something that should be cheered but it might have all worked out much better if she would stuck with the handsome naive officer cadet instead of the depressing loathsome fatass,171,71
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i was not sure i liked this book in the beginning nevare was not a character i especially liked in the first volume of this trilogy and i thought my feelings for him were not going to change and they did not not until the final few paragraphs of forest mage a few paragraphs that i found such a perfect ending that it completely redemed nevare for me as for the rest of the book i did not find it depressing at all just totally engrossing i did not do much of anything for a day and half but read this book i love robin hobbs world-building her way of creating such marvelous cultures and mythologies this book was no exception the forest the specks the walkers i loved all of it and would happily have continued reading for another 700 pages can not wait till volume 3 this story is going to haunt me until i can finally read the ending thanks robin for another enthralling story,163,72
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i loved this sequel to shamans crossing ms hobb takes her time developing characters some readers find that tedious i love the way it unfolds as the story unwinds you find yourself swept along whether you really want to be or not whether you feel empathy or revulsion you are on a roller-coaster ride of emotions ms hobbs characters are flawed and sometimes you end up slapping your forehead over dumb decisions they make but the point is that you care about them anyway at least i do i can feel the bouts of power and helplessness that navarre struggles with the farseer trilogy is one of my favorite sets of reading i can see similarities between what navarre and fitz suffered is it magic or fate self-sacrifice or hopes for the future i may not always like thecharacter but i can not put the book down because i am always pulling for him i can not wait for book three,161,73
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i enjoyed shamans crossing but the main character is quite dense and unlikeable in this second of the series it is something you would read to initiate major depression i was disappointed,31,74
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i am a newcomer to the fantasy genre i finished reading george r r martins song ofand fire and while waiting for the next book in the series happened on shamans crossing by accident i was immediately sucked into nevarres world and came to care about him his friends and wanted the mystery of the specks to unfold i found forest mage to be a satisfying continuation of nevarres story there are still many questions unanswered as a mystery fan i love that and nevarre is maturing into a truly flawed but real young man i think with the exception of martin and charlaine harris books i have not looked forward to a sequel with this much anticipation in a very long time,124,75
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,a very solid second novel in the soldier son trilogy robin hobb has once again provided her readers with a rich and brilliant world to explore I have heard slow and tedious many times from people knocking her works farseer and soldier son both but hobb fans will tell you that neither are true and that she is one of the very best at taking the time to develop a world for her characters and their conflicts i highly recommend this novel to any fantasy reader and especially to those who have loved hobbs work in the past,97,76
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i loved the farseer series it is in my top 5 of all time this however disappoints it is boring tedious long winded and has a main character that is hard to like not through any fault of his own i did not like and unfortunately will inspect all of robins works in the future more closely before buying,59,77
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed with this book i was over 150 pages into the book before i was past what it said on the book jacket i also did not like that so much of the book was contrived and i did not think there was enough happening i thought there were a lot of loose ends too i will definately not pre-order his next book before thumbing through it myself,69,0
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,much better than his last novel very hard to put down a real page turner,15,1
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,as a big koontz fan and one anxiously awaiting the third book of the moonlight bay trilogy i had missed this title for some reason and i eagerly checked it out to read when i discovered it for the most part i was disappointed i only give two stars because the first half of the book which unfortunately is nothing but a ridiculous red herring the boyfriend of the mom should be in different book really actually had me intrigued enough to read on i also did not mind the plot twist regarding the doctor but not the way it was resolved however i was largely unsympathetic towards the protagonist and his love interest and the ending failed to resolve anything in that regard in fact the ending i would almost classify it as an epilogue was so bad i almost tossed by tablet down in disgust oh and the supernatural element does not really work in this book,160,2
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this is my second reading of this book mr koontz always keeps your attention the way he uses subtext as he has educating you on subtext was so clever the entire time i tried to figure out what he was trying to saymr koontz for another great read,49,3
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a dean koontz fan so good bad indifferent i enjoy his books for what they all are at heart entertainment i would read again buy again and buy from same vendor book ordered and arrived in manner i expect when making purchases on amazon,45,4
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,that said i wanted to stop after 100 pages 150 pages should have stopped after 200 pages am kicking myself for not stopping after 250 pages and more etc and more what a complete bore i hated the stupidity of the story i hated all of the characters the book was not thrilling exciting scary or mysterious a snoozer,61,5
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,worst dean koontz book i have ever read very disappointing i think nowadays he is just writing to make money,20,6
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,really really enjoyed this book all the way through except for the ending i think most people will love the ending but it was not what i was hoping for definitely going to be reading more dean koontz books,38,7
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a big dean koontz fan so i can say with some authority that this book is terrible do not waste your time,22,8

Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,always a surprise love his writing from beginning to end look forward to the next book keep them coming dean,20,10
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love it he always keeps you guessing,8,11
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was not a huge fan of this instead of the in-depth characters and plots that koontz is known for this was a book that just lightly skimmed the surface of his normal writing it was bland with characters that were vanilla and boring and several things just never worked with the book including plot points that went nowhere and a total lack of compassion or caring for the characters things happened that just were not logical but the reader was supposed to just follow along and it just did not work overall unless you are a die-hard fan of koontz skip this one it is far from his best work and it really was a disappointment,114,12
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this novel is a bit different from the usual koontz novel as always it is well-written and it keeps you guessing until the end,24,13
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,now i have two of them oops can not get enough of dean koontz,13,14
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,good book not one of koontzs best but still entertaining,10,15
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i can not help but feel uplifted after reading any of mr koontzs books this one was no exception i love how his characters develop and become more human to me as the story progresses,34,16
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,took a few unexpected twists and turns as always well written and a page turner especially in the last half,20,17
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,awhile ago i started to read this book and when i was just over half way done the book started over i guess it was a problem with the printer anyway i can not believe it took so long to read this book i loved everything about it so many twist and turns i wonder if i would have been able to read all the clues nevertheless i enjoyed this book very much,72,18
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,the main character ryan is a self-made success living the good life in the middle of it all he becomes I shall needing a heart transplant after the operation strange things start to happen and soon it is obvious that someone is out to get vengeance for the donor of that heart lots of suspense and also very sad at times enjoyed it,62,19
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have to be honest and say up front that i did not finish this book instead of the heart thundering suspense that i normally experience when reading something by dean koontz boredom was the only thing i felt i can not give away any spoilers i see at least one review that has done that already i was little more than halfway through when i decided to check the reviews something i usually do not do until i finish a book the details about the second half which were revealed were enough for me to know that i need not bother finishing i have a couple of odd thomas books waiting to be read i would have given only one start but so many of the descriptions of mundane things were so well-written as in other books koontz was able to paint many pictures with far fewer than a thousand words still it was just boring,154,20
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this story was a real let down i thought from reading the description that the book was going to be a heart-stopping thriller instead it was more like boring amateur hour in book writing the characters were 2 dimensional at most no one was complicated they were either good bad or confused the plot flat-lined and could not be brought back to life this book was a waste of my time and energy but at least i only paid a dollar for it,83,21
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have come to expect witty repartee complicated but clear story lines from dean koontz this book to me was overly complicated with many passages bogged down by expansive and unnecessary rhetoric when violence pops up like a deranged whack a mole it seems out of place in what dragged on as a psychological thriller I am sure there has a life lesson in here somewhere I am just too word-weary to care,69,22
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,got this for a gift for my son he is a big dean koontz fan he highly recommends this book,20,23
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,rather rambling and boring hard to pick it back up once i put it down really did not like it,20,24
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,did not like this at all too predictable and trite just the same old theme used by many authors with no new angle and spoiler alert super rich protagonist giving it all up to live as a monk come on,40,25
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,perfectly writtenof your seat wonderment as only koontz can do highly recommended reading you will not be able to put it down,23,26
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,really a good read pretty scary but truly a page-turner,10,27
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,very interesting and suspenseful but not sure what samantha wanted from ryan it was not clear to me and really did not understand the ending but it held my interest to the end also makes you think about where organ donations are coming from guess if you need one you need to ask that question,53,28
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,fascinating book by koontz i know a lot of other people do not like the book but i think they are reading it like an early koontz rather than his more recent work which is more spiritual and philosophical the underlying moral question this book poses is how complicit are we in others suffering because of our wants the corollary question to the answer is then what do we do about it when we recognize our complicity you are not going to find these questions addressed in your typical thriller or mystery i agree that the supernatural religious part of the book did not quite fit but neither did it reduce the power of the message I shall gladly take a book like this over dark rivers of the heart any time,129,29
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the book but it was not as scary as i am used to from dean koonts but still a good read,23,30
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i had read some reviews that said they did not like this book i loved this book as i have loved every dean koontz book i have ever read he is amazing and my all time favorite author thanks mr koontz,41,31
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,good book i like dean koontz because what he writes really could happen it is possibly science future fact and not really science fiction he makes it interesting and hard to put down,33,32
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,such a wonderful read very spiritual i am a fan an this going down as one of my favourites great,20,33
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,dean always keeps me on thewaiting i would have loved for a different ending but enjoyed this book thoroughly,21,34
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a huge reader and thought that this book had a poetic feeling anyone who thought this book was not believable does not realize that a person would do anything they could to preserve life truly one of koontz best books i think the others are quick reads this one has an added depth,52,35
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this was ok i have read more interesting or kept my attention i was about to stop reading but finally got interesting almost over half way,26,36
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,my mom really loves to read this author all she ever want for christmas and her birthday you will enjoy it,21,37
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i would read this book again and recommend it to my friends it was a thrilling book and it kept me on theof my seat,27,38
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,bravo to dean koontz for having the nerve to cover such a sensitive and important topic I am sure it is not a easy to write about the real-life crime of chinas organ harvesting alongside the complexities of the most profound spiritual movement of our time thanks dean,47,39
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this book is amazing once i started reading i could not stop check i did not want to i can not wait to read another one of his works,26,40
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been the biggest fan since the 1st book i ever read of his love his books and will continue to read as long as he continues to write them,31,41
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this book has ranked as one of my three favorite koontz books tied with phantoms and watchers the ending was so beautiful i cried i do not understand why people did not like this book it was so creepy and scary that i could not read it at night until i got close to the end and as i said before without giving it away the ending was absolutely beautiful but sad in all i highly recommend this book,79,42
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,this was a gripping story as have been all the dean koontz books I have read to date i have read 4 koontz tales becoming a big fan,27,43
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,enjoyable read for a while kept me saying one more chapter just one more the second part does drag a bit but there is just enough action to keep you going the ending is sweet and the whole book comes together nicely i rented this free on my kindle fire from my local library i noticed it was for sale for 999 i personally am glad i did not spend ten dollars on it i find it is not worth that much money overall if you can find it for free or on sale then it is worth your time happy reading,99,44
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been a fan of dean koontz since i was a kid i think i have just about ever book he has ever written if you love a good story that you can not put down give one of his a try you will not be disappointed,46,45
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,the story was pretty good and kept me engaged i would recommend this book if you are a koontz fan,20,46
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as usual never disappointed in any of his work my favorite author once again proves to anyone why he is,20,47
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i liked the morality aspect of the book the story like threw me a curve because i was sure he was doing the things the candy the lockethimself,29,48
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as usual dean has written a book that is hard to put down until finished keep up the great work,20,49
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,ryan heart has failed and at 34 he has found himself on a waiting list for a new one impatience for life gets the better of him and he searches for a new doctor dr hobbs finds him a heart in record time and the transplant is a success a year later things begin to happen to him that make him wonder if it was all worth it this is a book filled with love suspense danger and a little poe thrown in for good measure this is not my favorite dean koontz book but it is not bad either i think that it was a little slow on the upstart but the ending was fast paced and well worth the reading of the rest of it the subtext of this book is that you can not buy life you just have to live it and let it be as it should be i would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy romance horror and drama i bought this book from a used book store,174,50
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have been trying to catch up with koontzs books for the past several years now although i am still a very long way from completing that task what I have come to expect from mr koontz is well heart his books are far less focused on cheap thrills and gore than some of the other authors that I have read and the results can vary from time to time there is usually a good amount of hope behind his work with this book the heart is there i really do not mean that as a pun but it takes a different form it twists the story and the character in a way that i was not expecting and i quite enjoyed seeing that play out i do not want to give too much away with this review so I shall just leave it at that,139,51
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,to me this is not so much a thriller i guess many would have been disappointed with the mediocre treatment of the story there is no gory death scenes no chasing around the globe adventures and certainly there is not even teeth-gritting intolerance of injustice there are however a good build up of characters a good surprising twists to events and the love between the two protagonists is endearing i have never been moved emotionally by a thriller but this one almost moved me to tears at the end there is forgiveness giving and redemption a very high value of human nature indeed how on earth does dean koontz add these two elements of thriller and spirit all in one novel may not be his greatest work but i like it,131,52
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this review will contain spoilers so be warned this is the first koontz book I have read and thankfully i got it from the library and did not pay money for it the ending made no sense so an internet billionaire up and decides to give away all his money and live in a monastery for lack of a better word yeah sure also it bothered me that the nutjob violet did not get arrested and did not have to pay for her stalking assaulting and near killing him i really wanted violet to get a smackdown so bad yes it sucks that dr hobb was a slimeball and should be persecuted but that was not ryans fault if this is indicative of koontzs stuff I am wary of trying out any more of his books,130,53
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this is without any shadow of a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read oddly enough it is written by an author who has written some of my favorite books I have been a fan of koontz since i read watchers about 25 years ago from that one to odd thomas to life expectancy one of my favorite stories dean koontz has consistantly put out very readable works this one stands alone i oftenor give books I have read and enjoyed to friends and family this one went straight into the garbage as i could not subject anyone that i like to the horrible waste of paper this was i do not know if this was just a publishers deadline book but i can not possibly see what anyone would take away from it as the ending began i actually looked back thru to see if i had missed a portion of the book it failed on so many levels,158,54
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love dean koontz but this was an unexciting read the story line seemed interesting but there was no suspense because i could always see what was coming next i found the ending to be very anticlimactic frankly the entire book felt that way this is a book i wish i had not wasted time on and that is very unusual for a dean koontz book the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because a it is dean koontz and b the story line was interesting,88,55
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,once again koontz concocts a story filled with intrigue and had me guessing as to how it would all turn out the ending to this tale was much much more satisfying than many of his works that have superior writing this was a fun-filled book the pacing of it is a bit different from many of his recent thrillers but it was singular,63,56
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i read koontzs earlier books in the 80s and 90s and pretty much like them this is his 1st book which I have picked up in yonks and i must rate it as a poor excuse for a novel it is extremely draggy and plain boring after the 1st couple of chapters i was wondering if this is the same writer who wrote all those earlier hits this has turned me off getting further koontzs stuff,74,57
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i do not know where this came from but i was disappointed with this read i love to read his stuff but this was not even the same author for me i could not get into the characters and the story it did not capture me at all i kept reading to give it a chance but it never came around i would definitely skip this one there are too many amazing books to read and so little time,75,58
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i read this whole book only because there was no dog in it what is wrong with samantha for breaking up with ryan some how she mysteriously knows he did a really bad thing by using his money to get a heart quickly this woman is supposedly in love with him but then decides he has a piece of garbage for not waiting around in line to die for a heart transplant to top it off she will not even tell him why she broke up with him i do not know why either there is no possible way on earth she could know the circumstances involved around getting his new heart the villain is the sister of ryans unwilling heart donor my question is why go after the rich guy who really does not have a clue about the heart go after the surgeons or his doctor or the organization in china that is killing political prisoners to harvest organs typical women never know where to place the blame,166,59
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i agree with several of the previous posters poorly and no doubt quickly written sorry i just realized most of the postings were over 2 years ago i recently purchased this book in paperback to read on a road trip and this is the first time i have posted a review of a book I have been a fan for years but have to say nothing he has written in the past few years has done anything for me the heart transplant plot could have been taken so much further such as the true stories of heart transplant recipients taking on the habits traits personalities and more of the donors very disappointing,112,60
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,the storyline just did not have enough glue to hold it all together and bounces too far out in too many directions there were many variables that left me thinking that the author was trying to grab for something that was just too far out of reach the first half of the book is a little slow the last half picks up with action but is thin an adjectivally tedious skimmer but that is just my view having said that dean koontz is still my number one author someone sitting next to me could read the same book and easily rate it five stars,103,61
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i actually liked this book mr koontz has always been one of my favorite prolific authors he has changed style as he has gotten older this is a perfect example the plot is a very good one and has a tendency to make one think ryan perry 34 has it all he has made a fortune in the dotcom business he suddenly finds one day he has in dire need of a heart transplant he receives the transplant successfully now his life begins to become very strange and begins unravelling although a very goodfor a story there are parts in which the author leaves loose ends dangling no justice for dr death who apparently murdered ismay clemm the beauty violet for the most part simply vanishes shortly before the end the end holds no great surprises in fact it may be a bit over the top as the love of his life samantha re-enters his much altered life alas possibly too late it does carry some of lifes lessons and may very well leave you thinking of your own life and mortality i just wish the story was packed a bit tighter without the loose ends i still enjoyed the novel,200,62
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,the first 200 pages are summarized on the back of the book seriously it is a horrible sloppy mess of a book that fails to captivate me the ending was immensely unsatisfying this book is a huge disappointment and you should not buy it if you want a good dean koontz novel check out odd thomas or the good guy but stay clear of this monstrosity for it will consume your time and yield no satisfaction,80,63
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i just need to say it what happened to mr koontz I have read almost everything by dean he has one of my favorite writers however this novel is the bottom of the barrel for me these suspense novels are falling short not because they are poorly written but because the dean koontz standard is so high deans imagination is the thing that first drew me to him where are the strange ideas where are the tales of terror where is the cross-genre genius of dean koontz this novel your heart belongs to me is not dean koontz at least the dean koontz that i long to read this story is nothing more than a novella that was fattened-up with endless descriptions of decor lighting and weather i will continue to read koontz but this is not his best,134,64
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,silly book reading it is a waste of time probably his worst yet,13,65
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,sorry but add me to the list of people who thought this was just a really bad book i found myself doing a lot of skipping throughout it because it dragged so painfully slow a lot of parts of the book just did not fit in with the story and once i finished made it more clear just how they were not needed in the book at all he has gotten in the habit of trying to paint a picture for you using a lot of flowery language that make you lose track of what the story is about because you find yourself skimming just to get back to the plot at hand i used to love dean koontzs books and had just started reading him again and so far this is the third book in my list of his latest books that made me wonder what happened to the dean koontz i loved in the 90s,157,66
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i can not believe this was written by koontz his writing is usually uplifting and leaves you better for reading it the ending of this one left me feeling empty and trying to forget i read this at all if you are a fan i strongly recommend you avoid this book it will leave you cold and lacking,56,67
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i enjoy dean koontzs stories although his characters often seem a little too good to be true i actually liked ryan perry because he was a real guy that is not perfect i was hoping the female protagonist samantha would turn out to be the baddie but no such luck this book turned into a rant against the evil moneyed west exploiting the people of the third world yawn and i am getting so tired of surfer lingo and golden retrievers,80,68
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,your heart belongs to me is different than the other dean koontz novels I have read the main character is not as likable the story does not move at as fast a pace in the beginning as most of his tales ryan perry does not know something inside him is broken that something is his heart he needs a transplant but i do not want to say anymore and ruin it that being said the story is brillant i love it just as much as his other novels I am glad i continued reading because if i had stopped in the middle it probably would have recieved three stars very low for a dean koontz book but when near the end all mysteries were revealed and the subtext became clear this was a story of redemption that will stay with me for a long time it deserves five stars,143,69
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this is the weakest koontz novel after reading about two dozen of them I am not saying do not read this one but it should be one of the last koontz books that you read as for recent koontz novels i recommend the husband and velocity over this one the only thing that really saved the good guy was the entertaining serial killer that left me laughing out loud this one here is slllloooooow you have to read 150 pages before something significant happens there has lot of things that do not make sense and once the villain was revealed and her motives i felt cheated i even stopped within the last 10 pages to brush my teeth before bed before actually finishing the book something I have never done with a koontz novel if you have read everything else by koontz by all means read it but i do not recommend paying more than a few dollars for it definitely get it second hand,156,70
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i am wild about the fast pace of koontzs books but this one it started ok but then slowed to a crawl and just dragged on and on before the main character even got his heart transplant the book was half over before anything had even begun to happen then very little does happen the supernatural element was vague confusing and pointless and the climax was like no climax at all it simply left me scratching my head wondering what koontz was thinking the climax ended so abruptly i kept thinking it would start again in the next chapter but no then then romantic interest was a disappointment too the book jacket was better than the book worst fiction book i have read in long time sorry dean love you but this book was bordering on awful but i give it too stars just on your reputation,147,71
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was really disappointed as this story lacked the usual suspence and thrill of a koontz book i kept waiting for the good part to start i was over 3/4 done before i flet i had a hint of that my suggestion is to pick a different koontz book to read,51,72
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,with this novel koontz puts his spin on human transplant donation the story might turn some off to becoming donors or it might even encourage others to become donors so that that happens in this story does not happen as I am sure it does it is like buyer beware especially when it comes to getting body parts story also covers paranoia to the extreme as a paranoid myself it shows how ones mind can do so much harm taking a person to places where no one would ever hope to go fast reading with an interesting main character who starts out as the guy who has everything money can buy but ends up happier after losing almost everything including his own life if you like koontz this book will not disappoint,129,73
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i will agree to the dragging a bit at the begining but i do not agree that it was disappointing the unpredictablity keeps you guessing til the end,27,74
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i thought this was pretty good a little different for dean but good very interesting concept,16,75
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is been a while since I have read a dean koontz novel most of his work s are great however this novel was very slow and hard to get into not the dean koontz that I have enjoyed this book took forever to really get to anything interesting if you really like to wait until the book is almost over for any action to occur this is your book but it really left me a feeling of huh this book did not win me over at all i do not recommend this one sorry out there to all the dean koontz fans,98,76
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,to quote dorothy parker out of context there has no there there this book has no substance whatsoever and whatever suspense is built up in the first half is completely misguided and unfulfilled this is the worst dean koontz book i have ever read stay away it starts out promisingly enough but then you realize it has denigerated into hints of a good book that will never arrive,68,77
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a huge dean koontz fan and was looking forward to reading this book it could have been a really great story but the read turned out to be extremely tedious i skimmed through many many paragraphs which is something I have never done in any of his previous books the story took way too long to tell his never-ending references to subtexts was annoying the characters paranoia with regard to people out to get him was repetitive and extremely tiresome the end was a letdown and all in all the book was a waste of time are we sure dean koontz even wrote this mess,104,78
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i could not get past the 2nd cd it would not play but 13 and on play fine,16,79
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,another masterpiece from the master of suspense once you start reading koontz you can not stop anxiously awaiting his next adventure,20,80
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,spoilers i do not have much to say about this book that has not already been said by the other one and two star reviewers I am an avid koontz fan so please do not think i have a vendetta against the author but heres all i have to say you keep me up into the wee hours of the morning with the knowledge of cadaver art and you do not give me the payoff of having the lovers reunite for a happy ending cadaver art without true love prevailing that is just cold,88,81
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love to read dean koontzs books because i never know where they are going to take me they have an underlying theme that runs through the book but is not stated but implied this book is about grace and mercy and that there are consequences to each of our actions when we extend grace and mercy to others it is extended back to us i do not want to say more because it would spoil the ending i simply enjoyed the reading,81,82
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,may not be the sellers fault but this book was a misprint changes in the end to the beginning never did find the end of the book,27,83
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have two favorite authors of the macrabra kind stephen king and dean koontz write alike and hold people enthralled to the last word dean has out done himself with your heart belongs to me i found each chapter to good to put down i had nowho was tormenting him then the end was a real surprise i read this book in three hours my husband was not happy with me but it surely was worth it keep on bringing these books out dean i love them,87,84
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,anything koontz writes is always entertaing from odd to supernatural his heros and villens both will keep you turning the pages trying to determine which direction the story is taking you,31,85
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i needed a book to read on a continental flight from houston back to sacramento so i bought this book at a wal-mart near the hotel i finished the book in 39 minutes and spent the rest of the flight about 90 minutes or so enjoying boeing 747 safety card and continental sky-mall magazine did you know that you can buy a davinci code cryptex for 195,67,86
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,big fan of koontz disappointed in this one usual guessing game but this one is way off base closes the loops in the last two chapters after going all over the place during the whole book and the answers will leave you like say what did he have to go do something and so he just needed to end the book various theories and hints leave you guessing in all the wrong places only to end up with oh that is all sorry if you liked this book but it is nothing like his classics I am going to,94,87
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i enjoyed this book i always prefer koontzs non-supernatural books and at first i thought it was going in that direction it was a very good plausible plot and an enjoyable read,32,88
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,great book as always dean koontz leaves you on theof your seat worth while reading,17,89
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i could not be happier with the speed and condition i received my book it was packaged great and turned out to be a good read thank you,27,90
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i can not believe that those who gave this book great reviews and i read the same book it is an okay read but definitely not one of koontzs best it was a little slow to develop thecharacters were kind of bland and the ending was dull i think the premise of the book is a good one but just was not developed as well as one expects from koontz a lot of the events seemed totally unrelated to the main plot and characters i felt let down when i finished this book rather than saying wow I am really glad i read this not quite a waste of time just do not expect much if you are a big fan of the author,120,91
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,koontz is a favorite author of mine this book is a good one although not one of the more eccentric stories,21,92
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,as a long-time koontz fan i was excited to get this book unfortunately is was a huge disappointment and the story did not even make sense he writes about ryans love interests mother and the mothers boyfriend as if they may eventually have a part in something nope just turns out mothers boyfriend has a creepy house also what was the point of developing ryan and his girlfriends love story at all they do not even end up together apparently deep down she knew he was the kind of shallow guy would who take an unethically harvested heart and the ending was irritating too i get that ryan was trying to make up for his previously shallow / money-rules-all existance but come on an orphange real believable for someone who can write books like intensity false memory and life expectancy this book was just not up to par a double disappointment since this was the first hardcover koontz that i ever paid for,159,93
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,first half paranoid rich guy gets himself a shady heart transplant second half paranoid rich guy gets himself a stalker real or supernatural if you have got this far in the book you really do not care you just want it to end,43,94
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am sooo glad i borrowed this from the library the thought of having spent money on it makes me I shall i love dean koontz but this was junk halfway through the book you think you have someof where it is going where ever you think it is going i promise it will not wind up there the story never comes together in a way that makes any sense lots of loose ends even a new character quickly tossed in near the end to help wrap-up a book that i think dean koontz himself was sick of writing part of me wants to say shame on you to dean koontz but part of me can not even believe that he was the author that being said i do still love just about every other book of his that I have read,136,95
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a huge dean koontz fan but could not make it through the first chapter i usually can not put his books down but this one was absolutely terrible wish i would have listened to the other negative reviews read the good guy instead an excellent read,45,96
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like so many other reviewers i was disappointed it reads like it was written by someone else perhaps dean koontz actually died and this book was put together by the person who received his heart but not his brain on so many levels it does not work number one is the hero yawn who cares if he lives or dies not me that is for sure and the girlfriend the amazingly talented novelist who has about as much empathy as a rock another dud and then there has the plot or is there bring back odd please,97,97
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read a lot of koontzs work but in recent years been disappointed with many of his stories while the premise of this one was intriguing it took way too long to get to the meat and potatoes there were many questions that were not answered spoilers ahead what was the point of isme clem coming to ryan before the surgery when she could not have known about lily why did violet have to have the final showdown at ryans dads house a character we never really heard about until that last scene why did she get up and leave after beating him senseless and torturing him what about all the focus on euthenasia and the fascination with the pictures in the folder why the poe fixation these are just some nagging questions while i found the premise intriguing about killing people for their organs it seemed overly prosaic and pretentious at times dean buddy get back to psychological thrillers already watchers false memory heck even straight-out horror like phantoms enough of this happy lovey-dovey cockadoodie,174,98
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i usually like dean koontz books so when a friend gave me this one i was more than happy to read it yet when i was about 75 pages into the book i called her and asked her was this book really going anywhere it does not there is no real incidents in the book the ones that happen are never really explained the relationship sours and you are left hanging with no solid understanding of what happened then out of no where comes another character and you are left shaking your head to me this is a what happened book i did not like it too many unanswered questions,110,99
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i loved this book a lot of subtext intriguing premise and well the fact that koontz created this one make it a great read not without it is downsides it is not one of his best it still is a good solid read definitely recommended,43,100
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,a am a big fan of dean koontz I have enjoyed the new directions as he explores his life-and-love-centered philosophy but this book was no fun it bothered me that the protagonist was so difficult to like i suppose koontz was experimenting with an unlikeable hero but this guy was so irritating that it was hard to care about what happened to him one reason i love koontz is that his good guy characters are personable funny good-hearted this character i could not understand what motivated him and in the end i did not care it is wonderful that koontz continues to experiment with his writing but i hope he will populate future experiments with likeable characters,112,101
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been reading dean koontz since i was in high school I am so impatient for his new books that i can not even wait for them to come out in paperback i look forward to every one and this lived up to my expectations great book,46,102
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have been a fan of dean koontz for some time and he has not had an impressive book in so long that i can not tell you what the last one was that i read i long for some good old fashion koontz that kind of stuff that has you clinging to your seat and peeking out your window wondering if they are coming for you too do not waste your money on this one oh the one about the woman leaving her husband was decent i can not remember the name although the cover was very colorful,96,103
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love it when dean koontz does something different and writes such a thought provoking novel one part of me wanted a different ending but i completely loved the one i got dean koontz has such a deep sense of honor i believe i would like him as a person if i ever met him maybe not he probably writes books all the time laughing out loud,65,104
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,if you have read the description of the book you know the premise however by the halfway point of the book which is as far as i got the main character still has not had his heart transplant this book was so slow so tedious and so devoid of interest for me that i saw no reason to continue after 160 pages the main character is a total jerk who you would not want to have lunch with and his girl friend has been given zero characterization koontz has written some compelling novels but this is not one of them it belongs in the recycling bin i checked this out of the library so i did not waste any money only time but i wish i had those 2 hours back,129,105
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,gaping holes in the plot preachy and egotistical narrative unsound and petty moralizing one-dimensional characters events that make absolutely no sense it leaves the reader wondering whether this was ghost-written by trixie koontz via ouija board i got this used for only a couple of bucks and still regret the purchase as well as the time spent reading this disaster this is definitely one to skip by far the worst thing he has ever written and that includes his early megaflops,79,106
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i am sick and tired of reading customer reviews that just complain about this book not being like every other book dean koontz had written i bet these are probably the same people who would write a review about a book and say this book sounded just like his last book get an originalalready as a writer I am sure he wants to experiement with different styles and different means of telling a story i loved the book and thought that psychological aspect was riveting even although at times the main character was not always likeable for me that made the character growth even more rewarding in my opinion this book was one of the better books of his i have read i admit i have not yet read everything he had written but I am working on it i am currently readying the darkest evening of the year and your heart belongs to me blows that one out of the water i hope to see more books of this caliber,171,107
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,in a nutshell skip this one the plot concept lured me in but it was really a waste of time it is written in a nearly incoherent style and the parts where there should be suspense sit there like a dead fish there are far too many stretches which left my mind confused,52,108
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love koontz i have read or listen to all of his books that i know of over these past many many years i have always liked the good guys against bad guys approach and the positive endings i like how he has portrayed christians and people of religion including earth mothers who love nature but this book who will love this book folk who feel that succesful people are ruthless and selfish who have class envy and wealth jealousy who love to see a rich person get what has coming to him and in the end to see that person humbled and contrite like the re-education camps for the land owner and business classes in countries that have been taken over by the communists or if you prefer keynes over friedman who will hate this book people who have worked hard and become succesful seeing myths about themselves being continued by an author who seems to be drifting politically left with this work maybe he will catch up with steven king i will re-read koontz other books where it is the government that is the potential big bad guy and not a self made business man,195,109
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,while i am a huge dean koontz fan this book did not do it for me the book dragged in the beginning and i was wondering how long before the plot starts to pick up well the plot did pick up and suddenly there were a number of different seeming subplots which i found very interesting but alas in the end all the subplots fizzled i was quite dissapointed with the way the book wrapped up,76,110
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i really loved this book sometimes it is hit or miss with dean koontz but this ones a winner i really could not put it down interesting characters and an interesting ending i highly recommend this book I am a koontz fan from way back but often he seems like different authors this koontz book is written by the author i like,59,111
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this is a poor outing by the usually reliable dean koontz a thin story stretched to novel length it might make a tight short story but there is too little plot and too much padding,36,112
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,dean koontz is such a gifted writer my husband and i share his books and every now and then we will poke each other to read aloud a phase that is just too eloquent to remain silent your heart belongs to me does not disappoint it is another winner,47,113
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have enjoyed every koontz book written until now as publishers weekly notes this one is a major miss the main parts of the book flow well but the conclusion leaves just about every issue open endings do not always have to be positive but this ending is miserable i read the final chapter three times to see if i was missing something i went back to tried to tie in other chapters no links i will probably buy the next koontz book but my advice even to fans would be to skip this one,95,114
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i have always enjoyed novels by dean koontz and until the ending i felt the same about this one i loved the suspense and the medical twist as well as the romance i did feel as did several other reviewers that the ending was preachy and perhaps made the point that wealthy people are always self-centered and deserving of bad luck i truly pitied the protagonist of this story everybody loves an underdog and so do i however we need to remember that many wealthy people have paid a great sacrifice to achieve their success and to enjoy their demise is simply unkind and un-american lynette fleming coauthor of lunch buddies buddy up for a better diet,119,115
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love dean koontz i think i have 90 of his books but i was disappointed in this one the story just does not seem to go anywhere until 3/4 through the book and the characters are not very compelling skip it,42,116
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,my title actually says it all i found the book a compelling read until koontz revealed what had actually been going on without the reader having been given necessary information along the way sorry that is bad writing,36,117
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,having read everything this author has written although not finished with the book as yet i know it will satisfy,20,118
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,the characters were stilted the writing was stilted the premise was stilted hated hated hated the ending i felt that i had wasted my time and my money,26,119
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,tedious is to kind the book is a complete bore i expect more from the man who wrote dark rivers of the heart,23,120
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,dean koontz has been a favorite of mine for years but this book was such a disappointment i got through about 2/3 of it before i just did not bother going on there was a plodding story plot a not to likable hero and a very undeveloped love interest luckily i just borrowed it from my library where i waited for a few weeks until a copy became available i pity any koontz fan who actually laid out good money for this book,82,121
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,dean koontz is by far one of my favorite authors but this recent contribution is almost an insult to his body of work i tried to like this book i really did but the descriptions are just overwhelming and the plot and characters underwhelming you do not need page after page explaining how the light reflected through a pepper trees leaves or how the sun dappled across a window pain to reveal yet even more reflections enough get to the story when the story finally pulled through there really was not much of it a story more adaptable to a daytime soap than anything but despite me not enjoying this book i know even more die hard fans than me will read it as well so i will not post any spoilers mr koontz your absolutely amazing this just does not have the magic you normally exhibit,143,122
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,well this is not spooky koontz of the 80s or 90s nor the more intriguingly bittersweet adventures of odd thomas but the new koontz exploring mortality and ambiguity similar in tone to stephen kings duma key the story starts out with ryan the 30 year-old dotcom millionaire having fun with living his life he falls in love with the driven writer sam an identical twin whose sister died and here his trouble starts sam is just not that into him then the mysterious physical symptoms start to anyone who has faced life-threatening illness you can identify with the fear suspicion need for control well ryan steps up to take charge with the bestaround all the while feeling something is not quite right well you have to read to see that indeed all was not quite right but the story evolves and you are left wondering what was going really going on what was the subtext of the story as sam the writer would say the book gets high marks for chronicling ryans introspections the development of mystery and revelation but the ending a bit hard to believe still well worth reading,190,123
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this book is the most inane piece of tripe from koontz yet and that is saying a lot since i think it is been a while since he has produced a good book i swore after the last one that i would not waste my money on his latest yet i succumbed never again i found myself skimming over pages and pages of this book that just had descriptions and idle musings on what the wind the menacing trees the weird noises that never amounted to anything and as others have noted there are so many things that are brought up and never resolved not only is there no plot and no character development but this just does not make a whole lot of sense in the end it is disappointing to me how low koontz has sunk I have read all of his books and i still re-read some of his earlier ones one of his books lightning is my favorite book ever as is one of his short stories strange highways what happened to the koontz who wrote those bring him back please or just stop writing altogether mr koontz do not sucker your faithful readers into wasting their money on drivel like this just stop,200,124
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have to begin by saying that i have always been a huge fan of dean koontz going way back to whispers and have rarely been disappointed not this time around what a dopey book while i will give him credit for roping me in from the very beginning the book eventually falls flat very flat the ending is beyond lame there are always dogs to wash stables to paint lawns to mow did he really say that at huge eye roll here truth be known i do not know how this book got published i guess they figure koontz can slap his name on anything and it will sell this may be true up to a point but anymore like this and fans will begin dropping like flies save your money,129,125
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,this was the first time i had ever read a dean koontz novel i used to read horror novels before i became a christian but i have not read any in over 20 years i was impressed by the vocabulary and excellent poetic descriptions although both slowed my reading speed guess I am rusty i was not too spooked by the book the worst parts for me were spencers apartment and the violence near the end those parts were quite creepy but that is to be expected in a horror / suspense novel at the very end of the book do not read this if you do not want me to give a large chunk of the end away the author missed the point of life and faith and all that and i am going to write to him and tell him nicely where he went wrong it is my privilege to witness to him and tell him no one can redeem oneself by good works if we could do that jesus would not have had to die on the cross right it is his righteousness imputed to us that we need in order to be saved yeah,192,126
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,definitely not the best koontz book I have read it is slightly depressing undertones are not the biggest reason why you should not undertake a read the minuscule character development and lack of an engrossing plot line however are,37,127
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i am an avid dean koontz fan and eagerly await each newly published book in your heart belongs to me the author introduces too many eerie unexplained events that he never really ties into the ending i found the ending very annoying that ryan decided to do what he did ryan was after all an innocent victim he really did not know that anything was not on the up and up regarding his heart transplant and given the ending there was no reason to introduce some of the creepier events that took place earlier in the book like the eerie rapping ryan heard or the feeling of deja vu he felt at the church in denver all in all a very forgettable book,122,128
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is funny i just finished reading duma key by stephen king before reading this book i thought to myself how wonderful it is that king can still write a fully fleshed out novel like duma key and how i have become increasing dissapointed in koontz efforts to do the same and after reading this book i feel even more so that his recent books feel like the work of a lazy writer or one who does not have the discipline anymore to really get down into it and produce rich complex stories i kind of liked his dogl book last year but that may be becuase i love dogs he is certainly off his game these days,117,129
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am a huge koontz fan and rushed to buy this book when in was first released i read the short synopsis of the book on the back cover and then began to read the back of the book basically told me everything the first half of the book was about i felt that there should have been a warning on the book that if you read the dust cover please skip to the second half of the book for the rest of the story in a nutshell i did not enjoy this book at all and hope that when relentless is released in the spring it will redeem koontz and make all of his fans as happy as he usually makes them,122,130
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,it was riveting until the end i did not like the ending of the story,15,131
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is time for this writer to retire and start spending some of his money and stop pretending he has anything more to say what a waste of time,28,132
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,to this point I have read everything dean koontz has written that being said it seems like with the last few books he has just been going through the motions of writing and your heart belongs to me is a prime example a largely unsympathetic main character contrived plot and overtly preachy tone pervading the book made this the first dean koontz book i have regretted reading please dean abandon the multi-book-per-year business plan and get back to crafting the intricate and thoroughly polished prose your fans expect I shall take quality over quantity anytime,92,133
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a huge fan of dean koontz books he had me hooked when i was back in high school and i read phantoms it kept me awake for three nights over the last few years his books have taken a new direction and feel and I have enjoyed that maybe because I am growing older and my taste in reading material is changing with me but like another reader i look foward to every spring and fall for a new book from dean and this time i had to force myself through the book got to the end and wound up saying huh I am not sure i get it this is not to say i will not keep reading his books but i have to say in all these last years this is my least favorite of his books hopefull and waiting for the next one,141,134
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as always dean koontz has kept me glued to the book till the end i almost did not want to pick up the book because i knew i would not be able to put it down till i was finished i was right great story great suspense,46,135
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i used to love dean koontzs books unfortunately i do not think he has written a good one since the first christopher snow this book was simply awful i do not plan on reading the next one he writes,37,136
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i spent the first half of this book not liking the main character why was he so paranoid can someone tell me and why did it take so loooooooooooong to get to a simple point the first half of the book can be summed up in a sentance he has a girlfriend he gets sick then goes all paranoid unfounded the reason was never made clear and uses his money to invade the privacy of almost everyone he knows was i supposed to like him also his girlfriend what was the point of her character she seemed so angsty but why why did they breakup is there a point here this seems like what i kept repeating as i read i got so fed up with the book that i went trolling for spoilers to see if this was going anywhere i found out that it does not i will not likely finish it by far my least favorite koontz book awful anti-climactic at best save your money,167,137
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,how about mr koontz whittle down part one into about half the length what a waste of pages wandering and going what you hope is somewhere but by part 2 realize was just a bunch of filler to get to a ho hum ending in part 3 urg guess he needed some extra cash,51,138
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a big fan of dean koontz but i can not recommend this book to anyone unless they are trapped on a deserted island and there simply is nothing else available to read too much mystic philosophical rambling too many loose ends that were never really resolved and an ending that was unsatisfying do not waste your time and please mr koontz return to the thriller genre that is your forte,69,139
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this book was a waste of time from beginning to end it seems that becoming a best selling author gives you a license to write junk like this,28,140
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book there were some unexpected twists dean knows how to entertain his readers i could not put it down he is one of my favorite authors this guy knows how to grab your attention i will read this book again,43,141
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,can a man be greedy if he is happy with his life ryan perry has great wealth a beautiful girl friend that he keeps trying to convince to marry him but when he is told that he has maybe a year to live unless he has a heart transplant his life changes is it a genetic fault or is there a sinister reason for his heart problems using his wealth he begins to hunt for the truth trouble is that he misses a truth that is the most important one of all a year after the transplant strange things begin to happen gifts begin appearing inside his ultra secure home all with the same message your heart belongs to me and i want it back it is not till the end that he finds the truth that he missed and it is not a pretty one again mr koontz has given me something to really enjoy as well as something to think about,161,142
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read every single book dean koontz has ever written and i will continue to do so but i have to make a comment on this one it was terrible i know it did not follow the same themes as his others books and that is okay i like variety but i think he was trying to get in the popular mainstream and write books like other popular authors jodie picoult-change of heart i am not sure what he was trying to do but this book was not well written the book left so many things hanging so many loose ends so many things were brought up in the book and you never know why no excitement thrill very little chemistry between the two main characters and dean is usually so much better at that i love dean koontz please write the next frankenstein novel I am still a fan just did not like this one,152,143
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a huge dean koontz fan I have read 50 of his works and look forward to many more i got this book for christmas and plowed through it pretty quickly I am not sure i let everything sink in the first time this is a very interesting koontz and a little different from a lot of his the protagonist ryan is a complex character and the story is told with a very tight focus around him many things go on in the beginning to middle of the book that really are not understood until the end and even then you should not be expecting the answers to slap you in the face the understanding of these things is more deep and subtle than a cursory reading will at first reveal it is there and readers should dwell on the meaning of this one a bit overall this would not be my first recommendation to someone new to koontz but a good read for someone looking for something worthy of deeper consideration than the typical industry thriller there has not a ton of action but more psychologically taut scenes that flow one to another thank you very much dean for another top-notch novel for thinking readers,202,144
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am a big dean koontz fan but this book was a real let down it was contrived and full of cliches i listened to the audio book and not only was the writing sub par but the narration was poor if you want a good dean koontz audio book get life expectancy,53,145
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i think I have read every book koontz has written in the last 20 years has it been that long i continue to buy his new books because of how much I have loved the stories along the way at this point however i am going to re-consider surely stop putting out the money for the fresh hardback unless it is of the odd series those are both classic koontz and yet a very fresh take this story just did not grip me at all and i rely on koontz for that type of effect i did not find his prose nearly as evocative as has been his standard and the characterizations were very limited in scope i was definitely disappointed,114,146
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,not recommended I am an avid koontz fan but not of fare like this disappointing plot was good story was too politically correct money is evil pleassse,30,147
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i just finished koontzs book your heart belongs to me i kept reading and reading thinking it would surely get better maybe even make sense the only cents it finally made was for mr koontzs bank account this book is horrible if koontzs name was not associated with this book the publishers and public would be laughing at this work of words please do not waste your time and money on this hogwash that said if you truly must read it get it from a source that will not cost you a penny trust me on this,94,148
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i will not be long winded i normally really enjoy dean koontz however this was just outright poor the plot was weak it felt like he changed his mind half way through as to the direction of the book i will carry on reading him but i wish we could get some more christopher snow or odd thomas soon i also adored twilight eyes wish that had been followed up as well,75,149
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,another dean knootzs novel i enjoyed it kept me in suspense until the very end dean knootz did it again written another novel i really enjoyed i highly recommend if you enjoy dean knootz or suspense novels,37,150
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting through this he is starting to get too philosophical like stephen king not much ever happened definitely not the usualof your seat page turner like usual i was disappointed with this like i was disappointed with stephen kings duma key only worse it was the 2nd time in my life i considered not finishing a book,64,151
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a big koontz fan but this ones a dud perhaps koontz filled it with his own personal meaning but it does not make it through to the reader and i really do not care to reread the darn thing to search for worth i hope mr koontz has not decided he knows better than any editor he will end up writing worthless best-sellers if he stays on this path,66,152
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I have read every single dean koontz book and I have loved most of them i really did not like this book it may be his worst one yet i did not care for either of the main characters the book started off promising but the last portion of the books was so contrived that it was a real let-down the ending was a real disappointment,63,153
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a big dean koontz fan but this one just does not work the premise was a great one and i looked forward to reading the story but it drags from the start this is the first time I have actually skimmed over paragraphs in a koontz novel and the intertwining of supernatural with reality just does not fit together this time the story picked up a bit post-transplant more than half-way through the book although but the ending is a major disappointment no spoilers here but there are certain events that just do not make sense the supernatural seemed out of place and the ending itself is extremely unrealistic and unfulfilling koontz can do much better and hopefully next time he will,120,154
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i read with great enthusiasm jumpy exited riveted and then what happened thud you forgot what you were doing too many loose ends no reason for spirits you forgot to end the story,31,155
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read every koontz book out even all the old ones in my opinion he has gotten better with age until this book it never seemed to come together at all and the ending sucked,33,156
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,your heart belongs to me surpassed my expectations that were low due to some poor reviews that i had read about this book i thought that the plot of this book was exceptional it was mysterious i had nohow the book would end without giving away details I shall just say that i liked where koontz went with this book take a chance on this one i am glad that i did,73,157
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i listened to the unabridged audio version of this book koontz has been right on the top his game the last few years churning out one terrific spellbinder after another however he stumbles with this one the initial plot line is intriguing but there are so many loose ends left untied that i acutally wondered if i was missing part of the audio program it would have been better to leave out some of the distracting but ultimately irrelevant plot twists and kept this one to short story length,89,158
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it was hard to believe this was a dean koontz book the story never really grabs you i did not care about the characters and kept wondering where is this all going it is all over the place not what i expected no one bats 1000 so with the amount of times he comes to bat and delivers i guess we can forgive him,62,159
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,dean koontz usually writes great books but this surely was not one of them this one spun around and around and never seemed to find it is center red herrings were all over as ryan flit around from place to place in his very own special jet being a very special rich person so did the story line suspense built and then it just crashed and burned dead bodies sealed in acrylic and on display as sculptures a hippie father monks jet setting life style of a spoiled dot com guru identical twins harvesting organs poisions a panic room chinese secret agents ghostlike appearances of long dead nurses special needs children security systems edgar allen poe i will pray for you ouch this novel was all over the place enough all ready,129,160
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,absolutely loved this book could not wait to get into my car every day on the way to work to hear the next chapters on the book dean koontz kept me fascinated from start to finish with the great descriptive emotions running throughout the dialogue in the book and the surprise ending definitely a good story to keep you entertained the narrator had a very good connection to the heart of the story,72,161
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,mr koontz does his own variation on the stalker thriller i do not recall another of his previous novels with this plot line which is good since lately some seem to repeat the same theme this reminded me of misery by king only in that it explored the disturbing twisted mind of a stalker who becomes obsessed with someone as usual deans humor is laugh-out-loud funny and the suspense builds and builds and grabs you by the throat until you are gasping for a breath koontz is hands down the best psychological thriller writer this country has produced his prose nears poetry at times and his insight into the human dilemma is unparalleled watchers,116,162
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,if i could even begin to author a book laughing out loud i would probably want to get the all over the board type of reviews that this book seems to be getting it is a thrilling and keeps you guessing type of book i have to admit it is a little confusing at the end and i can see why some would be disappointed since the ending does strech it alittle bit overall although it is a great book with some frays at the sides of the fabric but overall worth the read,90,163
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like others here i have read most of koontzs books and enjoy them this book however was a major disappointment i can only assume he cranked this book out for the holiday season due date there is no subtext to this review posting inside joke if you have read the book I shall state it plainly wait for the paperback or borrow this book from someone do not waste your money the story starts out interesting it grabs you but does not deliver in the end the characters are not well developed the story is choppy and implausible the surprises and twists are simply ommissions in the plot narrative that are revealed at the end not every book a great modern author writes is a great book i understand that what bothers me is what i perceive is the seemingly obvious reduced effort or rush for a book to meet a deadline or satisfy a publishing contract sorry dean if this was not the case I am making excuses for you i know but i hope it was the reason for this lackluster effort,179,164
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i look forward with high anticipation every fall and spring for the new dean koontz book the night before it comes out in stores i can barely sleep and I have even called in sick to work when i get my copy of deans lateset book your heart belongs to me was very disappointing i did not even want to finish it but i did out of loyalty to dean it has to be the only book of his i did not thoroughly enjoy sorry dean,83,165
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this book was so promising until it fell completely flat it was as if the last 50 pages or so were taken from another story that just did not fit my mother recommended this book to me as she had just purchased it and was halfway through it i finished it and picked up the phone my mother knew i was reading the story and when she answered all she said was I am so sorry i did not know how bad it was until i finished it last night i love many genres of books and will read almost anything i hope the next book by koontz that i read has at least a fitting ending to a good story,118,166
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have been a koontz fan since day one but this one just did not keep me fascinated and i really did not like the ending it felt like koontz did not really know what to do with the characters and so basically took the easy way,44,167
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was discussing with my wife how great funhouse and intenisity were i can not say the same for the last few books as far as your heart belongs to me koontz has let me down as a reader i was full blown interested until the last what 3 pages koontz books should end with a bang not a whimper with the exception of the first odd thomas book they ended with little to enjoy i was excited to read a non-odd book i guess i can not express in words my displeasure of the ending of this book and i consider myself one of koontz best fans,103,168
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,your heart belongs to me by dean koontz is a pretty good thrill ride from this talented and seasoned writer i have read many of his books this one reminded me of his older books which i prefer the characters are likable and the twist ending is nicely done this is not a perfect suspense novel but i enjoyed this story than some of koontzs more recent ones the main character ryan perry goes through many changes in his life and i think he learns lessons that others would not be able to tackle with such grace check this book out sometime enjoy,102,169
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,koontzs your heart belongs to me comes at the precise time that americans are grappling with the realization that they may have played a part in the meltdown of the global economy greed takes many forms and for those of us who play by the rules it is hard to assume responsibility for the breakdown of such a huge entityby such crafty manipulators but koontz does a masterful job in illuminating how the five roots of violence can play an insipid role in our lives so through the journey that protagonist ryan perry takes to self-awareness we see in ourselves how a cultural psyche can mislead us to believe that more is better and at any cost and while this tale is not about wall street it is a testament to the power of those human failings of lust envy anger avarice and vengeance and worst of all the denial of truth thought-provoking as always another must read from dean koontz,162,170
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,for a dean koontz book 4 out of 5 is actually not that good buy it but in paperback or kindle save your hardback money i was so excited to get my copy downloaded to my kindle the day it came out and even made sure i had time to really sit down and devour my new koontz book i have to say i was a little disappointed maybe it is that I have read everything written since the late 70s thanks public library and I have become a bit spoiled by the genius that is dean koontz the whole withholding where the transplant took place and the shallow girlfriend really bothered me and the ismay clemm thing was wonderful but not worked out fully i felt i have to say by the end i almost wanted ryan to get shot in the end and take the whining girlfriend with him but maybe that was the point a hero we do not want to like but do not worry dean I shall still be getting my pre-ordered copy of your books because frankly i think you would make a math textbook sound interesting,185,171
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i will not bother to provide any detail about this book it was a total waste of time the only line i can recall was that a poet said sleep is a little death i expectantly wait for the next book,41,172
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have been a koontz fan for many many years i have been reading and collecting koonts books since i was about 12 i think in the last few years i feel like some of the magic has left deans writings between the really thin plots and the collaborations and the plots that tie up in only a few pages i have been disappointed for at least a few recent books that having been said i think this books is pretty good i give the book 4 stars because it is a return to his previous form his writing was descriptive and thrilling and the ending was unexpected,107,173
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i was disappointed with his last book which seemed to be more of an effort to write a book than a product of inspiration and i thought went to the odd thomas well one time too often not this one this is koontz back with all his creative juices spinning out twists and turns reverses and double reverses an unusual love story where the intimacy becomes less but the true love becomes more intense it was refreshing to share the life of a dot com billionaire for a change instead of the good simple poor odd thomas but the evil is the same truely wicked and twisted the moral is better check where your new body parts came from you might not want them if you know a truely weird truely koontz book and even with a surprise feel good ending good job,145,174
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,wow shockingly bad novel I have read them all and this is easily one of his worst it is awful on pretty much every level plot characters depth you name it I am glad i got this from the library instead of wasting my money I am starting to fear that dk has written all his good books already because i have not enjoyed a koontz novel in a long time,66,175
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like so many of the writers i am a huge dean koontz fan that is one reason why this was so disappointing he is all over in this book and it appears he did not know what genre he wanted to write in there is the spooky atmospheric beginning the gentle love story the psychological mayhem and the violence you find in his other books but they do not go together in this book it just jumps all over the place and the deus ex machina explaining it all is just too bizarre for even him out of the clear blue sky comes a reason for everything that is been going on and it was not even a good explanation it is like violet is pulled out of another book and stuck in to wrap it all up i was really disappointed i wasted my time on this book,143,176
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i kept waiting for the story to build to a climax and be resolved but it never did no climax no resolution yet when i finished i felt satisfied think odd thomas not midnight,34,177
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i purchased the audio version of this book expecting it to be well worth the price nearly 1/2 of this book was so incredibly boring that i wondered why i did not wait to read the reviews instead of pre-ordering if I had rented the book I had have given up i wasted my money so why waste my time if it had been any other author I had have quit rating it with 2 stars but not recommending it to anyone that might expect it to be anywhere near the excellence of mr koontz previous books,93,178
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have read a number of koontzs books although admittedly not all of the ones I have read this is my favorite and the easiest read of all i love a good scare and started reading his books for the shiver although not of the horror genre this one did not disappoint i got all the thrills and chills I had hoped for and it carried me through a number of other emotions i was not expecting i would have given it five stars but it left me floundering at one point and i felt that part might have been handled differently but then that is my perspective over all a stellar read i definitely recommend it,111,179
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,warning spoilers below i have a hard time believing acould be so stupid and shallow as ryan he supposedly researched transplants so how could he have believed he was on an international donor list and not be suspicious when he gets a heart after 1 month in shanghai his security firm supposedly researched dr hobb and did not mention anything fishy also too may loose ends what about dr death and justice for ismay whom koontz strongly implied was murdered lastly is running an orphanage really supposed to make up for buying a heart from a murdered political prisoner,101,180
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,having tossed aside koontzs novels since the husband it was with great hestitation that i purchased this novel i was curious to see how he would rebound after the odd series and his previous tedious dog story i was surprised and happy to find i actually finished this one and while it lagged in several places it held my interest koontz defintely did his homework about heart transplants and cardiomyopathy so for those interested in such it gave a glimpse of the disease i was a bit confused with some of the early apparitions and other strange happenings in his home but when i put that aside i found i wanted to know the outcome all in all this novel is more like the old dean koontz although somewhat flawed and confusing at times my rating is based on the moral of his story one we all need to take to heart in these times,155,181
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,a rare miss by dean koontz far too much buildup and not enough payoff,14,182
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,while reading this book i thought there was going to be a great payoff at the end there just had to be after pages and pages of filler i would not even bother to read the first part of the book as it has nothing to do with anything after the transplant there were too many loose ends to count the ending was very unsatisfactory why is it that a whole nation plus countless others were responsible for the big bad thing koontzs villain only blames the rich hero i also find it very unlikely once the hero figures everything out his life is changed so profoundly i think we are at the start of a new political correctness being ashamed of and having to apologize for being rich,128,183
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i liked this book koontz earlier books were his best and the odd series i found tedious but this one is more like it i enjoyed very much and it kept my attention i know when a book is good when i can not put it down until i have finished it I am still waiting for frankenstein 3,57,184

Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,the book offered many practice tests thatto successfully passing the afoqt however it did not offer suggestions on how to improve on sections that proved challenging all in all this is a great resource to help prepare for the afoqt,41,1
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,this manual provided valid study material to prep any potential military officer for the officer qualifying exams along with provide excellent practive exams to test ones timed test taking abilities however it does not cover absolutely every aspect of military knowledge specific to each branch of service,47,2
Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,this book is great for preparing for the officer candidate tests one important thing to note is that it does not contain any of the sections that only pertain to flight or other specialty scores it only contains sections related to math vocabulary and more that will be on all of the tests,52,3
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,you are better off researching free information online this book is total waste of money if you need something specific like i did then this book is not the way to go this book gives you a basic at best outline of becoming an officer for each of the branches you can get more information by visiting the respective websites if you are looking at this book as a study guide which is why i bought the book originally do not you can find more valuable information simply surfing the web and that is free the only thing i can say about this books is i want a refund,106,4

Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,this book is the best book i have ever used even better than the sat guidebook like the title i am not lying is the best and most knowledgeable book i ever used it explains everything you need to know for the military tests and how to be an officer of the us armed forces the greatest military in the world and even better than pr china the book isin detail and covers everything you need to know if you want to be an officer in the us army navy air force marines or coast guard so i recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be an officer for the armed forces of the united states of america and i hope everyone uses this book because everyone should join the military it is your american duty to do so nevertheless this is a good book and i encourage everyone to buy it because you will not be sorry and it will also be one of the best investment you make in your life,175,6
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,for most people attempting to get into ocs occ or the like this book will be valuable to you however i will give you this much this book is great for the standard officer testing in that it covers what is basically the officer equivalent of the asvab however if you are applying to the air force or if you are interested in being a pilot buy arcos military flight aptitude test book officer tests like the afoqt are desgined to check for pilot and navigator candidacy so it is recommended that if you are looking into a job like that or are applying to a branch like that then i recommend that book however if you are joing the army marines or navy and instead are interested in other fields this book will give you the chance you need to succeed,142,7

Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this book because there are a lot of errors in it i found the newer edition and was disappointed to see the same typos in it this was particularly upsetting because the typos that i noticed are in the math sections although i am sure they are elsewhere too it is unfortunate there are few resources to choose from for this topic the explanations in the math section are also poorly written i am honestly worried about the real exam because this book gives me very little guidance,93,11
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,the book is a good resource for practice before military officer candidate test amazon however did not carry the book but still charged my bank account i have requested a refund and get the usual we only charge for what we send I shall tell you they charge for what you order and put the responsability of proving otherwise on the consumer this was the first and last time i will use amazon i also encourge others to shop elsewhere,80,12
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,as some of the other reviews have already stated there are multiple math answers that are simply incorrect and arguably a few verbal questions as well although verbal questions are naturally more subjective for the math problems the book does not explain the logic behind any formulas used rather than helping you understand the material it wants you just to memorize it questions and explanations in the verbal section are equally confusing and illogical on the mechanical section many of the diagrams have printing problems making it difficult to answer any question involving measurements circuitry and more regarding problems where you have to identify the correct tool the explanation tells you what the correct tool is and it is function but explains nothing about the other tools and their functions therefore unless the same question comes up on the real exam you are likely to get it wrong again bottom line for the math / verbal sections you are better off with a gre or sat prep book and for the mechanical section try to get ahold of a high school physics textbook the arco book is good only for the practice exams which you can take under timed conditions,193,13
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,when i got this book i thought that i would help me prepare for the afoqt as best as possible thank goodness i thought about getting the sat book as well the only things this book showed was the type of questions that you may have on the test along with the answers for the math portion it did not show the steps thatto the answer just the answer itself i recommend that you study the sat book in preparation for the test it explained why the answer was the correct one and it even gave you formulas that you may have forgotten for those of you who have been out of school for a while like myself it also stated hints as to how to take the test the officer candidate test book did none of this the sat book was a big help the oct book was a waste of money,155,14
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,i bought this book because i thought it is prepare me for the test the reality is other the book was not good i took the astb test for navy officer and the test is completly difference,36,15
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,a screw has 8 threads per inch and amust travel 2 inches along it how many revolutions must the handle make 16 right the book says 18 with no explanation of the mysterious missing threads do you have to spin a couple of times to get going in short the explanations stink the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps and there is not enough background material or pointers to references the entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the navy used there is no online companion to this not even an errata so the authors could point out some of their mistakes i take this exam next week and I am scared,137,16
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i studied this book inside out and learned the hard way that it was worthless try the sat or gmat for real help,23,17
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,this book is great for those who do better on batteries that they can actually see or practice with prior to test day i was able to take a number of sample quizes and it really let me know on what to work or focus after using this book and the military flight aptitude test book from the same publisher i scored over 90 in each section of the afoqt so the practice works however other books would come in handy since this book only provides reviews of the tests and samples with no instruction on concepts as other reviewers have said a book which explains certain math problems or english theory would help those who find they are lacking after taking a couple of this books sample tests i would agree that an sat book might be helpful as a companion also the verbal portion of the real afoqt is much more complicated than the examples given here so make sure you are a good reader and adept at pulling meaning out of passages so again brush up on basic skills with another book but practice with this one good luck,192,18
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,out of 16 subtests of the afoqt this book provides practice only on the 6 academic ones with very few practice problems with even skimpier explanations the only reason arco is still managing to publish this rip-off is because they have no competition the most you will get for your money is a goodof what sort of questions they will ask and how well you can expect to do in the allotted time for each subtest but you can get that for free on the net for serious study purposes i strongly recommend you spend some quality time with barrons sat study guide i scored phenomenally well on the afoqt and i owe it all to barron,117,19
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i bought both this book and military flight aptitude tests to prepare for my naval officer specimen battery i think that this book is nowhere near as helpful as the other even if you do not want to be a pilot the other guide is much more comprehensive,47,20
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,this is an excellent book i danced in college and competed at the open bronze level but my husband had never danced and this book gave us both the skills to become better dancers everything is covered in this book timing body flight technique styling and figures this is a must have book for anyone who really wants to know how to ballroom dance so many books are just lists of steps with no attention to styling and technique but not this one anybody can learn footwork patterns but that does not make you a dancer this book has all the information you need to really dance i just want jeff allen to write a sequel,115,0
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,jeff allen has really outdone himself with this one the complete idiots guide to ballroom dancing is so comprehensive but so simple that even an absolute beginner will feel comfortable on the dance floor in no time at all wayne,42,1
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,not only did the book come to me without the cd which was supposed to be included but the information provided was in no way intended to be understood by the novice ballroom dance idiot i do not consider myself to be an idiot but did not find the information in this book helpful to me and there was no promised cd included,63,2
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,extremely disappointed for not only getting the kindle version did not include cd contents which of course makes the book useless but also instruction guide cards attached to the front cover were missing,33,3
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,it is another useful entry in the series that will help you learn the dances an experienced partner is an excellent addition,22,4
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,the book was well written with interesting facts and background information it also had plain simple dancebyiillustrations,20,5
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,good information in the book but i did not find any value in the dvd i would have found the book much harder to interpret if i had not had previous dance lessons,31,6
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,it was no help at all no diagrams not a lot of instrutional info and i would not recommend it,20,7
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,for a friend that really loves ball room dancing has has been able to take several classes in the past,20,8
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,the book was all i thought it would be in a good condition for used the dvd plays well and easy to use all in all it was a great buy and a huge saving,37,9
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,i have found that reading about a subject is of little value you must perform the subject matter and repeat it many times over a dvd that demonstrates the actual foot moves is by far more helpful i have found the vicki regan dvds to bet the best because they show you the steps many times over with and without music trust me i am a pure amatuer on the dance floor but watching vicki and her partner show every move in stages i can duplicate them I am still no fred astaire but i guarantee you that watching the regan dvds will put you on the dance floor i have fox trot waltz rhumba swing and niteclub dvds I am still not brave enough to venture into tango mambo or any of the extreme latin dances yet,135,10
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,a good choice for beginners who want to get started in a wide variety of dances only a fewpatterns are given for each dance but these are well explained the dvd was helpful when visualizing the steps for those interested primarily in waltz fox trot and tango got to ballroom is a better choice,55,11
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,I am just starting lessons and thought this book which i found in the library would be a great reinforcement i think I am a bit premature but that is not the books fault the problem is that there seem to be many variants of the basicand the book does not always do what my instructor did i expect that as i get more practice this will be a non-problem the book is very wordy but that is because the chapters are each very complete i think it is not to hard to skip forwardc and then go back for the finer details however the library copy came with a cd with nice music the edition amazon sent has a dvd which seems pretty useless each topic seems to be about 6 second long and they slide into each other it is not easy to watch two people dancing for six seconds and pick up the footwork especially when the segments are not labelled on the screen as they come up and have of them are a bit blurry which may be to indicate speed or to give the scene a dreamy look a better dvd would have been helpful but the book stands on it is own,205,12
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,if you want to merely shuffle your feet and do the bunny-hop this is not the book for you get something else if you want to learn how to really dance this is the best book there is allen is true to his craft and does not compromise on his instruction to learn you have to read the appropriate chapter of his book watch the appropriate section of the dvd and practice again and again nobody can take something that is inherently complex and difficult and spoon feed it to you in five minutes but everything you need is right there jeff allen takes his craft seriously,106,13
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,i normally love the idiot books I have used them for years and love the straight forward approach i was very dissapointed in this book the writting is convoluted even with careful reading sometimes as many as 10 times i am not sure what he is describing or what i should do i suspect people that are decent dancers may find useful information here if you are learning to dance skip this one you do not get to any of the dance steps until almost halfway through the book and are very poorly described he refers constantly to the dvd that comes with it he should have just made a video maybe then we could have figured out what he meant,118,14
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,if you are able learn by reading through pages ofbyinstructions then this is great however if you are a visual learner like myself this book will be painful the dvd is not helpful it does have a lof of helpful information but this complete idiot just could not get into this book going to take it back,59,15
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,the text is way way too wordy it could have been edited to a tenth of it is length without any loss of content the actual instruction is far too detailed to follow in any meaningful way and the accompanying dvd is poorly organized the video clips are far too brief and the blurry fade-ins are very distracting as you can tell i was not happy with this purchase,68,16
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,this book uses a lot of words but fails to make clear how to master a dancedisappointing it makes a good coffee table book one leg was shorter than the rest,33,17
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,this book will take you through the basic patterns of popular social dances and does a fairly adept job of doing so this is purely a footwork book as there is little mention of styling but for the absolute novice it will get you out on the dance floor i particularly enjoyed the section on rhythm and the emphasis that dancing is about doing the same motion the exact same way every time so you do not really have to have rhythm to dance you just need to perform the same motion the same way consistently i have a friend struggling with this same issue in his dancing and recommended this book to him with the practice exercises included to help him improve all in all a well written book for the novice dancer and one i recommend,137,18
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,if you are taking lessons and are serious about putting some hard work into learning how to dance then this book is a great resource as a 50-ish beginner i loved the background information but did skip ahead to the lessons only to come back later and see how important the background and foundations were like anything else there are no shortcuts if you want a quality result you are not going to pick this book up and be dancing in a week any more than you could learn to paint a landscape or play the piano in a week dancing is music art and body control idiots it takes practice one suggestion i would like to have seen some footwork diagrams as many idiots like myself need a visual diagram in addition to photos and the lengthydescriptions,140,19
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,to bo honest i have not read much of the book i started dance classes ballroom and latin about 2months ago and i am able to pick up the moves pretty fast because i love it so i focussed more on the cd here which i was very impressed with it was more than i expected to find covering a few basics two or three patterns per dance having a little knowledge of dance already it was a nice review and practise however to thos of you that are interested in the book you will find explanations for both the man and womans steps and also pictures as guidelines covering waltz foxtrot tango viennese waltz rumba merengue samba cha-cha mambo east coast swing that is a good spread for your money of course the cd is necessary to also help explain,137,20
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,it really is a helpful guide I am all for the idiots,12,21
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,i am fortunate to have the author jeff allen an my dance instructor jeffs book is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to master the art of ballroom dancing he meticulously breaks down every movement andin order to allow his reader to quickly become familiar with the various dances there is no other book on ballroom dancing that i have read which even comes close to what this book has to offer the dvd that is included is also an excellent visual tool,85,22
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,this book was different from what i was led to believe it is a detailed sophisticated and comprehensive not idiots guide to ballroom dancing i am enjoying the book but the history and background and then the technical foundation the book lays in finally getting to the actual dance steps are more for the serious student who is not an idiot this is clearly a serious book written by a serious dance teacher for serious students who are not idiots,81,23
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,I have had this book for 3 years now and at the same time I have been taking weekly ballroom dance classes i thought that as i got more hands-on instruction i would feel more comfortable with the instructional part of the book i never did now that i am far more advanced than what is taught in the book i still feel a bit confused trying to figure out what the author trying to teach ok some maybe I am an idiot but if i am then this book should be geared to me if there were an accompanying dvd then i think it would be much better,106,24
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,i really ordered the book to get some ideas to help some friends learn to dance i took dancing in college but am afraid we cheated on some of the movements i think this book will help me crips up some of my movements positions and give me a refresher on some of the dances i love to do latin but my husband does not with this book i believe we may become the next fred and ginger,77,25
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,this book has some great material and it is history bits are good but if you just want some hints on learning to dance there is way too much stuff you have to wade through before you get to anything about dancing you are half way through the book before you get to the actual dance steps and too much stuff you have to wade through around each dance if you want lots of history and detail this is the book for you if you want to get down to dancing it has some good info in it but it takes a lot of work to find it,109,26
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,i wanted a book that i can grow with the complete idiots guide to ballroom dancing fits the bill the first sentence of each and every dance pattern start with simple phrases likeforward with your left footto the side with your right foot close your left foot to your right foot certainly anyone can follow thesedescriptions then if you want to grow with more techniques it is all there right in front of you if your taking lessons this book has to be the best reference guide anywhere you can practice your basics without forgetting what you did in class allen has produced a terrific preconceived notebook for all level of dancers buy it you will love it and the book will grow with you,129,27
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,what i wanted were easybylessons but what i found were verbose and complex explanations the dvd was the only redeeming feature as it provided a good beat for the dances unfortunately being an incomplete idiot i had no steps to do,45,28
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,the professionals who have been reviewing this may love it but the book is definitely not for beginners it devotes pages and pages to posture breathing technique history and other such topics but precious little on the basics of what steps to dance when after 14 chapters he finally starts teaching you how to dance it is almost incomprehensible this guy does not know how to give simple instructions that most people will understand if you are new to ballroom dancing do not buy this book it will be of little help,90,29
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,this is a classic romance novel not an adventure story as we might expect from uris while the story of the early days of the marince corps is interesting and very well researched there is virtually no action i strongly suspect in spite of no official word from the uris camp that this book was finished by others re-read earlier works for your uris fix and pass this one by,70,0
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,i had never seen this book in the days when uris was popular it is a little departure from his normal style but an excellent story well worth the read,30,1
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,this is a wonderful book one would never guess what a difficult beginning the great united states marine corps had this book will be liked by all readers who enjoy military history it is also a wonderful love story,39,2
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,i have long been a fan of leon iris this book is not his best but it certainly is readable and an interesting history lesson paddy and zach are a typical irish father and son with all that implies add in the marine corps and you have a recipe for good fiction there are layers and nuances to unfold and much food for thought,64,3
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,good novel about the early days of the usmc not as much action as other uris books but still not a bad read,23,4
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,i love leon uris books this was even better because it is about the early marines i have a vested interest in the marines it is a great story,28,5
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,this book is outstanding fun zreading leon usis has outdone himself in this his final novel as a marine who served in combat in the pasific during ww ii the author has done his homework with regard to the marine corps before during and after the civil war the characters are real and the story is alive with terrific characters,60,6
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,i received a hardback copy of this book as a young lance corporal it motivated me then because it is an easy read now that I have read it again years later it reminds me of all of the optimism that we share as marines it is an uplifting book that i recommend to all marines,55,7
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,my partner brought me this to read while i was sick in bed i thought well leon uris this should be good the writing was lousy it was self-indulgent and preachy but more to the point it was just lousy at times i skipped whole pages and then there were the things we were asked to believe not only historical inaccuracies but adonis-zachary the shining hero of the book predicting the japanese invasions that would occur half a century later or an entire church full of ex-slaves interrupting their service to gasp oh god how beautiful he is i paraphrase many times i wondered if the author was in the last stages of alcoholism finally the ending was not only unrealistic and poorly done it was an abomination to the art of storytelling i really do feel as although i have just wasted a part of my life by reading this book,152,8
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,this book has one of the poorest endings I have ever read it seems uris did not know what to do with it the last two chapters made this book a flop,30,9
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,you can not tell a book by it is cover the synopsis sounded good and the book started out in grand epic style by introducing a host of characters the interest stopped there the characters were undeveloped and the lapses in time were confusing dialogue was stilted and love scenes were sappy there did not seem to be much craft used in developing the plot it appeared that the author had done his historical research and then needed to share that learning through the dialogue of his characters writing in hindsight the author had material the characters would never have known nevertheless the information was inelegantly expressed through the words of the speakers who sounded too prophetic and preachy to be real i did learn something of the origins of the marines but the price of the knowledge was too high do not bother,141,10
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,having always heard great things about uriss writing i was excited to read this work about the us marine corps and while it started out well the book falls flat with sappy interludes and silly situations i had hoped for a story of the united states after the civil war although the development of the corps unfortunately what i got was a implausible love story told in flowery overemotional language that more suited a romance novel i would definitely not recommend this book,83,11
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,unfortunately old age or laziness finally caught up with leon uris his final two novels a god in ruins and oharas choice rank as the two poorest novels that i have read in the past 5 years not only were the plots sketchy and improbable but the main characters were contrived stereotypical and forgettable his attempt to push a certain modern political agenda through his books conflicted with events of those times and in the process alienated many of his faithful readers who enjoyed his previous agenda-neutral historical novels you would be best served to read all of his earlier works which i found masterful and riveting and forget these two books that only show the sad decline of a once-great author,125,12
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,trinity may not be leon uriss best book but personally it is my favorite book that being said I am not out to trash uris but oharas choice is a waste of time I shall leave character development and plot intracacies to other reviewers my focus is the story itself as the book unwound i was reasonably well captivated i wondered along the way how much actual marine history played into the story in terms of the fight to keep the corps alive interested enough to research that later the problem is that the story was not compelling enough to have an ending that was not supported by the events thatup to it 390 pages of showing someone has emotions progressing in one direction so the reader can be tricked with a gotcha at the end well that is fine if the gotcha seems plausible but in this book it absolutely did not slight spoiler the ending reminded me of the partner by grisham which had the same problem i do not read grisham anymore because to me that was a big let down the last two pages were not reasonably supported by the first 390 or so and to me that makes for a bad book,201,13
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,uris death three months prior to this books publication not only cut short the career of a great novelist but also another sequel i loved his novels trinity redemption and qbvii they were great stories spun in the tradition of historical novels his story-telling ability and character creation communicate the humanity of the age and culture about which he writes oharas choice is no exception patriotic duty and family loyalty duel in this tale set in the gilded age that followed the u s civil war leon uris was a great writer he had the ability to create characters who communicate the age and times in which uris set his novels the worst part of coming to the end of this book is the nagging awareness that this is the last uris novel the reader will read,137,14
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,when i stopped to think of the time i wasted reading this trash oharas choice was worth exactly what i paid for it thank god i got the book as a gift i have to agree with a disappointment s review i expected a better ending and it crossed my mind whether someone other than uris had finished writing the book it was a drippy romance followed by an unrealistic usmc twist topped off with a ridiculous ending,76,15
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,after so many great books and after such a long time between books this one was a big letdown save your money,22,0
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i am a big fan of mr lehanes work and i can only conclude that he had nothing on the shelf when his publisher needed to publish I had say two of these stories are worth reading which makes this hardcover release an absolute joke in my opinion,47,1
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,I have enjoyed all of mr lehanes work and appreciate that he writes in a number of genres i do not usually read short stories i really read this book because i enjoyed mistic river the patrick kenzie novels and shutter island so much i think these stories are well written and interesting i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys other lehane books,62,2
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,extremely weird can not find a story line goes off in dumb directions real negative aura i very seldom write a review but this was awful,25,3
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,i really like the short story format from authors it provides a different perspective on their writing i especially enjoyed the adaptation of the story to a play,28,4
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,i love lehanes writing often i only want mystery not prose however his characters are always breathing flesh and blood people,21,5
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,i started reading this book but did not stay with it too long it seemed to be filled with short stories that were not my type of reading,27,6
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,lehane has written several excellent novels but this is not one there is a weird short story that is meandering and vague this is followed by a self indulgent ramble concerning a play i was unable and unwilling to finish it,41,7
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,i usually stay away from short stories they are not to my liking i loved these dark yes but like a train wreck you can not look away,28,8
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,the stories were about low life characters without morals the stories were interesting but i did not like the endings the endings were to abrupt and left me wondering what happened to the characters at the end of the story,39,9
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,so it never ends they are so good alas i do get to the end but on the bright side lehane keeps writing,22,10
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,first let me say that i think lehane is a fabulous writer having read mystic river a given day shutter island sacred and the other kenzie and gennaro thrillers however i started reading coronado twice and suffered through half of two stories wondering why i would want to read about these terribly ruthless thoughtless brainless misfits who are killing and destructing without a second thought i did not even feel pity for them just utter disgust oh it is certainly well written i just do not want to read about these people there is enough of that in the press unfortunately,100,11
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,dennis lehane is a very talented writer but i do not understand his sensibilities i loved the first story running out of dog for about 10 pages then i wondered why he writes about these characters i can not see their appeal and the story is over-developed it seems to me i do not need the coda at the end the wrapping up there are good insights into human nature and into the nature of male love and lust good insights into elgin and blue and the way they feel about the woman jewel and why they do what they do but all in all it seems like a tragedy without meaning maybe that is the point but it does not make me want to read more this is the opposite of a sermon but it also is not a very satisfying story not because it lacks meaning but because it lacks a well developed aesthetic sensibility there is just too much here about these losers reminds me of justified a tv series about drug dealers and hillbillies in appalachia i do not care about these people this is more than i want to read,190,12
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,if you are a dennis lehane fan be sure you do not pass up coronado his book of short stories and one play these stories are not new they have all appeared in various publications before but you probably have not read them for me these short stories were my fix to tide me over until lehanes next full-length novel i enjoyed them but they were not enough to satisfy me,67,13
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,rarely does a book of short stories hold my interest but coronado did the short stories ranged from good to outstanding i was quickly drawn into most stories and the writing was better than in most of his novels the only part of this collection that i did not like was coronado the play scenes at the end my two favorite short stories were running out of dog and until gwen those two alone make this collection worth picking up,80,14
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,these are great stories that show how far lehane has advanced from the unrealistic potboilers of his earlier work powerful stuff that reminds a little of carver,27,15
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,this is my first dennis lehane book and he is a fine writer he explores many aspects of human nature in his stories occasionally with a subtle touch of irony the themes of the stories are sometimes depressing but they help one gain insight into other people other places,49,16
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,dennis lehane is quickly becoming my one of my favorite authors and i was very excited to see something new for him short stories but these just are not very good some stories have potential but they just do not get developed and others are just boring if you have never read lehane i recommend him highly just do not start with this book,61,17
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i have been a big fan of dennis lehane over the years and have read all of his patrick kenzie novels and was hungry for more of his writing i saw two books by him on amazon that were not part of the kenzie series and bought them just because lehane was the author the first book was shutter island and i loved it the other book was coronado and i thought it was horrible even although dennis lehanes name is on the cover i have trouble believing that the same man who wrote all those other great books wrote this trash if coronado had been the first lehane book i read it would also have been the last and i would never have known his true talent,128,18
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,I am struck by the response of other amazon readers i agree that coronado is not the equal of one of lehanes novels but short stories and short plays are seldom the equal of a novel particularly a novel crafted by a writer as gifted as lehane each of the stories here is dark and each is haunting in it is own way like any reader i have my favorite s but the collection as a whole carries the lehane touch i waited awhile to buy coronado because like most readers i was waiting for the next lehane novel paging through the book it felt odd to me particularly with a two-act play that grew out of one of the stories i should have read it earlier any collection is a priori uneven but each of the stories held my attention and running out of dog and before gwen are unforgettable the stories also take lehane away from his geographical base and demonstrate the range of his talent I am still waiting for that next novel but coronado has given me enough of a lehane fix to help me tolerate the wait,188,19
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,a collection of short stories and a script this was very disappointing dennis lehane is among my favorite authors but these stories fell far short of his usual great reads it seems like these were old stories that were lying around and there was a thought that if they were bundled together in an attractive package a quick buck could be made ugh,63,20
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i had read every one of dennis lehanes books and was so excited to see that he had a new one coming out i preordered it and could not wait to dive into it well i was bitterly disappointed this book seemed to be written by someone else entirely it was depressing and lackluster as if he had been forced at gunpoint to write something his other books are brilliant I am hoping he will write another one with patrick and angela wonderful characters and great plotlines,85,21
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,I have read dennis lehane since his kenzie and gennaro detective series one of which is being made into a movie as i write this if you have read lehane before you will not be disappointed here this guy is easily one of the best american writers of the current day,48,22
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,having consumed the kenzie and genaro series followed in quick succession by the rest of his works i left on a high with shutter island awaiting his next release this is a case of really not worth the wait if you are new to lehanes work then invest in his back catalog skip this book in it is entirety if this is your first dl book then do not measure him on this the book starts well the first short story is not a bad read i really felt that it went down hill from there sorely disappointed,95,23
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,as one who owns copies of all the published work of this writer i found the stories and play technically adroit they are replete with good dialogue pace surprising plot lines excellent settings pointed descriptions and believable characters for anyone interested in observing a first class novelist explore a different medium this book is recommended,55,24
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,my interest in fiction with a boston setting led me to discover dennis lehane some years ago when i learned that we are alums of the same high school thirty plus years apart i was hooked his boston tales are authentic and jsut plain fun to read his flair for the language and skill at crafting plots set him apart from other writers in coronado tales he stretches westward and stretches his imagination and the readers a good deal also these five short stories and the play-script reinforce lehanes reputation as an artist and story teller and remind us that the short story is an art form itself,108,25
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i bought this book the day it came out dennis lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors what a letdown he is so talented i will buy his next book the day that it comes out however this one does not showcase his talent,46,26
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,i am truly surprised at the negative reviews this collection of short stories and one play has received maybe it is because people do not like to see one of their favorite authors deviate from the norm in any way or maybe it is because it is been a while since shutter island came out I am not sure but i do know that i happened to have loved this collection i thought all of the stories were original and unique and i particularily loved the play coronado i would have loved to see have seen this performed live i do hope however that we have not seen the last of patrick and angie how about another book in that series dennis please,117,27
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,two of the short stories in this book running out of dog and gone down to corpus are not new stories running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr l writing about ironies and tragedies of average people but it should have been noted that 40 of this book is not original the others are average reads over before we have any understganding of the characters mr lehane writes so well about none of the others are full of tension irony comedy tragedy and suspense we have all come to expect they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the authors excellent reputation we waited a long time for another lehane this book certainly does not showcase his talents,124,28
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,while i love dennis lehane his prose his timing and generally his stories these stories get more and more depressing as you move along,24,29
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,disappointment quickly followed excited anticipation after reading the first story hoping it would get better i kept going just to become more and more exasperated and frustrated i realized that i was actually angry at having been taken for a fool in my opinion mr lehane used his fame to bring back some of his previous work which sounds like lines written with no purpose other than to lose the reader or even worse a small attempt a la steinbeck in out of dogs which came too close to of mice and men which was a great story,98,30
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,sorry but i kind of hated this the story was so rambling lurching off into different directions it was aimless and largely boring i do not know what the point is supposed to be no closure no moral no beautiful prose indeed much of it was like slogging through knee-deep mud and just about as much fun do not waste your time,61,0
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,the story is about a young child who is left to die in mud by her mother a young man passes by and finds her and hauls her out the remainder is ta story of her childhood and adulthood in a flashback pattern with her psychological challenges coming and going throughout the narrative this is a hard book to review because at times i was involved and at other places i had to skip pages something i rarely do because it was so disturbing it had been a while since i read a joyce carol oates book but i remembered her dark side the story is psychologically violent and the sexual stuff is very minor but reading about psychological disturbance is not myof a fun read,128,1
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,once i got into this book i was engrossed what was real and what is in mudwomans imagination you can not really tell sometimes but you can not stop trying,28,2
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,some reviewers complained that the narrative structure of this book is hard to follow it is true that the use of flashbacks and dream sequences makes it more complex than a conventional linear-time story but i found that the shifts in perspective were very artfully used providing a contrasting perspective that forced me to reinterpret events at key junctures it certainly is a dark story but i felt the characters were compellingly drawn showing how the same person will function differently in different times and different places in the course of life,92,3
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i found the story disjointed hard to follow and confusing written in such a way that the reader is left with no resolution or explanation will not be recommending to friends,31,4
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i trudged through this book hoping i would at least like the ending i did not the description said the story was taut it was not i gave it 2 stars because i did enjoy when the story went back to mrs childhood and when she visited home as an adult in my opinion mr neukirchen was the only truly likeable character i had enjoyed the gravediggers daughter by ms oates so this book was a big disappointment,76,5
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,psychological stories can be hard to read highly intelligent meredith a university president is having a mental breakdown i felt a lot of sympathy for her thrown away by her mentally I shall mother at age three fostered in a house with seven other children adopted by a loving couple who had lost a child years earlier she gets a scholarship from cornell goes on to harvard earning a doctoral degree she obtains the presidency of a university and starts having dreams nightmares times when neither the reader not meredith is sure of what is real oates is a wonderful writer and even although i was not sure at times if i wanted to finish the book i am glad that i did i wanted to know what happened to meredith see if i could discover what was real and what was only in her mind i recommend it to those who want more than a cozy story,156,6

Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i usually love joyce carol oates but was sadly disappointed in this book the plot was weak and anticlimatic and it had entire chapters of pointless rambling i was only able to finish the book by glossing over 3/4 of it,41,8

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,excellent novel about female university professor affected later in life by early childhood trauma / neglect interesting voice memory tricks / devices well-written and suspenseful combines literary suspense with serious literary fiction succeeding on both levels joyce carol oates fans will probably love this as one of her better ones although she is so prolific there have been many,55,16

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,hard to readi skimmed a lot of it especially all the politics it was hard to tell what was reallyhappening and what was hallucination worst of all ther was no satisfying ending it just stopped i wanted to know why she took her sisters name perhaps she was already so damaged by the abuse that she could not remember which girl she was or perhaps it was survivors guilt,70,21

Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i was greatly disappointed i have enjoyed may oates books but i did not enjoy this it seemed to me disjointed weird and at times using high-blown language unnecessarily i could find almost nothing redeeming in it sorry i would not recommend it,43,25
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,having written so many volumes over the decades developing a personal style with recurring themes and not repeating oneself for an author as prolific as oates is close to impossible how far can she take her singular agitated anxious young woman from a small town and another lived through media tragedy this time is always the question oates is back with an entrapment by drowning or burial of a young girl which becomes a sensational news story what is the girls connection to a very successful woman the first female president of an ivy league university struggling with her obligations including the ethical politics of fundraising and an on campus attack of a student who is a right wing political activist and as in most novels there is the adulterous affair the married lover and a complication straight from the stories of alfred hitchcock which will have you wondering long after you put the book down what happens sends professor meredith neukirchen known as m r to her peers back to the place of her birth I have been hooked by oates through most of her novels and she has never disappointed me,191,26

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,what a strange and haunting book one that i thought about for a very long time after reading,18,30
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,this is one of the worst books i have ever completed her literary style to start the main character in early childhood then go to the prime of her career and then jump back to points in her childhood that were not relevant to the story and then to end without a point i do not recommend this book to anyone overall she writes well but there is no story here it is about a woman who overcame adversity in her early life and became successful about 1/3 of the way through the reader starts wondering if there has a story embedded here 2/3 of the way through the reader is wondering will this ever end at the end of the book the reader will ask themself are you kidding me it was a waste of time,135,31

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,for how many years have i been not reading her novels too many she is nuts her mind goes places where minds should not go especially mine for decades i have done the same thing with this writer after i read black water i swore off her she had just gone too far no more reading joyce carol oates after a few years i gave in to good reviews and i read niagara oh no why never again no more and then i read the review of this creepy book and i do mean creepy what kind of twisted mind even thinks these thoughts much less strings them together into sentences that make up a novel do not buy this book if you do buy it put it on the shelf and do not read it unless you want to be sucked into her vortex you will not be able to put it down it is a compelling read and then you will not sleep for a few nights sleep is kind of over rated yes,176,34
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i started this book for a book club i am in i like the way it started and was very interested when the story when to the present time it became too involved with too much information i could not follow and got bored with i got half way through and closed the book it has been years since i have done this when i find a book that is hard to read i normally keep going because it will smooth out around the middle of the story this did not i was very disappointed as the book club which i had just joined had read another of her books the month before and they liked it very much perhaps it was just this character in the story and not carols writing style i hope so as i would like to try one of her books again jo,147,35
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this one of joyce carol oates best carries punch after punch after punch it calls us all to look at where we have come from and how that effects our life forever the book goes back and forth in and out from the present to the past to the future and back again at times it is hard to tell reality from dream as both intersect again and again and again wonderful,73,36

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,very good writing about a very superior person who pulls herself out of a painful past the only trouble is that in some parts i could not tell if events were real or imagined that is probably my fault i thought the book was very good,44,40
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,mudwoman calls the survivor in us strewn out to the mud flats like an inanimate object mudwoman must survive after being saved from death and go forward with her life haunted forever she struggles painfully and successfully,37,41
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is an amazing book that looks at several issues in depth one is the damage done to a person in childhood that follows her throughout her life in spite of being a success in societal terms another is the stressors upon women who manage to climb the ladders of success and how their viewpoints are disparaged and how they are held to a higher standard another is the issue of what it means to be a liberal or progressive person politically and how to juggle ones own beliefs in managing a high powered career this book to me exemplifies the best of joyce carol oates as she takes on some of the toughest issues of our times in a capturing and readable novel,124,42
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,title indicates the stylel which becomes heavy and depressing about an academic leader and how she came from poor and humble beginnings thoroughly boring,24,43
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i am normally not a joyce carol oates fan due to her extensive descriptions which meander on and one however this novel about the president of a university was wonderful her fully developed characters and the psychological tension was superbly executed i highly recommend this book,46,44
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,we dove into the psyche of a women having a breakdown following her demise was a nail biter but the end was a bit of a let-down I have read many other books by jco but this one was not one of my favorites,43,45
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i know that the books description told me that it was about a womans break down due to a stressful job and a dark past but what was going on i could not follow the plot and the dream / delusions were out there do not bother buying this book,46,46
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,at the beginning of the book i had nowhat it was about as it continued to develop i found it most disturbing and interesting at the same time even when you have the feeling you know what is going to happen after a while you still wish to see how oates ties it all together for people who like serious books,63,47
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,one would almost think the author was high while penning this wordy nonsensical novel i kept thinking it has to get better alas by the time i was half way through i knew that i had wasted too much time and money i have nohow this book evolved or ended and actually have no desire to know i rue the time i spent struggling to interpret the first half i would be reluctant to purchase any of her writings in the future,84,48

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i am quite willing to go down the rabbit hole following a good character down a strange but solid story unfortunately in this book the tangents go nowhere and add little to enlighten the story great premise but the main character could have been more fully developed had the story not taken so much time with seemingly unnecessary tangents and episodes that leave both her and the reader wondering did this really happen by the end i just felt like telling her enough already stop your and,87,51
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i am only halfway through this book and am forcing myself to read slowly and savor every magnificent word this is more than a book it is a major experience this is great literature as are almost all of ms oates books it is not my intent to insult other readers however i have two theories as to why anyone is not loving this book ms oates is obviously a genius and it may take more than average intelligence to appreciate the books splendor readers who need whiz-bang action cinderella romance or three bears type plot will not find it here 199 on kindle the best bargain you will find in your lifetime i will add to this review when i have sadly finished this masterpiece,127,52
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,fans of joyce carol oates know that she writes dark and dreary novels this is one of them at times i was very confused as to what was reality and what was a product of meridiths demented mind it still haunts me,42,53

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,the review for this book sounded so good i anticipated it is delivery and dove right into it when it arrived however i could not force myself to continue much beyond the third chapter the writing was tedious i do not give up on many books but i did on this one,49,56
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i stuck with it because i do not like to start a book and then not finish it this book was so bad for me it was painful whatever the author was trying to get at was not clear to me in the end when it looked like she was going to resolve something she simply ended it with no ending i think she was disgusted with it too,69,57
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i did not even finish reading this book it made no sense and did not hold my interest long enough to finish,20,58
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,very deep heartfelt story as most of oatess novels demonstrates how life can be both destructive and rewarding main character was portrayed so that reader could fully understand her actions and reactions,32,59
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,strange and beautiful tale of a child who is lost who finds herself then loses herself again no joy comes through in this muddy story,25,60

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,i did not care for this book at all there were a lot of parts that just went on and on it also kept changing the time period so much just did not like it,33,62
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,a few pages in the story grabs you and draws the reader into the very convoluted world of the mudwoman it is a wild ride that makes you question what is real and what is imagination,36,63
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,kept me involved through the whole book plenty of tension hard to put down i would recommend it highly but not to everybody,24,64

Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,unless your psyche is made of steel do not read this book it will just bring you down do not we have enough real live events in the world to do that i choose not to spend my precious little expendable discetionary time on a book that is so depressing had there been a better resolution i would have applauded and felt happy that even through trials and tribulations the resilence of individuals will prevail i do not want to put any spoilers in but i did not put this book down at the end of it feeling that way do not waste your money do not waste your time do not expose your psyche to this,110,67
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,extremely well written but so distressing to read the skill in the writing worked against the readability the feeling of impending disintegration made me need to stop reading often just to regain enough emotional balance to be able to pursue the story but however uncomfortable i could not leave it alone perhaps the story was not the point,58,68
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,even if you are not already a fan you will love this book it is intense but that and fine writing is the beauty of ms oates,25,69
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,i was unable to stop reading this once started disturbing yes disappointing no i do not understand how readers can be disappointed by an ending this is the way jco intended it is the same as criticizing a painting because it does not follow conventional beauty i was and continue to be confused about certains aspects of the novel but this mirrors my own mind blurred lines between the real and imagined memories as seen through anothers life and mind i read it in one taut marathon sitting reading through the night a darkened house with all the night noises scaring the heck out of me and ghosts behind every door,110,70
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this novel was post-modern and had much stream of consciousness writing the beginning is the best part and the reader has to absorb every moment of initial story because it all comes back to haunt,35,71
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,never read anything by oates and this was an awakening excellent read that i could not put down highly recommend,20,72

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,can you believe this character goes from subtle observer wanting to be invisible in a very visible environment trying to alleviate chaos and lack of compassion and maybe just a big lie turns into psycho dismemberment machine do not even think it may have been revenge subtext in patricide,49,76
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i rarely leave reviews and especially do not comment negatively on things i usually just let my money speak for me however i felt that i needed to comment on this book i read this for book club and had to continue to force myself to finish this book as it turns out many members of the club just quit reading it because they did not like it there is no real point or plot to this novel there is an outline and a plot line but the story is never developed in any way that makes any sense at all you want this to develop into an interesting story of a woman who has overcome such a terrible start to life or some meaningful point but it is just a bunch of bits of pieces of events that are never really tied together unfortunately because of my experience with this book i will not likely ever read another book by this author i hate to say that because i love reading,170,77
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is a fascinating story told magnificently by jco the main characters struggle to balance her two extremely different woirlds is heart stopping in all of jcos many tales there is always a golden truth this one in order to prevail in life we need to have experienced a great love,51,78
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i have not read this author before this was an audio book and i listened to the first 5 of 16 discs and found it to be very annoying jumped around with no follow through i finally listened to last disc and returned it to the library i do not think I shall read any more works by this author definitely not my type of book i read for relaxation and enjoyment mudwoman not relaxing and not at all enjoyable give me daniel silva spencer quinn michael connelly baldacci child and more,87,79
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,although i am a big reader i have not read any jco books before it took me nearly seven weeks to finish this book and what a waste of time i kept thinking it would surely get better but no i had to see how it ended and now that I am finished i still do not know skip this book and go on to something else,64,80
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,this book was very confusing and i did not know what was going on half the time the ending was out of the blue nowhat it was all about,30,81
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i have read many of joyce carol oates books and this one is among my top three it is simply brilliant,21,82
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i did not like this book at all to be fair i have not read the author before and it is her style of writing that i did not like i am sure the story is quite ok,35,83
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,while this story opened with an intensity that prompted me to keep reading things just went downhill i have read joyce carol oates and enjoyed her writing which prompted me to read this what an arduous task would not let it get the better of me just knew there must be something at the end to pull it all together wrong,61,84
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,just not my cup of tea i really like all types of books but could not get into this at all too deep for my tastes i did read it all the way through hoping it would grab me but it never did a friend really raved about it i found a few parts of it very good but overall it left me dissatisfied and unfulfilled at the end i read for enjoyment and did not enjoy this trip,77,85
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is among the best books that i read all year the plot is intriguing and all the characterizations are mesmerizing you can identify even more if you have experienced academia or high levels of administration,36,86
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is a psychological novel about a woman who is decending into madness the reader is drawn into the novel through the mind of a woman who has gone through a devastating experience the reader must figure out what is reality and what is not just as the woman in the novel must grip with this this book makes you realize there is a thin line between sane and insane it is not an easy read but it is one you will not put down until it is finished someone i respect told me about this book so i knew before hand it would be an unusual read,106,87
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this is a complex story that keeps you thinking every sentence it takes more twists and turns than an old country dirt road while still staying on point,28,88
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i like descriptive books but this author filled a full page to describe a single feeling she did this by rephrasing a sentence over and over again the flash backs boarded on psychotic ramblings maybe this was her way to convey the ranting of someone mentally I shall i found it too disjointed to appreciate,54,89
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i found this book to be very difficult to read it skipped back and forth too often and it was very confusing i was never really sure if mr was actually living something dreaming or hallucinating the writing left a lot to be desired with many awkward or fragmented sentences it just did not flow easily even although i found the book hard to get through i did finish it only to be somewhat disappointed with the ending,78,90
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,like all of joyce carol oates novels this one is very well written it is thought-provoking and the plot moves at a quick and exciting pace but it is also sad and often disturbing,34,91
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this story is told from inside the tangled mind of a brilliant woman when she is lost in the cobwebs of her mind i got lost as well I am sure that is just what ms oates intended when it is all deciphered we have the story of an abandoned baby adopted grown into successful academician and confused adult who seeks answers about her origins very well told I am mystified at how joyce carol oates can tell such dark twisted stories and yet retain her grip but this most deservedly esteemed writer does time and time again i gave it four stars instead of five because i felt i was never quite able to unravel the whole story,117,92
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this was an interesting concept sometimes a little hard to follow but overall it was true to the subject and had some interesting twists i was expecting more about the climb to the position she held but it had enough to give the reader an experience of the feelings behind the climb i reccommend this to all,57,93
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,if a book is supposed to communicate something to the audience there seems to have been a violation of purpose in this case the main message for the reader is to wonder what better way they could have spent their time i expected more from such an esteemed author to a point i appreciate her way of presenting the dark interior life of someone as a jumble of memories and perceptions that are not clearly real or not real but the reader might like to know once in a while there are many examples of themes and plot lines left hanging in the breeze such as a gruesome murder that occurs in the middle of the book that is never mentioned again the ending is on par with the rest of the book completely baffling so do not read on hoping for a sensible denouement i hope the author will remember her readers in the future because we are real,159,94
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i always enjoy jcos books this one takes me back to her earlier writing and i am very fond of it she is one of the best writers living today i only hope she continues to write books like this one with fully developed and interesting characters,46,95
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,was excited to see a new work by this author i am a fan of her work this book has a lot of boring parts and is really tough going much of the time very confusing because you do not know whether what you are reading is really happening a dream a psychotic break or just an old memory i would not recommend mudwoman it seemed totally unfinished what about the boyfriend the father the job,75,96
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,4.0,positive,the reason i bought this cd was because i love the song got you were i want you what an awesome song there are also many more on the cd that are great songs as well so glad i purchased it,41,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,4.0,positive,a few good songs on here the most popular was she has so huge however i enjoyed holiday man the most for it is more up sound not sure why i originally bought it but i think it was for the cool album cover,42,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,1.0,negative,got you where i want you is by far the only song worth listening to every other songs sound like an entirely different band most of the time the signer uses so many effect on his voice that it sounds like he has singing through a tin can under a bridge while being backed up by a few highschool kids in a band it is just plain aweful,66,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,fantastic cd it is not in stores anymore use to listen to it in highschool it is alternative 90s experimental rock,19,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,before they were the flys most of the members of this band were in a band mozart i was really impressed with the music mozart made and when i found out they had morphed into the flys i was really intrigued to hear what their sound would be like i admit that i did really like the song got you where i want you when i heard it on the radio but did not recognize them as the band i formerly enjoyed after listening carefully to this song i definitely hear the old sound mixed in and enjoy it even more now that i know it is derived from the band i really missed i am starting to enjoy the rest of the album also but slowly I shall admit my next favorite song is sexual sandwich i am sure the rest of the album will grow on me as i listen to it more because of the talent and uniqueness of this band i am rating it a 5 and giving 4 of the stars because of their talent and how much i enjoy got you where i want you and 1 star for how much i am anticipating enjoying the album in the future,205,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,2.0,negative,wel i was turned on to this song at a strip club when 2 lipstick lesbian dancers were doing what they do best to each other i got you where i want you was the best piece on this cd the rest of the songs did not strike a buzz with me although i listen to it with fond memories of those two hot chicks that night at the bar so i gave it 2 stars for the girls and the songthis is a one hit wonder cd or a good beer drinking cd at a frat party in collage,99,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,1.0,negative,i can not tell you people how bad this album is it is plain bad i remember loving the single so i bought the album never was my money so wasted if you really love got you where i want you then buy the single trust me on this one this album is terrible,53,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,1.0,negative,this the worst cd i ever bought track 2 is a good song but the rest of the cd is just horrible this band is just a 1 hit wonder and expect nothing more,34,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,4.0,positive,this is california rock no doubt and a great rock party cd at that the 70s party rock band was van halen the 80s brought us janes addiction and the 90s delivers the flys speaking of janes addiction this cd sort of instills the image that their little surfer brothers all formed a band and this is what came out this is a fairly nice mixture of todays popular genres all mixed into ato be served on modern rock instruments they even include subtle tributes to sly stone and barry white along with the nearly hidden recurrence of the elements of surf music from days gone by another pleasantry within is a consistently positive although sometimes sarcastic message regarding the female persuasion that is very little of the break-up-song you broke my heart mentality all in all a great rock album with tasty songs and recording techniques rock lovers will appreciate,153,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,after hearing adam paskowitzsinger perform on the bathead soup ozzy osbourne tribute a few months ago i decided to give the flys a try so i bought their latest cd outta my way i really liked this cd so i soon picked up holiday man after hearing holiday man i can now say that the flys are one of my favorite bands this cd is great and i like all but one song still eleven out of twelve is pretty good this cd mixes a lot of types of music from slow songs like girls are the cruelest to more upbeat songs such as holiday man some of my favorite tracks include got you where i want you afraid holiday man and groove is where you find it if you like the flys or want to try something new you should check out this cd,147,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,this album is great adams vocals are awesome i especially love track 5 holiday man with it is harderi have to say the gods of basketball is way better live got to love that intro riff this band goes way beyond got you the pop radio smash hit and i really wish i could find 25 cents i hear it is an great album,63,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,1.0,negative,i feel so misled you see a video on mtv and you like the song you buy the album assuming that you will be at least almost as pleased by the remaining ten songs or so you have been duped at least if you bought this album i know this because i made that very mistake every song is worse than the previous one and the song titles are even worse sexual sandwich what the he shall is that the flys are this years sugar ray i can not think of a worse insult than that,90,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,4.0,positive,the flys bring a fresh new sound to the world of alternative music with many different techniques they create a sound that has yet to be discovered by other bands i highly recomend this album if you do not please check these guys out on the disturbing behavior sound track,49,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,orbit achieves fine instrumentation but no expression i expected someone of his standing to break new ground in recording electronica versions of classical pieces particularly in squeezing emotional expressiveness out of the machinery no such luck the renditions are flat orbit may be a good composer but does not show talent as a conductor thus i would not recommend this album for folks who are already classical listeners pieces in a modern style really feels like massage parlor music,77,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,my god how you dissapoint me orbit this album is intended for the classical fan not for the electronic buff it is too mellow slow basically goes nowhere the songs cut off no ending just the meledy or highlights of sections if your thinking madonna think again,46,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,after one gets past it is pretentiously crass artsiness the title wants to be serious and the cover wants to look classical the first reaction to pieces is where is the beef it is been a while since synthethizers have been with us and insipid electronica renditions of classics are hardly worth notice the comparison of pieces to tomitas mesmerizing renditions of holst light years ago but still fresh would be an undeserved compliment i usually enjoy creative and unconventional arrangements of classical pieces and am always eager to discover cross-over artists who make me see hear this great music in a new light but this is a boring unfocused hodge-podge even at his best orbit sounds like one of those self-propelling diskette-recorded jobs at music store demo room you can almost hear the sales person say see even if your child prodigy turns out to be less than a genius our newest clavinova can play all by itself and it almost sounds like an orchestra while orbits audible touch on madonnas ray of light was refreshing his heavy-handedness with modern pieces is off-putting,182,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,william orbit is a genius in the field of electronic music production his new album combines various techno-synthesized sounds with the original melodies of classics by handel beethoven barber and vivaldi this album is a worthy purchase for any fan of classical electronica or just relaxing ambient music best suited for relaxation meditation yoga and studying,56,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,this is a great record if you want something to put you asleep faster than nyquil you are much better off finding the origional peices of music and enjoying them but if you can find the dance version of adagio for strings grab it in a heartbeat an amazing soaring peice of music,52,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,i have been working in electronic music for almost 20 years years i have a massive library of music for almost any reason mood and itch tonight i am taking the five minutes to stop and write how unique amazing and consistently refreshing this album is everytime i go back to it since the day it was released highly melodic very electronic and overall lacking the percussive elements most have come to know when listening to orbit much more sophisticated than the average listener might appreciate consider it a staple for anyone serious about electronic music i believe anyone rating this poorly is looking for a pop appeal that you just will not find here thankfully,115,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i do not know who maxine kubabi is she has certainly untitled to her opinion an ungainly meeting of the sublime and the absurd what a sublimely empty and inadequate statement you have to know something about a genre before you can be an effective critic inside it you should be able to specify why you do not like something in some detail rather than resort to crabby nebulousities that is greasy kid stuff what orbit has done is to realize some old familiar works in an electronic medium using smooth and musical strokes he has taken many big chances some of them worked out well others not as well as one might hope but he deserves kudos for taking a risk and for making some of it work why would anyone who likes electronic music complain that it does not have live instrumentation that is like complaining that jazz has no rock and roll in it reverence second rate vangelis so you were disappointed that orbit did not create more of the kind of schmaltz you personally like yanni anyone for those who actually like electronic music and like beethovens opus 132 please give that track a listen i do not think you will be disappointed,198,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,i have been a fan william orbit since water from a vineand i have to admit while this inst exactly a electronica per se it is still amazing to see what he has done with our classics the listening experience depends solely on the listener more ambient than anything else i have heard although recommended for william orbit and curious georges,63,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,if you are looking for something to pop in late at night to dance to this is not the album this album is eery and some of it is painful it is not full of upbeat electronics like originally thought it would be but i love it it is great to listen to while just thinking relaxing reading it is beautiful,53,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,being a fan of ambient and electronica for some time i decided to give this a try i can understand how some may simply hear this as a cheesy reworking of the classics just a man and his keyboard but it is really much deeper than that if you just sit and listen i suggest not comparing to the originals as much as enjoying what these pieces are themselves a few tracks do lag and there are quiet spots but as a whole i find pieces in a modern style to be almost hypnotic and as i said in my review title rather peaceful the tracks i prefer the most are adiago for strings cavalleria rusticana intermezzo linverno and the music-box sounding triple concerto however the others are fine as well i say if you think you might like this you probably will it is well worth the used price if nothing else,151,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,this album attracts such mixed reviews i feel one has to see it and use it for what it is a simple and beautiful reworking of some classic peices with modern technological advances it is not a philarmonic interpretaion it never sets out to be and yet seems to attract hostile review simply because the music is not the production of an orchestra i think of it as like a costume drama by the bbc of some excellent victorian novel not as it was first intended in it is own time but a clever reworking and marketing for a modern audience thus allowing some history a new voice and a new audience for that reason alone it desreves praise but also happens to be a beautiful and sensual album,127,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,how does one define excellence this album is as close to being excellent as i know william orbit has taken the works of classical composers and remade them with synths samplers and other electronic equipment and the end result is nothing short of stupendous astounding and spectacular there are many gems on this great piece of work and the ones that stand out particularly are nr 4 nr 1 nr 6 and nr 8 orbit has created an album that sounds a bit like the old composers a tad of jarr some vangelis and voila we have a modern day masterpiece orbit shows his mettle especially on track nr 8 i love this album and i never tire of it this is a keeper for the ages,127,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,I am a huge wo fan yes even his work with madonna which no doubt played no small part in her musical resurrection and while you can pick out definite stylistic traits this is just not well executed at all the string pads seem to be ubiquitous throughout and it is not even an expressive string pad there is little emotion here like a lot of modern synthetic sounds and so he has quite right these are indeed pieces in a modern style if you want true-to-form synthesized symphonic music try jarres equinoxe or schulzes timewind for starters,95,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,I have been a fan of orbits other works for a while and while he does have a very identifiable signature style he has quite a good producer and technician and electronic interpretations of classical music ar eoften quite interesting like wendy carloss landmark switched on bach or elps progged-up pictures at an exhibition sadly this one really misses the boat instead of benefitting from orbits prisitine production or from the depth of the original compositions what this just manages to do is suck the soul out of all the compositions it is slightly better than downloaidng a midi file of the same piece but displays the same flaccid lack of emotion it becomes a pretty self-indulgent exercise the single of barbers adagio is paricularly flat as an electronic piece removing the tension of the dissonant strings and replacing them with rather flabby whooshy pad sounds the corsten remix is a sight better but only becasue it bears less resemblance to a classical remake and more to a novelty trance tune disappointing,170,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,most people tore this cd apart i think you just have to know what you are buying this is not i repeat not a high-energy fast bpm cd it is extremely relaxed and much of the music is taken from classical music so if you are a 16-year old wannabe raver punk do not buy this it is that simple you will not like it go get one of aphrodites cds instead guarentee you will love them this cd is mellow very beautiful pick it up if you are into mellow stuff,82,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,william orbit pieces in a modern style maverick / warner a true innovator william strange cargo orbit offers us a piece of the future or the past as it were pieces in a modern style is orbits homage to the string arrangements of beethoven gorecki and vivaldi amongst others and provides us with his reinterpretation of classical music done to a contemporary chill-out vibe it is touted as being a blissed-out compilation of sparkly beatless remixes with a trancey flavour along with the visually stunning packaging the record comes with some exclusive reworks of barbers adagio for strings by ferry corsten and atb corstens remix provides the listener with a cohesion of banging building progressive techno fused with the epic adagio sample this is a prime example of orbits conceptual vision that behind all the breakdowns the buzzes and fizzes of trance music the sweeping strings of classical music are just waiting to get out,153,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,I am sure i should go back and listen to the original verions of these pieces reinterpreted by orbit but for the moment i am spellbound by what he has done with them i can tell this is a cd that will stay in regular rotation for me particularly in my office where it is soothing effect is a big help i know purists may decry orbits reinterpretations but perhaps they willpeople to discover the original works in the meantime this is a wonderful musical gift i will definitely seek out more of orbits work,95,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,anyone who says that this is not good just does not know what good is the two reviews at the top are worthless and do not believe what they say the wholeof music is the fact that it changes in style and texture and over a period of time it is not dificult to find that certain re-workings can improve the quality of the song all of the songs on this album are fantastic to say the least this is by far the most relaxing yet totaly obtainable cd to listen to you do not have to be tired to listen to this it is a great cd to have on any time some of the outstanding pieces are john cage in a landscape piece in old style 1 and 3 and the whole rest of the cd you are a musical twit if you over look this cd simply for the fact that they are re-workings of great classical pieces this is by far an oustanding achievement in the field of electronic / re-worked music and music period,174,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,i got this cd thinking it would be as good as best of strange cargos unfortunately this album is a waste of time it actually depresses me because it fills my head with white noise it your to spend the money get a strange cargos cd,46,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,i am strangly conserned by the sheer amount of reviews for an ambient electonic cd seriously maybe william orbit would have been better off with a new moniker to release this wonderful album under i think the aphex twin selected ambient croud would have understood this album much better i certainly was amazed by the greatness of this all this talk about killing the original songs is just annoying since it is not like orbits was trying to get the original songs off the market relax the originals are still available to be listened to regardless of who remakes them seriously this is a wonderful ambient album and it is hard to find decent ambient albums that are not muddled with constant over production and wannabe trip images further more every single [ one ] who relied with someting like it is been done should be shot because its not like decent ambient electonic versions of classical songs are a dime a dozen a quit using the term pop when describing this style of music,171,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,i like ambient music i love orbits other work but this is simply terrible if you have never listened to the original pieces you may like these then again if you have never listened to the original pieces done by true classical musicians and you like these you should listen to the original pieces i have not even heard all of the original pieces but these are so devoid of emotion and beauty i could not bear to listen the album a second time there is nothing redeeming about orbits interpretations other than the name william orbit if you are interested in this type of music do yourself a favor get the originals done by real classical musicians by the way not even the remixes can save this album buy any of the zillions of trance albums that have it mixed in instead,142,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,this cd was not disappointing by any stretch if you are looking for really cuttingtechno / electronic versions of these classics do not buy it if you are looking for some soothing adaptations of time-honoured melodies then by all means buy it immediately i agree with the other person who reviewed this cd and said something to the effect of read between the lines of the other reviews is it genius no is it good absolutely,73,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i agree with the reviewer who said that this album is ambient and not trance if it was trance the beats per minute would be at least 128 bpm i think the only fault of orbits pieces in modern style is that it is a bit slow otherwise i love what i heard i especially dig the remixes by atb and ferry corsten they embody what trance is granted that songs like adagio for strings were a bit long and slow they are perfect to relax to,87,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,do not be fooled by the ferry corstens awesome remix of william orbits barbers adagio for strings track this does not at all represent william orbits cd this cd is almost entirely slow ambient takes on classical music,38,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i was surprised to see that the editorial reviews on this album were so negative i think this is a beautiful album it is peaceful yet haunting definitely a relaxer,29,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,it did not have to be dance music or even upbeat what it should have been was good like all the rest of william orbits music i have heard this album was just awful do not waste your money if you want to hear wo at his best get strange cargo iii or madonnas ray of light,55,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i can totally understand how many reviewers have raked this album over the coals it is very different especially if you are used to classical music the way it was originally written but what is wrong with doing things differently i am 39 and started listening to classical music when i was 9 i do not mind hearing different interpretations of old classics i think orbits interpretations are pretty innovative and unique yes there are some tracks that are not very strong but that is typical of all albums track 8 xerxes has been getting some air play on spinnercom and that is how i got introduced to orbits cd it is definitely the best track on the cd if you like mythos tangerine dream and other electronic new age you will like this cd,131,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,that your parents bought you when you were ten that were capable of producing only cheesy sounds this album reminded me of those I am serious I am really familiar with most of this music and orbit completely distroys what makes the music special and beautiful it is possible to revamp classical music electronically just listen to the techno mix of orffs o fortuna from carmina burana it rocks orbit just falls flat and puts me to sleep in the meantime do yourself a favor spend the money you would spend on this cd and buy some actual barber or beethoven or ravel or cage,105,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,although i could liken it to jean-michel jarre or vangelis it is true i will not because i believe that to be most unfair william orbit has metamorphisized eleven classical pieces into newer lighter soundscapes nothing tempts the soul like a door to the heavens and that is where i feel orbit has triumphed feeling as if an angel is carrying you along to perhaps an internal epiphany you can lay down and exist and leave all your mortal worries behind yet it is not dull or inconsequential in the slightest no this music holds intrinsic beauty pulled out of the original classical artists intentions it can make one cry or sigh in relief it is that human interpretation of beauty and nature and rhythm that can stike our senses dumb think of this work as valuable to own and enjoy and feel,140,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,rolling stone magazine dubbed pieces in a modern style as being a rare bridge between pop and classical after listening to and enjoying this album many times i have yet to disagree with that fine observation the 11 beautiful classic compositions in the tracks of this cd are transformed into modern-day masterpieces orbits lust for subtle ambient sound is fully satiated in these works as he presses onward for that perfect sound not once although does he betray the original flare of these pieces some tracks are simple barbers adagio for strings others more intricate saties ogive number 1 and still others bold and inventive mascagnis calleveria rusticana ravels pavane pour une infante defunte beethovens triple concerto however all these are facsinating engrossing works although classical enthusiasts are probably disgusted by this album i think all open-minded lovers of pop-music or music as a whole can find this bridge between pop and classical to be quite enchanting,153,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i was not sure if i was going to like this one when i first bought the cd but i must say i was pleasantly surprised i had only heard of william orbit from his contributions to madonnas ray of light album and i am not a huge fan of electronica I am more into sarah maclaughlin and tori amos i do enjoy listening to classical music on occasion although so i thought I had give this one a try i really liked it the music has almost a celestial feel to it it shimmers and radiates and resonates into a pure crisp wall of sound the arrangements are very peaceful and calming when you listen to this cd you can feel the stress emptying from your bodyand if you close your eyes you feel like you are floating on wave after wave of sheer sound the music is at times blissful other times upbeat sometimes melancholy but always enjoyable admittedly this cd is probably not for everyone if you are open-minded to new things and are not some kind of strict classical music purist you might like this cd it is different unique and very relaxing give it a try,198,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,I am not quite sure what album miss maxine listened to when she reviewed pieces in a modern style but it is not the one I am listening to now quite honestly I am not an avid classical music listener and have not heard these pieces as each of the original composers intended I am sure but that does not matter this record is a beautiful albeit subtle masterpiece which is yet to disappoint me it is rich in creativity and originality,75,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i listen to everything but country and this is definetly very nice and I am glad to have it and listen to it based on the bad reviews by critics you got to have it it is a very nice interpretation of classics which i happen to like alot not as intense as some of the pure classical musicians like anne-sophie mutter but williams orbits skill and originally and creativity sell this one and make it quite enjoyable I am not sure whether to organize this with my electronic cds or classical cds but I am glad someone is willing to straddle the line without regard for pleasing either crowd,105,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,this album was interesting back in 1968 it was called switched on bach by wendy carlos i was hoping for a record that would expand upon the innovations of 20th century music while adding a fresh twist to the classics what i got was a set of admittedly well-produced midi tracks where has the innovation,55,33
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,i tried i really tried i took him to work with me i listened to him as i drove through the mountains i gave him my undivided attention on the headphones in the living room but try as i might there has not much good i can say about pieces in a modern style purists will be aghast at the electronic reworking of compositions by ravel beethoven handel and others the ambient crowd will yawn with boredom at the undoubtedly high-tech production that goes out of it is way to sound low-tech the result unless you really want to see what pouty posturing synth artists lose the cover art already do when they decide it is time to make serious music stay away you can find better electronic music you can find better classical music taken together neither side wins here,138,34
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,buy this cd if you want to take a listen to a modern take on some interesting and very very well played music sadly some of the pieces have been played better tomita et al still it looks like most people would probably want the 2 cd edition that has the atb remix on cd 2,56,35
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,if u like clasical but is not that invovled or do not want to be away from pop too much heres a perfect alternative half-classical with some pop sensibilities,27,36
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,this cd was the worst cd i had ever bought the cd was also very very boring william orbit should made all the songs faster and not-so-long the only good thing about this cd is that the second disk which is a remix but the remix cd only contains two tracks but they are ok overall this cd is just garbage and a waste of money people who like instrumental music that really is boring this is the cd for you,81,37
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,this is what music should be tending towards a sythesis of styles it blends some of the most beautiful sounds together with production work that can not be done on a concert hall stage the final result is something that holds dear to your emotion,44,38
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,the sound of this album takes the sort of synthesizerrealizations of classical music isao tomita was doing in the 1970s and1980s and goes nowhere with it comparing isao tomitas 1984 realization of pavane pour une infante defunte from the ravel album issued as bolero in the united states with orbits realization of the same piece from this album reveals not only tremendous similarity but also a much more evocative clear and varied musical palette in the earlier rendition indeed pieces in a modern style falls into the sort of sound-cloud excesses that marred even some of tomitas best albums like firebird the planets and the bermuda triangle indeed pieces in a modern style is a veritable sequel to tomitas worst album by far dawn chorus if you are interested in how synthesizers can be used to interpret classical music in interesting ways try one of tomitas albums the recently re-released snowflakes are dancing is delightful or virtually anything by wendy carlos but let mr orbits endless fake synth-string washes fall deservedly into the remainder bins end,172,39
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,totally disappointed do not get me wrong i really like experimental music and thought mobys play was the best cd of 1999 but this experiment simply does not work if you are a big fan of orbits as i am you will be sorely disappointed this is not a cd to be tossed aside lightly it should be thrown with great force i suppose it is ok to listen to if you are in a coma completely awful,75,40
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,if you have come to william orbit via ferry corsten great but beware do not expect more of the same i mean do not get me wrong the remix of adagio is one of the most uplifting dance tunes of recent times this cd is at the other end of the scale but in genre and bpm terms not quality it shows through that william has spent much time and effort subtly recrafting classical tracks of yesteryear into chill-out soothers for the future i must admitt that upon my first listen i dismissed it as being too light but further listens meant i began to uncover the subtle tapestry of what he has tried to create for instance i think ludwig beethoven himself would approve of the downbeat re-working of triple concerto classical lovers may turn their nose up at this dance nutters likewise but if you are not adverse to a bit of genre meshing then give this a try although not an all-time ambient classic it is definitely worth taking this trip,169,41
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,it is worth remembering as you drift spellbound through theshimmering fantasyscapes of william orbits remarkable new cd pieces in a modern style that this is not terra incognita classical music was once electronicas proving ground wendy carlos aka walter carlos stunned the pop and classical culture alike in the late 60s with the energetic and appealingly appropriate switched-on bach an exploration of johann sebastians linear meditations through bob moogs primitive analog sequencers that seemed to go well with beanbag chairs and philip roth and all things postrevolutionary,86,42
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,so this is not a dance cd so what it is a really interesting treatment of modern classical music i really like the pieces by john cage and henryk goreki as a musician this shows orbits incredible shill and i found it interesting and great to listen to why should an artist do the same thing over and over if you want dance music buy strange cargo whatever number if you want to hear something new and interesting try this cd,81,43
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,this album should be called tunes that you recognize played a cheap keyboard none of the tracks are very exciting and most just sound cheap and tacky,27,44
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,okay i happen to own strange cargo cds and i like them i own isao tomitas albums as well yes the man who has been playing classical music on synthesizers since 1974 and yes i like them all pieces however gets it all wrong the album tracks are boring the most interesting track the remix of barbers adagio in not on the cd at all but on a single if you can compare pavane from orbit with the version played by tomita back in 1979 on the ravel album daphnis et clo while orbits version seems flat tomita playes the same work with much more emotion if you like classics played on keyboards you should really check out tomitas work if you expect to find anything like water from a vinestrange cargo 3 then do not buy this album,141,45
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,having owned many and heard most of these pieces in the original form I have found orbits interpretations refreshing and insightful they will introduce a whole new audience to a genre that badly needs more listeners yet they stand on their own in feeling and creativity i think orbit deserves credit for taking this lateralthe production is first rate and his choice of melodies is to my mind excellent,70,46
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,i think this cd is wonderful it is definitely orbit even classical composers often create arrangements of other composers works or themes often times intended for other instruments so it is really not a valid review to imply that a new arrangement is simply not valid you have to appreciate orbits cd as an expression of his style just as you would not compare a performance of rachmaninoffs variations on a theme of paganini to a performance of the original score it would not even make sense,83,47
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,I have always felt that really good techno has many elements of classical music in it and it seems odd that it would take so long for one of the techno crowd to try their hand at remaking classical music the results are beautiful yet tasteful and not exploitative of the material there are some missteps some of the tracks in a landscape for instance veer off into sounding like a music major noodling on a cheap casio keyboard and others adagio are a little to respectful to be authentic however the others are terrific xerxes is beautiful and some of the other arrangements are really chancy and inspired i enjoy listening to the cd tremendously and so do several of my friends who hate techno,125,48
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,i bought this cd before reading the review on amazon however even if i had i probably would have made the purchase anyway that said it is undeniably the worst piece of crumpled recycled techno-classical music imaginable if you have a collection of the most awful music you have ever heard this is an absolute must have if you do not steer very clear of this disk,66,49
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,2.0,negative,alas the original amazon review is correct this album is well produced but also very kitch beethoven in ambient soup is almost as bad as smoke on the water sung by pat boone i think that orbit could have made a much better album by reinterpreting open jazz standards i believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that are perfect and complete in themselves so i can only explain this cd as a cash-in operation after the successful madonna album my humble advice is to those who like easy-listening classical music buy the originals classical cds are often sold at a bargain price since they provide a much pleasant authentic listening experience to those who are curious about ambient buy any cd of the orb or boards of canada or plaid or even the classic eno,141,50
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,5.0,positive,we think this album rocks we were in the uk for christmas when the adagio was number one and it should be released in the us if you like techno we would thorouhgly recommend this as techno with a tune and excellent for turning up really loud if you like this try sash too,54,51
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,he has original how many electronic musicians can you say ah that sounds like william orbit he has his signature sounds he writes his own stuff and has his own respectable back-catalog but where is the first torch song album on cd he has got friends in high places he has sexy ok not but the album is kind of dull and lacks feeling you want emotion electronica with emotion someone may have beaten me to this already because i see others that bought pieces have also bought but check out global communication 7614 the original german pressing of this album had some arvo part tracks that did not make it on this release but kudos to bill for simply doing something he wanted to do now where has the next single with club 69 mixes,133,52
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,1.0,negative,supermaket version of classical favourites adds nothing worthwhile to the original pieces why does mtv europe run the adagio for strings video without telling us that it is a remix not to be found on the normal album i want a refund,42,53
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,5.0,positive,i have been listening to tot since velvet it is hard to believe this is the same band they have gone from the death-goth stylings of velvet to the beautiful aegis and now to the techno / metal / goth hybrid if you are a metal purist you probably will not find anything you like about this disc if you an open minded music lover you will find that every track is totally stunning i listen to mine driving at night with the windows down in a big city absolutely amazing,83,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,1.0,negative,i must say as a huge fan of this group i was immensly dissappointed with this new disc this is not the good tot it is some attempt at something from out of clear left field if you liked the old tot do not by this disc if you like techno / electronica let us play the same mundane beat over and over again then this disc may be for you for those of you who need to fill the void for this lackluster performance try the new release oracle moon by garden of shadows killer riffs tons of time changes beautiful keyboards just downright good music,104,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,4.0,positive,rating this album is somewhat hard because there is a big change of style here by tot i would recommend to those that loved tot for their metal-gothic style to maybe pass on this one also if they do not like techno or a somewhat ramstein-ish music style but for those that are willing to accept change form their favourite group they might be positively impressed by the change here they have gained a more techno feel while still keeping their metal roots ala ramstein and liv voice is still as angelic as ever even through this techno sounbds the problem is that they may seems to have lost their gothic touch but personally i think it just transcended into something different but no totally un-gothic to sums it up for those willing to see change not necessarily as a bad thing i would recommend this album but for those maybe older fans who are not so open to change i would not recommend this one because it is too different from their previous albums i was not prepare for such a change on this album when i bought it but i still loved it music is an art i think keeping an open mind is a must,205,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,1.0,negative,a longtime fan of this group i was elated to see that they had finally released a new album elated that is until i tried listening to it i am not a purist and do not insist that everything i listen to be true metal but this is simply inexcusable this once great band has degenerated into yet another factory for watered down euro-pop trash causing them in my mind to have ceased to exist do not buy this album instead i highly recommend that you purchase any other album by this band or perhaps something by tristania or the sins of thy beloved assuming goth metal is what you are after i mourn the loss of this band and hope that others like it do not follow the same path to utter corruption,134,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,2.0,negative,what happened it just all went so wrong I am sure there has people out there who might like this album but he shall i sure prefer their other albums over this one this one sounds more how shall i say club-ish,37,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,2.0,negative,aegis was the turning point you could tell that it was somewhat different than the other albums even although the aegis album is one of my favorites they all are with the exception of musique i mean it is like another band and i really really loved the old stuff because of the passion put into it this album just did not have that,62,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,5.0,positive,seems like most people like to on tot for this album but this album is what got me to take them seriously until this album tot was exactly like every other goth / doom / metal band out there decent heavy metal parts growly male vocals pretty female vocals lots of gothy stuff unbelievable cheese-filled lyrics sure they were the leaders of the pack but the pack was cheesy and predictable this concept album changes everything elements of old tot are still there the heaviness livs pretty vocals the good song writing but they show influences from the best of techno / industrial why techno / industrial cuz it works with the concept of this album I am willing to bet that the next album will be quite different and have totally new concepts of course if they stay in this direction for awhile i will not be complaining it is called creativity people that is a good thing,148,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,5.0,positive,this is a great album it does not sound like their earlier albums often it is assumed that when a band experiments in order to grow because they have mastered something thay have sold out not true this is album along with ageis are my favorites liv kristines voice is absolutly wonderful she is one the few singers with a truely extraordinary voice and you can hear her clearly the music is great and defintly has a great rythm and force behind it the music has a crystalline kind of sound like it has surpassed basic levels and gone to a higher plane wich may sound weird but it is absolulty awe inspiring,115,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,1.0,negative,i was excited for this album to come out i hate it this could possibly be the most disappointing cd I have ever heard why does raymond want to sound like a robot version of the guy from the b-52s if you want my honest opinion theatre of tragedy need to get off their high horses their sell-out may have even surpassed metallicas has anyone been to their website lately talk about a bunch of ego-driven jerks I am into metal that has a groove but I had still like it to be intelligent i also like it when people play instruments why are not the guitar players in this band bored there has more programming in this cd than there is in windows 2000 i do not know what possessed them to make an album like this but they need an exorcist badly it is sad when a hard core theatre of tragedy fan like me just does not care anymore i do not know what they are up to these days probably playing dance clubs and sadly i do not care i am one of too many incredibly disappointed ex-fans,183,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,1.0,negative,i am among many other various music styles a big listener of lacrimosa and therion which i consider to be pathfinder in the chaotic musical universe of the last years their music is qualitative very high rich and listenable these are things i unfortunately can not say about this tot album first problem the band creates an unnecessarly wall of sound much to loud i do not think that gothic means play it loud unlistenable and which is covering by 50 the vocals second problem the techno-pop section is far from being original copying electro-pop bands from the 80s there are entire passages you could swear they are from kraftwerk a-ha or others third problem i think there must be a limit of mixing different music styles while it is proven that classic-rock classic-metal or opera-metal is working very good i do not think that techno-pop / metal or any other dance-metal will have any succes it sounds to me like trying to enter the limp biskit family and i am not interested to follow the tot in there,176,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,2.0,negative,i am a new convert to the black metal i use that term loosely after listening to this cd genre and recently picked up this cd i was expecting more of a symphonic experience like tristanias beyond the veil i am disappointed with the premise that this album is listed in the black metal genre it belongs somewhere else preferrably electronica however I have heard that tots earlier work holds truer to the genre so I shall probably pick up an earlier tot album if you like synth-based music with a gothic twist the album is palatable i rated it two stars mainly for the disappointment of my own expectations not necessarily for the album itself i must now deal with the sadness of my own disappointment of course it could have been worse i could have actually picked up an a-ha cd,141,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,4.0,positive,i came across this album via the vnv nation remix of machine i was hooked after about a minute of that track I have since heard some of tots earlier stuff but the musique album is by far the most enjoyable would have given 5 stars if vnv had mixed the entire album i had none of the goth pretensions to cloud my judgement i rate such bands as curve rammstein ministry along with much ebm / future-pop / synthpop oh yeah and kate bush too die-hard fans will no doubt flame this but i think musique is full of great pop songs at times it may veer into republica territory but the tech lyrics and beautiful female vox hold it up i only hope this band continue with this electro path in the future much like vnv nation this band get better with each release,141,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,5.0,positive,i have all the cds of tot and this is the first i really enjoied they were too ssslllooo [ ] musique do not need to be defended if you do not buy it you regret it,33,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004ZBM6,4.0,positive,if you are a fan of everything they have done until now and listen primarily to that kind of music you probably will not like this whatever their true intentions they have modified their style quite a bit taking things a bit less seriously in some parts much of it has become a blend of industrial with what they used to do with clear kraftwerk influences city of light and retrospect come the closest to comparing with their previous efforts I had say you should pick this up if you do not mind giving something new a try or if you already like this style of music to begin with for what it is worth i like it,113,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,the 2002 tony for best revival went to into the woods and it is well deserved this staging and album are both pure gold vanessa williams interpretation of the witch manages to be quite distinct from bernadette peters while maintaining the standard ms peters set back in 1987 although her velvet tones do strike you as a bit smooth for the character you can feel the underlying emotion in the larger numbers like the last midnight both laura benanti and kerry omalleys voices are quite beautiful and add new dimensions to the characters of cinderella and the bakers wife respectively benantis on the steps of the palace is much lighter and more girlish than kim crosby on the 1987 recording which is refreshing to a listener who has become so attached to the original recording the only reason i have not given this five stars is the quality of the recording itself in many places the recording feels a bit closed in as if you were in a small space almost drowning out the richness of many of the actors voices overall the recording breathes new life and energy in an already timeless musical and makes a welcome addition to any sondheim library,202,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,buy this cd it is defiantly worth it with all of the publicity surrounding this revival and this tony award winning castby vanessa williams and john mcmartin it is an amazing soundtrack this recording is inventively done and defiantly breathes new life into this score the new additions on this recording are the first american recording of our little world a duet between rapunzel melissa dye and the witch vanessa williams i would have bought the recording just for this song the new version of hello little girl is now sung by both wolves to ridinghood preserved on this recording along with many other tweaks to the score williams and mcmartin are absolutely fabulous breathing new life into there performances as well is veteran actress laura benanti kerry omalley and gregg edelmann while newcomers adam wylie and molly ephraim give a different twist on there characters and are very entertaining to listen to the performance of marylouise burke is the biggest letdown on this recording while this recording is nothing like the original headed by bernadette peters i think it is defiantly worth the chance because of the additional material by steven sondheim and jonathan tunick thanks for reading and buy this cd,204,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,oh my god i am a broadway fan and when i heard that vanessa williams would be playing the witch i could not wait to hear this cd and it took me along time to buy it because something kept telling me to wait and i waited and waited until now and i understand why although there is more to this cd than the first one i love the first cd to this show and even love love the dvd to into the woods a must buy but this it mite take me sometime to get use to but i do not think i will be picking it back up there is nothing like the first one and how grand it is and you get to this cd and it just do not work for me,133,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i bought this because i was doing a cabaret that had into the woods as one of the shows shown even after the show is over i still can not stop listening to it,33,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,until i got this cd home i was unaware that this rewritten revival existed and i do wish i had continued in that state of happy ignorance if zombies on valium had been engaged to perform they could hardly have made the music more lifeless than this recording does i understand wanting to interpret roles anew but even new interpretations should be imbued with sparkle of some kind unless of course one is doing the aforesaid druggie zombie version i bought this cd at a local store and back it goes if anyone wants to see a lovely version so much better than the 2002 broadway revival search youtube for into the woods cleveland hs the high school students are wonderful it is a pity their performance is not available here I had buy it,134,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,i would have given this recording one star except for the fact that the album is presented beautifully by nonesuch records i luckily found this cd used and only had to pay a few bucks for it i would have felt really cheated if i paid full price and got what i did while the orchestrations are beautiful and the additional song between rapunzel and the witch was nice to have this revival was lackluster it won a tony for best revival but must have been due to some other factor than individual performances my biggest bone to pick was vanessa williams as the witch she was boring and lacked the feeling and emotion that bernadette peters put into her performance granted it is hard to fill those shoes but she just was not anywhere near capable of this role she sang in tune and she hardly missed a beat but there was nothing there the only role i really liked more than the original cast was cinderella she was amazing and earned her acclamations go buy the original cast recording or if you are looking for a good sondheim revival look into the 2006 london cast recording of sunday in the park with george,202,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,brilliant brilliant brilliant those familiar with sondheims dissonance with pay off and poetic lyricism will love this application to fantasy if you liked sweeney todd but want something lighter or liked company but want something more optimistic you will thrill at how well sondheim thrives through this happy medium as for preference in recording i can not yet help as i am still exploring them a major benefit to this recording is bernadette peters performance her voice is rich and her acting is so beneficial to sondheims theme and since she is the first to be recorded as the witch she has become the standard buy it go,107,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,stephen sondheim is a genius of musical theatre that is for certain into the woods is my all time favorite musical i was really excited to hear they were going to do a revival of it with vanessa williams as the witch sounds great right not so much vanessa is not as great as you hope and for some reason shephen thought it would be a goodto write new parts for almost every song or throw in every he cut from the first time to be perfectly honest this is the worst of the three recordings get the broadway or my favorite the london recording do not waste your money or time with this one,114,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,like many of the reviews i agree this revival is a disappointment as a fan of vanessa williams i think too it was a mistake for her to played the witch i enjoy original into the woods cast better,39,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,i have never understood the fascination so many have for this show I have seen it performed watched the dvd and have the cd I have spent hours trying to figure out why someone would call this good musical theatre i have seen more than 20 broadway shows own hundreds of musicals on cd and dvd i have tried to really like this musical but it is over dramatized stupid and lacks everything someone would want from a musical the characters are slow stupid there are a few comic moments but not enough to make the story a thought provoking jounrey i have not found a song yet on this cd that i truly enjoy no one is alone somehow manages to stand out but that is the only song i would listen to more than once all in all I had consider listening to a differant sondheim classic for this is just simply not his best,151,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i realize that many people think that this cast is much worse than the original but i think they both have strengths i actually found that i enjoy this version of into the woods much more i find that this cd has a cleaner sound wonderful voices and the addition of funny lines are a real plus some differences i think that are well created were the harmony in on the steps of the palace and i thought that a very nice prince it takes two hello little girl and your fault were better in this version of the musical this album is wonderful and do not get me wrong that original is too and i would not suggest passing it up the songs are moving and an amazing feat in musical theater,131,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,to me into the woods is one of the most inspirational thought provoking musicals ever written and this recording does no justice to it in fact it belittles it i agree with another reviewer when they said it seems like a bad community theatre production of this masterpiece it seems like this production is more family-oriented the show may be comprised of childrens fairytales but it is in no way a family-oriented musical it has very adult situations and complex concepts as do other stephen sondheim musicals that are notsuitabl for children making it more family-oriented makes the usually genuine characters overdone that is vanessa williams interpretation of the witch and almost hokey cheapening the overall message i suggest buying the original cast recording from 1987 with bernadette peters and joanna gleason chip zein may be disappointing but you will not go wrong with that cd and if you like that one i recommend the original cast recordings of other amazing stephen sondheim shows such as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street sunday in the park with george and merrily we roll along,183,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i love this musical this version of it is really the best a great cd for any age brings the cartoon charactors to life,24,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i have been a fan of into the woods for a very long time now i am currently in a production of it i play jack and so i bought all 3 versions of into the woods orginal london revival i love all 3 as if they were my children so there is not a bad one i think that the orginal is great i mean cmon people bernedette peters the london one has the best baker I have ever heard but the revival has amazing music the best cinderella ever and same for jack and rapunzel i think people who give this cd bad reviews is because they wanted another joanna gleasoon bernedette peters production i think if you are a woods fan buy all three but if you are new to it buy this first then orginal then london,140,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i first saw into the woods about five years ago a small theaterhouse where i live put it on from that moment i was totally entranced with the whole story i have not seen the revival nor have i seen the originals so i can not really compare the two still i got this soundtrack for my birthday and i have to say that I am fairly impressed i love it so much but certain things do get on my nerves it also annoys me although when people complain about the different people doing the characters whenever a play reopens there are going to be new interpretations of characters also complaining about the peoples voices is rather rude in my opinion unless you think you could do a better job recently some idiot scratched my cd blanking out the last three songs i like this cd so much that i am going to buy another copy which is the highest recommendation i can give,162,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,ok so nothing can beat burnedette peaters but this comes close this soundtrack is good but the acting is hit and miss baker and wife good but i like the original better narator someone please shoot this guy what is with the whole ok since the stageing is not as creepy as the old one i will make up for it i do not like him witch two different interpritations but still good either way prince better then before cinderella best ever casting jack ok is it posible that this part is played too young if it is i think he has done it little red good choice thesisters they do not have the comedic timing as the last group jacks mother why is she so old if jack is so young not that the actress is old she just sounds old the stepmother to annoying over all it is like the stageing has changed the music so much that if you are used to the original cast that you can not sing along the first time you hear it it is only annoying if you sing along with your music like i do i recomend this but i do not think it is the better of the two sorry,203,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,this play is amazing i saw the play a couple months ago and i just recently bought the soundtrack I am glad i did because i had forgotten all the amazing voices most especially i truly appreciate the voice of adam wylie as jack his song giants in the sky just makes me cry every time i hear it which is a lot because i listen to the song very frequently anyways molly ephraim is a great little red she has a very simple voice that will definetly please the audience the princes are very amusing with their agony and of course vanessa williams is a great witch she plays the part perfectly definetly buy this cd it is definetly not a waste of money or time,128,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,none of the principals hold a candle to the original this cd is a testimony to the sad state of broadway in one word if you want a recording of itw buy the original recording,35,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,sondheim has written a few beautiful songs but most of it is just tuneless melodies that arnt that good,19,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,this recording is a different animal from the original the cast all go in with fresh interpretations of the characters and the show has a different overall tone than the original at first i did not like this revival recording as i was so used to the original cast but i grew to love it once i got over the differences if you like this a must get is the original cast dvd hook it up to your stereo sit back and enjoywow,81,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,i bought this cd because I am a fan of sondheim in general and especially of woods however after seeing the revival production twice i knew this was going to be onedown from the original cast recording but i had high hopes alas even in the studio this cast can not come near to competing with it is successor the only cast members who hold their own are laura benanti and kerry omalley and even then it is difficult sitting through the other performances if you do not know the show yet by the original cast recording the only thing you would get out of this one would be the few changes that have been made if you really want to hear those make sure you get the other recording as well,128,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i have seen this revival three times now in it is current run at the broadhurst theatre in new york and honestly it just keeps getting better this recording captures the new production well but of course what it can not capture are the actors expressions gestures and other nuances to my ear vanessa williams is actually better than i expected as the witch she has quite good really those with an astute ear will recognize the always-terrific pamela myers think another hundred people in sondheims masterwork company as cinderellas stepmother,89,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,a prospective buyer should be asking two questions 1 should i purchase a cast recording of into the woods and 2 should i purchase this recording in my view the answers are yes and no into the woods is a great great score that is wonderful to listen to over and over it just keeps getting better some say it is one of sondheims more accessible scores i do not know about that but it does not lack for richness and depth i think this version and the original cast are much closer than some of the other reviewers some actors are better in one or the other the key to me however is the role of the witch who sings a few of the most poignant songs in the show and here i give bernadette peters a bigover vanessa williams williams voice is pleasant and very professional but bland to my taste peters brings verve and passion to every note and her singing is the highlight of the original cast recording what has most important is that you get some version of this superb piece of musical theater,188,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,the 2002 revival of into the woods pales in comparison to the original 1987 production vanessa williams was not right for this role and she lacked the emotion needed for the part of the witch i kept waiting for bernadette peters wonderful voice to pop out of nowhere and stop vanessa williams from singing i would advise you not to buy this cd,63,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,very few revivals have matched the impact and quality of the original production the recent production of cabaret is the only one that springs to my mind this new into the woods is no exception james lapine has chosen to revamp his lyrics and tinker with some orchestrations but why nothing is really added that makes the show significantly better or even very different the new cast is for the most part adequate with the exception of the superb laura benanti but vanessa williams makes a poor replacement for the phenomenal bernadette peters but all that said and done it is still one of sondheims most beautiful scores and enchanting stories,110,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,i quickly went out and bought this recording after i was upset with myself for missing the shows run here in los angeles i hated myself even more after listening to it wonderful orchestrations and the cast is incredible it is as if this recording manages to express more of the characters traits and personalities we can read more into what type of people they are throughout the show without having to see them acting it out on a stage vanessa williams really is terrific sondheim just keeps getting better,88,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,5.0,positive,wow i was not expecting this recording to be as good as the original one with bernadette peters the whole cast brings a rush of energy right through you vanessa williams is great she has a great witchy atittude which brings out a whole new her the bakers and his wife both are more young and have more angelic voices cinderellas voice is so calming and full filling the narrator has a great voice tom aldrege the sound quality is great everybody sounds wonderful as if they were onstage in front of you this is an absolute hit if you have seen the show than with out a doubt get this wonderful recording everybody is so joyful it will leave you singing and dancing to all the songs this is an absolute must,131,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,2.0,negative,to say i was disappointed with this recording is an understatement having just completed an amateur production of into the woods i was glad my cast did not have the chance to over indulge in this recording quite frankly there is little in this recording worth recommending above other recorded versions of the work why bother altering the music for a show which was orginally so funny and poignant and why make the witch an aretha franklin wannabe and why is jacks mother so bored all these questions keep floating around my head as i take it in doubtless many will disagree and say it is better than the original but apart from a couple exceptions it really is nothing more than a curiosity i really really wanted to enjoy this recording but simply can not maybe i need to listen to it more or maybe i just object to the changes but this not worthy of the name sondheim my advice to performers preparing this work is to use the original or london casts and ignore this i can only dread what they did to the script,186,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,i think this revival broadway show is excellent it is amazing unforgettable the new version of the cd is also overwhelming fantastic i think the little riding hood played by molly ephraim was great just as innoncent as she can be my favourite jack the sad young lad played by adam wylie was a bravo his voice really fitted how i imagined jack to be all the casts are great but vanessa williams did not do as well as i expected she has got an excellent voice but her role the witch was a bit distracting considering the witch is evil and she did not really bring out that sense of villian only she looked a bit silly she still did a great job in the singing but her acting throughout the show was not as great as her voice overall the show is excellent and the music is awesome no doubt you will forget the ending of ever after,155,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,my title pretty much sums it up the original cast of into the woods was irreplacable and this attempt is contemptable i am so glad that i did not spend money to buy it or see it i feel sorry for the friend who did although i hear it is going out in her next garage sale if she can sell it if not it is going to good will,67,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,I am a huge fan of musicals i lvoe them all but none has ever held a candle to into the woods the revival cast is well to say the least very good however they lack the the well passion of the orginal cast the songs are sung a little absent of the chachters vanessa williams is weak as the witch she lacks the passion and luster bernadette peters brought to the role she has her finer moments thought among them stay with me and last midnight one of the finest perfomances on the disc is our little world a song from the london production added to the revival other highlights are the bakers wife cinderella and the wonderfully innocent little red the actress who play little red brings something new and fresh to the role and i think really perks it up the disc also comes with a wonderfull booklet of pictures and lyrics but do not attempt to follow along as the lyrics in the book are diffrent all in all it is worth buying but make sure you have the orginal first,183,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,1.0,negative,if you are interested in listening to sondheims wonderful musical into the woods do not not buy this cd bernadette peters ia far more animated and charismatic as the witch in the original broadway cast recording with vanessa williams in the revival recording seriously lacking also jacks mother has no rhythm and the other parts are so far behind the spotless caliber of the original cast this cd is a waste of your money invest in the original,77,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000067G5Z,4.0,positive,the new into the woods is a must have this new cast of into the woods took me completely by surpirse the new cast is almost as good as the original cast and vanessa williams shines as the witch but lacks some of the power that bernadette peters used to make the witch come alive i was afraid when i heard that sondheim had made a few changes to the show i believe that the original cast album is a gem the changes include 3 little pigs a second wolf minor alterations of words to a few songs like on the steps of the palace and the editon of our little world in act one the song was cut from the broadway production but appears on the london cast album these changes enhance the show which i thought was already perfect this is a must purchase if you love the original cast album you will not be disappointed,158,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,2.0,negative,right off the bat if you are a country music fan this is not a country music cd i first saw lee ann at fan fare week in nashville a bright wonderful vocalist that took my breath away with her songs that was country there is not a single country music song on this cd if lee ann was going to change her genre midcareer she could have warned her fans her other releases were wonderful country music this is horrible as far as I am concerned lee ann has dyed her hair a bad job at that and changed her genre to a sort of blusie / jazz / pop type of thing and it does not work her talents are surely going to be wasted the last track 13 is an international release of the title track that is purely pop and intended to attract a new listening audience i suggest she release this cd on the pop side as it is a pitiful excuse for country music if this is the mature path in life that she has going down i will no longer be purchasing her cds,183,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,2.0,negative,i listened to this album a few times already the only song that i really liked is something worth leaving behind the rest just does not seem like lee anns style i enjoy all of her other albums just this one is like she has trying to go to pop in my own opinion lee ann shines best in country music,59,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,the only great song on this album is something worth leaving behind the album is really all pop to me and not very good pop she needs to go back to her roots and do country again do not waste your money on this cd,46,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,4.0,positive,having been a huge fan of lee anns since her debut back in 1996 i was anxiously awaiting this new release the first single something worth leaving behind is a masterpiece with it is lyrics and exceptional vocals the album has a much more laid back and relaxing sound than her previous efforts she takes you on a journey through her world this album is about love loss perseverance done with those amazing chops she possesses the highlights are something worth leaving behind i saw your light when you going to run to me i need you you should have lied and surrender not a bad album just let it grown on you,106,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,4.0,positive,i love this cd i am really glad that amazon had it because i could not find it to purchase anywhere my favorite tracks are he will be back and forever everyday if you like leann womack you will love this cd,40,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,4.0,positive,i think this album should have gotten more exposure the songs are very solid and so is lee ann womacks performance a few songs are not my cup of tea because the production and vocal performance is overly dramatic but this does not take away from lee anns talent some folks complain that the album are not country enough but all music forms need to evolve and diversify in order to stay relevant i know there was a lot of pressure to create an i hope you dance pt 2 but i think there is something very classy about this album something worth leaving behind at times feel ethereal i would give it 4 and a half stars if i could,118,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,if you are looking for country music try leeanns self titled release or something i know these are both great cds she has a perfect voice for country music strong with just the right amount of east tx twang this cd is for those celine dion fans who want to listen to adult contemporary music leeann has learned how to sell music to the masses and left country music fans longing for a return to her earlier sound,78,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,2.0,negative,i have all of lee anns cds the first three are great but this one is awful it is not a country cd at all almost all the songs are bad pop songs her voice is really good so that makes the songs better than they could be but it is still not worth having buy her other cds instead,59,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,5.0,positive,this is a timeless recording from lee ann womack from the title track something worth leaving behind to the oldtimey jazzy he will be back lee ann shows her amazing vocal talent in a wide range of country / pop style songs she has definatly proven that she can appeal to both country and pop music fans this cd is an amazing add to your collection and i highly recommend it,68,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,2.0,negative,what an appropriate title as that is exactly what i am doing so sorry that such a great talent for traditional country has sold out to the nashville establishment it is very disappointing when the record producers just do not get it did not they notice who dominated the cma awards this year you will never hear alan jackson recording something as mediocre as this lee ann womack attempt at copying faith hill,70,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,this has to be the worst cd i have purchased for a long timei have loved leeanns other albums but this one is truly awful,25,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,i loved her first cd and her second one was pretty good i liked the country part of i hope you dance but this cd really has nothing to offer a country fan the only country sounding thing here is a patsy cline type song called he will be back something worth leaving behind is a pretty good song but the version on track 13 should have been the only one on the cd i like it better than the radio version as a christian i really did not like jesus mentioned as just someone in history he is our saviour and our god i hope others do not waste their time / money on this cd let us send lee ann a message that we want her to get back to singing the classic style of country that she does so well,136,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,4.0,positive,the very first time i played this cd i listen to it at a very moderate volume and thought all the cuts sounded the same subesequently after many listening sessions i totally retract my original statement after her last spectacular releasei hope you dancei felt it would be a impossible act to follow once again i was way off base some of the melodies sounded very fimilar at the beginning of some of the cuts but they immediately flowed into new material when you going to run to me and surrender were teriffic when i heardshould have lied it absolutely grabbed my sole it was so powerful this women is a genuine super star do not pass this new release up it is a winner,118,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,talk about your sell outs i do not like country singers that go pop go back to your country roots lee ann i want something that is meaningful like patty lovelesss mountain soul not pop drivel like what you and faith hill having benn pumping out the last couple of years your last 2 releases do not come close to the quality of your first 2,63,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,2.0,negative,this album is certainly a change for lee ann womack but it is a shift away from where her talent lies her vocals are still beautiful but something worth leaving behind is a dull pop-rock crossover exercise with leaden production and songs that are I shall-suited to the artists stylistic strengths lee ann womack seems to be doing everything she can both musically and image-wise to suppress everything that made her original and exciting when she first came on the scene a waste of talent,83,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,5.0,positive,after the huge disappointment of kelly willis easy it was a massive relief to find one established artist who was still on top form from the opening title track right through to the last this album was an unalloyed joy there is nothing second-rate here the songs the musicianship the arrangements the production and above all the great vocals of lee ann womack are immensely accomplished all the tracks stand out with the title track and blame it on me as perhaps the most commercial it is only too sad that others in this overcrowded sector fail to reach miss womacks standard forget kelly willis forget allison moorer this is the real thing buy it,117,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,1.0,negative,i have been a lee ann fan since day one the first concert i saw her in she said if you do not like country you do not belong here well lee ann what happened to you there is only one country song on this entire cd i am very disappointed with this production,53,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,5.0,positive,i did not think she could top i hope you dance but it has happened using a different sound and style-she delivers yet another masterpiece i see album of the year in her future with more female vocalist of the year awards coming her way,44,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006AVEY,5.0,positive,this cd shows that lee ann womack can do anything it is mostly not country but it is haunting lively and very emotional this may be the best combo of country and top notch pop that i have ever heard and really shows off lee anns beautiful soprano voice it is certainly the best crossover of any country singer every song is great but you should have lied should be no 1 on the charts country and pop,80,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,three chords and a it-all attitude personified the band these covers are at times blissfully reminiscent of that successful formula eddie vedder and zeke pulling down i believe in miracles and daytime dilemma andode to beat the brat are some of the best sendon this disc other big-time notable efforts include those by the offspring i want to be sedated green day outsider and the pretenders something to believe in nowhere in fact is there an uninspired or at least original rendition with the exception of marilyn manson who sounds as although he recorded his cut in the vacuum of space meaning without the benefit of oxygen flowing to his lungs oh and steven king does the liner notes in a style befitting of the master of horror who also happens to be a bit of a headbanger himself it is a fondly irreverent preface to one of the better tribute albums I have had the pleasure of hearing,158,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,welcome to the world of tribute albums this land is becoming more and more visited in recent years we are a happy family is definately one of the best tribute albums I have heard every track seems to have a new twist rob zombie did a fantastic job with this project and seemed to capture the essense of the ramones i recomend this to any ramones fan as well as the younger generation who has not yet had a chance to listen to them this album provides an array of fantastic songs which willyou through the music that the ramones have given to us,103,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,compiled by rob zombie and ex-ramones guitarist johnny ramone we are a happy family has it is moments but is a mere shadow of what it could have and should have been as for what has good do you remember rock n roll radio is an interesting addition to kiss discography the ultimate 70s arena rock band finally embraces punk as they once embraced disco however briefly in both instances tom waits as always is a hoot on the return of jackie and judy and metallica green day and rancid all serve up various tracks competently unfortunately the album could have been a lot better for one thing few of the acts onboard have been regarded as anything like cuttingsince about 1995 for another few of the ramones contemporaries were tapped for contributions where are the dictators blondie heck johnny ramone has admitted in interviews that the cramps were asked to provide a song which was left off at sonys insistence for budgetary reasons memo to johnny ramone joey would have hung tough,174,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,we have been needing wanting and waiting for this cd for too long fabulous production to have kiss u2 along with expected tributees-green day rancid was a surprise but it works with the volume of work the ramones have this should be an ongoing project to include an even wider diverse group of musicians congratulations on this wonderful cd and let us see if interest can be generated for volume 2 thanks we needed this,74,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,this is a great cd brought to you from the twisted mind of rob zombie and it well rocks i may not be a ramones fan but the artists in this cd have great performances especially metallicas cover of 53rd and 3rd great and also kisss cover rock n roll radio the offspring and chili peppers also have great performances buy this album it is sure to please even the not so diehard fan,73,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,excellent record with an incredible collection of artists great interpretations of the original songs especially mansons dark and slow version of the kkk took my baby away eddie vedder delivers the most authentical performances and in my opinion the best ones ok I am a serious peal jam fan get at least two of this must have record phm,58,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,the big surprises here come from the bands that have the least in common musically with the ramones the peppers are great tom waits is fantastic rom zombie has a great bop-version the female vocals of garbage and the pretenders are very refreshing and big names like u2 metallica and kiss deliver very well the least remarkable covers are those of green day offspring and rancid they stick too close to the originals and we already have those of course nobody can beat the ramones at their own game but this tribute album is well worth your money,98,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,ramones were a happy family tribute was great the kiss track was by far the best,16,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,do not know what has with the revisionist reviews I have had this album for years and have loved songs from it for years yeah you can pass on marilyn manson and some of the others but u2 garbage the pretenders kiss and the offspring kick it I am not much into rob zombie metallica or green day but they do a good job too bottom line this is a great album for some of the songs covers are just that they do not replace the original so what do you expect here u2 puts a new spin on beat on the brat had to grow on me but the guitars rock garbage is just fantastic kiss rule the world as usual and offspring make a pretty good replication of i want to be sedated with enough variation to make it memorable oh and i forgot red hot chili peppers another band i do not listen to do a great job on havana affair buy it for some fun i love the ramones and I am sure they would probably love it too although johnny would probably grumble about some of the arrangements,188,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,1.0,negative,this tribute had quite a few metal bands on there which as a normal human also known as metalhead i would ponder why they would use such good bands to cover such a sh tty new york garbage band i love rob zombie but no one can make it sound rite the ramones are an overrated untalented band kinda like the acdc of punk so f ck the ramones cannibal corpse owns,68,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,i think this tribute should of had more punk bands doing the songs it is a pretty lame line-up if you ask me i do like metallica and u2 but they do not do the ramones the way they needed to be done in my opinion the line-up sucks but there are some good songs,54,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,this should have been and so easily could have been a great album as it turned out only four of the seventeen artists metallica kiss peter yorn and garbage play any inspired tributes to the ramones that would be enjoyable to their fans most of the tracks are such ludicrous reinterpretations that their departures from the source material approximate the tongue-in-cheek satire of mefirst and the give me gimmes or the flying lizards but without the loving respect or creativity of these cover bands this is closer to the golden throats compilation where we hear william shatner singing mr tambourine man a one-listen curiosity and a bore,105,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,buy it and do not wait for anyone to pat you on the back for buying it either you will understand or you will not from reading other reviews I am convinced that the slack-jawed punky brewsters of the current generation have no clue too much television i think why you must own a copy forward written by stephen king the strange and unusual eddie vedder singing a song of positivity quote of the compilation if people were not such [ ] cover art have a little respect and cut the rock-n-roll high school crap unless it was mr zombies,95,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,the only good cover is made by rancid because is the only real punk rock group on this album the offsprings and green days songs are a copy not a cover they does not put their own style so they sucks i think that thecover is very good too,50,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,there have been several ramones tribute albums but this is the first one to feature big name acts the results are varied of course like on any tribute album the young pop punk acts green day rancid and the offspring perform good faithful versions of the songs most of the other acts try to put their own spin on the songs the most interesting variations are to me by red hot chili peppers garbage the pretenders tom waits grammy nominated for his song on this album and john frusciante unlisted bonus track most of the songs are at least decent except for marilyn mansons dirge-like version of the kkk took my baby away which is god-awful this cd should be of interest to ramones fans who do not mind hearing their heroes songs played in different styles,136,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,bought this on a whim it is a true tribute to how many artist site this simple and unique band from queens new york as a influence the tracks range from intriguingly different rh chilipeppers rob zombie and tom waits to unchangingly consistant u2 garbage green day and offspring to just downright silly and uninspired no better example than m mansons the kkk took my baby away one of my personal favorite ramone tunes if you find this used for around 6 or under like i did it is worth it otherwise there are better ways to spend your time and money i guess that is why there are about 53 used copies for sale here especially if you do not have the original ramones recordings of these cuts classics just one more thing thank you ramones for saving rock n roll,138,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,good cd my favorite songs are i just want to have someting to do garbage outsider green day and sheena is a punk rocker rancid,24,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,1.0,negative,i only liked three songs on this cd tracks 11 - 13 come on people when the offspring have one of the best songs on the cd you know something is wrong you know joey and dee dee must be rolling over in there graves first this and then marky and the other guy sell the rights for blizkrieg bop to a cell phone company this is a cd for kids that buy a ramones shirt from hot topic and think there punk would like do not waste your money on this,91,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,the way this tribute was put together was simply amazing rob zombie seemed to know what song fitted with the bands style like havana affair the way the red hot chili peppers did it was amazing and marylin manson singing the kkk took my baby away was eerie and just bad ass the craziest thing about it is i hate the ramones i admit that there is some songs of theirs i like but not a whole lot they do not even have talent but to sum it all up this cd is amazing,93,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,1.0,negative,overpaid dull mtv approved rock stars covering a real rock n roll band that followed a path none of these corporate ding dongs have the guts to follow none of these bands deserve to be on this tribute except tom waits who is the only talented songwriter on this hunk of junk where has motorhead where has antiseen this is for dorky lawyers who read rolling stone and drive pt cruisers this is a tribute album of a rock n roll band by products that could not rock their way out of a paper bag except tom waits what has the point of this no mainstream crud cared about the ramones or dee and joey until they died which happens all the time no one cares about tom waits or rambles on about his incredible albums but wait until he has dead they did not care about joey working with the misfits which jerry only and doyle are no where to be found on this cd and do not even exist to alot of people somewhere some kid is sniffing glue and getting in a fight with his mom slamming his door and throwing on rocket to russia that is a more fitting tribute to the ramones than this hunk of crummy stuff,205,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,1.0,negative,the covers on the album from punk bands like rancid are ok but are total [ junk]next to the real thing are not all tribute songs on the other hand there has mansons version of the kkk took my baby away that [ smelled ] a lot rob zombies blitzkreg bop would be good if they played faster because the ramones were known to be loud and fast so the songs that were slowed down [ were bad ] do not buy this because it is not worth it,79,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,i know that rob zombie had the best of intentions in releasing this record i really do this fact does not save this record from being an utter trashpile with few memorable moments the kiss and rob zombie covers surge well enough but overall this record is a tired retread by bands paying tribute to a band who probably would have loathed them had they been in the same era and league skip it,74,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,i have almost every ramones disc available i formed a band in high school after discovering rocket to russia the ramones made me believe in the divine healing power of the power chord so naturally i snapped this up first week fortunately this disc does not make like a carpet cleaner set on shag it does however help us understand what made the ramones so special there is not a single song on we are a happy family that makes me want to forget the original in fact some of the acts here make such inconsequentially redundant versions that they sound like ramones cover bands,105,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,i saw this on a listening station at a cd store and thought I had give it a shot I shall premise this by saying that i am a huge rob zombie fan but zombies version of blitzkrieg bop has got to be one of the worst things i have ever heard in my life i mean it was simply terrible then bono trying to pull off beat on the brat was simply embarrassing metallica yeah ok all in all i could not find too much to salvage on this album rancid is good i did not listen to the offspring track so maybe that ones ok but the rest is terrible so why buy a whole cd for one or two good tracks a proper tribute would have at least had x iggy pop jello biafra henry rollins social distortion bad religion bad brains frank black and many other people who actually wrote music that either inspired or was inspired by the ramones,161,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,from stephen kings stoopid embarrassing liner notes and that is not stoopid embarrassing in a good way to bono mincing his way through beat on the brat this package is stunningly misguided kiss comes off the best which should tell you all that you need to know this is the ramones as product which goes against everything they were about one two three four chuck the thing out the door,69,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,you can not listen to a tribute cd the same way you would a normal album you can not expect the songs to sound anything like the originals the entitre point of a tribute cd is for other artists to put a twist on the original song if you listen to this cd for what is it a tribute album you will be happy if you expect to hear the ramones when you listen to this album no you will not be happy this album has great intentions with the proceeds benifiting the lymphoma reseach foundation it is a win win situation with this album a great album to have around,108,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,most of this is a joke seriously metallica sound like a bunch of old men rob zombie creates a disco version of blitzkrieg bop mansons version is a predictable slow and creepy take the offsprings inclusions shows how out of touch rob zombie is kiss eddie vedder and zeke rancid and tom waits are basically the only versions worth checking out rooney gee thanks weezer skip this and buy the ramones tribute on white jazz records that features the hellacopters sahara hotnights jesse malin gluecifer and more,85,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,1.0,negative,this is by far the worst cd that i have ever heard if you like the ramones at all you would want to hurt almost every band on this cd with the exception of rancid and the offspring very badly the other bands on this cd murdered anything that ever was good of the ramones i have no respect for any of those bands marilyn manson ruined a great song u2 did the same if there was the option of giving 0 stars i would even negative this is not a tribute disc this is torture to the ramones the ramones fans and anything that is ever was and ever will be punk this is a tragedy,116,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,the ramones what can be said this band revolutionized rock and roll if not for these guys where would we be today with todays mainstream dominated by pop-punk acts like blink 182 and good charlotte this album in addition to being a big old thank you to the american punk rock band from 16 great acts is also a reminder that there was once good music 17 new twists on classic ramones songs played by a wide aray of rock bands like green day kiss garbage red hot chili peppers the pretenders pete yorn and marilyn manson how could a ramones fan not want this album i most definately recommend buying it by the way do not stop listening after eddie vedder and zekes rendition of daytime dilemma there has a hidden track by the chili peppers john frusciante to finish off this interenting and diverse tribute to a great band,149,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,he completly messed up blitzkrieg bop but most of the cd is pretty good although the original was better i must comment on offsprings version of i want to be sedated they did an awesome job although they should have had bad religion doing one of the songs,47,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,i recieved this cd for valentines day from my girlfriend she knows i love the ramones when i first looked at the cd and examined the track listing my heart sunk i love the song blitzkreig bop but would i like rob zombies version but after listening to the whole cd my opinion changed this cd pays tribute to the greatest punk band of all time except for a few misses marilyn manson and pete yorn the cd is pure gold i would defnitly recomend this to anyone who likes the ramones,88,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,i have to start by saying i do not know anything about the ramones i bought this cd because i am a die hard kiss fan boy was i surprised the sheer talent of the bands on this cd alone is worth the price kiss u2 metallica eddie vedder rancid offspring to name just a few and the songs they played rock marilyn mansons might be the lamest song of the set and even it is not so bad the best probably belongs to kiss version of rock and roll radio this has made me want to get the ramones original recordings whether you like the ramones the bands on this tribute or just good rock this cd is definitely worth owning,120,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,overall a good tribute cd most of the songs capture the essence of the original one of the most pleasing surprises wastrack which seems to stick pretty close to the original the biggest disappointment was marilyn manson taking a great song and just simply destroying it rob zombies effort was also dissapointing still worth picking up,58,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,2.0,negative,this tribute solidifies what many fans of the ramones have known for years the only people who should play ramones songs are the ramones i am sure that the participants of this tribute with the blessing of johnny and under his supervision mean well enough the problem is that on the surface those who chose to alter the arrangments to put their own stamp on these songs have missed the mark trying to be different and those who remained faithful to the bands original version can not do them justice true fans will want this album to support the band and the legacy they left behind but it will not be something they will listen to more than a few times fans of those artists participating and casual ramones fans will be greatly disappointed there are too many missteps here to go track by track to discuss but the novelty of this tribute is that it will be perceived as just a novelty leave the ramones songs to the ramones,169,33
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,all in all this is a good cd the best tracks are red hot chili peppers rob zombie manson metallica metallica recorde 53rd and 3rd just like the ramones but the other three took good songs and put their own flavor on it the rest of the songs were too slow are too fast the ramones had it just right so why mess with it,65,34
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,5.0,positive,great tribute album only weak spots are the mansons track and waits track still good but the rest are incredible rooney does not even have a big label release yet and they do an incredible version of here today gone tomorrow personal favorite is garbages i just want to have something to do i highly recommend it for fans of the bands and fans of the ramones alike,66,35
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,hey mick and keith open your vaults and release some real rarities almost all of this is available from previous releases come on guys we know you have enough in the can to fill twenty 30 gig ipods let us be more adventuresome go with the dylan formula of releasing boxes and boxes of bootlegs they will sell do not worry,58,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,well i agree with most reviewers most of this stuff is readly available there three solid gems the live let it rock being one of them so yes i will buy this but really this was a shoddy attempt at xmas buyers i mean where are all the b-sides like so young I am gon na drive jump on top of me those three songs alone would be worth it they should have put those on voodoo lounge come on mick and co give us a proper rarities and b-sides cd,85,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,this is a very stupid compilation with two essentials and a few tidbits the 1971 live version of let it rock is fabulous and the 1974 b-side through the lonely nights features some great mick taylor guitar playing i always liked the steel wheels b-side fancy man blues but do we really need live versions of thru and thru mannish boy rare it is the version from love you live tumblingand wild horses rare it is the same version from stripped i wanted two of these cuts so i bought this cd hence a two star rating but the idiots who complied this cd were lazy and stupid in their selections,111,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,great cd exactly what i was looking for thank you,10,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,some neat songs I had never heard by them gift for my husband which he loves he listens to it constantly,20,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,it is a great album i enjoy listening to the rolling stones all of their albums are great been to a few concerts,23,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,i am enjoying this cd different or unreleased tracks some b-sides released only in 45rpm vinyls very hard to obtain,20,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,I am a woodstock era lady who has all the rolling stones best rock and roll band in the world bar none i think this is a most under-rated album i can not believe some of the reviews it is so freaking well done every song is live to me I am not a musician so i do not look at it from that way it makes my soul rejoice every time i hear it if you are a rolling stones fan this must be allowed into your collection and if you have not heard it give it 1 try pick any song i rate it among the best work they have done,103,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,despite the absence to a large extent of genuine rarities this album was my only way of getting access to let it rock,23,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,the songs included on this album are available elswhere i wanted the version of miss you and wild horses in one spot so i bought it,26,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,this compilation does compile many key stones rarities from the sucking in the 70s vinyl album and newer sources that are not currently available anywhere else to me the classic if i was a dancer dance part 2 is worth the price of admission alonce the stones need to keep this going and release some of the many unreleased some girls sessions tracks the miss you cassette version and the 12 inch versions of under cover of the night while i can not splain the miss you edit on this album i can not say that it is inferior to the longer original 12 inch version which is avaiable by the way on the do not stop cd single that promoted the 40 licks compliation from 2002 bottom line is that i can not imagime why a stones fan would not like this album despite the songs that are not here and the stupid and lazy mistakes in the liner notes,153,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,even someone like myself who does not own every stones album ever made can tell these are not all that rare but i like it and it has grown to be my favorite road cd as i work i like the fact that it is not a greatest hits collection but a mixture so do not buy it thinking it is like the beatles anthology but more like you burned a cd randomly choosing some stones songs and you will be happy with it,77,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,early in 2005 there were a few stones releases on the schedule that never saw the light of day stones freaks like myself salivated over the prospect of hearing these multi-disc collections which promised outtakes and unreleased recordings and live songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s instead we got this knock-off christmas release that amounted to nothing more than theft i bought rarities as soon as it came out for full price i had already bought sucking in the seventies given the crossover of tracks i soon felt like a total sucker as for airbrushing out bill wyman this reminds me of the recent double-disc compilation which featured a thick booklet but no space for mick taylor i love the stones but i hate how they rip off their fans and what has with the stalin-like rewriting of history,140,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,well it seems that neither abkco or virgin know the history of the band hey hey hey that is what i say will someone please hire a person who actually knows the recording history of the band the monkees have a better cd collection than the rolling stones and that is pretty sad the monkees were not even a real group stop issuing the same songs and versions if you house this stuff for too long pretty soon no one will care we will all be too old as the song says i am waiting,90,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,there were only a handful of rolling stones songs that managed to make their way into the 12 era of the late 70s and 80s and while they are basically all on this mish-mosh of rareties there has only one full length 12 mixed emotions is it is full 610 12 version as other reviewers have stated miss you loses a minute but also the new york mix of harlem shuffle has been edited down by about 40 seconds not to mention the original vinyl 12 version of the song had two different mixes the flip side being a uk 12 mix it would have been like striking gold to find that on here too instead of all these live tracks who cares as well as the full length 12 versions of the other tracks otherwise why bother putting the stuff onto cd at last probably the only time any attempt will ever be made to preserve these remix rareties,157,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,rarities 1971 - 2003 the rolling stones is a really nice compilation of rare tracks from one of the best bands in rock and roll history jagger is a stupendous vocalist and the lyrics are better then what most rock artist can put to paper i am not a huge blues fan myself but and the early tracks sound a bit too much like blues then again the stones can make even blues sound good and to me that is not an easy feat there are so many good tracks on this collection like the awesome live version of beast of burden the dance version of miss you and many others the book-let is very nice and the photos are of a remarkable quality i highly recommmend this amazing compilation of rare tracks both to stones fans and fans of good music in general,142,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,just a quick note-chris bushmans reviews are always welcome-i use them to help decide song running order and which cds get burned with extra tracks from the tunes contained on other cds from the same session such as tops and waiting on a friend from tatoo you get re-burned onto a cd with the rest of the goats head soup album to make it a more complete listening experience anyway the live version of live with me on this cd is the same version that appeared on the wild horses single so it seems that this is from the same sessions as yeilded the stripped live album the other 3 tracks on that cd single are all from the stripped live dates so I am not sure that this really is the same version that was contained as a b-side to a voodoo lounge era single,144,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,let us rock a good lick of the stones and their history some great material can be heard on this one get it and enjoy it,25,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,i like maybe two songs from the stones i do not get their popularity i wanted to rate it 0 stars sorry,21,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,first they release bigger bang in a deluxe edition a greedy insult to fans if ever there was one now this complete thieves ridiculous ticket prices a ridiculous number of greatest hits and live albums now this insulting sloppily scraped together rarities collection no conscience shameful absolutely shameful,45,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,is anyone truly surprised that the stones would release a piece of dung such as this they have been doing it for years look at flowers for petes sake the rolling stones have plenty of rabid fans who would gladly empty their pockets for a bootleg box set ala dylan so if greed is their motivation at this point please fellows exercise some quality control,64,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,if you love the rolling stones you will be glad you got this it is full of good quality out-takes such as fancy man blues anyway you look at it wish I had never met you through the lonely nights let it rock and the full length miss you enjoy note pick up the new deep purple disc rapture of the deep check amazon reviews as the virgin mega-store ad puts it unmissable i love those old british rockers,77,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,something stink on this collection of rarities bill wyman was missing unjustly of the credits and cover mick and keith are a really old bastards of rock n roll shame shame shame,32,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,4.0,positive,these are not exactly rarities i mean wild horses from stripped exactly how is that a rarity maybe if your car will not start and you can not get to best buy but that proviso aside it is a fun collection that does not flag for a second,42,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,this album is a disgrace the stones are obviously trying to fill some contractual obligation it was also a contractual obligation that led the stones to record and release the rarity co sucker blues which ironically is left off this album by the way bill wyman has been airbrushed out of the picture used for the albums cover that is loyalty for you save the cash that you plan to spend on this album and give it to a hurricane katrina charity,80,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,here we are in stones 101 look the person that picked these songs gets it thank god sure you have these songs on other discs or records so what listen to the music the stones are playing music they love blues american blues and rhythm and blues listen to little red rooster on the early rolling stones now if that does not knock you flat no hope the stones love willie dixon howling wolf chuck berry muddy waters i could go on but i will not american blues this disc is great and i wish for more this disc blows away this lastest crapola disc that is out i wish the stones would put out a pure blues album like clapton did i wish satisfaction had not become the hit it did in the long run it ruined the stones,136,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,I am a huge stones fan like alot of you i bought this because of the taylor era songs ttln is an awesome song i could not believe when i saw that this great song was going to be released an remastered i have this on a old 45 and a few bootleg cds but the sound quality is not there too many pops and more any taylor era stones releases are gems when are they going to release all of those gems he made with the stones the taylor / stones years were the best most stones fans will agree from 1969 - 1975 where have you gone mick taylor we miss your guitar playing cheers,109,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,the stones or their record company need some counseling do they want to issue true rarities here are some suggestions think I am going mad claudine emotional rescue outtake drift away criss-cross man goat 's outtake living in a harder love fiji gin some girls outtake yellow cab lonely at the top stones version not solo jagger travellin man exile outtake the list goes on and on when are they going to open the vaults to call this collection rarities is an insult for abkco some suggestions too that could make us stones fans very happy looking tired satisfaction early version with harp blood red and wine co k sucker blues gold painted nails highway child extraordinary let it bleed outtake jumpin jack flash tv version record companies should invest a little time do research and deliver true lost gems,137,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,fancy man blues the original b-side to mixed emotions sounds like an outtake from exile on main st which is probably the ultimate compliment you can give a single but the rest eeeeehhhhhhh i can not conceive of the quantity of narcotics it would be necessary to ingest to listen to miss you for much more than a minute the timing of bigger bang coupled with the timing of the release of this cd much like the release of metamorphosis in tandem with whatever-that-early-seventies greatest hits thing back in 1975 made in the shade just proves that it has all already been done i mean come on guys take the hint that stus death and bills defection should have given you and retire gracefully please do not pull a kurt cobain and have charlie die onstage just to get attention,133,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,5.0,positive,the reviewers here except for scott holter are 1 thinkin too much and not listening enough and 2 collectors who already have most of the cuts so ok but for the rest of the planet if you love the stones and mostly just have the best mastered copies you could get of the albums on vinyl and/or cd and even mayhaps a boot or two this will be a killer addition to your merely human collection the sound quality is primo for 16 bit and the cuts are incredible a delicious mix that was obviously pleasing to the ole boys themselves i was literally shouting out joyously in response to blastin thru this stuff this is great great great thank you rolling stones for this and the new album now give me more,132,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,2.0,negative,this is a missed opportunity with the exception of the previously unreleased live version of tumblingand two previously vinyl-only tracks let it rock and through the lonely nights there is nothing else on this cd that is remotely rarejust a re-hash of tracks from flashpoint collectibles sucking in the 70s love you live stripped another side of steel wheels and several uk cd singles a major letdown since there are still many vinyl-only stones tracks from the past 35 years such a lazy compiling effort,81,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,what a rip off i love the stones but i can not believe they have the balls to call tracks from love you live no security stripped and sucking in the 70s rarities of course the back cover does not tell you the source and year of the recordings you get to find out when you get open it up like i did,61,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BP86MI,1.0,negative,i love the stones but there are too many of the same songs on many of their albums why do not they just come out with a true b-side collection instead of this sad excuse for a rarities when i looked at the track listing it was pathetic do you really need a remixed version of miss you they could have done better,62,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,4.0,positive,i am a huge fan of korn and i have faithfully bought each album / dvd / singlewhen they were released however this to me is only worth getting if you enjoy hearing live recordings I have heard boot-legs and I have seen boot-legs videos and although they are sort of cool to have or to see at a friends they all lack in quality be it performance or sound quality this cd has some of the very best live recordings I have heard from korn if you really like korn and want to hear some really tight performances of some of their songs pick this up also keep an eye out for their upcoming live from the other side dvd shot in hi-def from the current tour,122,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,5.0,positive,i was not a really big korn fan their music is kool thou from their first album to the present iv seen them twice they are bad ass and identification like to continue to se them when the come to my town this cd is awsome it is like seeing them in concert over and over just listening to them jam,60,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,4.0,positive,being a diehard korn fan my review might be a little biased but this cd was great it made me even more excited to go to there show in august the only thing that i was unhappy with was the names jonathon davis called the audience but at 29 i may just be too old to understand that or really appreciate it,62,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,4.0,positive,mainly taken from the cbgbs free gig great live sound not too many rarities unfortunately,15,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,2.0,negative,the following can be said about this album rare all of you who are contemplating the purchase of this album should look the other way chances are you already have all of these songs except maybe proud a final thought would be this rare does not even describe the album cover turn it 90 degrees counterclock-wise ever seen george romeros land of the dead,61,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,1.0,negative,what is there to be said about this album apart from what your already thinking why why did live and rare make it to be a korn album tell me and I shall show you a green dog they should have put in remixes to all the song that were not even rare this is good music tho just get a beter record label korn,62,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,5.0,positive,pick this disc up on this album you get some great live tracks from the cbgbs preformance best of all you get my gift to you live from woodstock 99 this is a fantastic song live and it is worth getting the cd just for this song who cares if you have heard half of these tracks before support korn,59,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,2.0,negative,so this is what happens when your former record label wants to cash in on your popularity even after you have left have to say that this disc while not bad still leaves a lot to be desired it is a very underwhelming first listening and while it does grow on you it is not a disc that you are dying to listen to again for me the three-part another brick in the wall is great but does not hold up to repeated plays that being said the bands performance of one is a nice addition just wish they did a more complete version of the song my biggest complaint about the disc is the mix overall the performance at cbgbs in new york city is a poor live recording folks the vocals are way down in the mix and the bass is all over the place virtually on top of everything else no excuse with the recording technology available these days nice try epic but this one just ultimately falls flat,167,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,1.0,negative,first off you have to understand that korn does not as a group endorse this release nor did they choose what material would be on this live and rare album you see upon leaving epic / immortal for the virgin label korn lost all rights to everything they recorded / produced under sonys label therefore sony now has all control and can release junky compilations like this whenever / however they want now the songs are excellent do not take this review as me bashing korn i am criticizing sony for releasing these readily available tunes for a quick buck nothing is rare about this album i can not wait for the day sony has to sell off the korn catalouge hopefully korn and virgin will be ready to deal the highest bid,126,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,2.0,negative,not going to buy this one a korn live cd would have been cool by itself a korn rare tracks cd would have been even better but why the hail would they include one of the few rare songs proud on this i mean hail you make a live or you make a rare or even better you make both not this poorly put together compilation but a double disk one live cd and the rare tracks one the live stuff on this looks fine but you need the other rare cd with camel song i can not remember sean olson jingle balls kick the pa and any other locked-up slop that is rotting in the vaults i know i know there are money issues involved just release them separately and rake in more cash,128,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,5.0,positive,like pretty much everybody has said already buy it for the live stuff rare eh not so much the live tracks will keep ya happy although 999 well spent,27,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,2.0,negative,this album should not have been made not because of the music but because it was put out by korns former label epic obviously trying to get paid as korn promotes see you on the other side this is a suits album plain and simple as of the release date may 9 2006 korn has not even mentioned it on their website on to the album itself there is nothing rare here it is basically their greatest hits live many korn fans might even have tracks that are on this album the live version of metallicas one is here the same hidden track on take a look in the mirror however that does not make it bad it is fun to listen to and it is always a bonus when you can hear the crowd singing along especially the chorus but still this should not have been made at all had jonathan davis been involved I am sure it would have been better,156,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,5.0,positive,yeah i agree with the last comment there has nothing rare about this album proud from the movie i know what you did last summer earach my eye frollow leader bonus track another brick n the wall gre hits one take a look n the mirror however it is damn good live album good quality sound great for subs n your car it is the same recording from the bonus dvd that you get when you buy take a look n the mirror for those did not realize that so if your die hard fan i suggest you get it add to your collection new to korn even better actually it is like a greatest hits but live pretty much so buy peeps,110,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000F2CC3Q,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good collection of live korn songs but there is not really any rare tracks proud is probably the only one on here that is rare earache my eye is not really a rare track to me if it is a bonus song on follow the leader than you can not really call it rare i do wish the had camel song it comes on the end of days soundtrack should of been more rare tracks but what you going to do the live tracks are good right now and one are my favorite tracks good live songs but only get it if your a die hard korn fan it is not really for everyone and if yoy really want to save some money most of the songs on here you can find to download it seems epic just tried to make some money off korn,143,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,1.0,negative,i am in total agreement with lounge sound from fl this is absolutely positively the worst hotel costes volume to date boring repetitive almost put me to sleep i was completely underwhelmed at the first listen but decided to give it another try last night and was even more disappointed the second time around there simply are not any stand-out tracks on this one each song sounds like the next the other hotel costes cds might be hit or miss but there are at least a minimum of 2 - 3 solid tracks on each costes 10 has nothing to offer save your and pass on this one,105,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,i can understand how fans of the hotel costes series always expect incredible music and i will not deny that the first time i listened to hc x i was a bit underwhelmed however after listening to the cd 4 times i am starting to see the genius of stephane behind the musical selection give it a try you will not be disappointed,61,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,2.0,negative,i really expected a lot more from stephane this is his worst cd to date most of the tracks on this cd are repetitious in sound tone and beat boring this is definitely nothing to write home about i was hoping to discover some new artists but all this cd did was to help me despise previous artists that i loved case in point louie austen his song glamour girl was so painful to listen to that i skipped the track i just could not take it dephazz was mediocre at best and zimpala stephane picked their worst song as well what happened,102,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,looks like stephane pompougnac and the gang are back in the groove with this five star collection of gorgeous music i was a little disappointed with costes 8 and 9 was so much better but it looks like number 10 will put costes firmly back on the map as one of coolest and tastiest collections for your home or open air driving enjoyment the whole is only as good as the sum of the parts and this cd has a dreamlike quality that takes costes in some new and pleasurable directions where do these guys find these little gems i will not get into individual tracks here yet but needless to say this cd is sonic ear candy at it is finest bravo nobody does this stuff better than pompougnac,129,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,1.0,negative,i have to agree with other reviews that are negative this is not the best of stephane and I am very surprised by it can not say i would tell someone that they should purchase it not good compared to the earlier cds,41,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,i own all previous 9 costes cds and was unsure whether to buy this cd after reading negative reviews yes it is different from the other costes but you would not buy 10 cds that sound the same the costes sound has evolved and this is another fine selection from pompougnac i suggest you listen to it without bias and open your ears it really grows on you favourites would have to be glamour girl and fleur blanche,77,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,2.0,negative,the first 5 6 were great albums especially 4 but this one by far is the worst album created by stephane even worse that living on thei went ahead and both this at virgin just because i collect the series and i am sure a lot of people here also did as well but trust me do not buy this one and use it as a chance to look at other artists,73,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,i am a fan of this series and own them all in my opinion this is just the best of course closely followed by 8 and 3 if you like the songs with a little more beat this is a great pic i got it 6 months ago when it was released and still listen to it every morning as my alarm clock,63,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,i have been so pleased with all of the hotel costes series that when i went to paris i stayed at the hotel for the experience and the lounge it truly is an expensive hotel the lounge is about the size of my living room there were never people there i do not know what i was expecting but the hotel did not deliver the musical experience nor did it have stephane it is close to the eiffel tower i wanted to go to the buddha bar but was told to go first to the cantine du faubourg disappointment the mezzanine was fabulous the music the atmosphere the experience as far as stephane i have purchased all of his music and will continue to the next time i go to paris i will have to think twice about staying at a trendy hotel with no lounge it is recognition here in the us is because of his music,156,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,this one is one of my top four favorite hotel costes you will not be dissappointed,15,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,2.0,negative,I have been a fan os the costes seroes since day one and while the series has had it isand downs this release represents a new low was stephane sleep-walking his way through this collection,36,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,i have all the hotel costes cds and i loved this one in fact i think 10 is the best since 5 and 6 although 9 was pretty good as well apparently there is quite a divergence of opinion when it comes to rating the cds in this series my advice is to sample the tracks and judge for yourself,60,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,another great release for the series interesting quirky with plenty of variety spinning it a lot these days,20,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,i have been collecting all of this series and i have to say that this is the best one yet in my opinion well worth the listen even if you are not a hotel costes listener it is very good background music for home work or your favorite cafe sean,50,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,i have all 10 and they just get better every year great job stephane,15,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,5.0,positive,another great cd by the master himself start off a bid slow once you get pass the first two tracks the cd comes a live,24,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,1.0,negative,this is the worst hotel costes what a disappointment the music is boring and unexciting maybe that is why they will not give out samples to listen,25,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed after listening to the spectacular 7 8 and 9 disks it is different and it is not horrible but what a bummer,24,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,very chill hangout music soft beats and awesome sounding tracks like nothing really out there perfect beach summer beach music i would def recommend if you are looking for something chill to listen to on your mp3 player or in the living room when friends are hanging out first time around it is good and it gets better each time you listen to it,61,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,4.0,positive,looking at the previous reviews it just shows that in the end it all comes down to personal taste i have the entire series to date and yes i think some are better than others but all have something interesting and enjoyable to offer often it takes a little time i do not think these cds can be judged on the first couple of hearings true i do not think this is the best but it is still very a good compilation and the albums covers just keep getting better,88,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000T17ZNU,1.0,negative,i have to agree this is the worst in the series the series has been getting progressivly worse since vol 5 but this set is awful the first 3 cuts sound the same and seem out of place with following lounge / chill tracks the offerings from zimpala dephazz and afterlife are their weakest and the less said the better about louie austens vocals the only decent track sunday drive is already available on stephanes hello mademoiselle release perhaps it is time to end the series because there are much better lounge and chill available,92,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,i loved the first cd so i was so excited to buy this one after waiting for a long time i was really let down i listened to the whole cd with a sinking feeling where is the screamo where is the punk rock all i heard here was daughtry nickelback wannabes some of the lyrics where heartfelt but most of it was shallow and just like everything else you have heard before in fact the whole cd feels as if you have heard it before and better elsewhere this is frankly boring and very mediocre rja you guys go back to your punk-screamo roots forget mainstreaming yourselves because in doing that you have alienated the fans who really loved you,117,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,after the success if headlining tours and the platinum do not you fake it i was certainly expecting great things from rja their first single was not too impressive taking the sound I had come to love from the band and turning it on it is head however pen and paper the second song from the album I had heard restored my faith regardless I had be picking it up as rja has always been on the top of my list of bands along with 30 seconds to mars and monty are i however lonely road was too different i did not recognize one of my favorite bands the guitar melodies were often repetitious and without knowing exactly what happened with elias i start wondering if the sound was so dramatically different because of his departure ronnie pumps up the vocals this time around hitting notes that send chills of joy down your spine but the music behind the voice did not progress the new sound why the new sound anyway platinum records mean nothing is broken so do not fix it it sounds like they wanted to move forward musically they just too big of ainto a sound i neither recognize nor enjoy,200,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,first off I have been really excited about the second album since i finished listening to the first album so i ran out to target the morning of it is release dropped 10 bucks and ran to my car i tore the packaging and almost broke the case anxious to hear it sadly there is nothing blistering about this album i try to stay out of bands personal issues but i would say either the absence of elias or the new producer regardless of his success with daughtry severely maimed the signature rja-sound i kid you not as soon as i finished the last track which i found myself checking how much was left a mere two minutes into i fired up do not you fake it and jammed out why 2 stars well I am loyal to my boys and the quality is there all the songs are done well nothing sloppy but now I am listening to cat and mouse and it kicks the piss out of the new album the sheer raw bad-assedness matched to the raw emotional crossover of the first album is in no way represented by the new album,190,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,4.0,positive,i agree it is not as goot as the last cd but it is still good they rock,16,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,5.0,positive,mainly this is in comment and response to the previous review you think that they are going to mainstream with softer drum beats you apparently did not listen to some of the songs on this album a good mix of hardcore and more mainstream alternative although not quite as good as their original hit album i give it 45 stars,59,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,1.0,negative,unfortunately this is nothing like their first cd the lyrics are weak and uninspiring the music lacks anyor ingenuity even worse the vocals and the music seem to be forced together and create an unnatural rhythm that is just hard to listen to there is not a single song on the album that i could force myself to like i am not sure why they went the way they did but if you are looking for more of what you saw on do not you fake it you will be disappointed i will hold out hope that their next attempt gets back to where they started,107,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,1.0,negative,if you are a red jumpsuit apparatus fan and enjoy their previous album then do not buy this album their first album is an all-time favorite of mine for the intensity the good heavy guitar sound and a perfect balance of screaming and singing this album has zero screaming a poppy fluff guitar sound and boring soft drum beats grossss they are just trying now to be radio friendly instead of the hardcore band they once were 0 stars from me,80,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,5.0,positive,it is not easy making a successful second album after a great first one but rja did it the first track is smoking harder rock with great vocals so many good songs and several that really get stuck in your head there are one or two softer ballad songs too-a nice mix i am just crazy about this album there is not a song i do not like on it,67,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,5.0,positive,this cd is great my fifteen-year-old daughter loves this cd she said this cd of the red jumpsuit apparatus is better than their first cd do not you fake it it is more enjoyable because there has no screaming on it so you can actually hear what ronnie thesinger is singing about all the lyrics were beautifully written especially godspeed,59,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,4.0,positive,i was expecting more of the same from rja the second set was much more commercial poppy even it still had some really good songs but not of the same caliber as the do not you fake it set I am not dissappointed although because the more i listen the more i like it good job but not great first album gets that 5th star,63,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,1.0,negative,i loved the first album especially justify and grim goodbye the screaming gave it some intensity this new album has a few good tunes but they get annoying overall this album sucks do not buy it better off with the jonas brothers or some crap like that make a better album guys i know u have it in you that is grim goodbye awesome,62,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,5.0,positive,granted this is different from do not you fake it but the thing is you can not make the same album over and over again i think this is a solid and honest effort it is a great album like i said it is different for trja but it is different in a good way a new direction and i like where they are headed,59,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,4.0,positive,i was a fan of do not you fake it but i did not think it was the end all be all to music like some reviewers on here this album is very different than their first one and to be honest when i first gave it a listen it did not do much for me at all i found the music to be quite weak yet i found his vocals to be enthralling no he does not scream which personally i find refreshing but i think they are even more passionate than on their first one i try not to judge an album until I have listened to it at least three times through and boy am i glad i stuck with this not every song is gold but more so than not i think if you just try and listen to this on it is own terms and not as the follow-up to do not fake it then it just might grow on you not near as bad as the others reviews on here imply,170,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,do not you fake it is my favorite record possibly ever i could not wait for the next record i can not explain how disappointed i was the music on the first record was outrageous ronnies vocals were great but the music alone was fantastic to listen to jons drums were incredible dukes and elias guitars were amazing the louder the better what happened if i did not recognize ronnies voice i would never have guessed it was rja it is a good record but absolutely nothing like the first it is totally mellow compared to the first record that totally rocked i kept waiting for a song that i wanted to turn up the volume for but it never came if there is a third record which i wonder if there will be since i doubt this one will do well i hope they go back and find their true voice,147,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,where has the emotion the passion for the music like on do not you fake it is mia overall my first impression is did somebody let ronnie winter do the vocals on the new hanson cd the first album instantly drew me in ronnies passion for the lyrics he was singing amazing then this album brings the same happy tone over and over again reminds me of a bad christian alternative band i look forward to the next album let us try to make original rja fans enjoy your music again stop the charade in what seems like an attempt to draw in teeny bopper fans do not you fake it will stay one of my favorites but this one does not even come close sorry guys,122,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,volume 1 was much better owing largely to better selection of songs these tunes on volume 2 are not as conducive to sweet / hoffs cover treatment just too many popular songs in my opinion,33,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,4.0,positive,i just recd this cd in todays mail and am listening to it now it really does bring back alot of good high school and college memories i listened to these songs and artists and saw alot of them in concert the dead the raspberries fleetwood mac clapton bowie carly tom petty yes todd rundgren linda ronstadt john lennon george harrison bread and rod stewart this is another good effort by matthew sweet and susanna hoffs fairly faithful cover versions of songs you have heard many times before by the original artists but somehow they manage to put their own spin on them,102,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,5.0,positive,pretty much these covers nail the original but sweet and hoffs bring an affection to their tributes that comes across in the music the band the playing the vocals are all perfectly executed without trying to be too cute about it i think i like the version of yes I have seen all good people / your move presented here better than the original it is that good you can find instances of some of these songs on youtube tell me how a 53-year-old susanna hoffs can look like a foxy 30-year-old she looks amazing and sings better than ever I have gone back and looked for under the covers volume 1 as a result of hearing volume 2 brilliant stuff sweets pop sensibilities are sharply attuned to reviving some pretty cool stuff recommend both of these covers albums highly,135,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,once upon a time matthew sweet created fantastic often beautiful songs apparently having grown bored with this he decided to focus his considerable talents on creating covers with ex-bangle susanna hoffs track after track I am amazed at the lack of imagination this duo has put into their covers album series note to the artists if you want to do good covers choose poor songs and reimagine them into something better do not cover tom petty and then sing like tom petty do not cover classic yes what were you thinking there is just nothing to get excited about here although I am really looking forward to their 80s cover album which reportedly will include covers of relax who can it be now and i ran so far away,127,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,1.0,negative,i do not get this i have enormous respect for matthew sweet and susanna hoffs on their own but this work makes no sense these are not interpretations of songs they are duplications / impersonations of songs what are these two reknowned artists now wedding band singers i especially do not understand hoffs since her cover of steeler wheels stuck in the middle of you and lulus to sir with love is nothing short of phenomenal she can do so much better to any of you that would be a proponent of this why not just listen to the original since what is the point,99,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,4.0,positive,sweet jesus i love this collection sue and matt or susie and sid are such fans and the love comes through hearing their voices blend on the yes song I have seen all good people is close to bliss and we get the channeling of lost souls like alex chilton back of a car and george harrison beware of darkness with great reverence for the original i was fortunate enough to see susanna sing linda ronstadt in a lunchtime honky tonk in nashville in 1984 so willin is a special treat since vol 1 were 60s songs and vol 2 covers the 70s we can only hope that vol 3 see you next time will take on the 1980s maybe matthew sweet will try the bangles dover beach,127,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,5.0,positive,quite simply a beautiful rendering of these great songs they have done it again and i can not stop listening to it their voices are such a perfect blend that it would make the beatles blush and they render the beatles as well if not better i can not wait to hear what they do next more tours puleeeeeeeesssss buy this album you will love it,67,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,i totally agree with several fan reviews posted here that vol i of this collaboration which focused on some very interesting song choices from the 1960s was excellent but their move into the 70s falls flat unlike another reviewer here who thought this album looked great on paper but was disappointed when he heard it i did not good god who would want to hear this very sweet-sounding harmony duo cover unique un-topable songs like all the young dudes and bell bottom blues not me but i gave it a try and was right most of these cover versions do not work the only song i really like is back of the car and maybe that is because i am not familiar with the original by big star their attempts at country rock fare little better buy volume 1 and maybe they will have better luck if they move on to the 1980s also buy the thorns album on which mathew sweet works with a couple of other male singers on a fine album of original crosby stills and nash-style songs,180,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,i enjoyed volume 1 by these talented musicians and bought this one hoping for a little more interpretation of the tunes unfortunately they stayed so close to the originals that it just is not very interesting to listen to repeatedly both of them could easily add some additional harmonies or arrangements or even guitar or keyboard solos to add some spice to the tunes i hope they are willing to experiment more if they try thisagain I shall certainly be more cautious about my next purchase meanwhile I am going back to original versions,93,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,4.0,positive,if you liked vol 1 you will also like this one i am a geat van but was skeptical when i heard they were covering yes but they bdo a great job especially susanna who someone gets a jon anderson sound out of her voice if you did notmget vol 1 then get both as it is a surprisingly great job,61,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,5.0,positive,sid and susie matthew sweet and susanna hoffs take on the 70s with just as much success as they did with their on the 60s on under the covers vol 1 even to a child of the 80s like myself who has not a particular fan of 70s jams this collection shows just how good some of the music really was back then hoffs is right on with her vocals and delivery and sweets musical sensibilities really make these classic songs shine while remaining fairly true to the originals i must add that it is particularly worth downloading the 10 extra bonus tracks here on amazon as some of these exclusive tracks are absolutely fantastic highly recommended,118,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,5.0,positive,this is another really enjoyable listen the song selections are interesting and well chosen the cd is a fine listen in it is own right but also might make one go listen to the originals sweet and hoffs as well as all the folks who play on this are pros and it would be nice if they covered the eighties and nineties,61,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,take one of my all time favorite singer-songwriter-guitarists pair him with one of my all time favorite pop vocalists and have them record some of the greatest songs of the 1970s what do you get one of the most unnecessary recordings in history there is an effort on every one of these songs to duplicate note for note instrument for instrument and arrangement for arrangement the classic originals they are really talented musicians and do a credible job for the most part but in every single instance the original is far better and in a few willin in particular the cover is disastrous it is clear that these two have great taste my advice is to find each of these originals and make your own mix disc it will be awesome,131,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,4.0,positive,this album proves two things 1 susanna hoffs can still sing like a bird and 2 the great songs of the seventies included here are still great after all these years it was wonderful hearing them redone by people who were young the first time these songs hit the charts probably the best song on the album is rod stewarts maggie sung by susannah a new depth of feeling is added but there is hardly a substandard selection on the whole album it is just great listening all the way through I have heard under the covers vol 2 twice and i can not wait to hear it again,106,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,this is a gem of an album i love every song i have not much cared much for their recent stuff ie red and green freaking love this one and a rocking toni braxton cover who else could pull that off ignore the haters and get it,46,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,2.0,negative,has a few good songs but overall about as good as their last 3 cds at least it has some guitar solos which are rare in current weezer music from a once huge weezer fan who has gradually lost interest over the last few records starting with make believe all i can say is whatever,54,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,2.0,negative,ok so I am reading all these reviews on this cd and everyone predominantly likes this weezer album i really do not know what to do with this cd odds and ends yes i just see it as weezer oweing geffen 1 more cd before departing for epitaph and heres 10 songs and we will call it death to false metal and now geffens off our backs do not get me wrong i love weezer and I am the one always defending rivers brilliance and some of the stuff they put out and I am always buying everything by them and i mean everything but this cd is out there way out there and the reviews look like plants by the record label yeah this cd is as good as the blue album yeah i put this cd on and was instantly hooked what ok bottomline this cd is for curious / hardcore weezer fans get it to have it i suppose but be warned and this is coming from a pretty hardcore fan I shall tell you what has a worthy buy bigtime the pinkerton deluxe cd s wow the album rolling stone gave 4 1/2 stars yeah get that first this one not really recommended,204,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,I am shocked this only a compilation and not an actual album some of these songs are real gems for those of you critizing this album keep in mind it is only a compilation of songs and not an actual album,39,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,4.0,positive,so the album itself is fantastic i mean the unbreak my heart cover is reason enough to buy it but the album art is classic it totally looks like the artwork found on one of those tracts given out by jehovahs witnesses when they go door to door fantastic choice of artwork as usual,53,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,turning up the radio putting the cd in the car stereo and it is all the way up odd couple another great song,23,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,4.0,positive,weezer has been releasing for almost 16 years now I have got most of their cds but most have not been their best since green in 2001 hurley is to me a pretty good comeback but this odds and ends album death to false metal is just a great piece of rock-pop by these guys the first 3 songs really get things going songs i recommend are the first three everyone odd couple and autopilot just a very fun disc,78,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,2.0,negative,i love weezer the blue album was the first cd i ever bought and i love every single song on it they have put out other good albums since that one this album although is terrible there are two songs i like and one of them is a cover there are three songs that i dislike so much that I have removed them from my library the others are in between but usually i end up skipping them when they play the songs themselves are repetitive with not much melody or note change disappointed,93,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,1.0,negative,i think it is a running joke how many bad albums they can make and how they can lose all the fans they once had it is like a slap in the face each time I am done weezer,37,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,the cd was of the highest quality arrived on time and was in perfect condition the product was as describedby the seller,22,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,4.0,positive,I have been a weezer fan for awhile and i really liked this album much better than their past 4 efforts imho i added tracks 1 2 5 7 and 8 to my weezer playlist buy it you will not be disappointed,40,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,4.0,positive,there are a lot of hit and misses on this b-side album notables are I am a robot i do not want you loving and my favorite autopilot there are some bad songs but mostly good i mix these with the notables from hurley and i get a complete 2010 weezer album that is worthy of the 1990s classics we love 35/5 stars,60,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,2.0,negative,it is so sad how weezer continues to go downhill what a great band they were this album contnues their downhill slid what happened,23,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,4.0,positive,this is supposed to be the leftovers from weezers previous albums some of the songs are better than on what were on the originals but that is of course a subjective opinion in short the album is great,38,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,1.0,negative,are you kidding death to false metal-should be titled this is false metal this band is a joke an insult to all true musicians not my favorite band wouldn t take one of their albums if it was given to me free sorry weezer you suck,45,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,people are saying that weezer went down hill people could not be more wrong if you start from the beginning of weezer starting with the masterful blue album and progress you can see a change in the band a very slight change this is not a bad change it is maturity and more distinct sounds that people can relate to this album has a blast from a past with odd but pinkerton like songs it also has some new raditude not my favorite album like songs such as autopilot very catchy song there has the fast and fun burning my stack I am not suggesting this album is for everyone but it is for those die hard fans who own have early and later weezer albums and even the alone albums if you do not like the new album hurley this may be a stepping stone from early weezer into hurley if you loved the blue album and green album it has two or three songs that remind me of them and a whole lot like maladroit i suggest this album to those who want good clean fun,180,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,1.0,negative,i give up I have been trying to like my favorite band for years and this crap has finally sent me off theweezer is dead to me can someone please do something about rivers and send him back into a spiraling depressed state so we can hear more albums like pinkerton farewell,53,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,5.0,positive,there are some really great songs on this cd and overall i like it much better than hurley my favorite song is the odd couple very catchy and could easily be a radio hit when i listen to this cd and then listen to some of there newer cds I am baffled at how these could have been there b-sides when a lot of the songs on here are much more accessible to the greater population i really predict this cd will outsell hurley,83,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,1.0,negative,death to false metal is apparently a compilation of songs that weezer did not think were good enough to make it on their last three or four records if that is the case this album is exactly what you would imagine a collection of really bad songs where weezer try their hardest to seem relevant to a younger audience sadly at a time when most successful artists would be maturing from great pop acts to timeless classics weezer continue to trash their reputation with the same pandering attempts to look cool in front of todays hipsters you guys are getting a little bit too old for that it is starting to look creepy death to false metal an album that contains b-sides from one of the worst 3 album runs in the history of popular music is truly the worst of the worst obsessed devotees will buy anyway but the rest of us are better off purchasing the pinkerton re-release,156,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0042YY3WG,2.0,negative,seems like all cuomo does anymore is make mediocre riffs and couple them with whining lyrics of the past the songs are boring predictable and mediocre ballads I had rather pour cement in my ears i do not know how anyone listens to this garbage the weez took a left turn into yesterdays news not too long ago and really has never returned I had say that speaks volumes about the extent of their talent i would not buy this cd if i were you i gave it a chance for the sake of the old songs and I am sorry to say I shall probably never pick up a weezer album ever again the weezy fanboys on here will say differently but even for a half-assed weezer fan this albums got to disappoint,127,19
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,for my 4th baby i wanted nursing bras that i could wear out of the house that were as supportive as my normal bras this one is perfect it is lined so you can not see nursing pads through it and it is comfortable and easy to nurse in the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the sizing is a bit off the band around the middle is smaller than usual and the cup size seems bigger than usual i had to try on a few before i found the right fit but once i did i was good to go and believe me i have tried many nursing bras this one has been great,118,0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i really like this bra the only problem that i have with it is the side wire pieces are uncomfortable one of them is trying to poke through the fabric already so this could use more padding and reinforcement other than that this is a good bra,47,1
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i do not know who sizes these products but the cup size is too big by at least 2 i ordered the 36d and it was massively too big even for the 2 days when my milk came in that i was very engorged it is useless order small and return it if you need to,54,2
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the bra could have been made better without the elastic staps that surround the breast it is uncomfortable,18,3
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i bought this bra and when i got it washed and dryed it as the directions stated when i put it on immediately the wire popped out and stabbed me i am not happy with this bra and i plan to contact leadin lady the sad thing is besides the wire coming out it fits really well to bad,59,4
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i loved this bra i was looking everywhere for a molded nursing bra and was very excited when i found this one it works great and for only 26 it is a steal so far it is holding up well with washing too,43,5
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,very comfortable and functional a little hard to operate with one hand while holding a squirming infant cup is a little too cone shaped for my liking but otherwise i am happy with the product,35,6
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,the best underwire nursing bra I have found it is a bit firm but it gives really good support and although very full coverage is not bulky under clothes it is nice to have something i can wear under nicer clothes without looking lumpy it is not my favorite i have a softer non-underwire leading lady bra that i prefer for everday all day but this one works for special occasions,68,7
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my wife loved this bra while she was nursing our daughter she said it fit perfectly and was comfortable,19,8
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very supportive and great quality lasted the entire 15 months i nursed,12,9
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,wonderful support lasts a very long time more than a years worth of wear best one i have found and this is my third child to nurse,27,10
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i have used this nursing bra for several babies well worth the price best nursing bra i have ever used,20,11
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,to small and to pointy would not recommend buying this,9,12
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i have owned these bras for 3 and a half months and the under wire broke on both of them i wear the bras roughly once a week wash in gentle cycle and line dry poor quality,37,13
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,when i first got this i was a bit weary because the cups had a kind of molded shape it seemed unnatural to me as i thought it looked funny to me i was wrong i ended up loving / getting used to this i love this nursing bra it has support with the underwire it is super comfy and it serves it is purpose very well so easy to clip on and off for nursing purposes and holds shape even if you are not in properly laughing out loud i would definitely recommend this i wish i had gotten this from the start,97,14
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my boobs have been up in size and all around so i own pretty much every bra size now this pregnancy my breasts decided to settle on 36ddd or gargantuan as i like to refer to them 36ddd is hard to find and different companies fit slightly differently so i originally bought the 36dd but returned and got the 38dd which is working so far my cup doth not spillath over anymore and no side boob which is also a plus the band fits well on the middle hooks and gives good support straps feel soft against the skin but strong and thank god not rediculously wide so they are not noticeable under clothing the price is pretty awesome too for the quality i have spent up to 60 on one nursing bra thinking this will be the bra that changes my life and i like this one better for way less money I am giving a 5 star for all these reasons oh and the girls profile view is nicely rounded and natural looking not pointed weird or sad looking wahoo,181,15
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is amazing it fits prefect holds the girls up so well is super comfortable and very soft i want to buy like a million more,27,16
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is the last one i reach for in my arsenal of nursing bras the padding is stiff and very difficult to fold down to nurse when folded down it does not remain down so i have to tuck in under the underwire to be held in place which by the way tucking the padding is a chore in itself this is very frustrating especially when in public and trying to ready myself to feed my crying and squirmy hungry infant I have had people ask me if i were okay and if i needed help with something augh,99,17
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the support is great the cup shape is a little too pointy for my liking although update yeah i do not like this bra the rubbery material on the band going around my chest is not breathable and digs into me why not leave it cotton I am about 140lbs and somewhat fit but this bra fits so terribly that it gives me back fat rolls I am convinced that it is that rubbery material added to the strap going around my chest i assume that it is to keep the bra in place but not being able to move with my body makes for unflattering rolls of skin popping out it is awful and i can not wait to get this bra off at the end of the day especially on hot days when that rubbery band just makes me sweat,134,18
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,have used these since having my son 2 1/2 years ago continued to wear them even after he weaned after a year of nursing now still using them nursing my second son i recommend them to anyone who asks what to use for a comfortable nursing bra with underwire love the coverage of the bra the amount of padding is just enough not too much and the nudedoes not show through white or other light colored shirts i wear these all day sometimes 18 hours and they never get uncomfortable at the end of the day i only take them off to sleep and shower they do start to wear a bit on the top inside of the bra just below the nursing clasp since that part folds down each time you nurse this eventually causes the seam to give but even then they still work well these are a great product and value considering most other underwire nursing bras cost far more and are far less comfortable not super stylish but they do the job they are intended for,180,19
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits well but material wrinkles under clothing a bit like too much material just at the nipple part however very comfortable and functional,23,20
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,worst nursing bra ever sizes are not true to measurement save your money and get a motherhood bra,18,21
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,unfortunately this bra is too small around the chest the cups are also way too small and inflexible which would not allow enough give for engorged breasts,27,22
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,another awful fitting bra pointy cups rides up in back returned this,12,23
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i wish this came in a 36ddd but i make this work it is my far the best support and coverage that i have been able to find in a nursing bra,32,24
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,overall i like this bra so far I have had it a couple weeks and it fits well my only complaint is that sometimes it does itch / rub where the hook is for the cups but otherwise it is been very comfortable i like that it is slightly padded although it is not too thick i am currently pregnant so have not tried it for nursing yet but the cups are a bit harder to fold down due to being a bit thicker i think they will still work fine although i would buy again update i am now 6 weeks postpartum and still really like this bra and have ordered another it is a little harder to flip down when nursing but i can still make it work best of all it provides great support and does not cost a fortune,138,25
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very confortable and support bra easy fot breast feeding,9,26
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the band was much smaller than expected the cups although that is what made me return it they are not at all rounded like the picture they are pointy too pointy for any kind of natural look,36,27
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,bought this in size bra pre pregnacy to big will try to send back for right size,17,28
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,I am nursing my 3rd baby and finally found a great nursing bra i got a size 38d and it seems true to size i got a 16 bra at target and should have just thrown that money away that bra fit so terribly I shall gladly spend a little more for another one of these it is comfortable and has just the right amount of padding to feel covered and supported while out and about it will be good for pumping in as well when i go back to work I shall be buying at least one more of these i have not washed it yet so i can not comment on how it holds up,112,29
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,size runs small order at least 1 size larger than normal,11,30
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it was ok but the underwire poked out within a short amount of time,14,31
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,normally 36dd ordered 36d / e it is a little snug but i feel this is a good bra for out and about feel like it is a normal bra not a saggy nursing bra just should have considered supply and demand and gone up a size,42,32
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i did not really like the comfort of this bra i only wore it a few times,16,33
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,could not even wear it once width waaaayyyy tooooo small cups waaaayyyyy tooooo big not as listed at all i purchased a 34d and it fit like it was a 30e,30,34
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,best fitting nursing bra and well bra in general fits great comfortable and easy to use,16,35
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,other reviewers were right it is a tad too small in the band and it gives you torpedo boobs very noticeable torpedo boobs it also says it is padded but the padding is so light that you can still see your nipples through it not a good buy i will be returning it,51,36
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,so disappointed i thought i finally found what I have been searching for for the past four years it was going to be a supportive padded underwire comfortable bra that i just happen to be able to nurse in i read the reviews and they all said that the band ran small and the cups ran large I am a 36dd so i ordered a 38d when it came i was so excited i immediately opened it and tried it on the band fit perfectly the cups were padded and supportive it was so comfortable but the cups were still way too big like ridiculously i thought maybe i can still wear it and get away with it so i tried on a few shirts to see how they looked and they were awful it looked like my nipples were I shall shaped and wavy from the ridiculous amount of unnecessary extra fabric so mad,152,37
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,most comfortable breast-feeding bra i have ever tried,8,38
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love this nursing bra i have always worn victorias secret bras with underwire and this is the most comparable nursing bra i have been able to find it is very supportive and i like the center support when pumping,40,39
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,washed it twice and it fell apart fits good although,10,40
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,cup size was accurate but it fit snug around the back and the spine on either side of the band poked into my skin the cups did not fold down far enough for easy breastfeeding,35,41
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,both band and cup were tighter than other bras that i own that are the same size should have trusted other reviewers comments regarding sizing order up at least a size,31,42
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,after nursing for 2 years i really wanted a molded cup padded underwire bra to give a better shape and make me feel a little more normal again i searched for a while and am glad i purchased this one the price is great for a nursing bra and i have seen much more expensive ones at specialty stores and online the underwire is comfortable and although i wish it was slightly more padded i was happy with this it looks great under any garment but the sides do come a little higher than some of my other bras so i have to make sure that the shirt i choose covers it under my arms it is easy to nurse in and once the top is clipped back up it does not take long for the padding to smooth out again I have worn it out after about a year as the underwire is starting to poke through the fabric so it is time for a new one and i would definitely purchase this again,172,43
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,too tight the cups do not stay down scratched the babys face,11,44
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i wore this bra twice the strap broke on the second wear i contacted customer service and they will not work with me on an exchange 30 is not dirt cheap for a bra and i would have hoped i could have worn it more than 2 times had it for about 34 days as a new mother what the heck a busy newborn i was unable to contact them within the 30 day time frame so there is nothing they can do horrible custo merge service search for la isla brandon instead much better construction,92,45
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wish i had read the reviews first price is great but band is too small and material is rough and the cups do not fold down enough,26,46
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the clasp broke as i was trying it on for the very first time,14,47
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,love this bra it is my go to bra for nursing,10,48
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,best nursing bras i bought nice shape good fit comfortable and easy to use,14,49
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,great bra as others have said it runs a little small in band size and a little big in cup size but it covers well and keeps my boobs from looking pointed,32,50
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i thought this bra would be amazing but the boning on the sides is too long so it digs in even when I am not nursing it hurts and i do not know how making a bra like this is considered acceptable,40,51
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered one size up from my regular size and the bra still fits a bit small the material is great and it does give good support,27,52
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,best nursing bra i have found this was my third baby and never found one i liked with my last two,21,53
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the perfect mixture between a regular bra and nursing bra lifts you up so you look nice but with the snap of a clasp you are ready to nurse i love this one,32,54
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i ordered this nursing bra 2x in 2 different sizes and had to return them both from being too small i believe they run small but other then that the bra it is self was what i was looking for little padding and small underwire i may order this bra again in another size because it is what I am looking for,60,55
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered a 34 c I am still pregnant and have been wearing a 34 b normal bra but i am needing a larger size this however was too big the cups were dented and a bit cone like on me maybe i need one size smaller either way i need to return this one,54,56
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,wore it the full year i nursed and loved it,10,57
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the plastic boning in the side is horrible removed it,10,58
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,too large too bulky the worst and most unconfortable nursing bra i ever tried,14,59
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,had to return because it did not fit me right,10,60
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,not comfy at all lamaze brand worked better for me,10,61
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i ordered two of these one tan that i liked so i ordered one in white after wearing this a few times the underwire began to jam into my side the tan I am still wearing today and does not it does not even seem to have the underwire in the same place not sure why the two are different when they were supposed to be the same very disappointed in this one,71,62
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,extremely uncomfortable to me it is a scratchy material around the seams and in order to get it to be supportive it ends up digging into my sides under my arms and I am not a large woman on top of that the cups are a bit larger than expected especially in comparison to the size of the band and then trying to get my breast uncovered is a whole other mission i have to fold the covering a few times and literally tuck it under my breast for it not to be in the way so my baby can eat the only reason i did not click i hate it is because the feature of having underwire which is what attracted me to the product is nice but the rest is very badly designed in my opinion,135,63
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it sooooo comfortable I am going to buy an other one,10,64
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i was looking all over for a soft cup underwire nursing bra and I am so happy i found these they give me a great shape great support and are really comfortable,31,65
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,looks like a bra my 85 year old grandmother would wear,11,66
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,not a lot of padding and runs small,8,67
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,not easy to use not any different that just use your regular bra plus makes your boobs look pointy,19,68
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love leading lady bras as they offer good support for me and come in a variety of colors they always fit perfectly,23,69
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is been nearly six years since i needed a nursing bra and the playtex style i once enjoyed and found most uplifting was no longer available i really debated purchasing this bra but i am so glad i did it is extremely supportive a rarity in nursing bras go figure and very comfortable the cups are not too thick and easily hide nursing pads yes they do fold down with a little more effort but the support is well worth it the band size does seem a little small too as others have noted but the size i needed did fit if you need support this is an excellent nursing bra,112,70
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wire in the sides constantly pokes the skin and the cup does not fold down far enough to nurse easily,20,71
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,comfortable the cups are a little loose but it is a good bra,12,72
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the width was way too small and the cup size was way too big i usually wear a 34d but sized up to a 36dd since i am 6 months pregnant this definitely did not work for me the quality seemed good just not the fit,46,73
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,was like putting on a coney pointy bra ick i returned it,12,74
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,fits as far as general bra size i like the strap extender and it is helpful bra for inserting breast pads however it does not work at all for nursing the flip down flap sits up to high still covering a lot of the breast and the underwire impedes feeding altogether it is very supportive however a little too supportive for a breast feeding mom that does not want to restrict flow,72,75
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i like this bra and brand however i ordered an underwire style to replace the one i currently have been wearing and was shipped the same bra style only with no underwire i wore it a few times before realized why it fit differently it is comfortable so i wear it around house but it does not support and lift like the underwire bra does i think i was just shipped the wrongi like that they have larger cup size with smaller waist sizes it is hard to find 34d in maternity bras,95,76
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the band is very uncomfortable i tried 2 sizes,9,77
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this is the most uncomfortable bra i have ever owned it is ok if you wear it for less than an hour after that it is like you are wearing a cactus,29,78
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits a litte tight around but hoping it gives a little as i wear it these are my favorite nursing bras great support this is my third child and i have used them with all of them i started out with a different brand and hated them,47,79
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,I have always worn a 34 with no problem this bra is a tight 34,14,80
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,does not give a nice rounded shape as pictured it actually flattens your breasts in the front and pushes your nipples out toward your armpits it looks awful and is very unflattering,32,81
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,pretty good for a nursing bra fits well,8,82
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,returned this product too much fabric and did not fit at all like any other 34c I have ever worn,19,83
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the size of the bra fits really well but it is annoying when you are nursing because the flaps do not stay down like my other nursing bras would not recommend,28,84
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,when i received it it was damaged and the fit was all wrong,13,85
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra i have found with my first child i had an awful time finding a supportive bra for a 38dd they would get so stretched out after constant use they looked terrible under anything close fitting and the cups would bulge near the underarms but this bra holds it is shape even after constant use it did seem small at first but after 3 months it has worn in and stretched out a bit it also looks normal under a shirt or sweater i recommend this one and it is reasonably priced,96,86
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the underwire gets in the way of nursing and the size is bigger than expected,15,87
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great easy to use nursing bra the sides both clip down for easy access bra also seems to have a little extra room for the disposable nursing pads the bra is of hefty construction it is not light weight material very durable,42,88
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,so good so comfortable pretty it does not seem a maternity bra,12,89
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,bra was super awkward and way too small although i measured before purchase it was tight on the band cups were too big would have been fine since my milk has not come in yet but the weirdest thing was the straps were too short even full extended my boons would have to be at my clavicle for this to be a comfortable bra returned and not bothering to reorder,69,90
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable bra can not wait to start using this once my baby is born,14,91
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i had to return it because it did not fit properly even although i ordered my size,17,92
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is extremely uncomfortable the underwire digs very harshly into your sides and the nursing panel does not fold down the way it should in order to nurse it would keep pushing up into my daughters face the bra in general would be fine if it was not considered a nursing bra but with the main design to be for nursing mothers it is painful to wear and very difficult to feed so i do not recommend this bra a very large waist of money,84,93
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the fit was smaller than i expected and stiff i would not recommend it i had to return it,18,94
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra it is true to size and supportive and comfortable,15,95
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,while functional i could not wear this bra for more than an hour the band was too small even although i ordered a size up after reading reviews the cups were too large not by much but they were cone shaped and looked awful under a shirt since my breasts are not cone shaped the band was also very uncomfortable on the sides there is a vertical wire or thick seam under the armpit that digs into my rib cage i wish i had not washed it before i wore it for a longer period of time i would have returned it,100,96
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this full coverage bra keeps the girls in no spilling over the cups it makes my cest look perky not saggy i do not find it the easiest to nurse in but it will be my go to bra once back at work,42,97
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,love the bra i can wash it and it doest lump or come apart one handed clip make it easy for night time nursing or if i want to sleep in it it looks great under all my clothes highly recommend this bra i will be buying more as for how far it comes down to nurse ladies try rolling it under your breast works wonderfully,65,98
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,absolutely love this product i will not buy any other version this is a must have,15,99
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the bra was a little small i ordered a 34b it would still be wearable except that the front part of the bra does not fold down far enough to fit the pump,32,100
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i oredeted two bras from this company and at first was happy with them shortly after wearing them the wire on the side started poking out of the material stabbing my underarm on both bras now the lining is ripping i am very disappointed,44,101
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the size all around on this bra is off horrible fit and the pic is deceiving not that much padding on the cups,23,102
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a nursing bra that does not give me a saggy sports-bra look under clothing and finally one that fits and actually looks decent under a t-shirt i am usually a 34 f on the loosest hooks in other brands but this fits really well,48,103
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i know you only wear nursing bras for a few months but there are way better brands out there the cup felt not right too big in the center of the cup and too tight on thewhere it gives you a visible dent in your chest under t-shirts i hated the inner lining too i prefer just an outer lining that connects to the bra strap when you roll down the cup to nurse this bra has a complete circle inner lining with a circle cut-out for nursing it was uncomfortable and awkward for nursing using pads wearing undergarments if you do and using with other nursing tops and camis just do not,113,104
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this is a sturdy well supporting nursing bra has lightly molded cups like a t-shirt bra to keep a good shape and hide the wrinkles and bulk of nursing pads for me it seems that it fit a little small in the cup size and it is a little stiff out of the packaging it does soften up as you wash it but other than that it is a great nursing bra i have used the leading lady brand for all 4 of my kids while nursing and they are the best for the price amazons prices were half of what i paid at a leading department store previously,108,105
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is amazing it fits very true to size and on me had more coverage than the girl in the photo i do not think the way the flap comes down creates any sort of problem with my sons latch like some others have said it does the straps feel great and i like the ticket band this offers so much support i was a 3rd before pregnancy and i do not know if this compensates for the aimed increase in size but that is what i ordered and it fits great i can not wait for my white one to come in if you missed underwire like i did this bra is worth it especially for how great the price is,120,106
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,order a couple sizes larger than you think you need especially the girth size after reading other ppls comment i ordered 34 in because i am normally 32 but they were still too tight think i need a bra extender to wear them comfortably,44,107
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra I have ever purchased and I have purchased a lot this was purchased after having my 10th baby the padding is perfect it hides well also if i forget to put nursing pads on the milk does notthrough to the shirt usually great bra the band size runs a bit small,56,108
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,too small in the band and too big in the cup i would not purchase again,16,109
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,nice fabricator true to size i have several bras in the same size from other companies and the fit perfect or too big this was so small i could not fit it tooooooooo small,33,110
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cups on this bra were way too big,9,111
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,works fine was a little small around the chest i had to purchase a bra extender cup size fits as expected,21,112
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup size was true but the chest size was much too small a good two inches off i measured it,21,113
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am returning this bra the band is smaller them the listed size while the cups are a bit big also the flap that folds down does not fold down far enough and interferes with my little ones feeding the material is stiff and rough and overall it is very uncomfortable not something anyone wants in a nursing bra this is my first time ordering this brand i will not be doing it again,72,114
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am currently nursing our 7 month old son before pregnancy i was a 34d after pregnancy and throughout nursing i have been a 36dd this bra is inexpensive and is sturdy enough to hold my ladys in place,39,115
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this is an awful bra it is too large and too small at the same timeit is so padded that it will not fold down to make enough space for my baby to nurse it pushes my nipple down and outthe bra is cone shaped around the nipplesin addition to all of that the thread on the snap broke before i put it on i had to sew it back on,68,116
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,pointy boobs are not cute this bra makes boobs appear pointy I am so bummed as i was very happy with my other leading lady purchase,25,117
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i usually wear a 38d but ordered a 40d and it was ridiculously tight tighter than any 38 I have ever owned i sent them back,25,118
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,I am a ftm so I am not sure if this is a brand-thing or what but the bra was about a half-cup to a cup size bigger than the other two 34b nursing bras I have gotten I am going to keep it in hopes that maybe I shall swell up large enough to be able to fit into it the bra unclips and only folds halfway down right across the nipple not sure if that is because the inside straps attach to both sides of the cup or not but i see myself having to fight with it in order to pull it out of the way so my kid can nurse the other bras I have bought when unhooked fold all the way down without being attached to the center of the bra on either side so like i said i am a ftm but the design does not seem as practical as other bras I have bought and it runs much much larger than those other bras as well i hope it ends up getting used because ill be sad to just throw away 20,180,119
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,it arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition but while the cup size was too big the band was far too small it could be my particular body however i have been buying that same size in other brands and finding the fit to be just right,49,120
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,perfect amount of padding not like regular nursing bras that are granny like with no support i have 2 of these and alternate wearing them everyday,26,121
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,very uncomfortable and stiff bra the underwire stabs me on the side of my boob,15,122
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very uncomfortable bra did not like the underwire,8,123
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it is fine bra until you use it to nurse then it is awful the flap does not flap down far enough for my baby to get a good latch without holding or folding the flap in such a way that it is out of the way i went off of another experienced mothers review and certainly did not have the same experience that she did this is my third baby to nurse so i know what I am doing and what i like and what works well and i am not a fan of this bra at all,95,124
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i was disappointed with these bras i bought 2 for the great price that they were they felt cheap and i got a c 34 and felt way too tight the wire was digging into my ribs oh well this is what i get from ordering clothing over the internet,50,125
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this was much smaller than i expected i ended up going to a retail store and trying ones on and returning this one,23,126
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,uncomfortable unflattering size was not accurate i returned it as soon as it arrived,14,127
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i purchased the 38d and had to put a bra extender on the clasp because it was too tight i did not want to exchange for a 40 because the cups are always further apart then it now fits nicely and the bra as a whole is very comfortable and gives the support that is needed that the other non wire or padded bras give,65,128
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wires on the sides slid down first wear and dig into / cut rib-cage sides not an ideal nursing bra,18,129
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the wires popped out almost immediately it was all around uncomfortable,11,130
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bars on the outsides of the bra dig into my flesh very uncomfortable it is not a defect either i bought two of these bras and both have the same problem,31,131
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered the same size as all my other nursing bras they are all of varying brands and fit great this particular brand does not fit as well and is actually too big i would recommend buying this bra one size smaller,42,132
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits as expected and gives great shape which is what i was looking for after nursing two for a combined 28 months the padding is very light and definitely not victorias secret type padding but that would be difficult to fold down for easy nursing the padding slightly creases after nursing but goes back to shape after a while the underwire digs / rubs a little under bust but overall I am happy with the purchase,73,133
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i love underwire bras and typically wear them nursing or not but this bras underwire really poked into my breast very painful wore it twice and each time i got clogged ducts where the wire was i bought the right size 36f but the wire was just very tight and uncomfortable,49,134
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i got professionally measured ordered correctly and way way way too big so disappointed,13,135
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was way too small i would have needed to go up at least a band size,18,136
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the fit is okay but very uncomfortable has plastic rods along the side that are sharp and dig into my ribs,21,137
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,runs smalls uncomfortable as with what everyone else says the metal digs into your skin would not recommend,17,138
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,I am supposed to wear 38c but it is too snug 40c was just nice one of the cups were a little pointy but it was not too noticeable when i put it on i barely managed to latch my baby on and the underwire digs into my ribs not painful but not comfortable luckily my baby finishes her drink within 5 - 10 mins or else I shall get a bruise ok for pumping,70,139
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is so uncomfortable it digs into ur skin and is hard to keep folded down so you can nurse your baby it also has a weird shape to the cup of the bra i would not reccommend it to anyone,42,140
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the sizes run too small this bra feels uncomfortable and the opening is not big enough for breasfeeding perhaps only for pumping,22,141
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the material it is great but it does not fit me at all I am normally a b cup but since been pregnant made my breast larger I have been able to use a c cup now this one it is way large on me i love the material that it is made from very soft and stretchy i will change it for a smaller size since it is great quality,64,142
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,how do i send this back cups are big and pointy the sizes are wrong,15,143
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wire is too stiff digs into my sides and the cups do not fold down well enough for nursing,18,144
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,most uncomfortable nursing bra for me the pad that folds down so you can nurse is thick and stiff making it uncomfortable and not so easy to use i am a 40d and this bra it is way too tight for me wasted my money,44,145
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is little difficult to pull down to nurse like everyone says but my baby is older so it is not a big deal,23,146
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra fits great and actually looks good under clothes the only disappointing thing is that it does not fold down very well for nursing but with a little adjusting it is fine also after wearing it all day the under wires start to dig in i just snipped the sides and pulled them out and now it is one of my favorite bras great support and very smooth look with nursing pads,70,147
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the wife said the wires started poking out immediately in the sides and it was painful to wear,18,148
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable very supportive and hides breast pads well,9,149
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very pointy and not very pretty at all it fits very very tight and i usually wear a 40ddd well i bought a 42 dd and it still fits wayyy too small I am researching on how to return thethis is my 2nd purchase on amazon and i do not like the bra at all,54,150
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,for the price it was a good bra for nursing,10,151
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i like this bra so much that i may wear it even when I am done nursing it offers great support and easy access to the ladies when needed I have shopped around for nursing bras and this one is my favorite,40,152
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great support in the cup sides and back i have been through plenty of nursing bras with two very hungry boys to no avail i pump and feed all the time and this bra stands up to the constant use it not only maintains it is shape and form but it is comfortable i have seriously struggled to find a nursing bra to maintain shape fit in all areas side boob or 4 boob is not a good look and neither is sagging all that is gone with this bra,89,153
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,wire broke first time i wore it and it fit a little small,13,154
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it was just that i expected it is perfect,9,155
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,loved the bra but ordered the wrong size already have two more of the correct size on the way,19,156
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra is soft and not scratchy but the band size does not seem to fit like my other 36s do it is too tight and makes it hard to breathe i have recently purchased other bras in the same size that fit fine this one was just not a good fit,51,157
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is comfortable but for me without wire it is easy for breast,11,158
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,too small does not fold down baby can not get good latch waist of money in my opinion,16,159
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,a little off on size if you ask me,9,160
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,not the right bra for me just did not like it at all so it went back,16,161
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,the band runs small order one size up great full coverage no boob spillage awesome for an 18 nursing bra and I have had many nursing 3 kids over the last 4 years and still going holds the girls up high unlike other nursing bras I have had,46,162
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i purchased this bra in a size larger than i normally wear and it was way too small the top also gave the impression of unattractive torpedo boobs not something i enjoyed i will be returning this today,38,163
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i have now bought 5 of these bras i searched high and low for a supportive nursing bra with my first baby and never found one i can not go without underwire and finding an underwire nursing bra is really hard i took a gamble on this one and it paid off it is very supportive and comfortable to wear if often forget to hook it back after nursing and realize it much later that is a testament as to how supportive it is i am normally a 36c when not nursing but found this bra in a 36 dd fit best,100,164
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,so i like the bra and the fact that it is smooth and cupped nothing worse than the perfect circle you can see through your shirt from your breast pads right i would definately have to say that it runs a little bit small for sure although i am usually a 34 around and i am smaller now than i was when i got pregnant however the bra is definately running on the snug side in the band width so go up maybe 2 sizes the return process is pretty easy if you need to send something back although,99,165
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra does not have a good fit will not be able to wear this ever again it is very uncomfortable it also shows at the top of your dress or top,32,166
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra fit me perfectly and is comfortable it did have a rubbery smell but that did not bother me,20,167

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra fit very well it gives good coverage and gives me a nice shape it is a little bulky when nursing but not uncomfortable,24,170
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,bras in my size 38dd are sooo expensive this bra was about 15 bucks and fits and feels great i bought 2 of them this was the second one because i liked it so much,35,171
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this nursing bra works well for me i am exclusively pumping and larger chested so it provides adequate access and support i wish they had a 36 ddd but since they do not i am making the 38 dd work,39,172
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i like the shape that the bra gives my bust and i like the overall look of the bra however i hate the cups they are impossible to pump in and they do not fold down far enough to give my baby easy access i will keep it to wear when i want to look nice but do not plan on nursing much i would not recommend this bra,67,173
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra might have been nice if i was able to use it 36 d is the smallest I have found rib size i find that 36 is still too large around the ribs but the cups fit i was excited to find an inexpensive bra with 34 size unfortunately this bra fit way too tightly more like a 32 plus as other reviews reported it does not fold down very far for nursing it might work for pumping only maybe it will fit better after some baby weight starts to drop off being that it has only been a few weeks,101,174
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was extremely loose where the nipple is so it looks weird so i returned it because i would not wear it,23,175
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i was a lil skeptic about buying my size online but it fits perfectly i would recommend the product to others,21,176
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,band was a little small cups were a little large i do not see how i could have b-fed wearing it as the other reviews stated you could no pull down the front and get it out of the way of little ones face had to return unfortunately will have to spring for the more expensive ones,56,177
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,' even if you are full with milk the cups are way larger than expected they dent in and do not stay out the material is so bad it is like the equivalent of memory foam so when it dent in it stays that way until you push out the cup again which is embarrassing no one wants a dented in chest look take the cup size down a notch when ordering this one also this tends to cut off my supply 10 fold with the underwire so if you really need an underwire try this but I had go down a cup size for sure,103,178
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,after nursing for 11 months and beginning the process of weaning i was looking for a bra that had a little bit more support and an underwire as i am a larger chested girl this bra is very comfortable the straps do not dig into the shoulders on the 38 dd there are four hook-and-eye in the back some people have said that it is hard with the way the cups flip down but that has not been an issue for me again this is a very comfortable bra I am very happy with my purchase i bought one in nude and one in black exactly the same fit,105,179
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am a 34 dd and it was so hard to find a nursing bra in that size for a good price it holds my breasts up so well i forgot what it felt like great product,37,180
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i own more of these but apparently the girls are much bigger than i accounted for but otherwise these are great bras,21,181
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup size is too big and the band size is too small the molding of the cup makes your boobs look pointy,23,182
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,band size was smaller and tight cups were tight too hard to nurse in as well disappointed and hurting by the end of the day,25,183
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this is a size bigger than i actually wear could barely get it around me i was looking forward to having a wired bra this just did not work for me also it seemed like pulling the cups down would have been in the way for nursing,46,184
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i read so many reviews and had high hopes for this nursing bra i was willing to overlook the cups not folding down well but the boning in the sides is absolutely painful i ended up cutting out the boning but bra is still not comfortable would not recommend,48,185
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,got the bra and it was way too small i recommend getting an extra size bigger than what you normally would get,22,186
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i discovered this bra at walmart and they only carried it in nudei bought it and loved it so much i wanted to have another one in black walmart did not carry it so i found it here on amazon the black bra did not fit the same way as the nude bra at first the strap that went around my torso felt stiff fit too snug and also curled under and dug into my skin even although it hurt i put up with this for days until it was time to wash it that did the trick once washed it felt so soft fit perfect and i never felt uncomfortable again,112,187
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very awkwardly made the cup size is giant and the straps are super wide would be completely impossible to wear with a tank top very disappointing,26,188
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable very soft and great fit is the second time I have purchased them is my favorite nursing bra and I have bought a quite a few,26,189
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,wanted to like this nursing bra for the price but the fit is just awful the underwire comes up so high in between the cups that you can only flip the cup down half way right to the middle of your nipple and because the cup material is not stretchy there has not much you can do about it obviously this is not at all conducive to being able to breastfeed or even pump the cup itself in the size i ordered 34dd was too small as well so that the underwire would not even sit down flat on my torso returned this bra the very next day,105,190
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is seriously the best nursing bra out there i nursed twins to 11 months and it is the most supportive bra nicely shaped easy to snap on and off looks great under clothing i bought 2 of these and am so glad i did,45,191
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,everything seems well made and i like the style i usually wear victorias secret bras and this bra is larger than their sizing so it does not fit great hopefully it will be perfect when my milk comes in,39,192
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is difficult to size yourself for an appropriate fit after the baby comes so sizing issues are not really applicable needed to break in a bit but otherwise nice underwire support,32,193
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,first the band size runs small you should go up a size if you decide to order this product I am normally a 36 - 38 and the 38 felt incredibly tight and uncomfortable second the material is stiff and scratchy it is akin to wearing sandpaper on already chafed nipples i do not recommend this torture device let us face it we are breastfeeding we are sleep deprived the last thing we need is to star as a leading lady in his horror save yourself some grief and pay more for the bravada bra i had to learn the hard way i hope you will not have to now if you will excuse me i need to attend to my nipples,116,194
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i got this for my daughter and she did not complain she said it fit comfortably she said it will do the job,23,195
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,thai was somewhat large for me but that is how full coverage can be for me so that is not why i gave it 2 stars it got two stars because i could not return them if you are not sure of your size do not buy them,44,196
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am seriously so upset about this bra the cup size would be fine but the overall width is clearly too small and I am not talking just a bit snug I am talking it is the right size but will not stretch half way around my back i can only imagine that there was some serious mistake made when they were putting this together because there is no way that anyone would be happy with a bra that fits this badly,78,197
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,impossibly this bra is both too large and too small at the same time while the straps barely fit over your shoulders the size of the cups and the width of the band are larger than life the sheer volume of material used is daunting I am not a large person but wear a 34d in motherhood nursing bras which may not be the highest quality but at least do not cover your entire torso seriously ladies you can tuck this thing into your jeans and it will still rest just below your chin hence the spartan breastplate reference do not buy this,101,198
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,did not realize that it was going to be a little on the small size maybe if i loss weight it will fit,22,199
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my wife needed something comfortable during our last pregnancy she would recommend this bra it was a perfect fit and gives good support,23,200
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great value after wearing the first one i bought two more the cup size runs a little small but the shape is great I am in36ddd the full inner sling is a must-have for nursing moms with larger breasts i can bend over again highly recommended,45,201
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,good shaping separation and support comparable to much more expensive padded nursing bras underwire is still comfortable after six hours of wear,23,202
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,as a well-endowed woman for much of my life i have really struggled to find affordable bras in my size unfortunately this one was a diappointment fits like a 34dd on the largest band setting,35,203
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,a pretty good bra just fit a little too snug but overall it is great and other than being snug fits just right,22,204
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the fit is great and it actually has full coverage gilligan omalley nursing bras from target call thier nursing bra a full coverage bra but my nursing breasts always fell out of the cup to the point that i could not wear the bra without wearing a cami to hold myself together this bra is great i feel fully supported and the 3-hook design really adds to making the bra feel very secure this is a fabulous nursing bra for a very reasonable price,84,205
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is comfortable it does not come down as far as i would like it to when I am nursing but overall it is a good fit,23,206
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,1 great value 2 comfortable but had to order one size bigger in both strap and cup i looked at a ton of nursing bras online and in the stores this one had all the features i was looking for full coverage underwire straps adjust from the front and double sided attachment where the cup folds down i originally ordered the 38d because that is what all my other bras are and i measured myself to double check i wore it for a few weeks and decided it was just too small there was no cleavage separation and the band was leaving an imprint by the end of the day so i ordered the 40dd much better fit and fine for daily wear i have been wearing this one daily to work for a few weeks now and i am perfectly happy looks good under my clothes but if i wear my thicker reusable nursing pads you can sometimes see the outline no issue with disposable pads,167,207
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the flap will not go down far enough while nursing and not comfortable very disappointed since that is main purpose of the bra,23,208
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,ended up returning not a good bra did not fit right size was off and was uncomfortable cups felt like cardboard would not recommend,22,209
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i got this bra in the mail and was really excited to try it on i got my typical size of a 34b and the band was way too small it barely clasped in the back and the cups were really big also i do not recommend getting a nursing bra with underwire it does not fold down very efficiently and is just overall awkward,64,210
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits well thank you i am using a nursing bra for the first time it is a little hard to get used to,22,211
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the band runs small and the cups run big when the bra is unhooked to nurse the cup does not fold down enough so it is difficult to nurse in terrible bra,31,212
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i returned this bra the cups are pointed and do not fit right it is impossible to breastfeed because the flaps only come down half way,24,213
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,feels like it runs a size smaller then it is supposed to be if i had known i would not have bought looks like great material,25,214
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i was disappointed this was not even close to true size i was afraid to order the next size up for fear it would not fit either also the material is very rough,31,215
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i loved this nursing bra it held up great and i washed well i would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality nursing bra,26,216
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i had another bra from leading lady and hoped this one would be just as nice even although it was a different model the bra fit much tighter than the one i had even although they are the same size i also wore it only twice and the top strap broke off the plastic ring snapped i am really disappointed,60,217
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,was a nice quality and function but the circumference at the ribs was much too small for a 34 even on loosest hook,23,218
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i bought this because of the good reviews but found it to be a bad choice this bra squeaked when i moved my arms and was very uncomfortable the strap snapped when i was on a walk with my friend and was not able to be fixed i would not by this bra again,54,219
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered this bra because it was one of the few i could find in a 34d however the cup size was very odd plus the underwires came up so high that it was nearly impossible to breastfeed in i have another underwire nursing bra that is not this way and had hoped this one would work out not for me,61,220
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this was by far the best fitting under-wire nursing bra i have tried 4 brackets in the back for closure,20,221
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra may be better for longer waist larger bust it fits awful on me short waist 32c the cups do not fold down enough to nurse making the bra useless I am wondering why a good nursing bra is so hard to find,43,222
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is great for a heavy chestedlike me keeps the girls where they belong even when my daughter goes awhile between feedings the boning in the sides hurt me but i simply removed it and have loved this bra ever since,44,223
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it is way to tight i could barely get one clasp done i normally wear a 36 but opted to go a size bigger also the straps did not seem to have a lot of adjustment in it,37,224
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,very firm padding even after a wash it has not sagged like other nursing bras i had purchased a bit tight for me it maybe i selected the wrong size otherwise it is worth the purchase,35,225
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,nursing bras were not comfortable but i have to say this one surprised me with the comfort it provided and support,21,226
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,first time wearing this and the underwire is poking me on the side already very disappointed will have to cut it out,22,227
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was smaller than the expected size but then also had a weird pucker in the middle of both cups that stuck out too far,26,228
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is very stiff and uncomfortable it did not size to what size bra i normally get cup size was fine but the size around runs small,28,229
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this product fits well and is very comfortable it is easy to manipulate and it is very sturdy with repeated washings,21,230
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i am normally a size 38 ddd but 2 sizes bigger when nursing i got the largest size which was my normal size which worked out alright it started falling apart the 4 t h time being worn i only wore it for 3 or 4 hour long stretches for church the foam padding was showing because of the stitches coming undone if it had stayed together i would of bought more as it makes me look good and feel good it was hard to get my breast out to nurse and difficult to clasp together,95,231
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this is a heavy-duty bra that gives good support and a nice shape i said somewhat small for the fit but i do not mean the cups those i find true to size i do find that the frame of it is narrower than i like meaning i guess the space between the cups the motherhood maternity bras work better there for me as others have said the cups are stiff also because the inner support the part that remains when you fold the cup down encircles the breast i just find it a bit harder to get everything where i need it even for pumping but it is doable not my first choice for nursing but it is a good bra if you will be pumping finally this is a pretty old school bra in terms of coverage so you will not want to wear low necklines with it,147,232
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very supportive bra keeps the girls from sagging padded cups provide modesty for overly sensitive nipples i wear this to work when I shall be pumping the padded cups do make nursing the baby a little more complicated but still doable definitely the best nursing bra I have tried for work and outings complicated,52,233
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i tried this bra on when it first got here and it felt fantastic i finally had the support i was wishing for when i purchased it i would have loved everything about it but it made my chest look super pointy if you do not mind having the pointy my breasts are looking at the sky look then this is the bra for you it has everything you could want in a nursing bra really good support i was able to return it for free with no hassle if you do not like this one but are desperate for a good bra look into the bali womens concealers back smoothing underwire bra i purchased it next and although it is not for nursing it was only 13 and an absolute dream come true,130,234
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra feels so stiff when nursing it dosent fold down easily so it is uncomfortable for mom and baby i would not buy this one again,26,235
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first child and she really liked it the quality seemed to be really nice and the price was really affordable compared to other nursing bras hopefully this will work well for her,42,236

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra on the market i love the fit the quality the underwire and the durability this bra is comfortable and holds up well through the day,31,241
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i took a gamble on the size and i got it right however the way this bra is constructed it gives you pointy cone boobs that will appear under your clothing i am returning it in exchange for the bravado silk seamless nursing bra which is super comfortable and has sufficient padding to cover my lady bits but looks natural,60,242
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,I am very happy with this nursing bra it is very supporting and it fits as expected to my normal bra size i would buy again,25,243
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i like the design of the bra it lifts but my boobs spill out on the size and the fabric is stiff it does not stretch,26,244
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am rating this 5 out of 5 because shipping was fast and on time also because the product fit good and was comfortable i would recommend this for anyone looking for a good nursing bra it is very supportive without pinching,42,245
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought this bra because now i will be a mother in october and as soon as i arrived i experienced it is firm comfortable her breasts are firm feel good was not left was on the measure,38,246
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i really liked the shape and fit of this bra unfortunately the nursing snap piece broke in half when i was unlatching it i had used the bra twice i tried to superglue it back together but to no avail disappointing,41,247
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,fits awkwardly the part where the cups clip comes way up high almost to my collar bone also pinches under my arms,22,248
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i am size 34 pre-pregnancy my nursing bras are size 36 and they fit right this bra fits a little bit tight it does not feel like it is size 36 but it is okay the cup size is a bit big but over all it works serves it is purpose to give me support,51,249
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am incredibly disappointed in this bra i wore it once and it was awful there was a plastic piece sticking out on the right side that dug into me the entire day i would have complained and asked for my money back but they will not do that unless you send the product back well i have a newborn so it is not easy to get out so they win they have my money and i had to throw the bra out i went to target and bought one that is much more comfortable,93,250
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it s just iike i expect it is a great protection foor my wife and very confortable the desing is just what she expect,23,251
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,make sure that you get fitted properly by a professional after giving birth otherwise you will be waisting time and money,20,252
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra does not fold down enough to allow for nursing immediately returned it i do not recommend this bra,20,253
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra fits like a tanker it is very stiff heavy and uncomfortable i wish i had not taken the tags off before i tried on usually i can buy a 34d without trying on i prefer the motherhood brand of nursing bras they are light weight and true to size i just wanted the convenience of amazon to deliver a nursing bra but this did not work out,69,254
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the size is completely off and it is too thick so in summer time you will be sweating i did not like it at all,24,255
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,these are great nursing bras with lots of support especially if you are a larger breasted woman they also run true to size,23,256
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,so I have bought at least 8 nursing bras in the 7 months since I have had my son this one is my favorite so far i have rather large breast and it provides good support and shape but is still comfortable it lost a star just because it is full coverage and i can not wear with some tops,56,257
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i have had a hard time finding a nursing bra with underwire for bigger busts and this one is perfect i have two of them and they are the only ones i will wear it seems a little tight at first but does loosen up some as it is worn a bit which was perfect because it seemed a little small for the size i needed when the outer cups pop down the inner holsters around the breast are complete rather than just one sided and are great for nursing only downfall of this set up is it is not particularly easy to get your breast back into the cup with one hand in any position that looks even slightly normal a little awkward for nursing in public but can be done overall i love it and recommend it edit and star change after years of using these bras exclusively something changed i do not know if they changed manufacturers or what but the new bras I have ordered this year have been horrible they are tight in weird places the cups do not hold they dig and are insanely stiff i no longer recommend this product,192,258
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup folds down right at nipple level so this may work for pumping but it is terrible for breastfeeding because the baby can not get a latch on anything more than the nipple it teaches a bad latch in my opinion I am keeping it only for pumping,46,259
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,tried it on and there were weird dimples in the middle of the cups openings for nursing the cup and band size seemed to be correct for me but the bra cups were just terrible i returned this immediately and would not recommend this product to anyone unless you like looking like you have deflated boobs,56,260
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,been having a hard time finding a nursing bra that gave me good support and made my boobs look normal I am a dd and almost an e and most nursing bras are horribly unsupportive i bought this based on the reviews i like it gives good support comfortable and a nice shape closet thing to a normal bra that i have found it has molded cups so it hides the nursing pads well the snaps are good an sturdy so far it is been a great bra and reasonably priced I have always worn underwire bras as have never found a bra without underwires that gave me support it is a great bra for daytime under your normal clothes the only thing that is kind of annoying is the molded cups while i like them for hiding nursing pads and such it is a bit annoying to have to push the molded cup down out of the way to nurse or pump that is the reason i have 4 stars and not 5 other than that definitely worth the purchase fits pretty true to size,181,261
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra has a great shape that stays it fits great and i would recommend this for any nursing mother i will buy this again,25,262
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,overall the bra fits great and allows for great mobility i love the support of the inside the design is especially great for larger chested women,26,263
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the perfect nursing bra for out of the house i have other sleeping nursing bras but i would not wear them out of the house this one looks and feels just like a regular bra only with great quick nursing access,40,264
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it fits well but the wire is poking out I have been washin it on delicate that is the only dissapoint as i was hoping that this bra would last the last three months of nursing,35,265
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is perfect and comfortable this is the second one and i love them both perfect for nursing and durable,21,266
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,maybe it is just me-but this bra is not only the most uncomfortable bra ever it is not true to size and I have been around the block or two when it comes to nursing bras and regular bras and not ergonomically designed what so ever,43,267
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,first i have to say that this is comfortable moreso than i was expecting from an underwire and it does have great support I am currently an e / f cup and i was definitely pleased with the support however the cups are a little on the thin side and so it does not exactly hide nursing nipples not great for under fitted t-shirts but it works great with thicker shirts,67,268
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought these in 42dd i normally wear 40 f / ddd and it fit okay and worked okay and the underwires did not poke me or come out it was supportive enough for full breasts and i nursed my babe for 18 mos using this bra rotating every week with 2 other bras of course,53,269
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i bought this bra based on it is good reviews i bought it just a little over a month ago it is true to size and i found it to be very comfortable my problem with it is that it is ripping and fraying just after a month of wearing it i am very disappointed in the poor quality of the bra,60,270
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great fit true to size gives great support comfy one hand clip works perfectly fine will definitely buy another after looping months of trying to find the perfect bra for nursing,31,271
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i went to victoria secret and had them measure me so i knew my size then i ordered this bra it gives good support so you look nice and opens easily for it is job the cups have retained their shape over time as well better than the bras i bought at motherhood and jc penny in the past,58,272
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i really like this product and i would recomend everyone to get this it is great good and efficient product,20,273
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra is great i am very glad i made this purchase i am rather large and this bra gives great support it does have an underwire but i have not noticed it affecting my milk production at all i used the sizing suggestions given by others and it fits perfectly the only problem with it that i have had is that after only about a month the underwire started popping out of the bra so i had to sew it back in place other than that i must say that i really do love this bra and would highly recommend it,101,274
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love this bra i was searching high and wide for a nice neutral t shirt nursing bra that gave good support and was high enough on the middle and sides to contain my breasts i am a 34d and it can be hard to find a decent full coverage nursing bra that lifts and seperates my breasts that seem to be made ofthese days this bra really does the trick it is extremely supportive without looking so the underwire and the inner sling that resembles a triangle with an opening for your areola really keeps your breasts in place and that is with running around a bending over to pick up after a 4 year old all day even with it being so supportive the straps are not ugly and thick and the bra looks normal it is also really cheap yet made well the snap is easily undone with one hand it is so comfortable that i literally slept in it the first night i got it and wore it the entire next day-and it left no red marks or chafing in any areas most bras always irritate me at night highly reccommend,193,275
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,this book was a totally different change of pace after some of the predictable ones I have been reading recently disturbing but a great read and will keep you thinking,29,0
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,small but perfectly formed that is al guthrie for you this is one of the splendid series of novellas published by five leaves in killing mum carlos morales does odd jobs for people several of those odd jobs involve offing people when carlos receives a padded envelope one day it is a good news bad news sort of affair the good news is that a mystery client will pay him 20000 to kill valerie anderson the bad news is that valerie anderson is his mother oh and there has more bad news he suspects the woman he loves of being the one who wants his mother dead dark warped and funny and with a surprising number of twists and turns for such a short book i read it in one sitting alternately giggling and gasping strangely enough i had a whole train carriage to myself by the end of it loved it loved it loved it,153,1
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,you have to keep mum about killing mum because as other reviewers have noted it is hard to say too much without spoilers it is about a for-hire hit-man who is given a lot of money to kill his own mother he has both cool about it and curious he has prepared to do it but would like to know who wants him to do it is it his wife is it even the mother guthries writing is strong on dialogue which many writers find hard to do convincingly some writers talk tough but their characters just end up sounding manufactured elmore leonard is a master of great natural dialogue and while guthries characters are a world away from leonards they have that same tough-sounding realism i liked what one reviewer said about blood simple that is a really good comparison like the coen brothers movie it is gritty noir yet also occasionally comic and the characters are totally real by the way one reviewer referred to problems with the kindle version but I have read the kindle version and did not see any problems at all or maybe i was just too engrossed in the story,190,2
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,killing mum is a short sharp shocker true brit grit the novella is as tight as a very tight thing and is a spin off from guthries cracking novel savage night it is the story of a man who is paid to kill his own mother like savage night killing mum takes a violently absurd and tragically comic situation and gives it a couple of dark and bitter twists it is like having blood simple transported to modern day scotland and is a rush of a read five bloody stars,88,3
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,killing mum immediately sucks you in with a dark calculating main character that nonchalantly embraces his life as an assassins agent a quick read that you will not be able to put down the kindle version seems to have a few errors that are periodically annoying hopefully they will be fixed in a revised version,54,4
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,a true modern master of noir and crime fiction allan guthrie packs a wallop with his gut punch of a novella a sweet little package from crime express called killing mum carlos is a man who arranges killings for a fee of course a letter arrives addressed charlie a name only his wife and mother use for him the letter contains the down payment and instructions for a job but there has a hitch the intended target is none other than carlos mother and it all goes downhill from there guthrie is able to amp up the suspense right from the get go and it just never let up throughput the 96 page run and yeah thank the maker it is not a novel length story because damn it will nearly wear you out as it is any longer you might just need an ambulance the plot moves swift and we for the most part learn about the characters via dialogue and action it is a tight and tense story and without fail one you will not soon forget,174,5
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,liked the story line here was just incredible i can not write too much as i do not want to give spoilers i will say that the character development is very good for the main character i enjoy the way this author draws you into a story forcing you to turn just one more page to find out what happens next disliked again hard to tell without spoilers so i will just say that the author used a particular type of formatting that kind of gave away the twist way too early overall a terrific fast read length novella rating r for violence language and sexual references,105,6
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,this starts out great but in the end is so convoluted that it is just a narcissistic piece of junk it is sad that most of the story is made up of swear words maybe if more time had been spend on the storyline and less on how many times the f-bomb could be dropped,54,7
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,the beginning was ok but the story never took off and it got quite confusing can not say i liked it but it was short and free,26,8
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,it was really interesting but just different from crime novels also intriguing only thing i did not like was the way it ended not knowing who really wanted the mother dead,30,9
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,i felt that it was off the wall and not worth the time to read it the guy is crazy at the end and i did not understand why it had to be that way,34,10
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,the storyline was well written it had me interested quickly and kept my interest throughout the book i think most people would enjoy this book,25,11
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,the book jumped from one thing to another the cursing in the book just made it worse i did not enjoy the book at all,25,12
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,this book did not have a real beginning or an ending weird left the reader with a lot of unanswered questions do not recommend anybody killing their mum,26,13
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,story has no redeeming feature complete waste of time i gave it a one because zero was not an option,20,14
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,i love mysteries but the mystery should be what the story is about and not trying to understand the story i still am not sure what happened in this book one good thing it was very short,37,15
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,it started out okay and went down hill from there ridiculous plot but i kept hoping for more and kept reading waste of time in my opinion,29,16
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,guthries fiction is tough dark and extremely funny not for the squeamish if you like noir fiction you will like guthrie,20,17
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,short story so a short review dark witty tale set in a slightly surreal edinburgh hitmen tanning salons wee neds with guns and body bags it is tarantino with salt an sauce and at 74p less than a bag of chips,40,18
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,killing mum started out to be a really great story but kind of went downhill from there maybe i just do not do well with short stories the first chapter was good in setting up what promised to be an out of the ordinary thriller then it seemed as if the author just wanted to get it over with because he tried to cram too much information into the next two chapters the book became bogged down and confusing it is a shame too because i did enjoy the writing style at first and thought that i had stumbled onto another good author,101,19
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i am a musician i found these speakers to be very limited in range i bought them because of the raving reviews by customers they are very high ended lacking in mid-range and have no low end sound,39,0
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,wow these babies are smaller than i imagined i put them in a cd bag with 10 cds my mp3 player and still had room stereo in a pack the speakers are crisp and the surround sound is phenomenal give me more of this for my travel lifestyle thanks,49,1
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,for 20 these are very impressive little speakers they look a lot chaper than they sound the cardboard-like grill did not impress me but give them a chance they impressed me a lot once i truned them on and i am an audiophile the mid bass and the highs are much cleaner than i expected there is no deep bass but i expected that also the surround effect is nice especially when you have the spakers placed on your work table at near-ear level great for travel as they are very compact however if you want pounding bass you should maybe look into a subwoofer design but then again those will not be so compact and inexpensive good job sonic,121,2
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,just spent the last month checking the internet for portable speakers to take on vacation i wanted something as small as possible good sound and a modest price when i first saw the price of the si-5 i thought they can not sound very good for that price but after reading all the reviews on amazoncom and a few other sites i decided to purchase these if they turned out not so great sounding i could return them and start my quest all over again i bought them this past saturday at bestbuy and hooked them up almost immediately to my sony md walkman all i can say is what a surprise i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for compactness good sound and an incredibly great price in travel speakers i only regret not waiting another day because circuit city here had them on sale for 1799 and i also had a 500 off coupon which would have brought the price down to 1299 that would have been an even more incredible bargain for what you are getting for the little bit of money being spent,187,3
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,these speakers are well designed and give a good but not great sound highs are bright and crisp but slightly wobbly midrange is fine and bass is present but somewhat weak sounds best at moderate volume one of the key things for me is portability and here is where this system shines the speaker / amp package is great for travel or just toting about town to start with it is very light the form is also also thoughtfully designed the two speakers clip togeather to form a package slightly thicker than a standard cd jewel case this also protects the papery speaker fabric the tiny amp is sculpted so that it fits your hand and the wires are plugged at poth ends and detachable be sure to have a clip or rubberband around to keep the wires together after you dissassemble i can not belive how inexpensive it is you will not be sorry if you buy this but even if by some odd chance you were it is not much dough out of your pocket,173,4
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,i bought these to use with my ipod i just could not see spending the 100 - 150 for the high end altec lansing and creativ speaker units especially given the fact that reviews seem to be love em or hate em for those models as well i quite like these speakers the sound quality is good and reasonably full with jazz classical or rock music true given the rather limited output these would not be suitable for a display at a convention or a raging party but they are perfect for a hotel room quiet dorm or office yes there are three wires 2 for the speakers the other from the music source ipod mp3 but the advantage is that you can space the speakers farther apart then with other speakers I have seen the unit does not come with a power adaptor but has an input for one which can be purchased on the manufacturers website [ ] otherwise it uses 4 aaa batteries,161,5
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i read mixed reviews so i rolled theand bought these absolute garbage in their little bag they are 3 thick they sound very quiet no bass expected and no mid-range not expected the front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet they certainly are 360 degree speakers they sound equally bad from all directions even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables my original comment to my wife was twenty bucks how can i go wrong well my answer now is i could have still had my 20 now i just have to find someone to give them to as they are not worth the space they take up i know you get what you pay for but if that was the case here then should have been on sale for half off at the 99 cent store,144,6
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i got this for my frequent backpacking trips with my buddies and the quality of these speakers blew everyone including myself away every time i turn this on i still get amaze with how some 4 oz speakers could sound so rich and loud relative to it is size and weight if you are a outdoor freak and weight on your back is away an issue go for this and prepare to amaze your friends when they hear a live concerto streaming out from inside your tent total weight with batteries 1 pound 4 oz carry it on my 38 pound bag not an issue battery-share with my walkie eating real food and listening to a live concert while your friends are having problem trying to start a fire to cook instant noodle priceless,137,7
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,when you look at their size they are the size of a cd jewel case you would think they can not be that good but these speakers are great the sound is awesome of course you would not expect a great sound in a large room but for a small office or bedroom they are fantastic the only problem is the unit which connects the 2 speakers this contains the on switch and batteries if you forget to shut the switch off you drain your batteries rather quickly and it is easy to do this at first otherwise the speakers are great and quite portable,103,8
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i bought these speakers to take on vacations with my mp3 player and they actually have pretty good sound for their size however after only two uses one of the speakers lost it is sound unless you press on the face of it i would suggest buying any other speakers but these,51,9
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers are the worst that i have ever come across and broke down a week after i got them the sound is decent in the beginning but nothing around above average standards no way i would ever recommend any one buy one of these just are not worth the dough looks decent but that is where the good stuff ends,59,10
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,these speakers are the best the best for your money the best for sound quality and the best for dvd portable players if you are looking for bass spend more money and get good advice as to what you need for what you are buying for thoughs who under rate these speakers go get a job and put your sound system in the garbage,62,11
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,i bought these speakers to use with my toshiba satelite 2805-s402 laptop unfortunately i found that these speakers were not a significant improvement over my laptop speakers they are very small and they snap together handily making them great for traveling but i would only buy them for use with a discman mp3 player or something similar that has no speaker function,62,12
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,yes these are small and light now the bad news the separate amplifier and all the wires going everywhere makes the connected assembly look like a science lab project especially if you opt for the usb power connector yes the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my ibm thinkpad but not nearly as good as your typical 19 desktop computer speakers the problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange bass is nonexistent it is like listening to a pair of big tweeters the enthusiastic reviews are a mystery to me,100,13
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i enjoy watching dvds on my laptop but lugging my desktop speakers in a bag did not appeal to me now i literally slip these speakers into my laptop cases outer pocket and I am on my way they snap together and are one and a half inches at their thickest i show off these speakers every chance i get and the reaction is always one of amazement now while they are not the equal of my desktop speakers they are 25 times better than my laptop the surround sound effect makes a real difference when heard for the very first time while a bit pricey for most people if you own a portable dvd player or a laptop you will increase the value of your product and your audio-visual experience many times over i also use them with my mini disc unit in new york city where things have to be just a little bit louder to be heard these speakers impress,150,14
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,easily the best portable speakers out there and probably the only portable speakers that are not more then glorified headphones the sound is rich and full although the bass will hardly rattle your teeth the speakers are incrediably compact about the size of a double cd jewel case the i-mac-esquescheme is an aquired taste am i the only one that misses the days when computers and electronics only came in black silver and putty for a pair of speakers to throw in with your laptop mp3 player or portable cd player there has nothing better pros superior sound very compact easy to set up fairly long battery life cons [ light ] plasic and cardboard construction somewhat pricy weak bass questionable looks seperate amplifier this is a very good effort and i hope sonic impact tries again make it with heavier plastic integrate the amplifier into one or both of the speakers raise the bass a tad bundle it with a compact dc adapter or better yet a usb power option and lower the price into the sub-50 dollar range and this would be a breakthrough product,194,15
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,the unit works well after sorting through all the wires thefrom the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity the biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling also the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and i found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss a neat gadget for the price sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness,81,16
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers would have been a perfect compliment to my portable dvd player due to their size and portability however the volumn was minimal even after purchasing new batteries these speakers were beautiful in appearance but wiring could be more substantial speakers should be shipped with dc power supply to improve performance,52,17
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,got it for a couple of weeks it has been great took me a while to figure out how to connect to my reciever for the 51 feature picture quality has been excellent tried it with a vcd and it works fine but i think my vcd was a poor quality vcd karaoke works too so far no complaint from me,61,0
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,last week saw the ad tried to order and can not sucess so tried again a moment ago but the price was already jumped up 1000 that means if i do not order to-day and to-morrow will jump up again so may be i have to wait another month wait for it for sale then i am going to order thanks,60,1
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,this is a good unit but beware it has trouble playing variable bitrate svcds if your svcd bitrate drops below a certain level the picture will freeze and the audio will emit a high pitched squeal if svcd playback is important to you get a different player otherwise you will be ok with the ad-800,55,2
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this is a great dvd player it has everything you want even comes with mp3 at a price you can not beat it has a karaoke mode which is a lot of fun it is such a good buy it is easy to set up and easy to use a great first dvd player for anyone who is thinking of getting a dvd player i would not use it on my hdtv home theater but if you just want something simple that looks great this is the one it has good sound and picture for the price have not had any problems with it what can i say i love it it was cool big truck,111,3
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,i bought this unit the day after christmas i have since spent many hours in front of it besides playing almost every format of disc known it is firmware upgradable so it will likely keep pace with new formats as they become available one reviewer said that it was not user-friendly do not confuse a great degree of user-selectable preferences as being complicated novice users can play it right out of the box but power users will find it ultimately enjoyable plus with progressive scan i will be able to use this player even after i upgrade to a digital tv and the price speaks for itself apex is breaking new ground by offering high end products at k-mart prices keep up the good work,125,4
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,it is probably the best around for the price although it can be sluggish and tempermental it gives you an unbelievable amount of control from zooming and panning to speaker tweaking you can do anything you would ever need to with the touch of a button the mp3 control is very strange and almost old fashioned but it puts out great sound the remote is interesting and takes some time to adjust to but gets the job done and the unit itself is freakishly huge it is almost twice as big as my vcr but not that intrusive so if you like having complete control over your dvd viewing and love features galore this is definitely the dvd player for you,121,5
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,my new apex ad-800 provided good picture and sound on dvds but could not read half of my vcds commercially produced vcds i think the laser is out of alignment i found the unit to be very user-unfriendly the remote control is poorly laid out and performing a simple fast forward / reverse task is painful the unit does not automatically switch between 43 and 169 aspect ratio wheras my panasonic does so i have to manually set the aspect ratio each time i switch from a widescreen dvd to a vcd or a 43 dvd i have read reviews that tout the ad-800 as a great toy for a technical person due to it is many user-adjustable parameter settings but i think the unit had so many user-adjustable parameters because it lacks the intelligence to set them automatically the karaoke function is very limited as it has no ability to adjust the key and no vocal assist function i had high hopes for the ad-800 due to it is many advertised features but i am quite disappointed by the poor quality control and user-unfriendliness,181,6
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,had this dvd and worked until red lines appeared on led screen took unit apart and noticed exploded power supply component the unti still plays cds but can not get a dvd to play apex tech support is horrible they want be to ship the unit back in the original box,50,7
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,i have had my ad-800 for over a year and it works well there are 2 versions out there that i am aware of the newer version works better than the older one the beauty of this is that it does a great job converting pal ntsc while not region free it has the complete look feel ' and quality of the malata in fact if it was not for the apex label it seems like it is exactly like the [ expensive ] malata it does the 169 correctly in pal ntsc and you can adjust the aspect if needed great features for the price there are some issues with the progressive scan but overall it does a relatively good job heck i would say that for the price it does a fantastic job also with some of the newer high-end tvs some of the deinterlacers on the tvs are better than the dvd players anyway so you may not need it in the future i tried svcd and vcd and both worked well for me note i do not use mp3 or photo,178,8
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,if you are thinking of buy this dvd player for the progressive scan do not i have a 57 toshiba hdtv and when you turn on the progressive mode on this dvd player the picture gets worse it is grainy blurry and dull interlaced mode looks better plus this player will sometimes burp meaning sound / picture pauses or seems to skip a second or two like it can not keep up i thought i was planning for the future when i bought this player but i wished i saved my money for a better player later,91,9
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,i bought this player due to reviews in last years consumer reports it worked ok for about 9 months and quit working after that i took it to the electronics place and they said time to buy new too expensive to fix i guess you get what you pay for definitely think twice on this one,55,10
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,based on a positive review by the2001 issue of consumer reports magazine i purchased the apex ad-800 from circuit city as it was the only recommenned progressive-scan dvd player that i could afford i do not have a hdtv however i plan to buy one in the near future dvd disc sound and picture when hooked up to a typical television set are excellent i put a music cd disc in and it also sounded great it is a very good value for the money the only problem i have had with it occured when i tried to play a dvd disc that i rented from a supermarket it was just too scratched up for it to be played according to consumer reports some dvd players can play damaged dvds and damaged cds i suppose that also depends on how badly they are damaged i would reommend the apex ad-800 for those people who want a very good progressive-scan dvd player and who do not have a lot of money to spend on it,175,11
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,works great only thing that was a small hassle videos show in black and white until you change a setting tech support responded right away with the correct setting good thing because i would have never guessed how to set it up great picture and sound easy to hook up to the tv,53,12
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,the ease of operation and the crisp picture and sound playback are the qualities which because me to be very happy with this dvd player and i could not beat your price anywhere,31,13
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,any single women out there like myself will find this apex ad-800 a breeze to install and operate it should take no more than 15 minutes at the most for you to have it up and running i have never heard of apex but thought i would give it a try this is my first dvd player i am absolutely pleased the picture quality is very good and stable if your a novice like myself this is an excellent starter dvd player i do not see how anyone could go wrong purchasing this product and for the price the performance is excellent,101,14
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,just like others worked great for about 4 months then red lines appeared on display now it does not read at all what a joke same results on trying customer service who keeps original boxes anyway also the shipping cost would be very high to send back will never buy apex again,52,15
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,absolutely no problems for the first 6 months it worked beautifully one day for no apparent reason red lines appeared in the display window and now the dvd player can not read the disc i contacted apex to no solution they told me i had to ship it back in it is original box which i do not have at my cost and probably the problem would not be under warranty all this after being on hold for 20 minutes during a long distance phone call no 1 - 800 it really discourages me from buying apex and especially buying on-line,96,16
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,i purchased this dvd because of the ntsc / pal feature i thought that i would be able to play europeans dvd i was wrong this player will play europeans dvd with region 1 encoding which is us and canada in brief you will not be able to play foreign dvds with this player i quickly offered it as a gift to my sister and purchased one of those dvds [ ] now i can watch dvds from all over the world with my new dvd i noticed that the apex was not all that good whenever you want to change an audio language subtitle option the movie will stop it is not instantaneous also it has no rewind or forward you can only jump from chapters to chapters and finally it is almost impossible to decipher what has written on the panel the inscriptions are too small be careful know what you want,149,17
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,dvd player this thing should be called a multimedia player it will play almost anything flawlessly even vcd karokes i got from the philippines like having a blast at the famous karoke bars in southeast asia and it has plenty of outputs in the back so this thing is ready to take on the hdtvs too progressive scan another bonus mine has performed flawlessly a really good dvd player at less than half the price of the big brand models,77,18
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this apex is the most advanced dvd player around if you want the most out of your money this is it be warned although it will take you more than a few days to set this player up becouse it is detailed down to the last sound decimal i have not figured it out totally yet but the sound and picture just get better and better each time i figure something new out this player can be completely reprogramed if your an expert at that if you want to have total control of your sound and picture this one is the one to get but if you just want to pop your dvd or cd in and play it this is not for you,123,19
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,i got this as my first dvd player not knowing what the differences between the various products are i figured that the cheapest would be just fine that was one of the most naive things I have ever done the sound is delayed from the movement so it looks as if the movies were dubbed also it has a major overexposure there are also many times when it skips on brand-new movies all in all i would not reccomend this even to non-enthusiasts,82,20
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,i bought this unit to play my pal dvd disks along with ntsc disks this unit is advertised as being able to play pal-formatted disks however this is not true it will only play ntsc region 1 disks this was verified to me by apex tech support,47,21
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this is my first dvd player purchase and i am glad i bought the apex ad-800 i have an older home theater system so i needed the dts decoder in the dvd player i have not seen another dvd player at this low price with all the features and dts decoding i have been using it for three months now and would buy another one if i needed it I have recommended this one to my friends my only complaint is that i do not like the layout of the buttons on the remote but on the other hand i have seen very few remotes that have a good layout,107,22
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,i had my eyes on brand name dvd players but after read reviews on amazoncom i decided to get this one nothing disappointed me yet i have lots of my home-made vcds in pal signal and it plays them all without any difficulties amazing how it plays a normal mp3 disk with a list of songs from different folders on the tv screen and you can turn it into a karaoke session easy plugand play many kinds of connections to choose from with all the cables although the manual is quite bad with very few details this might be that you need not to do much to operate the machine i tested it with ntsc pal dvds and vcds no problems at all nice for money,127,23
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,the blink camera is so tiny i carry it in my purse the pictures are of reasonable quaility but the detail is lacking the software is easy to use and transferring photos is easy transferring 92 full size photos only takes a minute do not expect to take action photos as the there is a delay with the shuttle quite nice for a pocket digital camera,65,0
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i like this product because i can send pictures online to my family and friends also you can use this product for making family videos it is unlimited video if connected to your computer that what has makes it fun please try this product thank you,44,1
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,this camera is great if you want to take pictures at day with lots of light at a park beach and more is really usefull because it is as little as you can see at the picture you can take it wherever you want without problem the resolution is not the best so if you want to take super quality pictures this is not your camera as a webcam is really good too so it is great if you want a webcam and a photo camera 2 in 1 i could not ask for more for this price,96,2
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i bought this after seeing someone else with it it is very difficult to take clear photos due to the size of the camera the only way is with the tiny tripod which is pretty impractical i saw that people were recommending this for kids i would not bother go with something a bit more substantial that they can steady for a real photo,65,3
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,if you are looking for high-end quality pictures you are looking at the wrong place but if you are looking for a regular quality shots and do not want to spend a lot of money the stylecam is the right one how can you ask for a great quality pictures for less than even a film camera taking good pictures can cost you about to the software is very easy to use but do not have a manual the camera is even easier to use and it works great as a web cam be sure to hold the camera very steady because it has a slight shutter lag of about half a second this can be annoying but after a while you will remember this automatically,121,4
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this camera takes fair pictures in perfect conditions as long as you have good light the subject is not moving and you have hands of steel you can get a good picture it will not take in medium light conditions if you tap the button while taking a picture it will blur and if you taking picture of something moving at walking speed it will be unrecognizable works well enough as a web cam as long as whayever you set it on does not move,84,5
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,uses up battery way too fast but greatjust needs long term use changes,14,6
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,i had this camera although is adorable and it felt as if i was a james bond movie person it took horrible pictures the inside pictures if it did not have the right amount of light the camera would not take pictures at all and when i took pictures outdoors it woould have a blue outline around the images the saying you get what you pay for is very true,69,7
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,just really cute to look at but would not download on win xp windows prevented product from installation after reading the reviews on this page i am not really sorry that microsoft found a way to block this product,39,8
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i have just bought a sipix webcam 3 for my sons birthday the driver software did not install on windows 98se i asked sipix for technical support all i got were questions asking me if i had tested the driver contained in the empty folders it had set up on the advice of amazoncom i tried to download the driver from the sipix site after 45 minutes of download all i got was a manual advising me tothe software from the non-working cd-rom supplied with the camera is the camera itself any good i can find out,99,9
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,it is cute as heck but after a week i had to return it even although it only cost me that is money that needs to be spent towards a usable camera what indoor shots i managed to take were dark and heavily pixelated no matter what quality i tried plus until you upload you do not know which shots were actually taken the shutter speed was abysmal i could not stand still that long much less a child even outdoor shots were disappointing,81,10
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,for great design really small easy to install superb software extremely easy to use quality tolerable against refuses to take pictures indoors even on inside mode unless your room is very bright therefore can not capture any night time events so it is not for students will flash up error size would make it ideal but as it will not take pictures it is useless for this quality is limited proper digital cameras 13megapixel overall if they added a flash or even made it work in low light even if results are not stunning it would be a great little gadget as it is I am dissapointed because I have taken it out and it will not take pictures it may fit into your pocket on a night out but it will not work taking fireworks tonight proved impossible it still thought it was too dark for daytime use it is great for web pages but the quality is nowhere near a proper digital camera then again the resolution is better than competitors no other camera this small takes better pictures,177,11
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,i think this camera is excellent the best part i think is it is size I am an adult but my hands are very small this camera not even being 2 inches square fits nicely in my hand when i first got it i took a few pictures and set up the program on my computer i was so surprised at how great my pictures came out I am really looking forward to the holiday season i have a nephew who is almost a year old and i am excited about taking his picture and sending it to our extended family that lives several states away if you are thinking about buying this camera but you think that the low price means that it is just junk think again you do not have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good deal,138,12
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,people who rave about this thing either work for the company or are vision impaired i bought one on a whim so i could take it with me on vacation i can honestly say that of the 100s of pictures i took with it not one was a keeper the shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless your pictures are blurred i found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures the camera crashed often and i needed to take out the battery to reboot it this happened a lot the camera worked in sunlight but pics taken indoors were way too dark this thing is not ready for prime time not even at these prices,128,13
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this is a fascinating little product carry it in your pocket without any weight i love carrying it along to kids games and the kids want ones of their own it has a few drawbacks however some expected some that need fixing in the next generation the expected but still a little disappointing limited focal length lens means that elements outside the very center of the picture are blurred barrel distortion no flash for low light situtions the real problem it loses your pictures when the battery drains down that is it is memory is volatile flash memory is so cheap why did the designers make this choice there is no early warning actually no warning at all when the battery is too low in fact if the battery gets low it will still take pictures as normal then it freezes up and all your pictures are gone caveat emptor here a great product in so many ways but make sure you replace the batteries early that is every 50 shots or so it is not a cost issue but you will lose your pictures beyond hope for recovery even although the camera seems to continue to act normally,201,14
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i bougth this camera 2 weeks ago i was looking for a cheap digital camera that would allow me to create web quality images would be portable and easy to use the sipix stylecam has all of it the size of it is very small which allows me to wear it even in my keychain the clip is also provided in the package and it is 640x480 quality is enought for my actual needs also to point out that thanks to it is usb connection to the computer the download of the pictures taken is really quick it has although a couple of inconvinients which are that whenever you push to take a picture the camera takes a variable amount of time to actually take it so you can not take movement pictures or move much during it or the pictures will end up all messy the second inconvinient is that inside houses when the light is not perfect the camera shows an error and is unable to take the picture presumably because of the lack of light as it does not have a flash incorporated with the package it also comes a stand to use it as a webcam,196,15
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i was skeptical about this camera but it got enough good reviews that i thought it might be a fun thing to have i was not expecting to use it to take artistic shots to keep and treasure forever and ever but i did think I had get something other than shapeless blurs unfortuntately i think this camera will get little to no use because it just is not worth the trouble of checking to see if the battery is dead usually yes taking the pictures and uploading them onto the computer if they have not inexplicably disappeared using the awkward poorly designed software with no documentation whatsoever i have gotten a total of zero useful photos with thisif you want a digital camera do not buy this one you still will not really have anything more than you started with,137,16
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this camera has not satissfied me even as a toy it works only under sunlight else it blurs the image and it requires too much time to take a pic under room light also the sides of the pictures look round it is still very small but there are others in the market better with the same price,57,17
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i could not believe it wen i first saw it is lil toy in skool my homie was carryin it around da skool n showing off a lil n taking gurl pix i was like wooooww neither do my other friends so i decided to get one for myself too u noe to capture pretty gurls pix convincely n i did got one it works find for me under it is affordable price just the size of it is worth it already make ur life better n easier with it is small size cute lil camera tell u a lil secret gurls do like it a lot hehehehe so con get it while itz still in low price i personally will get more for my friends b-day or as a gift or anything like datitz fun to carryin it around n take shotz or wut eva u think is tyte i captured a shot of britney spear at a movie theater n a shot of kobe bryant outside of stable center w my homies in it,170,18
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,I have had a great time with the sipix blink digital camera took it on a family outing over the labor day holiday and came back with great pictures to share with the family nothing publication quality but certainly good enough to show people what the kids did for fun over the weekend the blink lens distorts the images around the edges but for snapshooting it is at least equivalent to the old instamatics and polaroids it is surprisingly good in low light tho the shooter must take extra care to hold it still it is main advantage is it is size and weight both of which are negligible coupled with the generous memory 100 to 400 images depending on resolution it invites you to carry it constantly and shoot pictures of everything two points to remember 1 it is easy to wrap your hands around the camera slr style and make your fingers part of the scenery 2 it is so small and handy that it is easy to lose i have a nightmare of leaving it in a shirt pocket and sending it thru the washing machine,182,19
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,i have not received the cameras yet but judging by our grandchildrens parents choice these must be excellent my daughter works in market analysis and I am sure she would pick only the best and most educational camera for their twin sons ninth birthday gift from us,46,20
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,absolutely fun little camera spent the first day after getting it on an impulse buy making little avis of the new kitten in my house the included software makes this a snap no the quality is not fantastic at those resolutions but making mini videos with a package this size for this price is going to be tough to beat keep the battery fresh and you are good to take it just about anywhere great fun little product and probably going to be christmas gifts for everyone this year,87,21
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,if you use the windows key on your keyboard then this is probably the mini-keyboard you want siig makes one that is decent but does not have the key adesso makes other keyboards like this one and which one works best for you you probably depends on what keys you need and where look at the bottom row look a the enter key there will be variations from what you may be used to after using this keyboard at work i bought one for home sure it does not have the normal numeric keys but i reach for the mouse a lot more often than i reach for those and it is considerably closer now i recommend this keyboard,117,0
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i hate wide keyboards with a number pad they force me to reach too far for the mouse this keyboard minimizes the distance between home row typing position and my mouse it also lies very flat so my wrists do not have to bend upwards the fn key does not duplicate the functionality of my ibm laptop fn key also with my laptop it seems numlock and fn are both needed to enable this keyboards number pad but i do not plan to ever use that feature anyway occasionally i bump the fn key in the corner which causes some of the number pad keys to not work but another press toggles things back to normal i might pop the case open and tape over the fn key if you install the provided software you get some bonus keys along the top some people might not like the feel or size of this keyboard but it works for me,157,1
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,this keyboard is awesome as a gaming keyboard i do have problems with the keys registering but that is because i am stubborn and like very few items in startup so i do not run the software for it i do not really use it for the multimedia capabilities but they all work if you run the software i use it for gaming the footprint is small but the keys are large / wide i have and still beat this thing up playing pistols on ravenshield everyday and i mean everyday i have many keys that do not work well from all the use but i have switched out the rubber pieces under the keys that i use in the game for fresh ones from less used keys it still just kicks and so do i in the game i highly recommend it if you like to have extra space clear in front of you i am back at amazon looking to purchase another one adesso pwns,162,2
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,had this keyboard connected to my computer for only 15 minutes keys did not register when pressed or had to be pressed several times very hard i may have just got a lemon but i am not buying another adesso keyboard,41,3
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i use an under-desk keyboard support and need to squeeze a keyboard and mousepad into a 19 space since i do not use a numeric keypad anyway this keyboard is perfect it is not quite industrial strength keys stick after a couple years and the letters fade away but i love it anyway and will just replace it when necessary if you just have one or two sticky keys try swapping the rubber doohickey under the key with one from an underused key for example home also adesso provided excellent support when i had a problem with an earlier keyboard,99,4
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,i spend all day drafting on the computer and was in need of a shorter keyboard for less distance between the mouse and letter keys you get used to the top numeric keys that is how we used to do it on typewriters and overall quality is good the keys are quiet and it has a good number of shortcut keys that worked immediately with my windows xp,67,5
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,I am not particularly hard on keyboards and bought this one only to use at work all the same this keyboard did not last more than 6 months before the space bar key ceased working entirely not recommended,36,6
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,we needed a compact keyboard for a limited-width keyboard tray for our secondary pc we use mostly for pc gaming it works great and gives us the room we need to place our mouse on the keyboard tray as well a welcome improvement the keyboard is similar to a smaller laptop keyboard but works beautifully for that which is was intended,61,7
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,excellent mini keyboard for pos system or small desk nice layout of keys except the delete button but you will get used it pretty quick,24,8
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,this keyboard is the best I have ever used after almost four years of using this keyboard I am purchasing a second one as a back up even although my current one is still functioning the print on a few keys is worn off but that is a minor thing for over fours years of steady use the size is perfect the action of the keys is great everything works as it should I have become a real fuss budget when it comes to the placement of the delete key can not stand keyboards that hide the key that most of us use so often i do a lot of editing and find that things like well thought out key placement are really important for anyone who does writing and editing this is a great keyboard,131,9
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,keys started failing after about 2 months and some of the key markings rubbed off too not recommended,18,10
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,one of the wireless keyboard i had I am able to control my laptop from 11 ft away with no problem i have my laptop connected to my tv,27,11
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these within a few months of each other because i love this keyboard because of the small size it is set up great one of the best keyboards in the world the problem is that the letters / numbers on the keys come off in 3 - 6 months making the keyboard worthless extremely quickly and then you have to go out and buy new ones i do not use the keyboards much so the letters and numbers on the keys should not wear-off so quickly but it is a big flaw of this keyboard because it is happening with the 2 that i own,101,12
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i had no problems installing the keyboard hooked it up with an adesso ps/2 to usb adapter i got the drivers off their website and installation was quick and easy i was using the keyboard in minutes so far I have been using it constantly and have not had any major problems with it but i do not really use the multimedia functions the multimedia buttons in particular feel kind of cheaply made and the rest of the keyboard kind of does too but i have not had any problems with anything breaking so far the extra space on my desk is absolutely great although it took me a couple of days to get used to the size of the keys definitely a good buy if you are looking to conserve deskspace and do not need a full keyboard,132,13
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the keyboard i like the size but the quality of keys and response is very bad i got a defective piece where the keys were just getting stuck i am currently using a microsoft keyboard but needed a smaller footprint to match the size of laptop keyboard,52,14
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,very simple if you want your life to be in peace please do not even think to buy this i literally had to throw this in to the trashcan it worked nice for a few months 2 then the nightmare started losing connection every 15 minutes then the left ctrl key stopped to work then the left alt key i reinstalled every thing several times without any success finally to get this nightmare worst 2 key pads came out i wrote several times to logitech no answer i decided to throw it away very very disappointed and it was not a 25 keyboard,102,0
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,this keyboard has a wonderful feel but the mediapad does chew up the batteries the decals have begun to come off the keys in a serious way after just a few months too very disappointing given that we have had over a century of manufacturing experience with keyboards,47,1
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,the mouse had a good feel and nice response that was the only thing i could get to work after much effort i did get the keyboard and keypad to work briefly but once i installed the software as directed it was only the mouse for a while eventually it quit too i spent a couple of hours following their limited directions and finally went on line to find automated support that said it must me defective return it i will,79,2
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,64 mb of software constant checks for updates items in my system tray just for a keyboard and mouse ridiculous i kept this keyboard / mouse going for about a year on a home theater pc but am retiring it now it was nothing but trouble constantly losing contact after sleep or reboots requiring lots of fiddling with windows and logitech configuration interfaces an additional wired mouse at least is required to maintain your system i do not know if it is a microsoft or logitech problem but I shall avoid buying new bluetooth gizmos from now on i replaced this with a non-bluetooth rf keyboard / trackball combo that i love also the separate keypad eats batteries much too quickly now I am just trying to salvage the bluetooth usb dongle for use with another bluetooth device i foolishly bought but i do not want the huge logitech install just for that wish me luck,148,3
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied these are thewhich is not sold in japan,13,4
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i have not experienced many problems with this setup at all I am gone from home all day but when i get back it is just any random keystroke and my bluetooth is back online I have had it for several months and only had to change the batteries once the mouse lasted significantly long before it needed to be recharge my only issue is it is intermittent ability to function before the os loads,70,5
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,this really nice keyboard and once you learn all it is features you enjoy it,14,6
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i love the way this product looked it was slim and sexy the reality was that it was a battery hog the media pad was basically useless there were frequent bluetooth disconnections and i actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working i am not a gorilla typist i eventually gave up on it i give it 2 stars because it was a nice design but it just did not deliver,73,7
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,it looks great but the media pad makes it too wide the battery on the media pad does not last very long so i ended up not wanting to replace the batteries again just not using it i usually use the number pad so this was a real inconvenience the mouse is also too heavy for my liking I am buying something else,61,8
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i bought this for the size and the bluetooth it is thin and fits nicely into my keyboard drawer my notebook has bluetooth and they paired up nicely as a keyboard it feels like a high end board and works perfectly the mouse is nice as well but not great for switching hands the only feature annoyance is that they did not bother putting a scroll wheel on the keyboard as in the elite duo if they added that feature and a dozen or more programmable buttons this board would be perfect oh ya do not forget to update the software / drivers before you even begin amendment so now that I have had this for several months i would give it 2 stars the setpoint software fails on all the computers running ms office outlook logitech help is useless several hours wasted the bluetooth is still great and the feel of the board very nice but without setpoint you can not use most of the features shame on logitech,164,9
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,the included receiver has very limited range if you already have another receiver i did you might be able to live with this set there is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad lcd the media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for itunes and windows media player however the useless lcd can not navigate song titles it simply displays the currently playing title would be great if you could scroll down a list of artist / tunes and tag for play,83,10
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,this keyboard is just perfect for me i love the seperate numberpad everything works fine,15,11
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i had read several reviews here before purchasing this product but went ahead and bought it anyway thinking that logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted i was wrong after a few weeks of satisfactory use long enough to get past amazons reasonable window for returns the space bar started working intermittently incredibly annoying and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes even before the space bar turned against me i was unimpressed with the feel of the keys i use a dell wireless keyboard an apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my ibm x-series laptop bottom line the thing looks great on a desk and it is nicely compact but it probably will not do what you need it to look elsewhere,131,12
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,i bought this and hate it the mouse works intermittantly and is too heavy the numeric keyboard beeps and displays incoming emails and ims seemingly at random and usually several days after the messages arrive it also ran out of battery power after a weeks use also the keyboard feel is horrible and it is impossible to key in numbers quickly and reliably with it same goes for the main keyboard the space button frequently will not work oh and the first time i use the numeric keypad after some time of non-use it often sends two consecutive numbers with one keystroke example i type 123 and it comes out as 1123 i will say the design is very cool too bad this product is useless,125,13
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i just got this one from a local store at 94 my mouse is the mx900 that has been discontinued for a while initially it was the mx900 got my attention at this price mx900 costs about 80 alone if you can find one before it was installed the pc has g7 and ms bluetooth already so after installed battery and plugged it into usb port the software detected them all i just configured some mouse and keyboard buttons to the way i like the keyboard / remote are very well built in both style and quality as well as key touching even on the bigger keys such as shift and space the mx900 is very similar to mx700 that i have been using daily along with g7 while the bluetooth mx900 features long range coommunication it suffers from very short battery life 1 day for normal usage which is unacceptable today however the battery charge is also very short too 1/2the remote keypads is handy as remote control for dvd / cd playback i guess logitch will put this keyboard together with g7 as another product,184,14
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,this is one beautiful keyboard but underneath the pretty skin a beast lies within many times over i had to restart my computer windows xp pro after coming out of suspense because bluetooth failed to reconnect i got the latest bluetooth software from logitech but still having issues and after a while the left ctrl key started to give me problems i had to press the key hard enough otherwise i would just type against or cs when i try to copy or paste that got annoying real quick since with my work i use a lot of keyboard shortcuts i am not using the keyboard or the mouse anymore i replaced the keyboard with an old dell and the mouse with mx1000 which is working fantastically 2 stars that i am giving is for the design and the effort logitech put into it,144,15
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,the aesthetics are the 1st thing i notice with new products the dinovo is no exception the build quality is outstanding the feel of the keys themselves quite solid and i have had no trouble to date the connection to the bluetooth hub takes a second or so to connect when the computer boots up but so what it is not a significant issue that should discourage someone from considering this product the mouse is also terrific excellent ergonomics comfort plus it has thoughtful and well located button features if any technical failures happen I shall update this post but so far it is worked flawlessly certainly makes typing enjoyable and there is zero timelag with the bluetooth once connected it is immediately responsive to keyboard input and no messy wires running across my desk,131,16
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,overall a great product had a little trouble with the first one the mouse would not charge the batteries but a new one was sent bby amazon with quick shipping this setup has so many uses not sure how i got work done witout it,45,17
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,i recently built a new pc for my boss and decided to go with this keyboard being as he is all about new and cool stuff so wireless and small was good i hooked it up had it running in about 5 minutes and it felt great i did not want to move so the boss could use his computer it is great so far we have only had it for 3 days and if anything goes wrong like said above many times i will let you guys know for now buy the damn thing,94,18
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,I am a tech geek so this sleekly designed keyboard was a must-have for me i noticed that the mouse that came with mine was very generic and the price is about 100 less than what I am seeing advertised i bought a laser mouse instead this is my first wireless keyboard my reason for buying it other than the design was that i feel retrained by wires when using my keyboard and mouse the only drawback to me is that there are no indicator lights for the caps lock or any other keys to indicate whether or not they are active and honestly at this price I had like the entire keyboard to have a backlight option,115,19
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i was first stricken with the beauty of the design of this set logitech hit the bullseye with the look once i got the set home and got it installed all without a hitch i might add i found myself most pleased with the feel of the keyboard it is a very comfortable keyboard and it is very quiet but after about 2 months the beast began to emerge to my dismay and shock i have been a loyal logitech user for sometime never encountering any serious problems with any of their products but after 2 months the left ctrl key just stopped working nothing i could do to fix it i also encountered frequent connection troubles with the bluetooth mostly with the mouse i would often have to wait a few minutes after boot for the mouse to be connected the sudden malfunctioning keys issue seems to be common among many users of this particular logitech product as well as the connection issues in light of this i strongly urge buyers to look elsewhere for a keyboard and mouse set,181,20
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,a beautiful product but not so comfortable the feeling of keystroke is very similar to gerenal notebook keyboard the mediapad is not a goodfor non-western language you will get for all non-western character and i get my mediapad rmaed twice a tedious procedure that i will not mention here theof media center is not as useful because the software is tightly integrated with ms media player so i can not get any benefit from my itunes if you do not use keyboard often and need some beautiful gadget on your desktop i would recommend this otherwise find other robust keyboard,103,21
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,a bought this keyboard a week ago and it is working fine i have a ibm t21 laptop with a sony flat screen and windows xp pro i use my computer 30 to 60 mn a day i plugged the bluetooth hub on a usb hub connected to the only usb port of my laptop it took me 20 mn to do the set up both the keyboard and the mouse worked perfectly right away i did not need to install the logitech driver i have still not installed it yet and i think i will not i may not have all functionalities but it does not matter to me i did not notice any pb with the batteries so far i like the design of the keyboard it is a pleasant touch the mouse is nice but a little bit overweighted in my view it has back / forward buttons which are usefull for web navigation,154,22
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,i had the service up and running within 5 minutes did not need any installation other than plug and play i was making international calls to the united kingdom within the hour at 3 cents a minute very impressive i set it up so that it rings my cell as well as the home number so friends can find me with just one call i gave it 4 stars only because i could not get a local area code number topeka ks and set up a 1 - 888 number for local friends to call in on,95,0
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,works well linksys is the best product in the market today period,12,1
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,we paid a little extra for this router for the integrated vonage phone jacks included in the package boy were we disappointed we stopped using the vonage service within a couple weeks because voice packets were dropped when multitasking with web-related activities refresh a webpage dropped voice packets check for email dropped voice packets do not buy this router for vonage services if you care about quality phone service and you are online throughout the day do not use vonage,81,2
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,it was exactly what was promised a router to connect a couple of pcs and a regular phone to the internet cable easy set-up no surprises decent price,28,3
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,customer service is horrible 3 hours on hold 2 hours on with a technician that speaks english as well as my dog and they could not figure out why i had no internet connectivity the only saving grace is that i was allowed to return it i had to stop payment on the credit card before they would allow a refund beware,61,4
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,awesome product for phone service and wireless all in one great buy for the money excellent price many options for added security and/or gaming features,25,5
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,i got this router from best buy when i decided to move my phone to vonage i have had nothing but trouble from day one first the phone service even sucked but some constant tweaking of the settings over a couple of weeks straightened that out now it works great except for the wireless the wireless connection sucks it constantly drops out resets the connections and runs very slow i have to unplug the router at least twice per day just to use the wireless connection finally i managed to fix it and get it working right i bought a new wireless router and turned off the linksys wireless for good so if you want a hardwired router with a crappy wireless addition buy this,125,6
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,worked as advertised wireless reaches my bedroom from the basement ethernet side was working within minutes vonage phone service was simple set up also although still waiting to have my exsiting phone number transfered to vonage service,37,7
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,i purchased the linksys wrt54gp2 to set up a wireless network at home for 2 desktops and 1 laptop in addition i wanted to use the phone ports with vonage service the router was very easy to set up with the instructions provided even setting up the wireless security options was easy I have had my system up and running for 4 weeks now the new internet phone service and network operation is working great,74,8
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,low sound quality difficult to reach customer support and frequent service outages even although my cable internet connection is very good the vonage service is mediocre at best in 3 months of using the service i have had at least 5 days of no vonage service and many have reported that when they call me they can not get through,59,9
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,postings on other sites have reported noise problems with this unit noise is white noise sounds like a hiss i talked to a vonage customer svc rep a capable one on 3/25/05 about this and he said the problem was caused by a faulty capacitor which as batch of these routers were built with this batch is no longer in production and is not being distributed anymore also if you have another non-vonage linksys router that you are replacing this unit with the ac power adapters for vonage routers are 12v but for non-vonage are 5v i was too lazy to swap adapters and was powering my vonage router w the 5v adapter the router-part worked fine except the phone-part would never register with vonage linksys should report this on their configuration page,130,10
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,this section is reviewing vonage not this product so i thought I had chime in great is the word for it easy to set up good reception minimal problems goodbye sbc finally i really recommend it,35,11
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,do not switch to vonage beside poor sound quality they have no customer service whatsoever i have been trying to contact them for over a week and nothing they do not respond to your emails and tech support does not answer the phone the only people you can get to answer is sales and they will not help you with problems this is the worst company I have ever run across do yourself a favor and stick with your normal phone company or pick another voip provider vonage is bad news,88,12
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I have never been more disappointed i was excited to get these earbuds after i read the other reviews and the minute i stepped outside and sped up they flew right out of my ears after a song and a half i could not stand it anymore and had to carry my mp3 player the rest of the way without listening to it,61,0
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,after trying several different kinds of earbuds i decided to go ahead and give these a shot they are noticeably better than any other earbuds i have tried sennheiser koss and panasonic they have good bass and excellent clarity i use these at the gym and they fit very comfortably and do not move they also work really well for running i would recommend these to any mp3 owner,68,1
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I have had sonys mdr-ex51lp and mdr-ex71sl fontopia headphones and this are decisively better the 52lps at around 27 are still the best option for someone on a budget but I am very happy with the extra ten i paid for these the sound quality is very similar to what you get from the 71sls which is lower bass than the 51s but much more clarity but the earhook design of these 81lps overcomes a major design flaw of it is forebearers I have had a huge problem with the earbud coverings flying off into oblivion when the plug was pulled out on the othermodels rending the unit unuseable until i found the extra buds infuriating when they are in another state the earhooks on this one ensure that will not be a problem and are thus infinitely better for use at the gym and elsewhere of course the sound quality and clarity on all of these is excellent and although you will not get any directional audio the plug design locks out surrounding sound like a champ fuctioning just as well or better than any noise-cancelling headphones in this price range,185,2
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i have very small ears and have a hard time finding headphones that stay in my ears so i thought with the wrap-around that it would stay in place but the section that goes from the earbud to the wrap-around is way too long and the wrap-around part was sticking way above my ear and instantly fell off i would not recommend these if you have small ears,68,3
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,there are two good reasons not to buy these headphones 1 they may very well fail without because as two pairs I have own have failed and 2 sony is so contemptuous of their customers that they offer to replace your defective 30 headphones with a ' reconditioned pair for 25 what a deal do yourself a favor before buying consider my experience with sony repair i mailed in my bum buds the second pair that failed but i objected to sonys pricing surely they have a better deal to offer nope sony shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap oh and they invited me to get back to them it would be our pleasure to accept a major credit card i bet 25 for used headphones with no cut to the retail middleman this is sony standing behind it is product you are on your own sucker,152,4
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have owned two pairs of these earbuds one in white one in black in each pair the left earbud has stopped working in less than a year it is closer to nine months that is almost 80 dollars I have spent on these headphones the sound quality is acceptable and they stay in your ears nicely when working out but watch out they will inevitably break i can not recommend these headphones unless you are ready to buy a new pair every year,78,5
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these headphones sound great when they are in your ear but if you are doing any thing other than sitting perfectly still they just fall out the only good thing about the hook shape is they do not fall off you head completely i personally find my self just wasting money on ear bud style headphones just to find they will not stay in my ear i have about 8 different sets i think it is time to go old school,78,6
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i like the quality of sound but the earphones do not stay in your ears well for andesigned to stay in your ears sony really missed on these,30,7
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,waste of money did not fir my ear very well and not that great o sound,15,8
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earphones have perfect sound quality and most importantly they stay in your ear while you run i have tried other headphones but these are easily worth the cost since my personal purchase i have bought them twice as a gift i will warn you to make sure you are careful with them the earbud will unclip from the wiring,59,9
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i bought a similar one year ago but the left phone was just broken i found this one is the only one on sale on amazoncom it is actually improved for it is mobility since a clip added on phone i hope it will last for more than one year i use ear phone every day,55,10
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality is subpar at best the volume and clarity of sound is about 50 of those from the original ipod packaging therefore totally worthless and waste of money in addition the wrap around feature is not adjustable and does not conform to the ear making it very difficult to keep them on unless you sit still,58,11
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,this was my third pair of sony earbud style earphones in less than three years and they quit like the two before after about 9 months one or both ears just stop working i had a pair of sony mdr-ex71 fontopia headphones whithout the over-the-ear thing and after they quit out of brand loyalty i bought another pair same thing this time i bought the mdr-ex81 and they broke a few months ago I am generally careful with my things and three times is not a coincidence so i must conclude that these earphones suck,93,12
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,it is a good headphone which fits around the ear easily and produces good sound but i actually liked the black fontopia without the thing going around the ear i gifted this to my sis and she is enjoying using it it is a good product by sony,46,13
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have been purchasing from amazon for years but this is my first review after reading all of the other reviews on this product i decided they would be the solution for running with my ipod as the stock apple earbuds just fall out well these do not adjust in any way so you would better hope your ears are the same shape and size as they would designed these for they are very uncomfortable and keep slipping plus the sound sucks other reviewers said the bass response was great bologna sounds like crap you have to shove these way way into your ear canal to get the bass but they do not stay put there and again more discomfort i hate em waste of money,121,14
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i hate ear buds not because of the sound but they absolutely wipe out my ears meaning they hurt like he shall over the years with my many ipods come the supplied ear buds that not only sound like excrement they hurt my ears after several minutes i have tried others and they are equally painful my son has a pair of the above earphones i could not believe how comfortable so quickly went the 33 route cheap at half the price they stay in sound fine and most important of all after an hour or so i am still not aware of their presence i also have sony street phones which i enjoy but these are far more compact and unobtrusive i am junking all those earphones that are in-between that are anchored by the ears some very time consuming to put on i am hard put to recommend any other product as a value for the bucks spent as i would this one,161,15
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,best headphone of all that i have tried good sounding and stay in place even during rigurous workouts,18,16
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,do not buy these they worked fine for 3 weeks and the fit was great then the volume in the right ear all but disappeared the left ear remained fine for two more weeks then it became irratic sometimes ok but most of the time soft enough that i had to sit still to hear it since i use it when i exercise this was useless now it is over 30 days from purchase date and i no longer have the original packaging so this was a total loss,88,17
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,out of 3 other types of athletic headphones I have tired these one are simply in a league of their own i can wear them forever and they feel great whereas the others hurt my ears after 5 - 10 minutes or do not even fit these never fall out they sound amazing the only downside after a year or two of hard use the rubber has ripped in two areas exposing the wires that run to the earbuds the grey part that actually goes in your ear can fall off about once a week and is often hard to find and they are impossible to find anywhere for sale does anyone know where you can buy replacement inner-ear caps or whatever they are called I had love to stock up on them so i do not have to bother spending 10 minutes searching the floor,139,18
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,bought this earphone so that i can wear it just hanging out or going to the gym it was important that the earphone looks decent and in the gym will not slipoff my ears while running this worked out really well for me i do not care that much about sound quality so i can not give an opinion about it i usually do not care to and do not notice a difference,68,19
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,earphones have earhooks that allow the unit to remain in ear during work this is what caused me to purchase the unit,22,20
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I have got no complaints with the sound versus the price after 3 months of use and use in the gym the rubber cord melted off the copper cables perhaps the sweat degrades the cable coating or something these are decent earphones as long as you do not plan to work out in them or expose them to moisture,57,21
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I am a runner and was looking for a pair of earphones that would stay put during my workouts while sony took into account ear canal size by providing different sized buds they did not put much thought into the piece that goes around the ear I am a 510 female with what i consider normal ears the loops do not even come close to hooking around my ear no amount of adjustment will make them work a few minutes into my run and the earphones pop out since they do provide decent sound quality I have resorted to using them for plane rides and sedentary endeavors,102,22
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earbuds are very comfortable and have great sound i love the changeable tips because otherwise they would be to big for my ear canal the only thing i would maybe change is that the case is a bit bulky but i can live with that,46,23
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these headphones are awesome the sound quality is amazing i definitely recommend these,13,24
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,am using them to jog with old ones fell out of my ears no complaints,15,25
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,bought 2 pair as ipod gifts based on positive experience with this model both quickly turned defective imbalance of sound one side significantly weaker than other device is not because amazon replaced 1st pair slow service after aggravating phone call to non-united states call center language skills and phone call noise objectionable now waiting several weeks for amazon to credit return on 2nd pair a shame that quality control has slipped on thisused to be good note there are refurbs of this product available at clearance spots good luck getting a good pair bottom line 2 pair earphones defective customer service poor amazon and sony need to do better,111,26
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i purchased thisfor a friend of mine in dominican republic and he loves it he mentioned me that the audio quality is superior,25,27
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these sound great but are too big for my ears I am an above-average sized adult male i do not think i have small ears and yet these do not stay on my ears because the loops are too tall i honestly can not imagine these fitting more than 5 of human ears ridiculous,51,28
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have nothing but good things to say about this buy it you will not be disappointed if you are looking for over the ear earphones with crystal clear sound,30,29
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,well they certainly work they deliver a crisp clear sound and are well worth the price they are also far more comfortable than the stock ipod head phones especially for someone with small ears plus they stay in your ears when working out or running my only complaint is that they go so far into your skull that you can hear your own breathing heartbeat and more and as a former hearing aid technician i would not recommend prolonged or high volume usage,81,30
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,simply put these seem like a great set of earphones just like the in ear model 71s but they did not fit over the top of my ear my thought was that these would be great for sports so as you ran along they would stay on the post between the plastic ear band and the earphone is too long i can only imagine how big ears have to be for these to fit on properly they are great for sticking in your ear and cutting out backround noise and they sound great they just do not fit and that is on many people,102,31
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i am no audiophile but i found the sound quality to be the same as my sony mdr-ex71s and better than the stock ipod set however i bought these because i thought they would stay on and in my ears better when working out running and snowboarding no such luck the rubber ear cups work fine but the ear loop that is supposed to keep the earphones on my head are too big and are not adjustable so they just fall off like my other set that is why i gave these a low score poor design ruined these for me,101,32
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,good for sony i think is 1 of my best purchase last year first class product whit and excelent price powerfull bass clear treable very confort design comes whit a case for care,33,33
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,well i bought these mostly because i like sony products they are more comfortable then the ear plugs that came with my ipod that is for sure they work good around evryday things but on the airline forget it i did not know they have noice canceling head sets for that soooo i bought a sony headset around 5000 they work a little better but i guess ubless you buy something really expensive maybe like bose the same thing will happen,79,34
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earphones are so light you forget you are wearing them i am very happy with my purchase e field,20,35
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was looking for a nice in-ear headphone for the gym to listen to audio books and found these sony fontopia headphones with great reviews i picked this mdr-ex81lp white over other fontopia models due to it is sport style I am a woman with normal ears but these headphones did not stay in my ears even when i was sitting still it was falling out all the time and very annoying especially when i was on the elliptical machine or lifting weights so if your intention is to use at the gym or workout i will not recommend,95,36
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones i could not get them to stay in / on my ears the loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome these may fit men with bigger ears better but i would not recommend them for females,52,37
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I have never heard clarity and range of highs and lows in any earbud headphones like these sony mdr-ex81lps and it is wrap-around-the-ear design means it never falls out including during my most aggressive work-outs at the gym and is not it great to block out at least 80 of the ambient sound in that gym so although i have not listened to every ear-bud out there i think you would be hard-pressed to find a better sound in such a small package especially at this price,80,38
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,my son specifically asked for these head phones i received them in a timely manner for his birthday,18,39
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these earphones to replace the set i got with my sandisk sansa m240 mp3 player as for the sound they are a little high on the treble ends to he point of being tinny just not enough bass could be the player as i have not yet tried them with anything else the fit is excellent in the ear canal but over the ear well it could be better maybe i just have big ears overall good sound and decent fit,83,40
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i like theand sonys technology of the earphone itself but the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless when i put the earphone in the ears the hanger part is just hanging in the air not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady because of that the earphones easily pop out of your ear,61,41
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the sound is great they fit snugly in my ear do not fit around my ears well do not care for the one wire longer than the other wish wires had adjustable piece to make it fit tighter,36,42
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,sony has an ultra-short 90 day warranty on these headphones mine broke after the warranty expired I had expect that from a cheap set of earbuds but not from an expensive set made by a name like sony I shall try a different brand next time,44,43
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I am on my 2nd pair of the headsets the sound is far better than the standard-issue ipod headsets and they are priced right plus the earplugs do block out a lot of ambient noise the problem i wear them almost daily at the gym after several months wear the volume diminishes sweat and whatever else seem to block up a pin-hole in each earplug that has not kept me from buying 2 pairs obviously but i wish there were a way to clean them,82,44
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,unlike other reviewers this earphones fit my ears perfectly i used it for indoor exercising 3 times a week it sounded great too unfortunately after 4 months one of the earphone stopped working and of course it is just out of the warranty time i did not expect such a poor quality from sony so i rate it 2 stars,58,45
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,my cord melted away after a month or so of use the soft rubber covering the wires to the earphones are easily damaged and once you get a tear it will continue to strip leaving the cord exposed good sound but you will look horrible with exposed copper wires hanging from your ears pass on thisuntil they figure out how to build it better,66,46
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,if you are the kind of user who can always carry the included carrying case then my comment will be irrelevant enjoy the earphones as they are as good as ex71 however i usually keep my earphones wrapped around my ipod and unless you are super careful the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles the same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle also the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while i use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses it is doable but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears finally the whitegoes well with the white ipod models but after a few months they tend to show the grime all too well my advice i do not think that any claimed audio improvement over ex-71 is worth the extra hassle if your heart is set on this model get the black one,150,47
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,these earbuds are absolutely terrible first the wires constantly tangle i bought these f-ing things so that i could stay motivated while exercising but it is a real morale killer to spend about 3 or 4 minutes getting them untangled before ever getting a chance to use them but this is assuming they are products you want to use in the past i had used these earbuds while lifting weights under such circumstances the experience is awful not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement but since the wire is meant to hang around your head and thus behind your back good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything awful for the first time tonight i decided to run with my mp3 player every few minutes i had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears no one should have to endure this bs from a product that is meant to enhance their listening experience enough is enough I am getting new earbuds do not buy these,181,48
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,since my daughters every waking day begins and ends with music these replacements get a great work out she uses these earphones so much that she has not used her backup units also purchased from amazon,36,49
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i guess i have small ears the loop that goes around the ear goes way over my ear i admit that the earbuds themselves are great but the loop only works if your earsize is bigger than average i called sony and they were no help with the problem so i returned the headphones,54,50
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,good ear buds the sound is great but a little bit difficult to set them in the right position they tend to come off easely i used them in the office so i can not tell you if they are good for running or other sport activity too nevertheless the sound is great,53,51
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,true there are other headphones out there however they will be more pricey these are the best results i have had with earbud style headphones the loop and different sized rubber pieces helped me to achieve the perfect fit I am so happy i can finally get them to stay on oh and by the way the sound is good also I am very satisfied with the product because i feel that i have gotten my moneys worth,75,52
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these earphones for my mp3 player i just have one question where has the bass the bass is pretty much nonexistent the crummy earphones that came with my mp3 were a lot better than these awesome design but without the sound it is just an expensive paperweight not recommended at all,51,53
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i just got back from the doctor because the earphone cover on this sony mdr plugs came off and was lodged in my ear canal for the last 3 days i have never written an online review in my life but for the sake of your health do not use these headphones the plugs work by literally being placed fairly deep into your ear canal with enough perspiration this rubber cover can come off unfortunately when i removed the earphones the rubber cover did not come with it and the gray cover stayed in my ear it not only impaired my hearing but caused a good deal of pain and headaches for a few days until i just got my physician to pry it out even as i write this I am laughing a bit since it is somewhat humorous that something so absurd can happen but I am only able to laugh because it is out of my f and ing ear you have been warned they are snug but could be hazardous to your health thank god it came out I am going to stay away from plugs in general especially when i used for running nothing should be placed deep into your ear to work just not worth the risk,201,54
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,at first i did not like these headphones much because they seemed to be very weak when it came to bass they sound was distant and tinny then i tried the medium size earbuds which allowed me to push the headphones a little farther into my ears i had been using the large size earbuds at first and it made all the difference in the world now they sound fantastic with the three sizes of earbuds included you should be able to find a size that fits your ears make sure you try all three sizes and place the earbuds as far into your ears as possible before you decide if you like the sound on these headphones,117,55
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,these fit in my ears and sound great but the loops go completely over my ear when i go running they constantly fall out I shall post a photo shortly,29,56
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,my white mdr-ex81 has now disintegrated where the rubber wire coating has rips in many places and very gummy and sticky it is as if it is melting away bad chemistry it is easily tangled and irritating to undo it also due to sticky coating this product has been discontinued by sony do not buy this product,57,57
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these are great they are comfortable and sound great using then in the gym is a great relief since they do not fall out when you get a bit sweaty,29,58
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these for 30 at the same time i bought some koss sport clip phones ksc75 for around 13 and the koss sound much better than these i can not even listen to music with the sony earphones it is so tinny they can only be used for talk radio and then they are marginal so beware,55,59
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I am very dissapointed on regard this headphones for the price brand and aspect i expected a great sound none of the above the sound is bright in excess an you will not hear any bass is unpleasant i tried different ways to insert them in my ears and no change changed the plastic cups and nothig readed and search in the instructions which are just a few lines and nothing looked at te web and no more info conclusion if there is no info there is no answer i wasted my time and my money you know it now is your call,101,60
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i love them they have good bass sound and they do not hurt my ears like other ear bud earphones do,20,61
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,it has been stated over and over again these headphones are great for the first couple months this accounts for the great reviews but the rubber around the wire will start to come off right after your 3 month warranty runs out it is strange but true once again rubber disintegrates after 3 months read the reviews it happens on both white and black i have the black the rubber is broke in 6 different spots and sticky unfortunately sony is not putting out a support alert on this product because they have not received enough calls on it from owners that have had this fail within the 3 month warranty period,110,62
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these are very convenient headphones you can wear them for long durations without discomfort some of the headphones that I have owned in the past have been really uncomfortable when used for long durations but not these the sound quality is good and the range of frequencies it handles is great i got very natural sounding lows mids and highs when i tested them with some mp3s that i have they do eliminate ambient noise quite a bit due to the snug fit soft ear plugs the loop around the ear stops them from comming off when exercising i would certainly recommend these,102,63
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,like the ex71 these earphones from sony are an embarrassment to the name sony used to produce a quality product not any more the sound is flat there is absolutely no bass I am also surprised that amazon when you return a product makes you pay for shipping both ways i do not plan to purchase things i have not tried anymore from amazon,62,64
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i gave mine away these do not fit smaller ears note all the raves are from men if you can stick the buds into your ear as they are meant to be like the ex51/71sls the wraparounds stick up and look silly suspended over your my ears rendering the ear pieces superfulous they are not the easiest things to put on either and you must take care if you wear earrings i recommend the ex51sl or ex71sls which you just plug in and be on your way,86,65
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,sony is trying to be unique in this design but i have a problem with the fitting and the rubber around the wire started to unravel after couple months of usage i am disatisfied with this product,37,66
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,great sound and a great case the carrying case i got with mine is a white oval hard case that fits the earphones great and also contains one pair each of small medium and large earbuds after wearing them for over an hour they get a little uncomfortable i have no comment on the longevity but after 2 months of light use mine are still like new,67,67
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,very good earbuds considering the small price sounds excellent in everything except rock a guitar sounds really loud and scratchy i consider the case that comes with these to be useless overall a very good product,36,68
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these earphones from amazon and used them religiously with an ipod shuffle while bicycling for exactly seven months the sound quality was more than acceptable and the earphones were very comfortable however they are no longer usable because the white coating on the wires has become sticky and has started to disintegrate exposing the wires underneath these earphones come only with a 90 day warranty from sony sony will replace them with a refurbished pair for about the price of a new pair 2900 previous reviewers have noted the same problem and suggested that sony respond to this they have they have discontinued the product,108,69
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i loved this headphones they were the excellent ipod headphones replacements they have got fabulous reviews but just do a google search typing ear buds hear all serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones unlike headphones that go around the ear these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you are projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process those cells are very very sensitive to noise damage earbuds allow sounds in the environment toin often causing the user to turn up the volume,146,70
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these because i travel a lot and like to listen to music books and more in the plane the sound on these are good for the money when inserted into the ear they do a good job of muffling most of the ambient noise one complaint the silicone earbuds will become dislodged and can be lost easily recently i lost one of the silione earbuds during a flight could use the earphone without them but it was very uncomfortable sony charges 895 for a single large earbud and 695 for a single small or medium that is a little on the ridiculous for a small piece of silicone that costs mere pennies to produce not to mention you do not even get a pair they are hard to find also i found a company called audiocube that sells a pair for 10 better than 14 sony wants but still expensive shipping is 7 in us so you are out 17 if you want a pair for backup,165,71
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I am going to order this at amazoncom from an awesome deal i found on dailytoolcom i think this is a very decent price for this white earphones,27,72
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,comfortable and fantastic sound much better than the stock earbuds that come with the ipod highly recommend,17,73
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,pretty good replacement for my old ipod headphones they have the same benefits size easy to store and more and drawbacks cords get tangled sound quality and more as any other earbud headphones would the sound is just ok as expected but noticibly better than the ipod headphones so it was a good upgrade worth the cost,55,74
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these and all the fontopia line sound great the big problem is the rubber coating on the wire comes off easily it feels like bubblegum,25,75
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i recently purchased a moderately priced mp3 player and was fully excepting the earphones that came with the product to be the weakest link my anticipation proved to be accurate i replaced them with the sony mdr-ex91lp set and the sound quality improvement was remarkable of course one could spend a great deal more on earphones but for the price these sony earphones are a great value,67,76
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i bought these earphones based on the amazon rating and have unfortunately been very disappointed i wear them primarily at the gym with my ipod nano while the sound quality is very good unfortunately they do not stay put and i am constantly having to fiddle with them to stay on the loop is just too big for my ears so when i put the ear bud into my ear the loop part sits way above and outside my ear not snugly fitting there is no way to adjust them unfortunately and it only gets worse when i sweat during a workout because then they are sliding off i also paid full price for them at the time january 06 and now they are discounted but even at that price they are of no use to me I am now in the market again for a set of earphones with good sound quality that are also a good fit for me any suggestions are welcome,164,77
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these ear buds were great they were cheaper on amazon and they sound quality is excellent they arrived in a timley fashion,22,78
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the earphone is pretty good and it gives exceptional sound quality it is easy to use sometime it comes off the ears but it is not a major problem overall it is very good,31,79
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,it does a very good job considering the price i use it everyday for my commute i take trains to work and i can listen to my ipod without blowing off my ears it is worth every penny you can get better noise cancelling headphones but they are bulky and north of 100 bucks,54,80
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the sound quality is tinny the treble range is fine but the bass response is absurdly bad to listen with these things is like leaving out entire instruments so if all you listen to are i dunno flutes go ahead and buy them but for normal music they are really not even better than the standard ipod headphones,57,81
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality is excellent do not get me wrong these earphones put out clear treble deep bass without washing everything else out and have a well balanced tone that i have not found in most other headphones i have used the backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect but does a better job than most earphones my biggest problem the fit i opted for the over-the-ear style because i thought it would be better for an active lifestyle and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are the length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make they simply do not work in my case others may have different a experience the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe almost an inch too far down for these to fit right huge mistake not making them adjustable sony bad bad bad design it is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones i have used,180,82
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i am not an audiophile i just need headphones that do a decent job of isolating me from external sounds and that are very mobile so i can not comment too much on how perfect the sound is from the sonys but my amateur opinion is that they sound great the sound isolation is not too bad but not too great either I had say they attenuate incoming external noise by about 50 i own a pair of etymotics er 4 micropro earphones cost 300 and the sony mdr-ex81lps a have much deeper bass response i use the etymotics correctly that is press them all the way into your ear until your feel that sucking feeling and when i do so i can barely hear what has going on around me so the etymotics are much better than the sonys for sound isolation i have not had a problem with the cords or durability but I have only used the headphones about 10 times no visible wear so far i love them and am glad i bought them i prefer to use them when total sound isolation is not necessary,183,83
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,great fit and sound does not work well with a cell phone adapter 25 mm to 15 mm do not buy for a cell phone but only for a device that uses 25 mm,31,84
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the ear piece is flimsy sound quality is good i do a lot of running and the things kept on popping out of my ears and if they do not stay in your ears you can not hear the music well you can but the quality drops from a 8 to a 1 i gave it to a friend of mine that just sits around and listens to music,67,85
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these earphones are awesome they are far superior to anything you would get oem with your mp3 player or other audio device it takes a little time to get used to these earphones and getting them to fit comfortably however once you do they do not fall out and sound great before during and after workout the only disadvantage seems to be the shorter cord to the left ear this is designed so that the main cord goes down on the side of your body rather than your chest but takes a little while to get used to and to hide the cord away in your clothing i wish the cord was shorter like with other sony earphones so that i could plug it into my in-line remote and not have a 22 m long cord but without a remote these are a great length for just about any type of use,150,86
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i got an ipod several month ago and want to boost the bass for my music so i decide to got this new set of headset it sounds good and clear but according to the bass it is really not as good as my original ipod set,46,87
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i usually have problems with ear-bud type headphones but this one is very comfortable even when used for 2 - 3 hours at a time i highly recommend these for the ear-bud skeptics the sound quality is excellent also,37,88
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,the best pair of ear buds i have had so far the sound quality is great and actually has a large amount of bass with the cords wrapping behind my ear i no longer have to worry about the buds coming out whenever the cord gets caught on something,49,89
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,indeed the sound quality on these is excellent but i am on my second pair namely because of the cord attached to the right earphone after a few months it loosens and inexplicably develops a putty like quality which soon peels away from the inner wire sony should have fixed this issue long ago,54,90
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the headphones have good sound and the buds themselves fit into the ear well the problem is with the ear pieces that fit over the ears they fit either my wife or me they evidently were designed by an engineer with big ears,43,91
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have purchased several earphones for my ipod shuffle including the apple small earbuds and the altec lansing im302 and these are the best in terms fit they also sound great,31,92
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,let me start by saying that I am pleased these phones definitely have improved bass response compared to the last ones 61s that i had from sony but they have definitely sacrificed some of the clarity you would expect from the stuck-in-your-ear type earbuds the pros the carrying case after i figured it out is very cool the over-ear hooks are nice they fit very good and block out a lot of the outside noise decent bass repsonse the cons the technology that sony has implemented in these earbuds definitely improves bass response but it comes at the cost of some clarity do not get me wrong they sound good they just do not sound great but definitely worth the price,118,93
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the packaging is great and the headphones come with different sizes of earbds and a neat little carrying case it is a very comfortable set to wear all of which makes it a real pity that the sound quality is terrible it sounds tinny it has none of the quality of sound of the standard ipod earbuds so i rate it 1 star for sound quality but bumped it up one star for the package as a whole,79,94
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i have had about 4 pairs of sony headphones from the basic earbud ones to these with the wrap-around-the-ear style I have loved every pair I have had very comforatble very nice sound quality which is why I have been so disappointed every time they have died these headphones will stop working within a year I have tried it 4 times it is true i use them for working out running or just when i need to be alone with music and they have worked just great [ ],82,95
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have very small ears most ear-bud earphones are painful for me to wear these are the first that really fit me and stay on well they have 3 sizes of rubber covers to fit all ear sizes i use them at work and they cut the noise out very well on top of all that they sound great,59,96
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have gotten these three times from and within three weeks of gentle use each ear bud started playing at two differnt levels one fine the second about a third of the volume they are very comfortable but i did have some trouble fitting them i guess i have smaller ears i could use them at the desk but did not work for me at the gym,66,97
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i picked this headset over many other options for the price and comfortable secure fit they advertise along with premium sound and superior bass if you like listening to all your music filtered through a tin can these are for you there is little to no bass and the earbuds fallout with great ease makes for a great time at the gym if you like messing with your overpriced headset and not working out do not buy and if you do want to buy them you can have mine since i can not return them now,97,98
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i just bought these as a gift for my brother I have had them for almost 2 years now these headphones produce a crisp quality sound i wear them when i run outside and the only drawback is that you can not hear anything but the music that you are listening to someone could sneak up behind you and bonk you on the head and you would never hear them coming if you had these headphones on ok unlikely scenario but the description should give you a goodof how outside noise is completely eliminated i highly recommend these headphones,98,99
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,1 the over-the-ear hooks do not really fit over my ears they sort of balance on top of the ear they are not adjustable I am an average-sized male so it is hard to fathom this design 2 the buds pop out of my ears when they get wet from sweat from exercise all 3 sizes of plastic earpiece covers do the same thing 3 the sound quality is mediocre bass response is especially weak 4 after less than one months use the volume on the left earpiece dropped to around 1/4 of the volume of the right all in all I am thankful therefore for amazoncoms return policy I shall use the money from the refund to buy a different set of earphones,120,100
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,the ipod earbuds just do not stay in my ears which i found very frustrating these are great there are three options for the pads so you will find one that fits i was concerned from the picture that the bar that hangs down and connects the ear hook to the earbud was too long it is not adjustable but it is not an issue the design makes these very adjustable and comfortable also if you have only heard your ipod on the standard earbuds you are in for a treat the sound out of these is just fantastic so much better than the original earbuds the price i paid was about the same as buycom but amazon was shipping for free so this is a better deal i strongly recommend these for anyone who wants comfortable earbuds with a marked improvement in sound at a very reasonable price i can not wait to hit the slopes with them enjoy,156,101
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,first i bought these because i hate earbuds inserted into my ear so i thought the over the ear feature would be great however the sound quality from these is very weak the stock ipod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound to get any usable sound i have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible which is exactly what i hate even then the sound is hollow and tinny second the over the ear feature does not work for snot i can not get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time plus this is a non-adjustable element i think my ears are a pretty average size and shape but i can not use them i guess it does not matter anyhow since the sound quality is so poor the carrying case is a nice touch but about twice as large as it should be,168,102
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these head phones are great the sound is clear and it fits great on the ear it comes with three different ear bud size that allows you to change between them and use whatever is comfortable however there has one thing that i do not like about it i worked in an office where there are carpet floors and since there has metal around the head phone near the ear buds static electricity transfer up to the metal rods quite often if you like your ears being shock or if you can keep your feet still then go for it just giving everybody a heads up,104,103
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these headphones for my ipod because the bud type headphones always come out of my ears and are terribly uncomfortable the ear hook design is a fabulous improvement the customizable earbud fittings also ensured these headphones have a very comfortable fit the sound is great from these headphones although the volume the headphones produce is lesser than what my ipod earbuds produce for the most part this is ok the only time this is an issue for me is when i am on an airplane announcements from flight attendants and from the cockpit drown out the volume even when my ipod is at the highest levels the only thing i do not like about these headphones is the earpieces have different length cords before reaching the single cord that goes to the mp3 player or whatever you are listening to this is picky i know but it makes it difficult to wrap up the headphones and requires that i strap my ipod nano on my left arm when i run if i need another pair of headphones in the near future and want to stay in this price range i would probably buy these again,198,104
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i bought these hoping they would stay in my ears while working out they are worse than the standard ipod earphones completely useless,23,105
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,definetely great sound superb clarity even if you take it to it is limits basses and trebles are nicely balanced and a natural sound is obtained there are several buts although the most important one being the difficulty of use the back cable is a mistake and the cable extension connection is always pulling your left ear down not a pleasant feeling when you want to move your head another problem i had is an interesting one one day i saw a cut in the coating of the cable and that got bigger and bigger that coating is supposed to hold the inner cables together but ex81s is made out of play-doh now there is a huge part only with the two inner cables and i can stretch the rest of the coating to cover that part it is that soft,140,106
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i got these yesterday after some glitches in the amazon where is my stuff system i was not sure if i wasn going to recieve it yesterday but i did i used them all last night and most of today and have been great so far one thing i have noticed is a very faint crackling in the left heapphone although it may just be my computer as i havnt noticed it when listening to the ipod or a defect with this set of headphones as several people have already mentioned the ear hooks are a bit large but are still a comfortable fit they just stick out the top a little bit apart from that they have great sound great bass and awsome treble so i give it 4/5 rating good job sony,131,107
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,beware beware first off they sound like craaaaaaap i have heard better sound comming off finger nails and a chalk board the orgianl ipod ear buds put these to shame next the ear hooks coolif your freaking dumbo must be some big eared freaks at sony when they designed these things no i do not have tiny ears these are just some big dang hooks I am not the only one who feels this way keep reading other reviews,79,108
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,overall the mdr-ex81lp is a decent replacement over the apple supplied earbuds that came with my ipod shuffle but too much bass for my taste the midrange is a little weak and vocals suffers the hangers are a bit large for my ears and as such do not fit snug around my ears but they are not falling off after useing them for a couple of hours of listening my ears do not feel fatigued i would have liked the ex81lps to be more neutral sounding but good value for what you pay,90,109
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the headphone line is made from 1 a material that sticks together making them difficult to unravel and 2 a material that falls apart from twisting and otherwise 6 months old and i need to buy a new pair keep looking for another pair,44,110
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,after trying these out for 3 weeks i dislike them for the gym they do not sit in your ear very well if you are running and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose if you are just sitting around they are ok but they still seem to fall out the flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming this means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box when i bought these i thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape but that did not hold true I have tried these along with other sony portable headphones like the mdr-g73lp never buying any more sonys again they always seems to miss something that makes it annoying I shall try buying those over-the-ear koss headphones instead,142,111
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i am not an expert in earphones therefore this review caveat emptor i broke my ipod earphones these are replacements i did not have the orginial ipod earphones to use for comparison i do not have a pair of enclose earphones for comparison either based on comparison with some cheap substitutes very cheap i was using in the interm they sony is definately better the bass is superior the range in the sound is great my favorite feature is sound insulation non-bud style earphones tend not to insulate outside sound very well I have had to turn the sound to maximum in the gym due to the ambient noise however with the sony provides excellent insulation against outside noise while providing clear sound,122,112
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i had ex50 ex70 and ex81 earphone performed about the same i can not notice any difference ex81 had loop around the ear it works pretty good construction on the ex81 is better than ex50 and ex70/71 white one,38,113
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,does this earphone have a detachable extension cord,9,114
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,ok i just got them through my mail well the headphone looking by bright pros can hear any surroundings might be bad because i barely hear car honking at me 30 is not too bad for these headphones easy to use very comfortable cons a bit costly low noise compared to ipod earbuds the chord are diferent length overall i say worth the money,61,115
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the sound is not very loud and clear and there has is no bass at all not worth the money,19,116
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these headphones sound absolutely claer and dynamic the sound is full and bright the bass not overpowering they are very light and comfortable the asymmetric cord takes getting use to the downside is that every movement of the cord gets transmitted into the earphones so they are great if you are sitting and reading while listening to music not so great if you are excercising,65,117
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,muy contento con mi compra es un producto solo para los que saben con una respuesta muy por encima de todos los productos de sony que he probado en esta categoria confort ya que son casi inperseptibles no molestan usan la resonancia interna del cuerpo para generar un mejor audio reconosco que de primera me decepcione pero despeus de unos minutos se nota la calidad del produto con su sistema de cancelacion del ruido en definitiva una muy buena compra se los recomiendo,83,118
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the title says it all these are not good for small ears they are not adjustable and they will just fall right off with the least movement namely running sound seems fine when the darn things are actually in and on my ears still looking for earbud headphones that will work for me,54,119
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews on these earphones when i took them out of the box and tried them with my ipod i could barely hear anything unless i turned the ipod volume 3/4 up i have to believe they sent me damaged merchandise because these were the worse sounding earphones of all time i immediately sent them back and opted to just stay with my basic ipod phones which seemed 5 star compared to the mdr-ex81lps,85,120
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,great sound very comfortable and easy to use very high quality of sound but not as much base as the shure 2c which i had before,26,121
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i have now owned 2 pairs of these headphones they soind great but they do not last the rubber cord tends to melt away leaving exposed wire after less than 2 months this then will give you a great little shock from time to time eventually you will hear pops and cracks i loved the sound and feel but the quality of manufacturing was just crap avoid these if you can,71,122
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,been using these now for a month and have no complaints they are much better than the stock ipod ear phones and stay in my ear better i use these primarily under my motorcycle helmet and they are perfet for the task the loop holds on well and the rubber gaskets really seal out background noise overall great phones for the price,62,123
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,at first the headphones did not seem to fit right but that was before i discovered the different size of earbuds once i switched to another size the headphones worked great they do not fall out like other headphones and that is great since i use them when i workout i give these headphones a,49,124
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,they sound great however the length of the shafts are too long for my ears after several seconds of a slow jog these little buggers fall right out some manufacturers have adjustable shafts this model does not if you have big ears they will most likely be fine if you are the proud owner of small ears look for other earphones,59,125
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i ordered these headphones because i was looking to improve upon the ipod headphones that come in the package the reviews on the site were great i am extremely disappointed that i wasted my money on these lousy headphones the sound quality is actually worse than the headphones that come packaged with the ipod they are much more likely to become tangled in your bag than the ipod headphones and the silly carrying case that is supposed to prevent tangling is totally ridiculous to even contemplate using not to mention they are very uncomfortable in your ears if i had wanted to have the feeling like i was wearing earplugs i would have gotten the noise-cancelling kind these do not block out any noise at all yet have the uncomfortable feeling of noise-cancelling headphones do not waste your money on these,138,126
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i keep buying this style because they sound so good for the style but the loops just do not fit around me ears right,23,127
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,when can you say listening to rock n roll softly sounded well fact is these phones do not sound as good at peak listening levels yet if you are a careful listener that appreciates nuances then finding that correct volume will immerse you better than any other 40 private listener you have ever heard i own 800 studio phones that these cheap sonys give a pretty good run for the money,71,128
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i am audio purist so as soon as i bought my ipod i chucked the standard ipod headphones and bought the 50 ipod premium ones they had nice highs n mids but the lows kinda tinny well one day they fell outa my ear on the bus and someone stepped on one and broke it overall i was pretty happy with them so i was considering buying them again until i came across these headphones my sister in law bought me them as a present and I am happier than ever they are amazing in every way i have very small ears and the small earbuds fit perfectly and the clip secures them to my ear in case they get a lil tug the bass is very clearly defined because of the special sony magnet that you will only find in these in-ear headphones plus they block out outisde sound due to their ear-plug like shapping as far as in-ear headphones go none in this price range beat these,166,129
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was very happy with these headphones initially sound is pretty good for cost and they are very comfortable to wear having purchased sonys previous in-ear fontopia designs i was very excited to have some that would work well for exercising my previous complaint being the they would fall out of your ears whatever material they are using on these headphones begins to disintegrate about a month after purchase whether this is caused by sweat from working or not i do not know buyer beware my headphones have been reduced to bare wire,92,130
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,flimsy plastic hoops over the ears do not fit snug enough on my smaller ears and are not adjustable at all so they just fall out worse than ear-buds from that standpoint not much low end either it seems there is not much you can do other than keep buying earphones and trying them no retailers let you try them on for obvious reasons i read reviews and they were very positive for this product all around but I am finding reviews on earphones in general do not seem to be very reliable this was my 3rd pair of disapointing earphone products best fit for clip over the ear types I have found so far are the overpriced b o a8s they are a bit heavy and the earbuds are a bit large for my ear-canals but the hoops are adjustable and have decent base a lot to pay at 130 but what are you going to do if i had to do it again I had just buy the clunky over the head hoop type for my situation,173,131
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality for a person who does not care that much is excellent way better than the stock phones that came with my mp3 player however i chose these phones because of the wrap around i thought it would be more snug for when I am traveling or working out at the gym i was disappointed to find out that they are not adjustable and they were twice the size of my ears I am 52 and female i guess i have small ears but my friend who is 510 and a guy tried them on and they were still too big why would sony think that there is only one size of ear and why make earphones for ogres weird i sent these back,123,132
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,paid 129 after 30 coupon for signing up for amazonin june 05 amazing sound so far and I am quite impressed by the depth and clarity I have not used them extensively enough to comment on the cord durability i give it 4 stars since I have not had them long enough to experience any issues described by other reviewers yet update 12/18/08 thse earphones are still as good as ever and the cord is still intact thogh it has turned yellow in portions that are regularly in contact with the skin during workout due to the sweat,98,133
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,love these headphones I have tried 5 different earbud type headphones over the last few years for use on my motorcycle and these are far and above the best I have used jabra koss and others and none were as comfortable or sounded as good as these I have owned them for 2 weeks now and ridden a lot with them in windy condiitons no cord disintegraton has be noticed as mentioned in other reviews reccomended without reservation,76,134
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,finally i have found a good replacement for apple earbuds apple earbuds never seem to fit well and would always fall out these earphones have a good fit and stay put sound quality is very good comes with nice carrying case that helps keep the cord straight when not using them,51,135
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these seem pretty good but i am no audiophile and these are the first head phones of this kind I have ever tried seems like good quality for the money although,30,136
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i played around with these headphones as soon as i received them and soon realized that the aluminum shaft between the ear piece and the speaker was much too long the bud itself fits into my ear just fine and i can see how they would be useful in the gym the very reason i picked them up if i wear them as they were intended inside the ear canal then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose i played around with them and realized this problem could easily be fixed with a shorter shaft about half the size if you have large ears these would fit and feel great i consider my ears average in no way are they small the speaker is remotely adjustable swivling a tiny tiny bit bottom line these ear phones would be great if they had about five more ways to adjust them,155,137
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,left earbud failed within 10 hours of use buds would not stay inserted in my admittedly small ear canals so they were worthless for exercising sound not any better than basic buds anyway do not bother with these,37,138
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,after reading reviews for these earbuds i thought here is the answer well they were not they fall out of my ears which may be a blessing in disguise because the sound is underwhelming they are very treble weak sounding earbuds with little full sound i will keep looking,48,139
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these sony headphones are really great before having themi had to put them back in my ears because they kept coming off and i had to constantly change volume because off the different street noisesbut now with these i never have to change volume because they block almost all the town noise but they do not cover voices it even stop my skateboard noise hand they do not come offi say without a doubt that these are the best i have ha ve ever had an d some of the cheapest,89,140
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i use these for exercise with my ipod I am a recording engineer so I am picky about sound quality these sound great feel comfortable in my ears and provide decent sound isolation without blocking all sound my only slight complaint is that the hooks that go around your ears are a little too big and they do not really work quite as they should i have other similar sony earphones that had a better design in this area great earphones for the money although,82,141
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the headphones fit alright but not that great i guess you need bigger ears for them the good news they do not fall out and the little rubber things do not fall off and they are white to match the ipod,39,142
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,this head phone works very good heavy sounds are heard very clearly good design and very light give me a style and i do not get tired even if i wear it for half a day,35,143
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i enjoy running and mountain biking with my ipod and ipod shuffle i wear over-the-ear ear-bud headphones every day and own quite a few sets my current favorites are some inexpensive ones branded phillips although i have seen other companys names on the same model but i have been unable to find them recently so i got these sonys to try big disappointment the sound is really quite poor it is tinny and high almost piercing at higher volumes and totally lacks bass plugging my old earbuds into the same device without adjusting the volume and comparing it to these sonys just underscores how poorly these perform the fit is also lacking when running there is nothing which breaks the revery of hitting your stride like constantly having to shove an earphone back in your ear they hang over your ear like overcooked linguini i could even excuse the poor sound quality if they stayed put for more than 1/4 mile of running i would only give them 1 star but they look kind of nice so i decided to be generous,182,144
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was looking for a replacement for apple ipod earbuds and these were not it the critical flaw was very poor bass it was almost defective sounding in the instruction it says something like if you do not hear high quality bass place the headphones further in your ear that is a lawsuit waiting to happen even following the inane instructions i could not get the bass much better i returned the headphones,71,145
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,this is the worst earphone pictures i have made i usually do not write reviews but felt the overwhelming need to write this one after reading so many positive reviews about these earphones i decided to pull the trigger and buy it the sound is okay but it was like he shall trying to get these to stay in your ears without sticking all the way in your ear drum get the standard earphones without the loop it will be much better,80,146
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i was very dissapointed with these earbuds until that is i used the smaller earbuds very good sound definition it has a high bass treble response i am using them for overall listening and as in-ear monitors at my church so far very happy the back ear flaps could be smaller as someone else mentioned earlier get these you will be suprized at how good the sound quality is i was going to buy the shure e4cs but i am so pleased with these i do not think that is necessary good job sony,92,147
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the headphones have great sound quality and if your ears are the right size fit on you perfectly but if you use them alot they quickly fall apart and break and that is from daily use not from abuse the cord is made out of some fabric that as another reviewer said almost seems to dissolve it is like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips and where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself these seem like headphones that were designed for short short use i got about 2 months use out of them and am extremely mad that this has happened so soon for even 30 it is just not worth your time,139,148
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I am no audiophile but i know how cheap headphones sound like and these sonys sound significantly better first off you need to stick this in your ears properly else you will not get good fidelity sound is generally well-balanced bass is not booming this is good but treble is still a bit overemphasized which leads to crackling typical of cheap phones volume is lower than most cheapos which can mean a lot of things but still acceptable ergonomics are good the buds fit in the ears nicely provides good isolation to outside noise i do not know how comfortable these are for sports since sweat inside the ear canal gets annoying for other things they are pretty good although you are not going to forget you are wearing them it is like wearing silicone earplugs which i do for swimming for a prolonged period of time so it can not be that bad overall a good value but not quite there yet I am not spending 100 for the shures so I am just going to keep looking for my whale I am giving it 5 because it fulfills my expectation of what 30 can get me,187,149
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,well i was completely happy with these until the white material that wraps the cables started to dissolve i do not know if it is because of daily use i used extensively for commuting purpose every day or if it is due to super-powerful sweat doubt that long story short these worked fine for less than four months and now with the white cords falling apart they are completely unusable,69,150
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i originally bought the ex71-sls which had spectacular sound quality and frontal-lobotomy-inspired design i switched to these expecting the sound quality to be lower than the 71s particularly the bass and that has definitely been the case the bass is clearly not as pronounced as the 71s but that is not necessarily a terrible thing had i never heard the 71s i would not have anything to compare these to however the design fit and quality of these is muuuuuuch better than the 71s scale of 1 - 10 the sound quality of the 71s is a 10 and the 81s these are an 8 or so but as for design i would give these an 8 and the 71s a 3 so the nod definitely goes to the 81s,124,151
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i just received these headphones after ordering them a few days ago and it is very disappointing for me to say that I am sending them straight back after paying thirty bucks for a pair of earphones which are listed at 50 i would expect much more than what i got which involved turning up the sound on my mp3 player to nearly the maximum level only to hear tinny distant-sounding music and here i have to note that my player is a creative zen touch which according to the reviews I have read many self-proclaimed audiophiles believe has the best sound quality of any mp3 player currently on the market granted I am no expert but it is funny to think that the included earphones which many of these same audiophiles apparently regard with contempt sounded a thousand times better to me than these more expensive higher quality earphones i guess this is proof positive that you can rarely rely on someone elses opinion personal experience is the real path to knowledge,165,152
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,took a long time to get it in the ear and then it does not stay in ended up returning it to get the white 51s instead at least with the 51s everybody knows how to wear it,37,153
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i really like the ear buds that come included with apples ipods but wanted something that would sound better and be more durable these failed on both counts on a long flight last week i decided to break these ear buds out they kept falling out of my ears regardless of how far i jammed them in i tried using the two smaller sized nubs which made exactly no difference same with wrapping the cord behind or in front of my head they just kept falling off which would jerk me awake as i was drifting off to sleep since they slipped off after five or so minutes when i was sleeping i can not imagine how awful they would be if used during physical activity i found the sound quality to be fairly abysmal as well there was an omnipresent tinny sound that i constantly heard over the three days that i used them they did a terrible job of blocking out airplane noise despite advertisements to the contrary these were a waste of the 30 msrp i will never use them again meanwhile my search continues for a replacement to apples ear buds,194,154
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i went from sony mdr-ex71sls to mdr-v600s and i had those till they were stolen with these being the replacements i have to say they are of no match with v600s rightfully so these are almost 1/3rd the price and earbuds only they are still good enough to notice that you need would need to change your bitrate from 128 kbps to something higher as the other reviewers have mentioned although they do sound slightly better and more normalize than the ex71s by reducing the bass a bit this may or may not be good for you as some of you may like more bass of which then the ex71s would be better the earclips are of rubberly / plastic material that easily bends and the buds themselves twist making sure that there is a perfect fit much better than the other clipon headphones which are of a hard plastic i like them but I have also tried eshure e2cs which sound much more like my v600s in sound as costs,168,155
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I have purchased many many headphones over the years from bose to etymotics to shure I have paid anywhere from 15 to 350 for headphones as a drummer I have played with these while practicing to music and they do a great job blocking out extraneous noise while delivering good quality bass and sound i also wear these while riding the train back and forth to work everyday and they are a pleasure to wear i have not tried to run in them so i do not know how well they are for running for the money these are the best value for such high quality out there right now i have a pair of shure headphones that i paid 180 for that have better sound but they tend to keep falling out no matter how much i adjust them i tend to wear the sonys most of the time because of this,145,156
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,maybe it is just me but i was very excited to get these and very disapointed when i had to return them as far as the headphone piece itself goes it seemed fine i tried the different sizes of little nubs and they seemed to be securely in my ears and had good sound however this unit also comes with the plastic piece that fits over year ear i got this model because i run and wanted the extra piece to help keep it secure well maybe it is just me but when the plastic piece was properly behind my ear the buds popped out and when the buds were popped all the way in the plastic pieces were not resting behind my ears correctly had the same frustration as the other reviewer as it ruined my run on the plus side i was very impressed with amazons return process click a few pages online it prints out a pre-paid address label for you and you just mail it they deduct the shipping cost from the return works for me,177,157
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i had the earlier model ex71sp but the cable got snagged a lot and finally lost sound on one side hopefully the hangers will reduce the effect of snagging the sound on this model has definitely improved the ex71 s bass can be quite overwhelming the ex81s bass is gentler I am hearing details in the soundtracks that i never heard before and I am driving it at lower volume than the ex71 i encode my music at 192kbps with the oog format on my rio karma,85,158
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,it is difficult to write an objective review on an hdtv antenna because reception will depend on your location however i live in a house on the outskirts of town and i am able to receive all of the local network affiliates abc cbs nbc fox cw pbs with this antenna it even picks up a weak signal from a fox affiliate over 50 miles away i also tried the terk hdtva indoor amplified high-definition antenna for off-air hdtv reception but found that it did not perform as well as the rca it also took up more room was not as stable it was prone to tipping over and was more expensive than the rca,113,0
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i got two terks the 525 and the rca 111 and tested all 4 for number of signals and for signal strength the cheapest 111 came out head and shoulders above the rest not only did it receive 3 more channels than any other but the signals were stronger plus i save on electricity because i do not have to plug in the 111 i returned the 525 with a big grin on my face 5 antenna and great signals from 25 - 30 miles,82,1
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i recently installed one of these on our new hdtv the reception is excellent and the amplifier is great for boosting the signal from otherwise unwatchable stations,27,2
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,as the specification says 45 gb gain is really works for me supplied cable is bit short but if you can manage it go for it led indicator is bit bright very little noise hd is great and works on my tv,41,3
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,the ant525 is the perfect ota antenna for me i had tried 3 others amplified antennas including the highly rated terk hdtva prior to buying this one and the ant525 worked the best i placed each antenna in the same location and the ant525 increased my signal strength by 10 - 15 points over the other antennas the ant525 is very solid and stable I am using antenna for uhf only so i removed the vhf dipoles which really increased the aesthetics of the antenna i highly recommend the ant525 i wish i would have started with this one and i would have saved a lot of time returning inferior antennas,106,4
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,this is a solid product great reception with it good for me with the channels that have football i would have to agree about the short cord although i have a table close that i put the antenna on and it works fine for me it would have gotten 5 stars with the cord length up more i mean come on it is regular tv what more can you ask for,70,5
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i bought this antenna for a spare tv i wanted to be able to get some of the channels i know are available to antenna tv only and not through our comcast connection guess what i got three channels one worship channel and two ion channels i was astonished i although that might be all i can get in my area but i borrowed another antenna and viola there were all the local channels plus the cable channels i had been looking for all i can say about this antenna is that you must have to be right on top of a big tv station antenna to get that station i live outside boston and there are three network affiliates within 10 miles of my home plus a fox affiliate within 5 miles yet this marvel could not pick any of them up do i recommend this antenna no emphatically no it might seem like a good buy but it is a bust,164,6
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,the antenna works okay on about five channels in my area it frequently loses the signal the problem could be location not sure,23,7
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,researched the internet and picked this one regretfully for me it does not work very good difficulty getting a signal and then if i can the picture will not come in clearly or without lots of lines and more very disappointed and a waste of money for me,45,8
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,do not lose your money rca indoor amplified tv antenna transmits only analog signals 10 to be precise in my brooklyn new york location absolutely no digital reception for my new hdtv i have 2 new hdtvs 2 jensen antennas more than 10 years old work beautifully for one of my new hdtvs as well as for my non-hdtv vendors should withdraw this product from amazon market place to prevent unsuspecting customers from losing money sellers impose all kinds of conditions to forestall taking back the product once the box is opened even although the product does not work transmit digital signals thus no longer viable as a useful product amazoncom should exercise it is power to compel the vendors to refund their customers fully for moving useless product to uninitiated and frustrated customers eager to view hdtv programs sooner rather than later,138,9
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,the rca amplified indoor antenna was a complete disappointment i tried it in upstate new york about a hour outside albany and it failed to pick up any digital tv channels and i returned it even my original rabbit ears antenna picks up two digital channels,46,10
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i bought thisto use with a digital converter box it worked well for the first day or two since i do not use this tv quite a bit i was not happy to find that the power supply had shorted out or at the very least was not working and the reception was horrible i went online to amazon to return it and found that the window for returning it had closed slam i would think that since it is defective that the window for return would be 30 - 90 days as it is for most electronic devices that are defective needless to say my days with amazon are over guess they do not need my business and i know i do not need their attitude,124,11
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,did not see any difference compare with my rabbit ears that come with my tv tried many different locations directions angles still receive same amount of channels,27,12
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,this antenna did not help my area does not pick up a signal that well but it did not work better than an older antenna i have been using for a long time only thing going for this product is the look of it,44,13
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i am really impressed with how great the reception is the picture quality is as good as it was with cable in the past i was never able to get a good picture with an antenna but with this antenna i get a beautiful picture and also pick up stations i never could get before,55,14
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,50 miles west of st louis and nearest towers i get all local channels and could not be happier,18,15
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,I am very satisfied with my choice of tv antennas I have been doing business with amazon for many years and i am never disappointed both the merchandise and delivery are superb i recommend amazon anytime,34,16
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,we are very satisfied with thisinitially it took few and more minutes to set it to work properly but then when we finally did the quality of channels has improved we do not use cable / dish so this helped in amplifying the news channel the most,45,17
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i switched from regular rabbit ears to this antenna today and now i get all of my regular tv channels perfectly i also get nine more channels that i did not get before it is amazing,34,18
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,i did not know if an antenna would work out here in the suburbs but it did can not get perfect reception but better than paying dish prices for 2 other t against,32,19
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,i received this product in a timely fashion and i am pleased with the performance of the antenna so far currently i am able to pull in tv stations within 100 miles of my apartment which means i am able to pull in local analog and hd channels from three cities the powered amplifier certainly helps,56,20
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,if you read my other review you will see that this one works good but is better when you use the booster and then i attached it to the rca flat large antenna good reception crystal clear without the second antenna the reception was fair especially in the compromised area of the house,53,21
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i lived about 20 miles from the tv towers i found that the signal is weak there is always some snow on the analog channels my digital box shows that the signal strength is about 55 when i found this antenna it had 5-star rating but i am wrong about this as soon as i turn it on the snow is all over the screen for the analog channels for the digital channels the converter box show the signal is jumping between 0 to 5 i do not think it will cut off the signal the only thing i can think of is that it amplifies the noice too without turning on the amplify feature it works the same way as other 10 rabbit ear antennas,125,22
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,excellent antenna i wish i knew about amplified antennas a long time ago i used to get some channels pretty good and now they are totally clear and i used to get some channels not so good with a lot of fuzz and snow but now they are pretty good highly recommend investing in one of these the only reason i did not give 5 stars is becasusei saw a generic brand one for less cost but rca is good so I am glad i bought it,83,23
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,i bought the nanofor my ipod nano you must buy thisbecause it is not original with the package and you do not want to end up having your nano on the bed or the desk or in the dogs mouth theis cool for charging and sync purposes know that thehas input for charging and output for headphones and fyi the headphone output has a fixed volume level so you can not control the nano when it is docked to increas / decrease the volume one last thing is that when you sync the nano you are not able to use the nano as it will be in charge mode do not say where has the power charger because it charges from the usb cable chao,127,0
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,thisstation is great i got one cord going from theto my computer and i sure can use less wires around my computer i love the fact that my ipod is charged and synchronized all at the same time with out having extra cables the station is small and sleek and takes almost no desk space be aware that if you order theit does not come with an adapter for the 1 gb nano and it does not come with any cables either thisis worth the money not to have your nano moving around you desk or even running the risk of knocking it off,111,1
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,this little unit allows you to play your nano through any radio or dvd player with either rca jacks you will need an adaptor stereo pin plug to rca jacks or a stereo pin plug bear further in mind that unlike many so called docks it does not charge your nano so you will only have the time your batteries last to play before recharging,65,2
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,you bought the ipod nano basically for it is looks buy this for the same reason it is so cute and fits your nano exactly as you wish i bought anfrom another company and although it was cheaper it looked dirty on my computer table this one has the apple looks,51,3
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,this merchandise is very helpful in a sense that you can charge the ipod nano on the wall without operating your computer in that way your worklow in using the computer is not being interrupted and still having the ipod being charge,42,4
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i do not find this to be that useful the only benefit is that it holds the ipod upright it has a line out feature but that is not why i purchased it and i will not use that i assumed incorrectly that it came with it is own power cord so that it would by itself charge the ipod you must purchase a separate plug or use the usb jack that it came with i wanted an addition means of charging the nano had i known that it was just a base i would not have purchased thiscertainly not for 30 for me the utility of this is not worth more than a few bucks and I am not exactly the miser type,119,5
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,2.0,negative,yeah the nanois useful however be aware that it comes with no cords whatsoever this means that you have to purchase yet another accessory for it to be of any practical use boo apple there is absolutely no excuse for following in the footsteps of microsoft,48,6
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,theallows you easy access to the nanos line-out interface and it makes it a lot more convenient to sync your ipod with a computer instead of rummaging around for cables you just set your it down in theand you are done on the other hand like most ipod accessories it is outrageously priced it is nothing more than a molded block of plastic with a couple of wires running through it can not cost apple more than 5 each to make while it is useful enough that it will probably be worth 30 over the long term it still feels like a ripoff,102,7
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,i got to say this tiny littleis amazing it makes it so easy to hook your new nano to just about anything that will receive a stereo mini jack i tried it at the apple store at the local mall before i bought it at amazon they had it connected to a variety of computers speakers and other media devices it is fantastic how this tiny interface increased the flexibility and usefulness of the newest addition to the ipod family it is so cool get one at this price buy two,90,8
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,i tried hooking up my ipod nano to the home theater system and had to crank up the volume way up both on the ipod and the ht system to get desired levels of sound with thisthe sound is backmatched with the ipod this is a recommended accessory for all who want to listen to their ipod songs on a bigger sound system my alternatives were buy a bose soundock 299 for direct usage or a bose ipod129 to use the way i am using it now via the apple ipoda third alternative which i have used in the past is to use altec lansing inmotion desktop speakers which are pretty good but can not compete with bigger sounding ht can not go wrong with a 15 price tag on this and a 15 mir when it appears,148,9
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,works perfectly with nano excellent for holding nano when downloading from itunes highly recommended,14,10
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i got this as a christmas gift today i was excited at first but I am afraid that I shall have to concur with the other bad reviews here that hurts because generally I am an apple fan but my new aluminum nano just barely does not fit and although surgery may work I am not going to fix something that ought to work correctly in the first place yes it says 1st generation but the buyer has to be pretty alert to realize that the new ones are very very slightly the wrong size to use this and the lack of a power supply cord is galling apple gets a lot right but they dropped the ball completely on this one,117,11
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,it is crazy that it does not fit the new nanos is not it i put in my metallic green 4 g and the width of the opening is about 2 millimeters to short i thought let us see if this thing can stand a little plastic surgery i bought my husband one of those dremel drilling tools for christmas last year and it works like a charm to drill out the excess plastic at first there was a small ridge that was making my ipod connect and then disconnect from itunes that puppy has got to be completely flush so he took it the dremel tool to it again and it works just like it should of course I am betting the one-year warranty on theis now void hehe,127,12
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,the new aluminium nanos just does not fit in theunfortunately this is not mentioned anywhere on this page as far as i can see buyer beware mines on the way back to the warehouse as we speak,37,13
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i agree with the comment below i was under the assumption as the previous reviewer i would pay about 5 with no shipping but no more it basically is more cosmetic than productive,33,14
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,theworks as promised the only hitch to me is i have to remove my nano from it is case to place it one thei purchased the apple brand rubber slip-on case to protect my nano and it is a very very thin case however i must still remove the nano in order to use theyou would think apple would provide a small amount of room to accomodate thier own accesories,75,15
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,i bought this for my grandson to watch dvds and tapes and it still works great he has only 4 so i do not imagine he is very gentle with it the people that are not satisfied expected more out of a low priced unit i bought the cheapest unit i could find and for the money it does exactly what i expected it to do it has great sound great picture and is easy to use and set up,78,0
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i bought two of these units exactly one week apart i liked the first one so much i bought a second one for the family room 6 months later almost to the day the dvd drive on the first unit stopped working i had to take the thing apart to extract the trapped dvd one week later on the second unit thetray began seeing a tape even although none was loaded which meant i could nota real tape so 6 months after buying two combo units i now have one dvd player and one vcr,98,1
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,as advertised works fine shipping was inexpensive but took forever,10,2
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,thewas cleaned and pulled apart and had hair and discs stuck inside the product not as was described,20,3
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was replacing the same unit i had for 15 years already the new one was used and worked just fine arrived as promised by vendor matt larue,28,4
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,press a button or use the remote flip back and forth betweenplayer and dvd easy hookquick and fast loading looks nice front aux port if your lazy just a great buy,36,5
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,this is a good combo player and have used it to record and watch movies both it works very well and i would highly recommend it if you like movies and also has the vcr recorder / player so for any of you with the older movies you will be able to watch also i love it and sure you will too,59,6
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i recieved a product from chicagadgets that was defective i ordered a refurbished toshiba dvd / vcr and when i tried to set it up in my tv system it was nonfunctional i happen to have had the exact same toshiba dvd / vcr and i was trying to replace that older dvd / vcr with the refurbished one they sent from chicagogadgets i reinserted my older dvd / vcr back into my tv system and it worked fine chicagogadgets would not replace the defective product they sent me you have only 15 days to return their products and they charge a reshelfing fee of 15 chicagogadgets should test their products before they send them out to make sure they function properly,114,7
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was looking for a second vcr / dvd for an extra tv we have and chose this unit as it seemed to have good divx support which i was interested in playing with well the divx support has turned out to be rock-solid playing everything I have thrown at it in countless formats burned on dvd-r cd-rw and cd-r it is never failed to decode a file I have moved the unit to our video room and we have been enjoying it ever since it is true the quality of playback of the vcr is not great but it is good enough for my childs videos in addition the remote is not too fancy but the unit has excellent controls accessible from the remote for controlling things like picture size jpeg playback and more,125,8
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,we have been very pleased with our purchase i found reading the previous reviews to be accurate and very helpful very easy to hook-up will work on old television sets dvd andwork wellis more noisy when rewinding we bought this for our children to watch movies and just use the most basic features so it has suited our needs well if looking for all bells and whistles would probably choose higher end model but if looking to stay simple and basic i would choose this model,90,9
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,after less than a year of limited use the picture changes fromto black and white the problem occurs intermittently and it is completely random i did not purchase an extended warranty plan because for something less than 100 it seemed silly but after limited use for something like this to happen just screams out junk to me,59,10
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i really have not had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product for me it was somewhat difficult to set up however i have always had problems setting up vcrs throughout my vcr buying history after consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear the unit appears to work very nicely once you understand the total setup it is quite easy and simple to operate i gave this a 4 star rating because i believe this vcr / dvd combo will do just fine the only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching for the price however i can live with that,116,11
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,i bought this product to replace my old sony slv-d300p dvd / vcr combo thinking that it would be more compatible with my toshiba tv than the sony this was not the case as the remote that comes with this dvd / vcr combo does not control the tv at all there is no way to program the remote to control anything other than the dvd / vcr player if you buy this product be ready to use your tv remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote in addition the user interface of the player is horrible much worse than my old sony i returned this the day after i bought it and exchanged it for the sony slv-d370p which includes a remote to control the tv and has a great user interface i gave this 2 stars because for the few minutes i used it the audio / video quality was fine and the product has divx playback compatibility which was one of the reasons i bought it in the first place,171,12
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,great product and well worth the price if you hook up the component video outlet your dvds look almost like hd,21,13
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,the vcr was broke after 1 week of owning it the company did replace it and i did not have to pat for shipping it back,25,14
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i so satisfied on this product i think it is low price and high quality,15,0
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,this is a great inexpensive option as far as webcams go i have purchased others with more features and a higher price tag but find myself seldom using the extras this product does the basics and i think that is all that most people really need zero problems,47,1
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,picture is very grainy and running the camera often causes a two-second delay in chat audio on skype but it does a pretty decent job for the price the vendor inexplicably sent me the skype version which has a blue circle instead of a black one and the word skype on the package but no other obvious differences from the plain quickcam chat,63,2
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,my brother and i have video chatted over the past few months but his frame rates were very low and the video pixelated he has a cable modem so speed is not an issue so it was quite a shock when we video chatted yesterday evening his video was not only clear but streaming nicely with full motion and the built-in mic picked up his voice clearly the performance was annoyingly close to my expensive camcorder doing double-duty as a webcam he is not using bleedingequipment either a pentium iii e-machines with usb 10 ports if this camera can put some life back into that old goat then this webcam is pretty darn good,112,3
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i thought this would be an ok cam but it actually has a great quality and it comes with the earphone microphone it has been great,25,4
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i ordered this webcam the 12th it was a weekend it did not ship till the 16th which i figured was because i ordered on a weekend and vday today is the feb 17th and i got it within one day of shipping the quality on it is actually pretty good only thing that is wrong with me it has like a a second or half of a secondit seems but it is not a big deal i payed 499 and free shipping for my webcam so i did not expect it to b this good,101,5
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,if you want a really clear picture do not buy this but if you want a basic web cam and just are using it once in awhile go with it otherwise buy something more updated,31,6
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this camera was a very contraversial one i bought 2 cameras one for me and the other for my boyfriend and my camera and mic worked perfectly fine but my boyfriends did not his camera had a terriable quality i could barely see his face it was so blurry and his mic did not work at all i suggest you save your money and buy a better webcam,65,7
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,if you own a mac do not get this camera there are a lot of uvc compliant webcams these webcams will work on the usb network without a driver this is not one of them,35,8
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter so she could talk to my son while he was in iraq it certainly came quickly and was as promised she did not tell me she had any problems installing it so i know it was easy to do,45,9
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i just bought this web camera from this seller i can not get it to work well basically it was a rip off i had a very difficult time installing the program after that it started working but not the way it should the speakers and the camera part of it work but it was unclear and made myself look unusual but i just can not get the built in microphone to work do not buy this it is a waste of my money and now i can not even use it please i hope i convinced you not to buy it,99,10
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,the product shipped was not in a box just in a small plastic bag cd missing to download the webcam very poorly packaged thrown in a small bubble envelope may have been the reason why the cam did not function returned hopefully we got our refund,46,11
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,this is a great camera for the price now do not buy this camera if you are looking for high-definition video from it i have this camera just to be able to talk to family and friends out of state and out of the country it is reliable and provides the video i need to be able to see and talk with the people in my life you can not beat an under 20 camera with this quality do not forget about the reputation that logitech has I have been using their products for years and love every single one this camera comes with software that has some great features like low-light adjustment brightness contrast andif you need a great camera and a great price logitech quick cam chat,127,12
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,it says right on the f and box that it works with windows 2000 when i tried to install it it said please update system to xp i was so pissed this is a fraud product,35,13
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,this camera is a waste of money i got it because it says directly on the box that it works with windows live messanger do not know aim can not find webcam setup and yahoo messanger wrong i got this webcam to chat with my brother on yahoo meassanger and it will not even connect with yahoo i tryed the help that yahoo suggested and nothing do not bother wasting your time on this even if you just want to make videos with it because unless you get perfect lighting the video is grainy as he shall and often eather way too dark or way blown out crap crap crap I am dead serious this is a waste of money,112,14
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,the cameria it is self was good the mic that cam with it it is not good have hard time working,19,15
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,i would do a video review except the microphone that comes with the damned thing does not work compound tht with the fact it has super low resolution and is ghosts horribly and this camera just is not worth your time the only thing preventing me from rating this one star is the ridiculously quick and easy installation,56,16
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,the title says it all if you want a cheap camera for video chat then this is a camera and it is cheap but the quality is not very good at all also does not pick up well at night in a lit room i often resorted to getting a desk lamp next to me i got this cam to work on mac os x,65,17
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,the camera works so well gives clear and non fuzzy image and has perfect light controls,16,18
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,easy to setup easy to use i got what i expected get skype,13,19
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,as with most things this webcam proved to be worth what i payed for it which was not very much it is decent for using with a messenger just to talk to someone with but i would never rely on it as a camera for photos it is an ok webcam nothing special but it works,55,20
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i bought this webcam about 7months ago but rarely used it initially it was working fine but i do not know what happened i dint even drop it or mishandle it the picture quality is horrible i do not even bother using it anymore i paid 27 for this piece of junk total waste of money,47,21
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,the video quality is nowhere near what i expected and i am disapointed enough to return it it is got a good swivel and that is about it the content that comes with it is so-so and the headset is pretty minimal,40,22
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,this camera produces a poor image that is grainy and hasproblems even in decent light the picture is much worse than images from the logitech quickcam for notebooks in the same light i am returning my quickcam chat but keeping the quickcam for notebooks,46,23
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,the quality is as advertised and there are drivers available to get this to work with a mac although you have to pay ten dollars for them,27,24
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this was one of the worst cams i have ever purchased since learned my lesson going to save up for one of those digital handheld camcorders instead with better resolution and megapixels this was aweful the picture was grainy horrible experience would not buy another i use them mostly to do my expotv product reviews this was not working for what i wanted it for so i am saving up to someday get a aiptek digital handheld camcorder or one of those flip ones instead this is okay maybe for yahoo messenger if that i definitly like my creative live one better my other logitech which was the quick cam I am messenger or something the gray one my boyfriend gave me worked alot better had better resolution this one would not recommend it get what you pay for kind of a thing,140,25
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,easy to use and worked perfectly i was pleased at how rapidly it was sent highly recommend it especially at the very reasonable price,24,26
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,logitech quickcam chat this product performs as stated easy set-up immediate results and you are on-line you can chat on various sites such as aim my space and more i love it,34,27
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this one is just not up to par i have a logitech camera with built-in mic that is in the 50 range and got this for my office the room-light picture is far less competent and the camera ghosted pretty badly I have traded it in for one with a better picture and am much happier i recommend as temptimg as it is to save money if you want to use a camera inside for sype-ing or something similar that you got for a camera a bit more competent than this even although it means spending a few more dollars,99,28
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i already have 2 webcam of logitech i bot this one for my friend have used this product for past couple of months it is really great good deal reasonable price branded company you can not expect much for this price if u r not brand oriented then u cud look out for something else but brand n reasonable price compared to others this is the deal u shud be looking for,61,29
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,that is right december 31st 2007 right after work 7ish i was rambling through this mess in my computer desk thing and i found the disc that i had missed since my mom threw it away I am so happy but one thing leaves me puzzled and it has nothing to do with the device itself per se it has a 3/5 rating why this magnificent thing does it all audio and video online yahoo aim and msn still pictures are great with proper lighting my room has little lighting so i needed a second source quick capture shading hues video mute I have been using it for one day not even and i know it is early but this thing has endless possibilities it was about as expensive at wal-mart then as it is here looks b if it was black or gold it would be an a or a respectively features a re-check all it offers price a 475 stars overall a i will adjust the score as i use video and shading i also boosted the rating from 3 stars to 3 1/2,185,30
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i bought this webcam tried it once and packed it neatly back in the box for return it has good light that is about it for me the quality is very fuzzy and the speed is far from quick it is more like still images moving slowly i was not happy with this product and surprised because it is made by logitech i strongly suggest trying another logitech webcam not this one,67,31
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,those who say this camera is great obviously have no standards whatsoever all you get from from this camera is choppy blurry grainy dark and poorly colored video if i did not know it was me on the screen i would not be able to recognize me it is without a doubt the worst camera I have ever bought in fact so bad that even my kids will not use it for fear of being laughed at by their friends,76,32
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,guess those who say the webcam is good are first timers this webcam is just too blurry and get worse under low lighting conditions thesays it is 640 x 480 pixels that is wrong the best is 320 x 240 even that is not clear the grainy image is enough to spoil your day one of the worst logitech products do not even know why it is sold in the it stores this should be contraband from the it world real big flop real big flop it is lesss than 1/5,87,33
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i looked for the cheapest thing on the market and it works just as great as any of the 100 cameras good product,23,34
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i just bought it and checked it out it is horrible apparently there is no such thing as a free lunch it is cheap for a reason the picture is grainier than the videos of bigfoot,35,35
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,small and cute it is cable length is long enough to be put at some distance away this works with mac,20,36
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,as a linux user I have all too often run into poor hardware support from vendors who only know of or support ms windows so it was with some trepidation that i recently looked for a reasonably priced webcam when i saw the logitech quickcam chat i figured it was hard to go too far wrong for the price but as it turns out i was pleasantly surprised to find that it works fairly nicely and it was surprisingly little fuss to set up i merely followed the instructions in the suse webcam wiki at [ ] and i was up and running in a few minutes chatting with kopete on a yahoo connection to a friend in another state i rate it at 4 stars only because the quality of the images is not as good as it could be but for a cheap webcam it is perfectly acceptable,148,37
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,it is pretty good quality easy to set up and use but you get what you pay for the video quality is pretty good and it adjusts to my indoor lighting pretty well sometimes i have to shine some light on myself but usually it is no different than when I am doing homework i do not really use the microphone because i already have one that is probably better hoever i do have one issue the focus on the camera is manual so you have to adjust it yourself it is fine when you are just going to talk at the desk and usually just sit there but if you want to move around and show things it will be a major pain but i guess it is good for what you pay for sometimes the light indicating that it is on will stay on all the time but that is usually on start up once you open a program that would use the video like skype it will turn off after you are done all in all good value and does just fine for video chatting easy to clip onto the laptop even if it is not the most secure but it is not like i move the laptop around everywhere while I am talking,204,38
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i bought it used a couple days ago and just received it let me tell you it is better than most first of all it is logitech that says alot also it is clip is very unique can be put on laptops pcs even end of tables or anything where it holds at an angle,52,39
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this outdated camera yes you are visible with this camera but the quality is so poor grainy and blurry it made the whole experience quite disappointing spend a little more for a better product,39,40
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,super noisy unaccpetable viedo quality worse than built in camera of my laptop,13,41
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,nice cam for the price i got a better picture quality than i expected,14,42
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,very easy to install as you can select to either install logitech software or just the drivers i went by the second options as my wife and i keep linked by skype whenever she has on a business trip even the video quality is not a wow i think it accomplish the purpose of see your other call party for what you pay,62,43
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,when i ordered this webcam i never know it would be so easy to install and use plus the clear images pictures and videos are great now I am enjoying my pc more than before the mic and headphone are so great and helpful too awsome,44,44
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,there has a reason this is 30 cheaper than the neuros mpeg4 recorder 2 plus it does not work as well i originally tried to save a few bucks and grabbed a v-mate but it went back after every recording had a squiggly white line on the top of the image and the quality just was not up to snuff upgraded to the neuros and have been very happy,67,0
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated especially with fast action sports like football and basketball the sandisk does have a better interface and is easier to understand and set up quickly but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor fyi I am using a psp as my viewer,74,1
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,nice compact box and recording quality better than i expected one major flaw although no preview when recording 640x480 resolution just a black screen with rec in the top corner dropping back to 320x240 resolution does not help this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display a real shame i love the concept but the lack of preview is a real problem technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it I shall keep my fingers crossed but do not have high expectations,90,2
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,this is nearly the best thing since pre-sliced bagels i bought this after i purchased another unit from yahoo before i came upon this little jewel what this has over the other model is that there is on screen programming and video recording options i purchased this to supplement my psp and new sony-ericsson w850i phone it works like a charm not only was it a snap to integrate with my set top box but the recoring options ie bitrate protocol and more give you the opportunity to record for any phone that you may own or your psp or whatever will play a list of a / v formats what i love about the unit is that you can record off of your tv or dvd player in the exact format that fits your playback device my sony phone works well with 3gpp so that is what i just recorded 8 below in and wow there has no stuttering or pixelation it is great what can i say i found another gem in my quest for entertainment freedom any questions please email me,176,3
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i had been going nuts trying to find a way to utilize the video features on my psp and sandisk sansa without becoming an it engineer or a getting involved in bittorrent and risking a raid or a subpoena for illicit file-sharing this was the perfect solution as it is incredibly easy to use and the results are immediate if you have a similar product it is well worth it as you do not have to mess with trying to figure out which content providers can provide video content that you actually want without paying fees or worrying if the licensing software will allow you transfers i have no interest in file-sharing and more i just wanted content i liked the ability to copy my dvds for my own use on my portable electronics is a big big big plus,137,4
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,pretty good video quality although i must say the setup was a little tricky not for the novice also you have to update the unit with the latest drivers from the sandisk website overall a good buy,38,5
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,is nobody else having the same problem with this device as me this worthless piece of garbage does not respond to the remote half the time it refuses to stop recording and it damages the sd cards,36,6
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,very different from the traditional recorder but you can set the output signal to match certain devices like psp i record tv for my psp all the time you can also set it for phone and the like the sandisk recorder can also use several different memory cards very cool device and works on it is own i highly recommend for psp owners especially,63,7
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,i ordered this to do exactly what it said it would do and it does it you can record from any a / v source even those oldtapes with copy protection straight to an sd card the only drawback is lack of choice for recording file type it would be nice to have mpg2 or avi as choices especially if you want to burn your results to dvd the sheer ease of capture in a single portable device that doubles as a card reader is like having an old school field recorder in your pocket no computer no drivers no expensive video cards no hassle just click to record,109,8
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,sandisk definitely had the rightwith this straight to media memory recorder unfortunately this is either an early model or they missed the boat the remote is hit or miss and selects twice per click most of the time starting the recording works well but you can not stop it so unless you have a small memory card and want to take everything until full which is when it will stop recording automatically then this is not the unit for you i hope sandisk has an upgraded model because this would be great if it could be controlled like a video recorder should be the price was right and it was worth a try but this model is not worth even the cheap price,124,9
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,unit is a great replacement for a vcr plus has better advantages i use with 16 gb sdhc card and yes it works originally purchased to use as an auto dvr for my car but it will not continuous record without having to delete recordings so i set 8 daily scheduled recording to repeat then just delete smaller files every so often nice unit and does what it says it will good quality and so small too nice unit and very inexpensive,80,10
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i use this to record my favorite tv shows onto my psp for less than 30 you can not beat the portability and convenience,23,11
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,i purchased this unit to record our church services from the output of a multi-camera switcher it instantly gives us a file that is ready to post on the internet each week of course there are other ways to do this but being able to hit stop and instantly have a file ready is a tremendous time-saver the quality is everything we need for a web video posting i have a second unit at home for time delaying tv shows from a set-top box the home unit has some issues responding to the remote control but continues to work once i have the recordings i can play them back from this box or from other tvs in my house connected to a media player another use i have found for this box is making recordings for my itouch i would really like to have a unit such as this that encodes a component hd signal with h264 compression,157,12
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,we bought this figuring it would be a great option to a subscription dvr if it worked we did not expect much especially after reading the reviews we were pleasantly surprised it works much better than expected and the picture quality is great recording at highest quality works great on a 19inch tv and while not crystal clear on a large 27 tv it is good enough to watch a recorded show i would not call it hd but it is just as good as my still kodak camera takes video or even my flip video camera the remote is not great in fact it was almost impossible to use at first i than did some research and found a forum suggesting the obvious replace the battery made a huge difference i just ordered a 4 gb sd card and this is going to get a lot of use in my house,150,13
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,best video recording device you could ask for the best quality and ease of use of any tv recorder for the psp,22,14
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,the device arrived promptly and undamaged that is all the good news after reading the product instructions i realized this device would not do what i wanted i have several sony semi-pro mini dv cameras with worn out tape drives i am looking for a way to use them with an inexpensive pvr that records to avc / h264 format which this one does not i connected the device to my video system for the test run it came on but would not respond to any command from the remote it has no input method other than the remote i tested the battery and it was dead i bought a new battery and it sometimes works sometimes does not the remote is really cheaply made without true buttons and sometimes takes multiple tries to get a response in a video shoot struggling to get your recorder on is a nightmare the product pamphlet suggests going to a sandisk address online for firmware updates they do not exist the product is out of production and unsupported amazon authorized return for refund but save the headache and do not buy this one,186,15
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,for the price this is an amazing little device and it does just what it says it will do it is targeted at creating video for mobile devices so if you are expecting to watch the results on hdtv you may be disappointed in the image quality i bought it so that my daughter could add video content to her ipod and it is been great for that I have also created videos for my phone the video even looks pretty good on a pc in it is high quality mode you can record almost 4 hours of video to a 2 gb memory card you can not expect dvd quality the clunky part is the remote all record functions are through the remote so you have to use it unfortunately it is one of the worst remotes I have ever used you have to hold it in exactly the right position to get it to respond still you get what you pay for when you consider what this device allows you to do it is a great value and very cool,176,16
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i do not understand some of the bad reviews for the sandisk v-mate are they expecting hd quality or something i took a chance and recently bought thisand absolutely love it the firmware on it was the old version so before i even tried to use it i downloaded and installed the latest firmware update version vmate 0207wwb8 and it works fantastic [ ] then all is hooked up to my tv i use the av-switch on my tv set up so that i can easily switch from my vcr / dvd player or switch to the sandisk v-mate the sandisk v-mate records really decent video onto my sd and sdhc card after recording i can then play it via the sandisk v-mate and watch it on my tv or i can take out the sd card and play it on my pc or other devices that except sd / sdhc cards [ ] i really love this sandisk v-mate fun and so easy to use obviously it is easy to set up if i can do it and it offers various recording quality and video formats that you can choose from,185,17
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,unfortunately after i hooked up the sandisk sdmv1-r v-mate when i tried to set up the v-mate the response between the remote and the v-mate was very poor i was not able to complete the setup however the company that sold the sandisk v-mate through amazon com adorama camera has excellent customer service and they allowed me to return the opened v-mate because it was not really operable i would not purchase the sandisk v-mate again however i would purchase from adorama camera again with confidence,86,18
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,thiswas a junk remote never work right and it kept eating cards not worth a dollar,18,19

Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i ordered the sandisk sdmv1-r v-mate video memory card recorder through the request of my son we placed the order on a friday and received the recorder on the following monday very surprised the recorder came withbyinstruction and my son had it working within a matter of minute it is way cool he is able to save tv shows on his sim card for his cell phone psp and more what amazed me was the low price for anthat does so much i very much recommend this product to anyone that is looking for this type ofsincerely k mathews jackson ga,106,21
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,what could be more simple a vcr equivalent that records to sd cards instead oftape unfortunately this product lives up to what can be expected from most everything made in china installation was easy but set-up was impossible because the remote control behaved erratically controlling the tv set-up screens none of the ir emitter codes worked reliably turning the my satellite receiver on and off after struggling with it for about an hour i put everything back in the blister-pak and shipped it back to the mail-order place i ordered it from a huge disappointment from the largest manufacturer sandisk of memory cards i conclude this product was designed developed and manufactured in china and marketed under sandisks label do not waste your time and money on this device,130,22
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,I have followed the sandisk web instruction but there was nothing like would you like to upgrade your firmware by the way my firmware is 0113en and i could not catch any video from tv what has going on please help,38,23
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,do not expect too much from this device the output is very grainy if recording fromthe picture will be blocky because it will not deinterlace the picture also i had a lot of issues with the remote it is very slow to respond and sometimes it took several key presses to work,53,24
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i received thefrom them on time but only a couple of weeks after getting it it stopped working i had only used it once,26,25
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,would like to return but supplier will not answer and therefore will not supply a return authorization or is delaying to get out of the return allowable time,28,26
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,this product was a huge disappointment i was so excited to finally get a device like this that recorded video directly to flash media i read the reviews and knew the video quality was not that great but i was still expecting better than grainy cellphone-type footage this is even although i had it set to the highest quality video setting i also wish i had read the technical specifications more closely i thought this device was supposed to be able to replace a vcr but it can not connect to an antennae of any type so you still need a separate video source that is a vcr which almost totally defeats the purpose of getting this device at all i knew there were going to be problems when i saw that the only video connections were mini-stereo plug ports on the back no s-video no-coaxial not even rca on top of that the tiny remote is incredibly frustrating to use i only spent 40 on this but even at that low price this device was complete and total garbage sandisk should be ashamed for letting this product come out to market,190,27
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,first off the battery was dead when i received it very confusing to work if you unplug it you have to reset the clock has to playback in quicktime only it sux,32,28
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,cool that is the best definition of this gadget makes it alot easier to capture video to ipod good product with quick shipping,22,29
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i had good expectations for this product but it let me down the fact that it has no buttons forces you to use the remote which has to be pointed directly at the box at about to inches in distance but i do not mind the defects above what really got me mad was that i had to press every single button about 20 times until it finally picked up the signal it was not a battery problem because i changed them and one day i wanted to record a show and it took me ten minutes of pushing the on button to make it work so i got sick and frustrated grabbed a screw driver and ripped the remote in two now i have no remote which means no v-mate what a good way to spend 60,137,30
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i think having purchased a second one speaks for itself while dressing at 5 am i can record the morning news on a sd micro memory card and watch the news one hour later on the train no conversions are necessary you can record from a camcorder a dvd player movies or cable tv and watch it immediately i watch my recordings on a sandisk sansa view mp3 player however i have also used it on my lg phone it also works fine on any tv using a resolution of 640 x 480 320 x 280 and lower resolutions for internet purposes,102,31
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,I have been using my scandisk v-mate for about two weeks and so far it has performed as i expected which is good I am satisfied with the performance sometimes it is slow to respond to the remote but for this price i did not expect perfection or studio quality video it does pretty much play back the same quality video that was it received to record tv playback is better than on a computer but i do not believe it was really meant for computer playback I am very satisfied with this product I am still trying to think of ways to use my v-mate,101,32
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,greatbut picture resembles watching oldtapes there is also no caption option hope they are working on a better version,23,33
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i thought i was going to be receiving a cheap easy to use recorder but the sandisk recorder never worked for me the remote is awful and you need to plug in the ir emitter yourself luckily it was only seventy bucks but i would not recommend it because of mine not even working goodbad product,59,34
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,purchasing through amazon was initiated by me my boss ordered this product in the past direct from the manufacturer when purchasing direct from the manufacturer he paid alot more for both the product and for shipping now he has learned amazon is the way to shop,46,35
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,after recording a tv show and inserted the card into my treo 700p there was no program on the treo that would play the show sandisk customer service did not respond when i inquired about what program would play the show i found some freeware core media player and loaded it on the treo this allowed me to see the video but the sound was choppy and could not listen to it i went back to customer support still no response it is going back unless there is a program to view / listen on my treo,93,36
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,purchased to look at short low quality video clips the device seems like it will do that but the image quality on a 20inch tv is horrible on my 24inch screen it is just fine do not even think of buying this if you want to look at the video on a bigger than 12inch screen system will pass through the video for your source so it is very easy to use takes some getting used to the remote there are no button on the device so do not lose the remote,91,37
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,product was easy to use handy device to record video for use on a mobile device i would highly recommend it,21,38
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,the quality of the recording was very bad little squares showed up all the time and in dramatic scene changes the whole screen was transitioning little squares like it could just not keep up with the speed i would defintely not buy it again,44,39
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,the great thing about this is that if you have ever strugged with ear-buds or something similar you will never have to do so again i have basically forgotten that these are in my helmet the setup is seamless the wires fit perfectly under the padding in most helmets and the female connect is then attatched with velcro to the underside lip on the side of your helmet so when not in use you really do not notice it when you need it reach up and connect your music male connector piece of cake the only downside is that it is not very loud at it is loudest setting with my mp3 player not sure if that is a fuction of the speakers or the player it is loud enough to enjoy although,125,0
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,really excited when i found this product and after installing in my helmet i wish i had never seen it volume is pure garbage i have tried multiple input methods phone input bluetooth amplifier input direct amplifier input even at non-interfering road noise the volume of these speakers is not hear-able in a helmet buy a real helmet speaker system even although these are priced right the money is wasted,70,1
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,the headset failed within a few weeks and the only way to make it work now is to get the jacks situated in the right place and even then the smallest bump knocks it out the speakers were also barely loud enough to be heard over wind noise at 45 mph,51,2
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,works for what i needed them for just temporary fix till i can afford a bluetooth setup for my helmet,20,3

Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,it fit my helmet like i wanted but the volume sucks i turned the volume wide open with out being in my helmet and could barely hear it i put them in my helmet starter my bike and could not hear at all with volume as loud as it would go i guess this is what i get for going cheep,61,7
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i can not say anything about the performance of this product because i never installed it in my helmet i did not care for the look of the speakers so i did not bother to install them,34,8
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,these work well and i can hear my music when turned all the way up but i ride a highway scooter it is not very loud i wish i would have gotten the higher priced ones that said they were twice as loud,42,9
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a viable solution for having a comfortable in-helmet speaker that i can use with my radar detector on my motorcycle i experimented with various ear butts that only caused discomfort especially while planting / removing the helmet I am very happy with this system since it has a volume control and disconnect and does not put undue pressure on my ears,63,10
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i thought that i would be able to ride on the highway while listening to some tunes from the ipod that is not happening with these you are better offer using regular ipod headphones or investing in a bluetooth helmet like i did waste of money volume is too low can not hear even when the bike is off,57,11
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,there are way better ones out there that you mold yourself for forty five bucks search for fuze custom headphones use them on my bike and they are awesome with very little background noise,34,12
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,sounds great to me but stay under 70 mph and it is your player not the speakers,16,13
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,they fit nicely in my helmet they are not very loud but you can get a booster / splitter and you and tour passenger can enjoy the music,25,14
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i tried these with my mp3 player all the way up with a boostaroo headphone amplifier and the volume on the speakers all the way up inside a closed full face hjc helmet still could not hear much of anything i was sitting still on my 500cc aprilia scooter probably the quietest motorcycle out there I am far from deaf and my 10 sony over the ear sporty buds are pristine under the same conditions save your time and money and head to walmart I am mailing them back tomorrow the boostaroo does help with regular earphones / buds to get over the bike and wind noise,102,15
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i agree with many of the other reviewers definitly not loud enough i tried them with my ipod and my garmin neither was loud enough i had to go with in ear phones,34,16
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,what a waste of money you can not hear the music over the road noise get a speaker with a booster if you want to listen to your music on the road,31,17
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,have over 12000 motorcycle miles wearing these most recently on a trip through canada and alaska i use mine with my ipod and they work great especially at speeds below about 70 mph if you spend a good deal of time above that speed you may want to upgrade to the hs24 iasus speakersxsound 2 high end motorcycle helmet speakers these are priced ridiculously low they are very easy to install very comfortable and have their own volume control which is very handy especially if your mp3 is in your jacket pocket or motorcycle tank bag,99,18
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i tried these with my creative zen sleek photo mp3 player in a 3/4 jhc helmet and they do not get loud enuff to hear adequately standing in the driveway never mind on the road the rated impedance seems low enough maybe the drivers are inefficient / lack sensitivity i tried plugging them into the headphone output of my yamaha yst 21 computer speakers and with the volume knob cranked up they do get loud and sound pretty good most portable devices probably will not have sufficient output to drive them properly for their intended use,94,19
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i like the size and ease of placement in the helmet however i can hardly hear it when riding i do not even have that loud of a motorcycle ducati st4s it is more of a back ground music than anything,39,20
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,i bought these for my ski helmet i could not find anything else and thought i could make these work i was right they fit in my helmet a giro 540 almost perfectly and sound better than i expected i looked at the various ski helmet manufacturers and the stuff they have only works in certain models and is more expensive these work well and should work in just about any helmet well worth the price i would think they could sell a lot more of them if they broadened the subject beyond motorcycles,94,21
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,this nextar gps is great for less than 100 you get 35 inch screen text to speech mp3 player and photo viewer unit is a little slow acquiring gps signal when first powered up and battery life coulld be longer however it comes with a car power plug and an ac power plug and will charge via usb i see a lot of people complaiining about the volume and not being able to hear it i do not have that problem mine is extremely loud and i have to keep it turned off the maximum because it is blowing me away i drive an old toyota 4runner that is 4 wheel drive so i have plenty of road noise anyway i would highly recommend and put it up against anything garmin and magellan make in the 150 200 range,138,0
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,it is 3-in-1 product gps mp3 player and picture viewer i did not use other than gps it is a great product other than 1 it can be slow to update on road it can be annoying if your turns are within 200 feet or less by the time gpss done saying I have already missed the turn at the speed of 20miles / hour 2 it does not get gps signal that easily good value for the price overall,75,1
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,i loved everything about this unit it was super-easy to use quickly responsive provided street names had all the features one could want but we regretfully had to return it after one short trip we soon discovered that when traveling at a faster speed on the open road the volume even at maximum could not be heard over the normal road noise in a honda accord if you are alone in your vehicle no music and just in-town traveling it would be ideal,82,2
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,bought one had to take it back because at full volume i could not hear it got another and still had the same problem now i have a garmin and can hear it fine,33,3
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,i got this gps unit last week and for an entry price range unit i was really blown away by the performance and functionality of this unit this unit only takes about 5 to 10 seconds to acquire satellites and locate my position and i love the ability to select major road as a route option and the ability to navigate by higher level view or zoom in to local streets in the high level view i really like that every street is named so i really know what has around me and i can really see where I am going when i pull off route into a mcdonald the gps recalculate my route in seconds when i get back on the road i have not tried out the mp3 player or the photo viewer yet i am sure it work fine but i really do not need this unit for those function anyhow I have owned and use other navigation products from the tom tom one to mio c220 and even the garmin nuvi 360 i like this gps unit the best this product really exceed my expectation so i highly recommend this product,190,4
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,love this little thing i had one from this company b4 so I am used to how easy it is to use for example when my crew members would try and navigate to my location using many other brands of gps the 1st thing they would ask me is what has the zip code and I am like i do not know why do you need that and they say oh i need to put it in my gps and then the town or whatever please are u kidding me nobody has time for all of that and besides i work in a lot of different places so half the time i would not know the damn zip codes now with this wizard of a tool by default your city is already in there unless your changing it but all you do then is throw in the street name and then the street number it then gives you the list of all the towns in alphabetical order and you just pick it out and it goes no zip code needed this is every bit worth the cash and more,174,5
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,i understand this is an older model but if you are thinking of getting it to save money do not i have the 2008 x3 first day the dash mount broke also it would say waiting for gps signal for 20 minutes once i was in an unfamiliar place when it took very long to find the signal i drove around waiting for it to find one and ended up in a bad part of the city i stuck it out until i could save for a higher-rated brand gps because while planning a trip the night before this gps froze and would notpast the power screen reset button would not change this luckily my friend had a reliable gps i could borrow do not buy this product seriously save for a brand name product that is worth it do your research,143,6
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,this is not the first nextar that i have had this one like my other one is easy to use and has numerous options not seen on other manufacturers units higly recommend,32,7
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,product worked splendidly for the first 12 months almost to the day one year later it would not allow you to get to the address screen to enter your destination called customer service they said since the warranty had expired basically i was out of luck i said i understood that they were no longer required to repair my unit for free i was interested in what the cost would be to repair it no such option they said after the warranty expires nextar does not accept units for repairs if i wanted to try to get it fixed try local computer repair shops in my area never before had i ever encountered a company which absolutely refused to stand behind their product like i said disposable gps nextar never again,129,8
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,nice compact gps but touchscreen does not work when temp is above 75 degree and it is only two years old when it worked it was a really nice gps showing distance and time to designation and current time map direction was very easy to understand and unit is very easy to operate volume is a little on the low side battery lasted only 15 minites when it was new i would like to have this unit repaired but nextar only offer exchange program for 7999 same cost as a new unit,91,9
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,unit does not even work and nextar will not resopond to requests for a replacement or repair my suggestion would be to spend a little more for a real gps that works,32,10
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,let me start off by saying i like this gps it has all the feature i like and i really can not complain about it while it was working however i would have to say buyer be warned i had mine for a year and just short of the warrantee it died one day it worked the next it would not go passed the splash screen i would say it was my bad luck but in researching it online i found quite a few others had the same problem some shortly after they purchased it nextar has a lifetime exchange program but the price is about 140 which is more then i paid new they originally told me they would fix it but the supervisor turned it down because i lack a good reason standing by there product is not a good enough reason it is also my understanding that even under warrantee nexter requires you to pay for return shipping on your repair both way i caution you to research this unit before considering a purchase,178,11
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,I have own the nextar x3-t for 2 years now and will never own another nextar product again no support no updates nothing had to go out and buy a tom tom while on vacation to disneyworld so i could find my way unit is slow you can get where you are going before it locks in on a satellite no map updates my maps are over 4 years old and nextar has no plans to update unit also locks constantly have to keep pressing the reset button in order to get it to half-way function buy something else i would purchase this unit if it was 5 dollars,112,12
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,i bought a x3 - 08 nextar i deliver flowers and twice a year phone books so i run across many new streets that are not on city maps this unit is fantastic for finding them i learned to use it in just a few hours sure saves lots of time andi had read other reviews that said this gps goes into sleep mode and freezes the display i have not run across this but decide to correct this problem ahead of time could not find any spot to change sleep mode very satisfied,91,13
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,easy to learn a first gps as good as tom tom 130s and garmin 255w both 35 screen i paid 8995 tax if you can get it under a 10000 it is a steal,34,14
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,unfortunately microphone started giving trouble shortly after i began to use intermittent cutting out and muffled sound or no sound at all earphones sounded good although too bad i needed them to use with skype returnedthe return process through amazon was the easiest and fastest i have ever used for internet purchases amazon is favorite place to shop,60,0
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,4.0,positive,they are cheap for a reason my first pair lasted only about 4 months but they do what they are needed to do,21,1
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,supplied with a 10 cord with one 35 mm stereo headphone plug and one 35 mm mono mic plug and a stereo and mono 63 mm plug adapter for each,28,2
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,4.0,positive,not the greatest headset in the world but i doubt you can find one better for this price exactly what i was looking for cheap and good,27,3
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,the mic boom did not work good the headphones sound ok,9,4
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,i expected good quality from koss and these headphones deliver i got them because my daughter thinks she wants to be a dj my new laptop does not have a mic input so i can not say anything about the mic,40,5
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,headsets work good but the mike was really weak i actually had to scream in it in order for it to work at all,25,6
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,headset wiring seems wrong the stereo connector has the microphone also in it i used adapters to hook up the microphone to a 1/4 mike input on a pa system mono plug on nady and to a headphone out 1/4 trs jack stereo plug on nady this is not rocket science but after trying all sorts of adapters i could not properly use headphones and mike at the same time too late to send back for a refund fortunately only 17 lost i do not recommend this is rare for me maybe it is just me doing something wrong it is not the on / off switch for the mike i hope this is the case let me know,113,7
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,yeah I have used a couple of these and what can i say if you compare them to anything else in this price range there has nothing better to choose from i use them as backjust in case something goes wrong mid-gig they have saved me more than once and that makes them well worth the price,55,8
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,arrived with some type of wire shortage cuts in and out just she shall out the couple extra clams for a better product,22,9
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,just send it i ordered over a week ago this is pee poor shipping speed,15,10
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,this headset seemed pretty good at first then after a week of using it the mic quit working then the sound was bad not worth what i payed for,29,11
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,i purchased these as a stopuntil we decided just how deep in equipment we wanted to go it was a big mistake the difference between buying these and throwing 20 out the window is someone might find the 20 and use it and you will not have to put up with these super cheap junk headphones do not buy these,62,12
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,i love these headphones they have an inline volume control and an on / off switch for the microphone the sound quality on both the mic and the headset are great I had been using fairly cheap headsets for a long time and i will never go back to them these are perfect for any type of online audio application,57,13
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,this lens is either not very good or i just havnt figured out how to use it on my canon 20d does not make colorful pictures but hey it is a very economical lens,32,0
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,every thing works but the lens is very hard to use and pretty much impossible to use hand held it is not sharp i got better images from another lens at half the length blown up to the same size,40,1
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this was a good find for me i was looking to expand my equipment for my camera and this was a good one,23,2
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,the mirror lens was a high quality low cost alternative to a very heavy and very expensive conventional telephoto lens where you want an occasional lens this is a fantastic buy it is decidedly smaller and lighter than the conventional lens and it gives an excellent picture with a canon digital slr it should be remembered that the rebel series rd300 rd350 and rd400 have a smaller film size so that the 500 mm lens is nearer 800 mm on a film camers a truely huge lens,86,3
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,on a tripod you can get good pictures i often find myself using manual focus even with my af lenses so getting used to this lens was no problem at f/8 it is dark and at 500 mm it is shaky so get out your tripod and a remote or cable release and get to having some cheep long lens fun,60,4
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this is good but i have one questionhow can i use it on my canon slr camera do i need some tmound part,23,5
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i do not even think this lens deserves 1 star it is junk not sharp very hard focus do not waste your money,21,6
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,very nice lens for the price lens is solid and sturdy easy to use no communications with camera all settings must be manually set focusing is not bad just like any other lens that is manual using it on a canon 7d and very pleased,47,7
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i was excited to try this lens out and the magnification is pretty amazing but the focus just did not cut it even with a timer on a solid tripod and the reflex mirror in the up position canon t3i crisp pictures were not possible for me large objects might considered in reasonable focus but not people or animals even with the most subtle turn of the focus ring i can not find a reason to keep it,76,8
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i ordered a 500 mm mirror lens for my 60d canon cameras i got an adapter for a nikon and now i can not use the lens because it will not go on my camera i just spent little over 100 and i am very angry and i can not get the adapter off,51,9
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,this turned out to be a horrible purchase and a 100 thrown away i am so disappointed in this product i bought it to give it a try and the photos turned out to be grainy and just utter garbage it is hard to focus with this camera and to keep anything in focus i use a good tripod and a shutter release and i still get horrible photos another thing with this lens is that a ring on the outside of this device came undone i have to push it back to be able to focus it seemed it was glued on so if you are looking for a lens please pass this one up you will just waste your money do not go cheap on your lens and they should treat you right i am not sure if i can do anything about this lens but i plan on saving up and purchasing a better lens for my canon rebel t3,162,10
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i tested this lens extensively on a nikon d40x with tripod mount and self-timer set to eliminate vibration the resolution is poor at all settings use this lens if you want to take a series of fuzzy images that could not possibly be displayed in addition there is no option to control the aperture or depth of field,57,11
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,the lens is a small reflecting telescope cassegrain no aperture diaphragm fixed f/8 manual focus you will be able to take some interesting telephoto shots given the right conditions for the price of the opteka i have no complaints check prices on real 500 mm telephotos,45,12
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,very poor quality images images taken with this lens have a very low contrast the bokeh looks really weird never really seems to be in focus but that may be due to the poor contrast on a positive note it is very portable for a 500 mm,46,13
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i got the lens within a few days looks great and i can not wait to use it however i went to put it onto my camera and it will not attach very disappointing now i have to hope an adapter exists i have a canon eos xs which it should fit into,52,14
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,you can read all opinion it is cheap easy to handle and with a regular quality the only issue is you need a lot a lot of light,28,15
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i got this lens today and tried to shoot some pictures using tripod outdoors it is very difficult to focus even wioth tripod even after focusing my pictures came out soft this is not the lens for action pictures it is well built and hence is a great paper weight 47th photo which suppleid through amazon is charging 15 restocking fee for returning thisi decided to bite the bullet and return this,76,16
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,i bought this lens to have something beyond my 55 - 250 tele-lens similar to other reviewers i was not quite aware of the fact that I had buy a little telescope that said i am very happy with the solid barrel and the optical properties of the lens you will need to use some sort of support although best a tripod otherwise you will end up with blurred pictures i took some amazingly sharp and big images of the moon but due to the slow speed even a picture of venus will be blurred not to speak about faster moving stars the lens performs quite well in bright daylight but you do need to have a good tripod,115,17
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this is a cheap way to get a 500 mm telephoto lens for my canon t1i nice compromise until i can get a nice stabilized zoom lens that goes up to 500 mm,31,18
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,if you want a 500 mm lens you can spend 4 figures on a canon lens or you can buy one of these for less than 1/10 the price obviously you are going to get better results from the canon and if you want to sell your photos this is going to be useless it has not got any bells or whistles no autofocus no image stabilization so you are going to need a tripod too i would characterize the results from this lens as barely acceptable sometimes but still if you wanted to take professional style photos you were not going to get that from a 90 500 mm lens,105,19
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,i bought this lens when i first bought the camera i did not know any better it is a shame that good lens are so expensive but after a year of using the camera i think it is best to wait until you can aford a better lense i am a beginner at photography but without a stablizer built into the lens i can not get a clearly focused photo without a tripod also without auto focus it is only good for still shots jmho,84,20
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i was a little naive in the purchasing of this lens i went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300 mm they all said the same thing there is no such thing if you go cheap you are wasting your money they were right i was extremely disappointed in this lens if you think you are going to freehand this without a tripod there is no possible way to do it if you set it up against something stationary it is still going to because a snowy white image you have to use your tripod or the shot is wasted the quality of the photos would rate approximate 6/10 they generally appear a little darker with quite a bit of grain it is nice and compact in design but if you care about the quality in photos stay far away from this lens,149,21
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,these are great headsets with mic great fit great sound great price would buy again,15,0
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,the price was right but once i received i discovered the connections were rca and not usb so it does not connect to my laptop any suggestions other than sending back,30,1
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,this headset is totally perfect for my purpose it fits well can be loud enough and has a inline volume controller and microphone on / off switch the sound quality is totally perfect for the price the mic can be adjusted the whole thing fits in a small place only problem i seem to see is that at the very minimum volume one ear shuts off overall i would rate it as a good purchase,73,2
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,these headphones are not usb although they work ok a little uncomfortable with the standard audio jacks it did not state clearly the connection type at the time i ordered,29,3
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,purchased for telephony needs at work where did not need a usb set not very comfortable with two ridges of hard plastic that dig into the top of the ear will have to pad these sections with cloth or tape,40,4
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,i was looking for an inexpensive usb headset for voip and saw this one at amazon the specifications are very vague and nowhere does it mention the type of connector it uses even the picture seems to cut-off any clues to the type of connector used i had to go to the logitech website and dig through their specs to find out it does not use usb to connect to your pc but mini rca connectors i think this should be mentioned prominently to avoid confusion and purchasing the wrongthe price seems fair although,96,5
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,I have bought this headset for myself 2 years ago and I have been using it pretty often ever since it is light comfortable and works great the sound is very clear and the volume settings are high enough my mom needed one now so i bought the same logitech headset for her she loves it as well you are getting a really great product for the money,65,6
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,i purchased this product almost 2 years ago and used it regualrly it worked well and finally after 2 years it started to give me some problems since it worked well for that long i purchased exactly the same product again this time it works well and is very comfortable to use,52,7
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,great sound quality it is comfortable on ears too the only thing i could ask for is a little small frame it is a little too big for me an adjustable one was welcome,34,8
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,i bought this product two days ago and the mic does not work at all i can hear clearly through the headphones but the computer does not pic up a sound from the mic i checked everything went through a ton of tests and options and nothing works never buying something like this again,52,9
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,the microphone broke after less than 2 weeks of use i purchased this headset to talk with my friends online and now i can not because all they hear is godawful screeching as the microphone is somehow broken this is a terrible product spend the extra few dollars and get a better headset it makes me sad because this is the first logitech product that i have ever been really disappointed with,71,10
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,it works pretty well it sits comfortably on your head and the voice quality is very good,17,11
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,logitech 981 - 000074 880 pc headset please do not trust this product bcos i thought logitech as a brand is worthy product regardless of the price we pay for it i use to voice chat n use voip service i just bought couple of months back suddenly voice output is worst other end can hear only if u scream out of your lungs,63,12
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,this microphone / headphone combo is really great it is affordable and effective the mic is bendable so it can adjust however the headphones do not adjust to size of your head and they are really big so they slip off my head alot and I have got an average sized head there is a conrol panel on the cord so if you are so lazy that you can not find the button on the computer which you are attached to by the cord you can just press buttons on the cord itself which is convenient and nice overall this product is good for conversing online as a friend but not for much more than that four out of five stars,115,13
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,logitech 981 - 000074 880 pc headset i purchased this product in may 2006 for my voip account i paid 2500 from staples at he time i frequently buy online at amazoncom and wanted the product the same night to make this long story short this product works great it is reliable and portable can be used to enhance volume as well as sound on laptop and mp3s have new voip account today apr13th 2009 house phone making weird noise i tried these headphones and adjusted the settings on pc tested it on my cel for sound and it worked great i highly recommend this product and highly recommend amazoncom they are awesome and have saved me a ton of money and are reliable well worth the price i paid irma,130,14
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,these work fine but he previous set i had from logitech were much more comfortable these may be good for kids but they do not sit well on me they always seem to be in the wrong position and fell like they are always there pressing against me i wish i knew the previous model but it is not listed on the headset i travel enough that i do not expect these too last over 6 months they feel cheap next time I shall pay more to get a better headset,89,15
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,i have a dell laptop with bluetooth built in i connect devices to the dell often with no problems however the s-2 just plain does not connect to the dell with any reliability when it does it sounds great but the frustration level in trying to connect just makes it not worth the effort i would blame the dell but it does connect just fine to other devices so i have to conclude that the issue is with the s-2 i tried to get so me help from the manufacture but never got a response to my repeated requests for help again nice sound but just not reliable,108,0
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i was looking for a replacement bluetooth headset for my iphone previously i had a motorola s9 paired with an icombi ap21 i got both at amazon well after 3 months of use the buttons on the s9 got stuck so that i couldt increase the volume I have read that this has been a common concern for many other people as well i looked at the bluetrek st-1 the sony drbt21 g and the cardo s-2 all three were within the same price range a cnet review of the cardo made me buy them in comparing them to my old s9s the sound quality is excellent i was a little apprehensive because I have gotten used to the small buds on the s9 but the earpiece is very light and comfortable overall a great product and i would recommend them to friends,140,1
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,it took me 2 hours to figure out how to configure the headphones with my vista 64 os but finally i did and it works like a charm with decent listening quality update the headphones are too flimsy and broke on me now i have to use tape t hold it together,51,2
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,I have owned the cardo s-2s for about 4 months during that time they received light use i would estimate total listening time to be about 40 hours the s-2s were used mostly for listening to audio while exercising i found the lag while watching video to be a bit annoying the sound quality was good not great but good battery life was excellent they never went dead i would always recharge at about 4 hours i did not abuse these headphones and had they not broken after 4 months of light use i would rate them 4 out of 5 stars,101,3
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,this piece of junk broke almost immediately it is designed so poorly that after only 2 or 3 uses it will break right at the piece that joins the ear piece to the part the wraps around your neck this prevents it from no longer staying securely on your ears i was extra careful with it two after reading several other reviews about it being week but it made no difference the sound is good but the quality of the product design it terrible if the price drops to 5 i would say buy otherwise avoid this product completely this is not worth the price,105,4
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,i like this headset works great and easy to connect not very loud and can become uncomfortable if wearing for a long time overall i think it is a good buy,30,5
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,the headphone plastic cracked and broke a couple of months after i bought the,15,6
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,i bought these to make my life easier at the gym by not having wires hanging off my head when i exercise the sound is pretty good the range is decent it connected to my ux380 easily i like that they fold it is what sold me one them top begin with although i worry about the durability of the plastic we shall see about that i have tried not to expose them to too much sweat so i can not attest to their sweatproofness or lack thereof i am please with my purchase although,94,7
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,this cardo bluetooth headphone works well inside a vehicle or indoor outdoor it pick up many other interference reception becomes poor when i turn my body might loose the signal inside vehicle no problem the elbow where it folds the plastic joint can seperate causing ultimately internal wires become torn will not charge and no longer function,56,8
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i use these extensively with both my blackberry curve 8320 and pearl 8120 for both phone and music listening i also paired with the jabra a120 adapter easily sound quality is great compared to the two other comparable bluetooth stereo headsets that i have tried not as good as my sony dr-bt50s but much easier to travel with no complaints about the mic when using the phone the controls are well placed and easy to use once you are familiar with them the headset is comfortable to wear for extended use my only complaint about them would be that they are a bit on the flimsy side and seem like they would be easy to break,115,9
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,cons you look like mickey mouse wearing these headphones pros best bluetooth phones out there for the money,18,10
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,i had mine for a few months now it was easy enough to make it work with my notebook lenovo x61 but it just would not work with my blackberry it was not cardos problem but their tech support was not very easy to work with so finally after making the headset to connect properly with both it is battery stopped holding a charge for any reasonable period of time basically a waste of time money and efforts,74,11
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i paired it with a verizon palm 700wx works perfectly no complaints sound is very good having the controls right on the headset is very conveinent essentially i am controling windows media player with it the microphone is also very good no complaints from people on other end most do not know i am on a headset at all range is great also almost to good make sure bluetooth is disabled or unit is turned off when your charging or not using charge seems to last me two 2 works days of intermittent use which for me means several hours of music listening and stand-by time,105,12
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,wow better than expected the sound is clear there is no skippin of music and they fit very well quite pleasantly surprised,22,13
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,this product is in a league of it is own very comfortable and it stays securely on your ears with the unique design of the ear clips easy to use and setup just have to follow the instructions can be paired with as many bluetooth devices you have to use sound is excellent the only set back i have is i can not get it to recognize my voice when using voice activated dialing which is minor because i did not by it for cell phone use but is crystal clear as handsfree device really good sound for stereo use and for those who have to stay up late watching tv,109,14
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,i am enjoying great sound quality using my cardo s-2 bluetooth headset for the mp3 player part of my phone however when phone calls come in the sound for the people on the other end is poor and i have to switch back to using the phone to talk otherwise this is a beautiful set of earphones,57,15
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,after being a photography buff for over 20 years i wanted to protect the surface of my new rebel xsi while the armor fits relatively nice it hinders lens changes and blocks the sensor which allows the lcd to display even after cutting that part of the armor i still found it negativley affecting the way i shoot photographs i did like the lcd protector that came with it but it is a high price to pay for that it is off my camera and i will not be putting it back on i would not recommend this product for purchase,98,0
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,it fits and works great the only thing which is a small issue is sometimes it blocks the light sensor and in turn shuts off the lcd screen but that is only when the cover gets moved a little in that area,41,1
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,i have a cannon rebel t3i i love my camera and want to protect it but this did not fit at all it is a good concept but it did not work out i should have know seeing that it was only 10 bucks i simply threw it out,46,2
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,yes I am one of those persons walking around with a silver camera xsi no i never have liked silver cameras but i got it from my sister so it was not entirely my fault i mean it is almost better than nothing anyway i got this armor not to protect my camera but because it looks a whole lot better than bare silver granted it does not make the camera awesomely black but at least i can say i tried without braking the bank it does add to the grip a bit as well so if you liked silver then found out after the fact that it was not really in this is a good way to cover your mistake trust me there are not a whole lot of people out there dying to buy your silver camera or trade for black so go head and at least try it,144,3
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,this body armour does the job of protecting my rebel xsi but i have a few complaints in installing it one rubber piece snapped because it is really skinny and was extended too much as i was fitting the body armour on my camera it is the piece that goes between the flash and the dial it is really skinny and fragile overall the armour is not snug enough i was expectibg it to really be a snug fit arond the camera body it is not the case it is a little too loose and you feel you do not have a good grip of the camera because of it the bottom piece holds to the rest of the body armour with rubber tabs these tabs keep coming out and i have to constantly put the tabs back in place feels really cheap but it is inexpensive after all the lens hood protector pice does not fit a 77 mm as advertised the bottom pice has to be completely taken out to replace the battery so yes inexpensive but you get what you pay for,184,4
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i bought this as a gift for a friend thedoes not fit the camera well and it was a tad bit embarrassing to watch as the recipient struggled to get it onto his xsi it also made the camera a dust magnet,44,5
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,i am more than happy with my purchase of the camera armour there is no better way to keep scratches and dings from a camera and the price was definitely right,31,6
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,the products company said it best you will get a case for your 20000 cell phone but not your 150000 camera that convinced me i got this and it is great the fit is a little loose but it is fine it will protect it way more than before buy this if you want a good case at a decent price,59,7
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,the fit on the camera is a bit awkward but once you get it on it covers a lot i have a canon t1i and the armor covered the light sensor plus the lens cup on the front blocks the flash if you use it,45,8
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i bought this for my girlfriends camera after much difficultly we finally got the thing on the camera only to find the armor blocked access to some features and would not stay tight around the body it sounded like a goodbut the final product is shoddy and not worth the money we have already thrown it out,58,9
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,this does fit my canon xsi quite well a little bit tricky installing but now it is on lens installation was not hard either i really just wanted something to protect the body from bumps scratches a previous post complained about having to remove it to replace the battery personally it seems quite easy to remove the bottom plus my battery tends to get several hundred pics so i do not see it to be a huge deal i do not see myself using the rubber lens hood for less than 10 i think it is a bargain,93,10
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i purchased the camera armor through amazon for my canon xsi last year at the same time that i bought my new camera i have been very disappointed in the camera armor it does not fit my camera well the armor makes it difficult to operate some of the features on the camera the extensions on bottom piece easily slip out of the slits in the main part of the armor that are intended to hold it in place the bottom piece of the armor falls off easily this is aggravating the part that would protect the lens is bulky and i have not been using it some areas of my camera specifically the led screen and the pop-up flash as well as the buttons and dial are not protected at all by using the armor further the rubbery material seems to attract dust i have put up with this product for almost a year and now i am looking for something else that will be easier to use and will protect my camera better,175,11
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,when i ordered this camera armor i knew that it was not popular but the price was reduced to under 700 and i thought i would gain if any part of it was usable alas i found no part worth using every part either falls off too easily makes camera use awkward and/or contributes nothing to protect the camera i believe that this product was honestly conceived and the best materials were used in construction it just does not work for me i ordered it to give it a try without high expectations i have no regrets,96,12
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,the armor does what it claims to do that is to protect your camera with a rubber coating that gives it a better grip just like having a nose mask for your car this product covers your camera with a nice protective shield all the buttons function normally except for covering the button labels so get to know your cameras buttons a little before putting on the armor the lense hood is too small for my canon 28 - 135 usm lense the only surprise was that i have to remove the base covering to replace the battery I am thinking of buying a second one for future use because i plan to keep my t1i for a long time i give it 4 stars because it is not tight fitting and you have to adjust it a little on occasion,137,13
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,does not have a tight seal sometimes the cover interferes when you try to attach the lens feels terrible in hand do not really offer much protection the bottom part is hard to install the lens hood is unusable because it is impossible to attach it on to the lens felt like i paid 30 dollars for a small piece of low quality rubber do not buy,64,14
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,this product has given me the freedom to carry my cannon camera in all conditions without having to use a camera bag the lens protector is excellent as are the other armor protection elements,34,15
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,nice product hope it will save my camera if i ever drop it it was easy to install and does not block any functions,24,16
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,the armor was easily installed on the eos rebel ti1 camera i have it works great and protects the vital parts of the camera I am througly satisfied with the product i have body armor on other cameras i have and found that it is a very good investment the armor makes the camera easier to grip and if you should drop it the armor provides some degree of impact protection,70,17
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,camera amour is excellent protection for my canon xsi the screen cover may be the best part of it one design flaw the lens hood does not stay on the lens unless you are using a filter otherwise an excellent product,40,18
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this it interferes with the lense change does not work well with the flash the lense protector makes it difficult if not impossible to manually focus the screen protector is the only think that was worth a darn i paid 40 at wallymart i promptly returned it for my money back,55,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,i normally like glutino but their honey nut flavor is so boring and the texture is wierd apple cinnamon flavor is significantly better so if you are buying one of the two definately go with the apple cinnamon however the best gluten free cheerio is perkyos frosted cheerio amazon why is it not for sale on your site perkyos is excellent in size of the o as well as taste in my opinion the frosted perkyo is better more flavorful than the original brand but amazon needs to sell both especially for the young toddler that needs just the right size for their little fingers the original is a good choice for them as well as for those of you who do not like sugar much,124,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,my son loves these thank goodness they hold up well in soymilk for ceral in the morning and also hold up well in snack bags he is constantly needing o shaped cereal for projects at school and these work great they are a bit sweet but he does not mind,49,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,I am a very picky person i use to love cereal every morning until i had to go on the gluten free diet until this product i just gave up on cereal because i just did not like the taste of other cereal either they were just so hard or too fake in taste and chocolate cereals got old very quick but this honey nut sans gluten changed all that absolutely the best cereal i have come across and still have not found any other cereal to meet it is caliber my toddler who is not gluten free loves it i also found that when crushed you can use this as a noncooking pie crust or any recipe that requires bulk bread or graham crumbs,120,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,i almost did not buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous but I am glad i decided to go for it this is one of the better gluten-free cereals I have had it is not just like cheerios of course but it has a pleasant taste of it is own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful it does not get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals nor does it have that familiar cardboard texture those of us with celiac know all too well this product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems and i give the makers credit for that i think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it of course i can always just add some myself and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals regardless of where you buy it but i think it is definitely worth trying if you are on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable I shall buy this again,170,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,ok i can not stand these things but my babies love them so i gave it 2 stars not one first of all it is just puffed corn like peanut puffs if you have had those by envirokids and that would not be so bad if they did not taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in your mouth for being all natural it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop watch out maybe the honey nut is better,81,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,this girlfriend cereal is decent does not get soggy easily and is relatively good i was a huge fan of apple cinnamon cheerios before going gluten free and these really do not compare well but the cereal does not taste like cardboard and does not have the weird gluten free taste to it and is actually pretty good,54,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,this cereal is slightly better than the apple cinnamon version because it is honey nut and it tastes very close to honey nut cheerios my toddler son and my gluten eating husband both eat it it is a good price also compared to prices in the store the only thing is you have to buy it in bulk but if you are like me that is ok because you will go through it or you can share with other girlfriend friends,77,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,this cereal while not exactly the same as cheerios is very very close and even my husband who is not girlfriend eats it it is perfect for girlfriend families especially those with a toddler who is needing to eat cereal and be gluten free good buy for the price also,50,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,honey nut cereal is my sons favorite it is the closest to cherrios it is great to throw in a suitcase for a trip sometimes hotels have only continental breakfast you can byoc-bring your own cereal and use their milk very good,42,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,we love it tastes great and can be used as a snack also just like cheerios only better because it is gluten free fast ship i would recommend this cereal to everybody you will not be disappointed,39,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,i have tried a lot of girlfriend cereals and this is the best one i have encountered since i started a girlfriend diet two years ago,26,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,our 2 year old son is affected by celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park the glutino apple cinnamon rings serve that purpose very well for us and he loves them they do not taste like your typical cereal that contains flour of course they do not but for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes these are a great quick snack,96,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,i bought these plainer box at a whole foods definitely not worth the 429 i paid for them they are so bland like someone lightly and i mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard there are no vitamins added either so there has little health value they could have at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it I shall probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips i can not afford to just toss them will not be buying them again,90,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,bought this cereal at the store does not taste like nut and honey very disappointed just tastes like they used cheap ingredients will not buy again,26,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,i order this cereal via subscribe and save and always have to order a new case before the actual new ship date i can not keep this cereal in the house it seems like i order 6 boxes and then i turn around and we are down to the last one my kids love this cereal i love this cereal it hits my sweet tooth just right when i momentarilyaway from my healthiest eating habits but do not want to sink all the way down into actual junk food also it is nice to have a gluten-free cereal that youngcan use to make cheerio necklaces and other craft projects,109,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,when i read the reviews on the products i like to believe there is some truth to it but serious this cereal just taste awful this was another gluten free product i tried based on the many positive reviews it is called honey nut am i correct yet it tasted like i can not even discribe the words nothing like i ever tasted is it just me had to give half of my boxes away what a waste of money I am getting so disappointed in this new gluten free stuff i think I shall just switch back to my normal foods can anyone out there make anything gluten free that is not disgusting come on,108,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,1.0,negative,this cereal is high in calories has essentially no fiber or significant nutrients and does not have either good taste or texture the serving size is 1/2 cup and packs 120 calories for that small amount I am returning mine,39,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,1.0,negative,wow-threw this away after one bite chemical sticky sweet smell the cereal is translucent wow i will stick with g-free chex light years better than this,25,17
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,1.0,negative,i was optimistic about this but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal we threw out all 6 boxes,22,18
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,i bought these for my son because they are gluten free he seems to like them i thought that they lacked taste i would have preferred a little more cinnamon taste,31,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,1.0,negative,it smells rancid it tastes like rancid granulated sugar it is too sweet the texture is bad and it has zero flavor it looks absolutely nothing like what has on the box i tried one kernel and spit it out could not even swallow it I am very mad i wasted my money on this product,52,20
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,5.0,positive,if you used to love cheerios before having to go on a gluten free diet you will love these great with sliced banana or other fruit i prefer the honey nut to the apple cinnamon one of the better tasting and better textured gluten free cereals in my opinion we all know comparing gluten free flour products to wheat products is like comparing apples and oranges but after years on a gluten free diet a product like this is a darn good substitute,83,21
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,1.0,negative,i bought these in the grocery store and could not even eat one bowl they were too hard too sweet nasty flavour i was sooooooo disapointed super gross,27,22
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,2.0,negative,i bought this cereal for my kids ages 6 and 7 who can not eat gluten any more they will not eat it i think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out,41,23
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,flavorful and a great substitute for honey nut cheerios texture a bit airy my children love it too,18,24
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair there is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated,26,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,all natural beef but too soft for my taste does not have the snap and drier outer surface that some like this is a matter of personal taste the product is good just not for everyone i suggest trying this companys old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks strong hickory flavor a good bite of spice and drier texture this company has superb customer service,63,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,i could not resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste and at first it was not very oily but as they got older and exposed to the air i did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks overall if you can consume this say within 1 week of opening they are great if you need something that will stick around longer stick get it then maybe this is not the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order and the shipping was quick i like the company the beef sticks just were not what i was looking for i guess,127,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,beef sticks and honey what a great combination the ole smokies beef sticks are full of flavor adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top the honey stung ole smokies are always a favorite with our friends the saddlebag pack is a perfect take-along to football parties,56,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,quality of meet was poor seemed like there was fillers in it smelled foul and was not really that spicy,19,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i brought these to work and everyone went through them in a matter of minutes i had to let them all know where i got them so they could order some for their family and friends and hopefully to replace mine love em,42,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,these things are nasty my dog was even hesitant to eat one and my beef loving dad thought they were gross the texture is horrible and leaves a thick grease film inside your mouth we ended up throwing the whole pack away after 2 sticks,45,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these are not spicy they taste great and have a mild spice if you have ever had the spicy sausage the mama brand from astation that is the spicy-taste you would be familiar with the product was incredibly fresh and i will not hesitate to try other flavors fantastic snacks and they are very similar to the jack links 99 cent beef stick although slightly sweeter at a much better price these are jack link quality not slim jim,77,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,this is by far the worst beef jerky i have ever had in my entire life i bought the teriyaki it tastes like a cheap hotdog i saw this product had good reviews but i think they are fake,39,8

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,price is great i thought they were ok but my sons loved them,13,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,the best honey beef jerky every just ordered again,9,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,these have actually gotten a lot better than they used to make them before the meat sticks were a more uniform cut thinner stock now they are thicker with a darker skin that leiterally gives a snap when you bite into them with the thicker skin it seems to retain more flavor they also seem to have a more moist feeling to them where in the past they tended be slightly drier feeling some might think this is more greasy but that adds to the flavor after all we are here for the flavor and not for healthy snacks the teriyaki tend to be a bit sweet tasting try the honey stung flavor which is also great but not as sweet,120,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,these are absolutely fantastic knew right on the first snack that these would become a staple in my household delicious and great buy,23,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,i bought the spicy jerky sticks and they were not even spicy also they were mushy i would not recommend if you want a good jerky stick this is more like eating a cold sausage,34,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,very taste get for those tring to lost weight and control your protean shard them with friends and now they are buying it too,24,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,highly inconsistent product the one saddle bag tasted wonderful was juicy with a delightfully sweet teriyaki flavor the second saddle bag literally tasted like dog treats it was not just one or two sticks the enter half was awful this company needs to higher someone else in,47,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,these teriyaki sticks were fantastic my husband loved having them in his lunches for a quick protein snack they were moist and flavorful not tough and dry I had recommend them to anyone and i will be purchasing more,38,17

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,nothing about these are spicy I have had chicken sandwiches from fast food chains with more spice they certainly have good content but i do not find them any better than off the shelf slim jims they lack flavor and texture i ended up spicing these up with some tabasco and cayenne pepper in a bag shake it up and now they are spicy,62,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,i am not generally one to leave a review much less a bad review but these honey stung literally leave a bad taste in my mouth i wanted to like them and the first bite is not bad because you taste the sweet but then the flavor turns into something that the dog literally thinks twice about seriously he kinda looks at me like really let us it sit for awhile and then will eat it this is not what he does with any sort of meat i guess i can thank you for the expensive dog treats,95,20
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,not a fan tastes more like hot dogs ground up mystery meat i guess if you like slim jims you would enjoy these,24,21

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i really like the taste but the fat content is too high to eat on a regular basis the texture is softer than jerky they are pretty much smoked sausages,30,23
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,rubbery greasy and texture is weird if you can get past those issues taste is eh ok not super spicy but gives a warm kick they would probably be better if they were not so limp and as i mentioned rubbery i tried letting them dry out a bit microwaved put them in the fridge and even tossed one on the grill still no change they are only about four inches long so it is amazing how these things droop over for being so short if they tasted better maybe that would not be a big deal but it is,95,24
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,very good meat sticks great flavor and with just the right amount of spiciness for me and they do not make a mess on your fingers while eating them,28,25

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i bought these last year and they are great for a snack very good product,13,33
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i love these things i used to order from an ebay seller but they quit handling the honey flavored ones i went to order the buffalo bills honey ones here on amazon and noticed these teriyaki ones I am glad i ordered these along with the honey ones the honey ones are not as sweet as the ones on ebay were even although i tracked them down to the same manufacturer it was a different city listed on the package so either i got the mild variety or my taster has changed the honey ones were still good although i could not detect much honey flavor detected this review is really for the teriyaki meat sticks the bad thing about these teriyaki meat sticks is that they are somewhat addictive in fact i should end this review so i can order me some more really thanks choo choo r snacks inc,148,34
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,bad not good this is terrible tasting it has the texture of patee and teriyaki flavor was not there thought it would be a good deal for the price but i wasted my money I am going to give it to the homeless person i see too bad I am a huge fan of teriyaki beef jerky,55,35
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,too soft for my taste reminds me of the smell dog jerky was looking for replacement for jack links beef stick original 36-count bag pack of 2 335 oz since it is not for sale anymore i guess i need to keep looking,41,36
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,I am a repeat customer they are better grilled than fresh out of the bag but taste good uncooked too,19,37
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,did not like the flavor overly smokey but if you like the smoke flavor then these are for you,18,38
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,these beef sticks would be good if they did not have that weird i can not even call it an aftertaste it is more of a side taste my suspicion is that it is the preservatives they use but it is just weird at least the texture of the sticks is better than the other ones i tried but not by much I had give these a pass unless you are desperate note this review really applies to these and the honey stung variety the only difference is whether they are slightly spicy or slightly sweet,89,39
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,good product that is not greasy tastes like old summer sauages that quality meat markets sold back in the 70s my son takes in his lunch and fishing with grandpa,31,40

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,this review is specifically for the buffalo bills 2 lb spicy 5-inch ole smokies saddlebag not sure why the reviews lump together different flavors and packagings anyway i liked em good flavor spicy but not overpowering good snap the smell well they smell like spicy dried meat it is not bad but you would not want to wear it as a cologne or maybe you would i mean i do not know you maybe your girl is into that it is not for me to judge anyway I shall be buying more in the near future i preferred these to the other brand i bought here old wisconsin hardwood smoked snack sticks although to be fair both were good,113,48

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,i love jerky and dried beef sticks but i could not stomach more than two of these quite disappointed and even although i never send back stuff that i buy i feel like i should get my money back in this case,41,62
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,louzy taste real fake taste i hatred this product,10,63

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,first of all i would like to thank buffalo bills for gracing the world with their ability to craft the common cow into something more than steak burgers and ribs they made the best beef stick I have ever tasted cowboy style smokies twisted on the ends this is the real deal these little fellas are the perfect snack on that long cattle drive or between rodeos every bite has that perfect snap when you bite into it do not even try to compare these to any inferior meat stick these ole smokies are the bees knees of the meat industry john wayne clint eastwood chuck norris and john bassalone would be proud,111,67
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,if u like extremely soft jerky this is for u just not for me because i like a some toughness to my jerky,23,68
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,product arrived as promised have made my own links this product is ok on taste but is finely ground and texture is horrible if they would grind in not so fine grind this product would be grea i re smoked and dried in oven was ok to eat,48,69
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,they were too tangy way too sweet but some how sour as well and too soft ended up feeding them to my cats more so than eating them myself the cats liked them but i sure did not,37,70
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i just received these today and i will say that the taste is very good it beats out most other beef sticks i have tried for taste however the slight film it leaves in my mouth after each bite is slightly icky if it was not for that film then it would definitely get 5-stars not sure if it is just the batch i got or that the sticks are cold so maybe if i warm them up a bit the film texture goes away all in all great product although i was a little disappointed i did not receive a free sampler like some of the other reviews i saw on here,111,71
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i love just about anything with honey in it so i might be a little biased i received these in the mail the other day and find them great for snacking on while at work i love the taste and prefer them much better than the stuff i find in our convenient stores i recommend them to friends and will buy them again as soon as I am done with this bag,71,72
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,this product was great no gristle meat was tender the taste was great well worth giving it a try we enjoyed eating them,23,73
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,this stuff smells weird and tastes artificial the center looks like it was squeezed from a tube and tastes powdery i liked them at first but very quickly decided they were not for me i very much prefer old wisconsin to these,42,74
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,i ordered these because i love teriyaki and i love beef sticks but these were terrible they have a nasty aftertaste I am not sure if they are rancid or just a really bad flavor i would not order this again,40,75
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,good packaging consistent flavour i accidentally ordered the honey-stung instead of spicy which to be honest are horrible my dog loved them although good for the price but of this brand i suggest avoiding honey stung and sticking to spicy which are great,43,76
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,fast shipping but the beef sticks are too soft i expected is harder inside likes the other brands the ingredient is good but i do not like the meat softy inside it tasted weird,33,77
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,the honey-stung ones are bland and not really to my liking but these teriyaki ones combine the nice texture of a sausage with a sort of snappy skin with a slightly spicy sweet and slightly savoury teriyaki flavor,38,78
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these are very good they are tender and not really dry or super chewy like some jerky products everyone loved them especially my college age son unfortunately they are somewhat expensive and you can go through 20 worth of the product very quickly,43,79
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,the sticks i received where mushy and did not have much of a teriyaki flavor save your money and buy something else,22,80
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,i am no expert but i have tried my fair share of beef snack stick even from different countries this is the single most horrible tasting thing i tried also the texture of it is dry and crumbles in your mouth how is this possible should not it be chewy i have nohow the product is prepared but i can tell you the final product is not worth the price nor the time after trying 2 sticks i have put the rest in the trash already,87,81
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,they are good but not as good as beef sticks from our local grocery they are okay but i will not be ordering more the other bag is in the freezer,28,82
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,really unpleasant tasting very high fat very poor quality meat made me wonder what the cow had done to deserve it is fate second ingredient beef hearts,26,83
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,i thought that these sticks taste like paper and were greaser than others I have had i like the extra smoke jerky better,22,84
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,one of the bags had a rip in it and ruined half of the product the other half was just not good big disappointment,24,85
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,ok needs more flavor to make them taste better I am not buying them again until they are improved much better products out there,23,86
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,maybe I am just a normal person who can not adapt this kind of flavor can not imagine why some people said they like it,22,87
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,this is how pepperoni should be moist yet with a good snap when you bite into it not too salty smoke and flavored just right,25,88
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,the outside of these is simply perfect for a mild meat stick the honey gives it a nice sweetness and the wrapper has a nice snap to it when you bite into it the inside however tastes almost exactly like a slim jim i find slim jims to be a guilty pleasure so i was ok with this but these do taste like they are made of cheaper fattier meat than what i prefer so i probably will not be buying this product again if you really like slim jims give this a shot otherwise i would pass giving it a four because it is exactly as advertised and quite tasty just not exactly my thing,115,89
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,or just fake tasting beef sticks either way they were terrible 2nd star for edibility during times of extreme hunger / famish,20,90
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these are some of the best tasting jerky sticks I have tried but i could not get the taste of heart out of my head after reading the ingredients something of a personal problem although,33,91
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,soft mushy moist these are the tree words that best describe these sticks i was definitely expecting these sticks to be dryer and chewier the flavor is pretty good but the texture makes these a thumbs-down for me,41,92
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,addictive delicious much better than the slim jims some other reviews have likened it to i got one of these in 4 days ago and it lasted for all of 2 and a half days i just ordered another package these have a high fat content which you can taste when you bite into one the taste is predominantly salty with a spicy kick and a noticeable but not overpowering hint of honey additionally there is a subtle acid bite these are good right out of the bag but they can also be used in cooking i chopped a few up and added them to pancakes delicious they would probably also go good in breakfast burritos cous cous or rice you can not go wrong with these babys,127,93
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,1.0,negative,the meat has a creamy texture like biting into a stick of brie cheese principal ingredient is pured cow hearts each stick has 14 of the usda daily fat allowance i would not feed it to my dog,37,94
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,guess it is just personal preference but do not like them ended up giving them away and using them as dog treats,20,95
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i think these are great but the packaging is so so it is a bulk pack they are not individually wrapped you have to put them in smaller ziploc bags to keep them from going stale,35,96
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these were a very good value compared to convenience store beef sticks a bit mushy could be drier i keep them in fridge,23,97
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,good light taste not too strong of a flavoring and very little if any aftertaste they go down easy mmmmm definitely happy with the purchase,24,98
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago he spread them around and so i got to sample a variety I have ordered the honey stung four times since then two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they are believers too additionally we have all ordered several of the buffalo bills brands and they are all superb as long as you do not eat the whole bag I had also call these atkins friendly as well as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times other than them being just being great well-seasoned snacks buy em you will love em,118,99
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i enjoyed this product they are a good value for the amount you get i did not sense much honey in the product so a bit more flavor would be nice i would buy again,35,100
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i although it was fresh moist however personally alittle to sweet for me i think i 'll stick with the john wayne brand jw brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better,36,101
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but i am happy i did they were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in the teriyaki was milder than others i have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole smokeys i did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste all in all worth a 4 rating but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes,97,102
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,these snacks are very different than say slim jims they are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there there was a nice hint of spice laced with honey i would say they tasted and had a texture that i might have expected in a more expensive product i will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family,68,103
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,i bought the buffalo bills teriyaki ole smokies beef sticks because i absolutely love beef sticks especially teriyaki and i thought this would be a good buy good quantity for the price the teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful i also loved the texture it was very soft and tender the only bad thing I had have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to fully enjoy the product aside from that i may still order it again,109,104
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i purchased the honey stung smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy i would not go that far but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a snap to them the taste is great even the picky kids liked these smokies-i think we will try some of the other flavors plus order these again,61,105
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,really great snack for hiking or a baseball game my son and i enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant,32,106

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,i love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say mild instead of spicy it is not spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so i thought i was actually purchasing spicy this time still a wonderful product,72,110

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000NY6P7K,4.0,positive,the bende salami tastes kind of like the pick salami but the texture is different bende is softer and hence a little difficult to slice thinly i still think pick is the best but bende is a good alternative if pick is not available,44,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000NY6P7K,5.0,positive,i have been looking for real hungarian kolbasz sausage or salami but could find only imitations this one is very good and i would buy it again and recommend it to those who like spicy sausages,36,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000NY6P7K,4.0,positive,knowing the hungarians they like a lot of fat / heavy stuff it tasted good but lots of fat would buy again for ethnic reasons,23,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000NY6P7K,1.0,negative,not good mediocre flavor packaged to look authentic but made in united states a small residual portion of most bites resists pulverization by chewing and needs to be spit out do not know if this is due to the addition of some type of inedible filler or what but whatever the because its very unappetizing and unsatisfactory all in all a very disappointing and inferior product,64,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000NY6P7K,5.0,positive,love hungarian salami and apparently so does my granddaughter very good,11,5

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,i took a chance on these considering the mixed reviews and found the grapes to be a solid product yes they are a bit more tart than some green grapes but i personally enjoy a grape that is not completely sweet i would have given it the highest rating except that about a third of the grapes were borderline miniature in my particular package regardless of taste i prefer them to be large and plump i queued them up for purchase again in my amazon fresh cart and will likely make my ultimate determination based on the two orders increasing my sample size,103,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,i ordered the organic and the regular green seedless grapes to compare for my own curiosity the organic were way more flavorful and i would not have considered them at all tart as stated in another review and I am guessing it may be the time of year and these were more in the peak of the season but for sure the organic were full of flavor and firm,68,2

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,2.0,negative,these were really tasteless i bought them because they were actually cheaper than the regular grapes but it was not worth it they are a lot firmer than regular grapes so i wonder if they are just unripe i do not think i know what an unripe grape looks like anyway i do not recommend it is a waste of your money,57,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,very good very sweet but i may have received the wrong ones since it has tons of seeds either way tasted good,22,11

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,i have been buying a lot of grapes lately every week so in trying amazon fresh for the first time i ordered 3 of these apporximately 16 of my 50 order so these were a big deal to me they initially looked really good big round plump juicy however i discovered a majority of them had huge black spots on them then in eating them i found the flavor to range from tasteless to dirt and yes i washed them well i can hardly bring myself to eat them and think it was a horrible waste of money i am canceling amazon fresh extremely disappointed,105,15

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,2.0,negative,i really like the walden farms ranch salad dressing so i thought i would like this dip i used it with a rice chip and the first taste was ok however after about 5 seconds there was a strong pepper bite on the back of my tongue since i am not overly fond of pepper i found this to be a huge drawback also the dip had an oily consistency i wound up throwing this product out i would only recommend it to someone who likes a pepper burn from now on I shall stick to the walden farm salad dressing and make my own low cal dip,107,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,2.0,negative,good enough taste and consistency replicates a ranch dip pretty well but then the aftertaste hits you it is got some kind of a fertilizer / chemical-y note on the back end that is off-putting enough to make me and my wife not eat any after the first few trial tastes not their best product for sure,53,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,4.0,positive,every one of these products are perfect for competition training and meal preps,13,8

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,5.0,positive,not too sweet but sweet enough and refreshing with a nice little carbonated kick this energy drink is a very welcome deviation from other energy drinks out there that i quite frankly can not stomach also the ingredient list is actually true to it is name healthy imagine that the first seven ingredients are a variety of fruit juices and water then other than caffiene and stevia the healthy sugar additive that actually possesses antioxidant properties and a little carbonation that is it this is one energy drink i will gladly keep on hand,91,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,1.0,negative,was not a fan at all brought a 12 pack and barely drank one anyone want it only tried the apple but probably will not try the others it tastes like fake apple like a green blowpop even tho it is real,42,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,2.0,negative,i sampled this last week when i was walking near bryant park in new york city and the marketing people were handing out free samples full cans of jamba juice energy drinks i grabbed one since it was free and i was really thirsty the drink did not tasted good i could feel the sour taste and low level of sweetness like it was sweetened with aspartame i drank about half of the can and threw the remained into the rain drain grate on the street i would never pay for this drink but i would accept it for free to clear my throat when i am thirsty,106,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this product some energy drinks have negative side effects for example headaches shakes terrible taste and more i found jamba to be both flavorful and gave me a noticeable increase in energy without a killer headache or the shakes,40,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,i have a cup of green tea every morning and that is enough to keep me going since i was sleep deprived i thought it would be a good day to try jamba strawberry banana energy drink the taste was better than i anticipated like real juice very slight carbonation with no detectable aftertaste i had it along with my lunch at 1 pm wish i had known that the 80 mg of caffeine it contains is about 3 times as much as in a cup of green tea i need to stay awake til about 11 pm but i hope it does not keep me up all night,103,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,1.0,negative,it is impossible to rate this product as we never did receive it i have friends that use it and like it but i have no personal experience with it,30,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,1.0,negative,i really did not enjoy the taste of this energy drink at all i thought it was a too sweet and then there was this bitter after taste at well it is also a very small can especially in comparison to a lot of other energy drinks out there in the market so even if it had tasted very good i still would not have thought this was an ideal choice,68,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,needing a mid afternoon jump start at work i have tried various sodas fruit drinks teas and so called energy drinks that were ranged from awful to so-so i was never impressed with one product to try it again the crisp but not overly sweet taste combined with a still hit of caffeine that did not make me shaky or interfere with night-time sleep made this a winner for me i did not notice any aftertaste and it did not the cloying flavor of regular apple juice it will be included in my supplies that get me through a long work day enjoy,103,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,if you like the taste of some of the other bull-ish energy drinks than enjoy if you like the energy from those other drinks but would rather drink something a little more palatable you might want to try the jamba juice energy drink no it does not taste like apple juice but there are enough hints of apple to drown out most of the nasty caffeine flavor that is usually present in these drinks if this does not sound like a ringing endorsement that is because it is not that said if you are going to use energy drinks this is a pretty good one,101,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,a crisp delicious beverage to give me a buzz without making me feel guilty for drinking from some large dressed up purple can covered in bolts of lightning i love jamba juice smoothies and the energy drink did not lower my opinion of the sweet and healthy treats apple may not be my favorite flavor and the can was too small to give me complete satisfaction but it was crisp delicious and came in a very nice looking can,78,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,1.0,negative,jamba juice is pretty well known in new york city as having great fresh made fruit and vegetable drinks I am a fan so when i got out of the subway station one morning to find a group of people handing out free samples of these canned juice energy drinks i figured I had give it a try based on reputation I am not big on energy drinks if i want a lift coffee is my go-to i was sorely disappointed i could not even get past one sip if i want apple juice I shall just go and get me a regular old apple juice thank you I am not big on artificial sweeteners and while I am aware that stevia is natural it still has a strange taste to it even my boyfriend who has gotten used to beverages with stevia said he could not get past the first few swallows either it tasted unnatural to him as well both of us unknown to each other threw them out in the garbage jamba would have been better off canning some of their delicious juice drinks instead that i would buy,184,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,1.0,negative,identification rather take a nap or have a coffee the flavor of this was so uninteresting i even like apple cider but this tasted like something you try once and forget about the labeling of drinks as energy drinks is such a joke half of these products probably only manage to irritate the body you are better off taking a nap or like i said having a small cup of coffee or tea jamba juice totally missed the mark on this one it tasted off and would have been even more disappointing if i paid for it,96,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,this jamba juice energy drink is tasty and refreshing with a nice tangy aftertaste to it the energy drink did not give much of a boost but i did not feel particularly slow after drinking it either maybe it just gives you even keel of energy than others where you get a noticeable boost and a noticeable crash later in the day too,63,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,2.0,negative,i ordered thisbased on the jamba juice name and was pretty disappointed i like tart apples but this is not enjoyable at all i did not notice a significant increase in my energy either i drank it during a break at work glad i got to try one for free not worth the price,55,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,4.0,positive,the jamba juice natural energy drink in the crisp apple flavor is very tasty the flavor reminds me apple cider i like it a lot and will purchase it if i can find it stores which i have not been able to in my area hopefully it will arrive soon 4 stars,52,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,5.0,positive,i know that a lot of people are enamored with energy drinks these days I am not one of them most of the energy drinks out there might as well be battery acid for the flavor and I am not sure why anyone would drink one save for the fact that it provides a boost through copious amounts of sugar and/or caffeine and/or taurine and more etc however jambas entry of crisp apple is quite delicious and refreshing even as a simple beverage I am not normally inclined to drink energy drinks but i could easily see drinking something like this on an a regular basis i highly recomend this,106,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,5.0,positive,jamba crisp apple is aptly named the slender 84 oz 248 ml can has 90 calories 20 g of sugar and 80 mg caffeine there are 22 total carbs with 80 mg of caffeine it has a little pick me up it is best served chilled the flavor is good but has a slight aftertaste which is not wholly unpleasant maybe the aftertaste is the stevia it is carbonated and not too sweet it is 70 juice i shared a can with my husband his comments were sour but sweet he asked if it was diet i told him about the stevia and he said that was probably the taste he was noticing overall i like it it is the type of drink i might get at a sandwich shop more than purchasing a case,134,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004K00DGC,5.0,positive,this is the second flavor i have had of the jamba juice energy drink line i like this one even more than the last if you like apple you will like this product it is full of flavor and tastes great it is not gritty or over carbonated like a lot of energy drinks it tastes natural and delicious,57,17
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,1.0,negative,i was hopeful this would work in my keurig k-cup reusable filter it did not i had coffee and coffee grounds everywhere now i have yet another batch of coffee i can not use i do not even know how it tastes i did not want to clean up the mess so i did not try to make a 2nd cup,56,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,the sumatra coffee is my favorite of the ekojava blends [ I have tried french roast and honduras house ] it has a nice bold flavor and the packet size is great for the re-usable k-cups [ solofill or my k-cup type ] I shall purchase again,41,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,i found the grind too fine for my solo refillable / reusable cup it clogs the mesh and only brews about 1/3 of a cup when i use a regular k cup disposable it brews a full cup also if i use my solo refillable with regular grind maxwell house for example it brews a full cup so i can not use my ekojava except tearing open several and putting in my regular coffee make not happy ekojava sumatra single serve coffee for solofill cup 25-count solofill cup refillable k-cup for keurig k-cup brewers,94,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,it is so hard to find a quality grade one single origin coffee i got the product and immediately tried it the flavor was incredible and the stick packs were nice but i hope they will come out with a bulk not in stick packs pre-ground coffee option in the near future other than that i could not be more impressed or pleased with the product,65,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,very good coffee i like bold strong coffee and this very nearly fills the bill i brew 12-ounce cups and it is good 10 or 8-ounce cups even better for my taste no mess nice canister good coffee the price is decent when it is on sale for 10 i think the list price is too steep i brew it in a solo cup with an ez filter less mess less waste of water i do not like the amount of water i waste rinsing away coffee grounds I had like to see them come up with a stronger blend a variety pack and a refill option to cut down on price and packaging even more,112,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,great product good tase and convienent to use however using the eco basket is cheaper and use your own coffee,20,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,sorry to say this but i found the ekojava single serve coffee to be too bitter for my taste i used the single-serve canister in our keureg but after two cups i gave up,35,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,i ordered this along with the french roast the taste is off as someone else stated brewed using the ecobrew with my keurig and had sludge at the bottom of the cup gave it a 2 instead of a 1 due to packaging guess I shall stick to my current brand,50,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,my review is impacted by the use of this coffee and brew method not on the sole quality of the taste we bought two ekobrew baskets a can of the sumatran and one of the honduran when the sumatran refused to brew a full cup we contacted the company received a nice email that explained the grind was pre ekobrew and they admit to it not working well with their single serve basket that being said they apologized and suggested for us to use less coffee with a smaller cup setting as well as offering us a refund for the inconvenience so I am not sure if the taste is fantastic enough for more than two stars since i can not brew a proper cup with their own product i gave them an extra star for customer service,138,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,coffee is a good medium roast however i am about halfway through the canister and have run across a couple of packages that had a much smaller amount of coffee in them,32,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,1.0,negative,i ordered this to go with the new plastic solo k-cups i will never drink it and will probably throw it away,22,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,mighty great coffee awesome one day sale pricing and cool old fashion packaging one problem liked to never of broken into the goods that top was really glued on not good for old farts with bad hands a rusty knife may work but i sure do not want to cut some precious coffee packets some kind of pull string like on those old dog food bags or a ductape seal would do the trick well shiver me timbers i just learned via another old fart that there is a secret passage into the ekojava coffee chest by golly there has a hidden perforation under the label no signs or maps about two inches down from the top that opens the goods real smart just run a fingernail around the perforation and twist the top right off who would of ever guessed now more java for me mates,145,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,i have tried 3 different blends of this coffee and think they are great i use the solofill but am thinking of buying ekobrew cup even with the solofill or ekobrew cup this is a good buy and your not putting all those kcups in the landfill,47,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,this is the perfect measuring of coffee for the keurig tastes great nice bold but not too strong coffee you can not beat the price,24,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B0057FSSCU,5.0,positive,this product is not for everyone it is high in fat and is perhaps a little too salty for many on a restricted diet for those of us who grew up in the south in the 40s through the 70s this was a staple at the breakfast table we did not have it everyday but when we did it was a treat the secret to making this sausage taste right is in how you prepare it first do not use a pan that will allow the sausage to stick use either a well seasoned cast iron skillet or a non-stick frying pan heat it until the sausage turns light brown and starts to stiffen basically cook most of the moisture out of it if you are going to scrambleinto the cooked sausage mix between 4 and six into the pan do not over stir theor they will be mealy or crumbly again the secret is too brown the sausage for the best taste lastly this sausage may not be meant for everyone,174,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B0057FSSCU,1.0,negative,while shipping was fast on this itemit is nowhere near being sausage in looks or taste i opened a can expecting sausage patties and to my surprise it was full of mush that looked like cat food and tasted nothing like sausage overall thisis a waste of money in my opinion even my dog refused to eat it,60,1

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005JGXETY,1.0,negative,the bags in this variety pack are not big grab bags as stated in the title the value of this product is far less than it would have been if these were actually the much larger big grab bags these small 1 oz bags can be purchased for 20 - 25 cents each at various warehouse clubs no bargain here,58,30

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,1.0,negative,pops broken and leaking clearly known by shipper since box was placed in a ziplok bag if you know it is going to break why spend a dollar on a ziplok bag instead of spending a dollar on real packing material that will result in a happy customer,47,2

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,2.0,negative,a little expensive for simplepops but my local grocery store only carries the pops with the exotic / adventurous flavors however after ordering these on two separate occasions they always arrive a mess with several pops open and leaking everywhere they get the job done but i do not think the price and damage are worth it,56,17

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,1.0,negative,it is always amusing to see things like this so far out there you have to question yourself for reading it wrong but if they sell them at that price,28,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,1.0,negative,some freeze pops broke and wet other items in the package on a positive note i got a refund from amazon one thing you can count on is that amazon comes through when you have a complaint,37,20
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,2.0,negative,these are amazingly overpriced they are very good a bit small but way way overpriced here order the exact same thing from walmart for 3,25,21
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,2.0,negative,my daughter loves this type of frozen treat we ordered this 100 count box expecting them to be larger these freezer pops are actually half the size of the freezer pops that we are used to buying in the grocery stores dissappointed with this purchase,45,22

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,4.0,positive,i bought these while i was deployed it was a great treat after working out in the hot sun dinged one star because the flavor was weaker in comparison to other pops I have had before but it was a great value,41,25
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B005LURDB8,5.0,positive,when i was a kid this is the summer tradition we could not keep them in stock at my grandparents house now that i have young children we have blown through several boxes of these this past summer I shall admit that i ate about 75 of them but when you are a parent of 4 kids under 8 years of age you can tell them they can only have one,69,26

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,4.0,positive,i was a little surprised by some of the really harsh reviews I have seen so far as well as some of the claims they do not fit the nespresso machine i have the delonghi latissima the older one not the new square one released last year and while it takes a little bit more force to close the door compatibility has not been a problem it is hard for me to imagine it fits one machine and not the others as for the coffee it is ok does not compete with that amazing vanilla seasonal variation nespresso released this past year but it is not as bad as the cherry variation either it is definitely not as strong as the ristretto or the appreggio but has much more flavor then the cosi and some other the other weaker blends i would most compare it to one of the new lungo blends taken as a short pour instead of the lung pour i have found them adequate to make my daily cappuccinos and honestly worth saving 30 per capsule against nespresso i will buy more,178,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,5.0,positive,this is the second ecc product i have reviewed out of the two i liked this the best and felt it was really similar to the nespresso i have been drinking for awhile i think it is a milder version but i prefer that for this flavor i have had this flavor three days in a row and i seem to be a little less jittery compared to the nespresso version i would give this flavor a try and judge for yourself but i do think it is a good product with a good story,95,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,5.0,positive,i received the espresso capsules and i love the fact that they are biodegradable the espresso tastes great great purchase,20,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,4.0,positive,i have tried the cremoso and the espressivo and love them both great for a quick pick me up in the morning and early afternoon the taste is perfect for me I am not one to love extremely bitter espressos and this has just the right amount of humph another great thing i do with them when it is hot out and where i from it gets extremely hot is pour the espresso in a glass with some almond milk and lots ofso refreshing bonus is that the capsules are biodegradable one should always go that route when deciding what to buy,105,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,5.0,positive,my office recently bought a delonghi espresso machine along with many varieties of espresso capsules to try out i was very excited as my love and pickiness of coffee and espresso has gone back many years since my first trip to france my definite favorite is the cremoso from ethical coffee company my mid-afternoon treat has quickly become a cremoso double latte the aroma and the taste are wonderful and it is the perfect pick-me-up to get through the rest of my day i have ordered a box of cremoso to have at my desk as my own personal stash my co-workers like several of the other varieties of ethical coffee but my hands-down favorite is cremoso an added bonus is that ethical coffee company the name says it all does not it makes their capsules envinronmentally-friendly and biodegradable i have been concerned about the millions of plastic capsules that are mounting up in our landfills i will always support a company that combines great quality with integrity and ethical coffee company seems to be the only company in the coffee genre that does,183,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,i really liked theof a cheaper capsule than nespresso offer with free shipping via amazon prime also i thought that the other reviewers were just being a bit sensitive after all coffee is coffee right uhhhh no i really should have listened to the other reviewers yes it is cheaper and yes it worked just fine in my machine and gave a fine crema but no i would never buy this again it tasted like a very weak watered down version of the real thing i guess you get what you pay for save yourself the money buy the real nespresso capsules and do not get stuck with 50 capsules of coffee that you are not going to drink yuck and can not return oh well lesson learnt,128,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,these capsules do not fit the delonghi nespresso machines the company indicated that they do not make a coversion kit either,21,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,5.0,positive,hi does anyone know if these espresso pods work with a keuric sp machine or just the nespresso device figured i could buy them to use at work these guys drink so much coffee they probably would not notice how they tasted thanks i appreciate any help i can get do not want to deal with the hassle of returning if they do not work in our machine,65,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,4.0,positive,new update well as it turns out the ethical coffee company has came through they contacted me about the problem i had and have replaced my machine so they do stand behind their word and will honor their guarantee it took a few weeks but they did what they said they would therefore i will continue to use their products,60,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,5.0,positive,delicious espresso i was hesitant based on some of these reviews but had to give it a try no problems with the capsules fitting i am using a gran maestria there is a little popping sound as described by ecc but in my machine it is quite faint no problems closing you have to give it a more firm push than the nespresso capsules the flavor is rich and substantial enough for use in a latte or cap i have tried it as an americano as well and it works for me at this price what has not to like enjoy,100,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,2.0,negative,i bought all five of the different types of ethical coffee capsules made for nespresso machines unfortunately 1 coffee flavor-marginal-not great 2 quantity of coffee-less in capsule than in nespresso capsule 3 we have a brand new nespresso pixie these capsules continue to get jammed in the machine and we have to reach in struggle with the capsule to pry it loose before we can make another coffee 4 since 10 capsules are packaged in one plastic sleeve the moment we open the sleeve air comes into contact with the remaining capsules minimizing their freshness bottom line is that the espresso coffee is not worth the lower cost to purchase these capsules,112,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,first off the pods jam in my brand new nespresso pixie it is easy enough to clear the jam but they should work without a screwdriver secondly the coffee is not very good as much as a like a lower priced option i have to suggest you stick with the authentic nespresso pods,51,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,2.0,negative,so as a espresso fan and a nespresso owner for the last few years i was excited when i heard about these capsules but after trying them i was not impressed if you just want coffee and do not like it strong and do not pay much attention to the flavor these should be fine if good flavor and strength matter do not buy these,62,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,i thought i would give these a try since the nespresso caps are so tasty hence we go thru them quickly thought i would try a knock off for half the price not worth it stick with the real thing or try another alternative because these are weak watery and yucky maybe if i was try to ween myself off a nespresso habit but i am not so i do not enjoy them at all i tried the 3 strongest options and they were all week had to do short pulls and a 31 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap the shipping and service was great just not the product plus to add insult they dropped the price from 25 a box down to 10 at 10 try them yourself and you can taste disappointing brown water too,143,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,2.0,negative,when i bought these they worked out to about half the price of nespresso pods i thought it was a great deal until i tasted the first shot this particular variety at least is very weak i ended up using two pods per shot and it still is not as strong nor full flavored like genuine nespresso pods even something mild like a 3 or 4 intensity my wife said they tasted like plastic and would not even drink them also i had some trouble with them jamming in the machine but learned to just eject them immediately after it was done this was with a pixie machine in short do not waste your money,112,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,2.0,negative,I am not exactly an espresso connoisseur so i have a hard time telling a huge difference between these capsules and the nespresso ones in drinks like lattes unfortunately for less diluted drinks the weaker flavor in these capsules was pretty obvious they are not so much weaker that they are undrinkable but they are definitely have less flavor at the previous price of 25 cents / capsule these were an awesome choice for lattes / cappuccinos but for 50 cents / capsule I shall just stick with the nespresso capsules,80,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,i am not a coffee snob but this is clearly not espresso either i have a almost new citiz i used to prepare the drink half way through the brewing process the coffee is coming out light brown the coffee tasted like diluted weak coffee with no body or espresso aroma there was no crema either i tried it again with new capsules to make sure that the first one was not a defective capsule same result amazon does not accept return for this,84,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,4.0,positive,ok so this is not nespresso swiss coffee it is however very drinkable and smooth and a perfect antidote to those sky high nespresso capsule prices hello nespresso are you listening i am eagerly waiting for starbucks to come out with their espresso capsule machine later this year it is going to be a category killer but until then I shall mix this coffee in sometimes after dinner and be none the worse for it thanks ethical coffee,77,17
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,1.0,negative,what attracted me was the savings over nespresso capsules i so wanted to like these but the extraction is inadequate and espresso is weak and not as nuanced as most nespresso varieties since i paid 25 for the 5 boxes of 10 each the price has dropped precipitously now under 15 i can only believe that despite the pretty package and the eco-friendly claims nespresso users will pay a significant price premium to get the consistenly good if not great no mess aspects of using nespresso capsules i am reluctant to try other flavors after my experience with cremoso,97,18
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006DQZ04Q,2.0,negative,i use nespresso roma and my wife uses nespresso ristretto we bought cremosa and espressivo as possible substitutes because lower per-capsule price free shipping with my amazon prime and i do not have to use the outpresso to recycle but we do not like the coffee others may prefer it I am sure but it is not for us too weak and we do not like the flavor the cremosa is especially watery versus nespresso I am cheap and maybe not as picky so i will use them up over time but after trying both cremosa and espressivo my wife will have none of it one of lifes little pleasures especially for her is good coffee and these are no substitute,115,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,i did like the taste of this bar but i thought from the description of the bar that was given that it was going to have more of a crunch to it it was too chewy i wanted it more crunchy other than that it was ok,47,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,ordered these cos i love the cashew ones and i love coffee they are pretty good love that they are not too sweet all the protein energy bars i have tried are sickly sweet which is really off putting not sure how good they are for you but they meake you feel really full for a while will buy again,60,1

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,i did not like the flavor I had recommend the peanut butter chocolate chip flavor over this the batch i got tasted old and flavorless,23,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,larabars are the perfect little snack tastes like a treat but made from real food i always keep a box on hand so i can grab one before leaving the house so if hunger strikes between meals i have something on hand to help beat temptation,46,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,1.0,negative,i must have misread the label i did not realize it said labrador because what came inside tastes like it came out from one of their rear ends these need to be buried in the backyard and someone needs to be called a bad dog,44,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,delicious nutritious and a hint of cappuccino which goes splendidly with my morning cup of coffee,16,7

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,i love these it is a delicious and healthy afternoon snack that satisfies my sweet tooth,15,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,i love larabars every flavor except this one usually larabar will amaze me with how accurately they can make flavors like blueberry muffin mint chip brownie pineapple upside down cake and more but they missed the mark on this cappuccino one not so great,43,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,i love larabars with a passion but unfortunately this was not a flavor that i really enjoyed i love coffee so i was surprised that i actually disliked it i think i wanted something a little sweeter and this bar to me just kind of tastes like plain black coffee i still love larabars but I shall be sticking to other flavors,60,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,qualitybut not my favorite flavor coffee is too strong for me but husband likes,16,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,quite good not my favorite larabar flavor but that is only because there are so many fabulous ones to choose from this one has the flavor of black coffee mixed with the sweetness of the dates very good but kinda like if you take a sip of coffee without cream when you were expecting cream but really is quite good maybe 4 1/2 stars would be a more accurate rating for me,72,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,it is ok a good strong coffe flavor only for he coffe lovers,11,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,1.0,negative,we love larabars but this cappuccino flavor is absolutely terrible it literally tastes like you are eating coffee grinds we have an entire box that we are throwing in the trash because they are so bad stick to the other flavors which are excellent,43,17

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,not my favorite flavor for larabars but it is good and simple nice snack,13,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,as far as larabars go these were pretty terrible the flavor was not awful but the coffee grounds in my mouth were my husband and i each had 1 and now we are looking to give away the other 14 stick with the fruit flavors,43,20
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,was not terrible tasting would be better with chocolate mixed in,10,21

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,i do not like to drink coffee often because of all of the added ingredients that i do not like to consume via beverages but i do love the flavor of coffee as a nutritionist and vegan i tend to stay away from processed sugars and dairy products so this bar is perfect for me the stores near me do not have this flavor so i decided to order online which was surprisingly inexpensive i will say that if you do not like dates this may not be for you because i have friends who do not like dates and they can taste it right away also they say it is not as sweet as they would like it to be but i personally would not want it any sweeter however i am biased in that i have grown accustomed to healthy and not-so-tasty to the average person things,144,31
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,1.0,negative,these were pretty gross tasted like week old coffee mixed with nuts not exactly sure what i expected but these for us at least were unedible going back to my other flavors,32,32
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,unlike many of the other great bars this one is dry crumbly and has an after taste that i found very unpleasant i eat many larabars each month this is by far the least favorite of them all imho,39,33
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,4.0,positive,filling does seem to energize taste is so-so,8,34
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,1.0,negative,the cappucino flavor tastes weird can not decribe the weirdness almost takes chemically although the bar contains no chemicals i bought 5 boxes of larabars and the cappuccino flavor is the last box still sitting in my refrigerator,36,35
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,5.0,positive,for me a coffee flavor lover i love these bars more than any of their other flavors also love the non gmo gluten soy dairy free they taste really good,30,36

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,maybe these are good for some people but i find the combination of the flavor and texture to be not at all to my liking i was really prepared to like these and find them quite disappointing the packaging says gluten free in line with the latest nutritional fad and perhaps some gluten would have helped them i shall not be buying them again,64,41
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007C6EJ2K,2.0,negative,i like larabars but this was my least favorite flavor out of the 8 or 10 I have tried so far it is a bit sour if that makes sense i actually love cappuccinos and coffee flavored most things but i would not order this again,43,42

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,2.0,negative,barely ok these disks do not supply very much creamer and it is very thin on the plus side they do produce a hot milk that does not cool the coffee maybe that is all they are intended to do,40,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,4.0,positive,these are 1/2 size discs not the normal larger taller that i am use to here in the us i have to use to for a latte good deal from the seller but took more than a month to get here,41,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,4.0,positive,this creamer is better than the ones that come with the latte / cappuccino packs the tubs are half the size and still froth but the barcode does not cause as much water to mix with the creamer so the drink is not as watered down i would have given 5 stars but the box was not thick enough for traveling overseas and was smushed on one side thankfully no pods were damaged although,69,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,1.0,negative,the discs i received were not as pictured that is not the better milk discs from europe but instead they were regular milk discs with united states labeling not only did they send me a product different from what was pictured but the milk discs they did send me were defective or something they caused my tassimo machine to make terrible noises and the steam pressure kept building with nothing coming out seems dangerous to me so i turned the machine off and waited for it to cool down before opening after reading reviews elsewhere apparently this is a known problem yet tassimo is apparently still selling the defective discs unbelievable,107,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,1.0,negative,these creamers are terrible they would not even work in my machine all i got was a loud terrible noise and a lot of steam the disc may have ruined my tassimo machine i can not get it to make regular coffee again I am filing a complaint,45,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,2.0,negative,i love this brand of coffee and creamers but it is been over 7 weeks i have not yet received it little disappointed,21,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,4.0,positive,different than frothing your own milk works in a pinch,10,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,1.0,negative,i do not know why tassimo changed this product i loved the old version but this one is terrible this is more like a dash of cream with a tiny bit of foam on top,34,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,5.0,positive,i should have looked at the delivery time my fault,9,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,1.0,negative,not good the very first version of tassimo creamer was the best,12,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,2.0,negative,they do not seem to have an aftertaste as some others i find that they are very small and did not foam very much a bit watery,27,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,5.0,positive,not as rich as the cappuccino or latte discs but it works if you want a warm splash of milk in your coffee i use it on exceptionally cool days otherwise splashing some whole milk on top of my coffee seems to provide the same flavor,46,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,1.0,negative,every one of these pods will not work in machine bad batch,12,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,5.0,positive,helps to make a great latte the milk discs taste great i also use them to make hot chocolate for my child,22,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007GIBOTK,5.0,positive,these are the best creamers they do dispense much less than the standard us ones however it is much better quality and richer and creamier i typically use two yes that makes the latte more expensive but it also tastes like a professional latte i do agree with another post i saw on shipping container it is very thin so my boxes were a little smashed as well but not the pods since it is an overseas shipment they should focus on better packaging mine did not take long to arrive and i have ordered 3 times,97,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,first impression stila sounds more like a medicine name than the name of a cookie bar the taste was fair at first not enough fruit filling and then a strange after taste probably from the sorbitol sugar substitute sorbitol is not an ingredient that i prefer in my foods as it does have some side effects sorbitol can be used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema as with other sugar alcohols gastrointestinal distress may result when food products that contain sorbitol are consumed sorbitol exerts it is laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine thereby stimulating bowel movements[3 ] sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly although it is not recommended without consultation with a clinician the crust or cookie portion is very dry and crisp to the point of being difficult to eat without creating a mess the moniker cookie bar is a bit misleading as my resident expert on cookies my 4 1/2 year old grandson tried one bite and promptly gave the stila bar back to me exclaiming that it was yucky there are better treats out there in this calorie range so i would not recommend this,199,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised at how these 100 calorie bars tasted I have tried a lot of whole grain cardboard tasting health snacks and these are some of the first that had good taste and low calories while not making me feel i was eating something mixed with sawdust the berry filling is fine no complaints but what really sets this apart is the crunch you get when biting into it I am tired of eating oat bars that are soft or that have to have 300 calories of chocolate or sugar to get you to eat it this bar has neither but still tastes pretty good recommended,106,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,the photo of this product is soooo enticing after i took a bite i read the ingredients list ouch instead of healthy organic ingredients there has a laundry list of commercial foodstuffs of questionable origin please keep in mind that i am a food purist someone else might find this product delicious,51,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,hmmmm as a child i grew up eating flat bread raisin cookies that sunshine bakery use to make they were very different from anything else on the market at that time i loved them they were chewey and low fat at that point in time low fat was never an issue they were not low calorie anyway i use to get them as a special treat unfortunately they disappeared from the market place recently i found these they were like the ones i had way back in the 1960s i was delighted to find them in blueberry which is something i love they have a texture more like an oat cracker with a bit of fruit jam on them very nice combination from the other reviews i believe folks today are very use to softer cookie bars if you like jam and hearty crackers you will like these just do not expect a cookie bar these are lighter the other varieties are good too,164,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,when i tried my first bar i threw most of it away my first thought was that it tasted like and felt like card board crispy is an understatment these things are crunchy on the outside with a semi soft middle now that i have had a few days to adjust to the texture i can say that they are not bad tasting in fact they have very little flavor period there is a light spread of filling in the middle which is the only thing that gives the bar flavor and by light spread i mean that the bar is actually hollow with some filling spread on the inside overall it is not a bad light snack i will finish off the box that i bought but i do not think i will be buying any more for the additional 20 calories and a dollar less in cost i will stick to the much better tasting nutrigrain bars from here on out,163,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,i really love these little cookie bars mine were better then yours i bought them at the 99 cent store,20,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,i do not tend to like these kinds of products but I am always looking for something that is a quick and easy breakfast on the run for me and my kids this particular product does not stand out in any way it does not taste better than the other types of products that it mimics it does not feel like I am eating real oats or strawberries it is a lot like a pop-tart to me ick the ingredients do not seem to be particularly nutritious either what has the point my kids ate them but did not ask me to buy more which means they were not blown away either I am going to stick with real granola bars instead at least they taste like oats,117,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,chinese newspaper must be the main ingredient terrible buy 1 get one free never tasted so bad i hope their product development team wait that is a threat 1 star is overstated,30,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,the quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar was not what i expected at all it has a crispy outside and strawberry filling on the inside there was not much filling on the inside and had kind of a grainy taste the outside was too crispy for my taste it was so crispy i could not break it in half with my hands,61,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,the quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar was not what i expected at all it has a crispy outside and blueberry filling on the inside there was not much filling on the inside and had kind of a grainy taste the outside was too crispy for my taste it was so crispy i could not break it in half with my hands,61,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,these cookie bars were delightful a great combination of chewy sweetness and oatsy crisp nicely balanced between dry and mushy and a good size for a quick pick-me-up when i get tired of yogurt for my work lunch pack I shall keep these in mind for something new,47,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,the quaker stila blueberry cookie bars are quite tasty as a snack they are of snack size 100 calories per bar very little fat and sugar yet are satisfying easy to carry and something a little different for those who are trying to eat consciously a good product,48,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,i love cereal bars i really really do but the nutrigrain which has been the staple for the world is just too most special ks cereal crisps are okay but a little too crisp where has the middle ground right here these oat cookies are the perfect blend of crisp oaty and moist to satisfy the most discerning connosieur what i loved the most although is that the blueberry flavor is not overpowering obviously there has some artificiality to it but the blueberry is not too much nor too little makes a great snack or lunch compliment,95,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,i do not really understand this product or why I had want to eat it for one thing the texture is very cardboard like it is thin like the old school ipod nanos and tastes like eating a thin slice of dry bread with a meager amount of jam so flavor wise it definitely did not win me over nutritionally meh sure it is low-calorie and it does have oats in it but i do not think there are enough oats to make it more worthwhile than just eating some oatmeal or a cup of muesli or some other sort of healthy cereal with a comparable calorie hit although I am only halfway through the box I am not sure how I am going to finish it to be honest that is how much i dislike these bars i considered giving it 2 stars but when i realized that i dread having to eat the rest i figured that warranted just 1 star,152,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,these stilia bars are wonderful they taste great are only 100 calories and my whole family loved them especially the rabbits they are quite filling and the juxtoposition of a crunchy outside with a jam-like inside made for an excellent snack the only downside is that we have not been able to find these in our local supermarkets i will say that these are extremely fragile and that sometimes you will end up with some broken bars before you even open the wrapper does not make them taste any less awesome although,89,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these were good tasting and it was nice that they had a little more of the daily requirements for fiber however they were dry and really needed something to ease their passage down the throat perhaps if i have them with coffee or tea it would have been better next time,51,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,it is the standard complaint i do not want to eat healthier because the healthier food does not taste as good these bars are a welcome change to that complaint very tasty and crave-satisfying texture provide a sensible alternative to the normal snack fare reasonably priced and worth every cent how they got all that crispiness into such a little bar is a puzzler just glad they did,69,16
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,these cookie bars are bland and have virtually no taste i love oats but i can barely taste any oats with these and the fruit filling is almost nonexistent save your money,32,17
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,title kind of says it all these are really good and tasty a bit different than other snack bars crispy outside with a bit of fruit in the center just right for a small in-between snack love it with coffee could perhaps have a bit more fruit filling but that is picky they are very fresh-tasting and satisfying especially for 100 calories,61,18
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,love the 100 calorie snacks usually i was really expecting to bite into this and it to have a nice soft fruity center i was sorely disappointed the inside has a texture like a fruit roll-up hard chewy difficult to bite it tasted like the fruit was overly dried out it was not pleasant the outside cookie part was rather dry too i think if the inside had been something similar to a nutri-grain bar or something it would taste a lot better overall the thing is just too stiff and too dry the flavor part is there but when something is that dry you are still not going to want to eat it,113,19
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly if you factor in the weight to calorie ratio they are about the same ratio wise to nature valley bars the amazon or quaker description says 55 ozs however each bar is only 091 ozs the whole package of 6 weigh 55 oz but i did give them 4 stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry one would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious,82,20
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,i liked these cookie bars because they were crispy and i was able to carry them in my backpack without out turning into a crumbed mess like some other nutrition bars the strawberry filling was tasty and hit the spot if i had to complain about something i did not enjoy was the sugar content and the oat flakes that came off and sprinkled onto my lap when i opened it but still an enjoyable treat,75,21
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these quaker stila crispy oat bars are delicious the perfect cross between a cookie and your traditional nutri grain style granola bar they are a great snack we have been watching our diets recently and these seem to be a better choice than many other granola bars with only 100 calories about 30 less than what we normally eat and they do not seem any less filling,65,22
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,I have eaten nutri-grain bars on and off for a while usually because I am lazy and do not like to cook in the morning these are a little better than the nutri-grain bars if only because they are crunchy the chewiness of the nutri-grain bars makes them seem even more bland than they usually are whereas with the stila bars the crunchiness livens it up a little making it almost seem like you are eating a pastry instead of something good for you so as long as it is competitively priced I had recommend it that is all,92,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,my mother-in-law bought this to make coffee for visitors it worked fine at first but after one or two months of use started to experience water leaks of increasing severity at first there were drips outside of the carafe then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints we put the whole machine on a metal tray to make clean-up easier finally it got so bad that fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock we stopped using it in the end i was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket it is a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug i then inserted a filter coffee and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle while this sounds ridiculous it is a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine my recommendation avoid this machine it is disturbing that black and decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality,194,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,when i first bought this 5-cup coffee maker i was so thrilled i purchased 2 more as gifts it is just 6 months later and all 3 of us are experiencing hot water and some coffee liquid falling outside the carafe I am disappointed in this brand which i trusted looking more closely inside the poor design which houses the filter holder is the issue i will not be buying another b d again,70,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,this is a great little coffee maker and does a better job overall than my old 12 cup braun coffee maker ever did makes good coffee and the warming plate keeps it warm actually hot i had been looking around for a small coffee maker and on a recent trip to walmart i saw this on the display shelf with the other coffee makers it seemed to be a bit sturdier and better-quality than the competing mr coffee 4 - 5 cup of course there seemed to be a zillion of those in stock but i could not find a single one of the b d smartbrew on the shelf i almost gave up until i went 2 aisles over and lo and behold way up on the top shelf there was one smartbrew left after looking around for half hour for a sales person to get it down off the shelf i finally found someone the best part is it cost less than the mr coffee if you are looking for a small coffee maker this is a great choice and no offense to amazon but i paid much less at walmart let us just say it cost me slightly under 1000 for mine o,202,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,while true it does not drip like others when pouring coffee but nothing else about it is up to par first it does not use a gold-tone filter basket or will one fit the standard filters i got were a bit too big okay those are things that are livable but it took very long to make a pot of coffee compared to my other 4 cup makers I have had last the coffee it made was not very good i would say continue looking,82,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this pot does all i expected and more so it fits my condo kitchen well i would well recommond this product esp because it a black and deckerthey always seem to last a long time without failure,39,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,let me say that this is my third black and decker coffee maker i have hadthere is no way possible to pour a cup of coffee without pouring it all over the placei have never seen this much leakagevery unsatisfactorythank you ps otherwise coffee maker is ok,47,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,my elderly father uses this coffee pot and likes it as it is good for just one person the lid is better quality than most other 4 cup coffee makers and the container can hold up to 6 cups which is like 2 mugs the on / off button stuck in the beginning but is working fine now we had previously bought a 4 cup but it was too small my father thinks this one is great as he has parkinsons and is limited on his strength,85,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,prefer my coffee brewed fresh this is the perfect size for one or two mugs having no auto timer is a definite plus since I am not into bells and whistles,30,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this product is very nice considering the fact that I am in iraq it is a slow dripper but it gets the job done,22,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,i needed a quick coffee maker and picked up this model at local hardware store and paid a premium little did i know the pot drips no matter how we angle the pot while pouring a mess occurs we can not make the right amount of coffee if we pour 5 cups of water in tank and fill up to line we get about 3 cups of coffee what has up with that so we never know how much coffee to use what a mess never again,80,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,easy to use easy to clean makes a great cup of coffee in a very reasonable amount of time also the coffee is hot not just oneabove warm which is really nice if you add milk or cream because it does not cool off too much also nice is the feature on the glass carafe that shows not only how many cups are in the carafe but also where to fill to get that many cups they are not the same i definetly would purchase again for myself or as a gift,93,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,i bought this when i was single in a tiny studio apartment and needed to save space and make small batches of coffee I have had it for over 10 years without complaint 10 years yeah it may be slow but it is cheap and small and easy to use 10 years,50,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,this is one of the worst products that i have ever purchased the pot leaks whenever you pour if it were not for the fact that i have thrown away the box i would return it in a newyork minute,40,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,while the price is right it brews a quick cup of joe and it is has a little more capacity than most 4-cup machines that is about where the good news ends my machines heating element just crapped out after 5 months of use it is under warranty but i am just going out to buy a different brand i find this unit is messy the caraffe does not pour as well as the mr coffee i had for 3 years it is ok if you pour very slowly but if you are a little too fast you will get liquid on the counter while brewing the lid is flimsy enough that it pushes up enough to release a lot of steam which over time will ruin the finish on your cabinets i also notice that if the warmer plate is left on more than about an hour my countertop becomes extremely warm i believe the bottom of the unit lacks sufficient height for proper air circulation rather than wreck your kitchen or burn the house down buy another product,173,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this inexpensive coffeemaker performs very well it is easy to fill and the glass flask pours without spilling my only quarrel is that the off / on switch is not very pretty and glows red rather than green when it is on,39,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,my parents have this coffee maker and every time I am at their house for a few days i have to use this very slow machine to make what amounts to a weak cup of coffee which i then have to proceed to forgive me coffee gods nuke for 10 seconds in order to get it hot enough of course if you like your coffee not much hotter than room temperature this may be the perfect coffee maker for you but keep in mind that the trade-off for this convenience is a very inefficient coffee maker that is warm water extracts far less coffee flavor than very hot water and on account of this you need to use far more beans to make a cup of coffee with this machine overall this is a poor coffee maker that is slow inefficient and makes cold coffee,144,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,just the right size for 2 people 4 cups not quite enough 5 cups just right with this pot however and my previous one when you pour always some dripping onto the counter because the lip of the pot is not deep enough i guess otherwise b d seems to be the only company making a 5-cup pot which i appreciate,60,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,i bought this product to replace one that had broken that i really liked i had to return this product three times because it does not as it says in the description come with the perfect pour carafe which is what i wanted since the standard carafe drips everywhere on the third time of returning it i asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size i then mentioned to amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description but they have not,98,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,with the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us we like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing but you must use their carafe with this maker you can use your own mug and if the carafe breaks and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes you can still use the maker with the mug or other container i sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher sure this maker is not fancy but i just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that does not take up lots of counter space i have not had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker,149,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,the carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good no matter how careful or how i adjust my grip water / coffee leaks from the top and down the side i have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter,44,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,after 6 months of use the led switch popped out of the coffeemakers base which turned the wired plug into an on / off device i found that black and decker no longer services these products and the firm that does does not respond to e-mail,43,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,the pineapple cutter does not work at all it is not powerful enough to cut through a regular pineapple without exerting extraordinary force and that makes the fruit mushy i would return the product to the purchaser if not for the hassle and expense of the return itself do not bother with this product it is a complete waste of money,59,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it does what it says it does it is not to tough although it deforms when being pushed through the pineapple causing a oval shape design thereby wasting some of the sweet tender meat,34,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought this because i love fresh pineapples and i thought this might be a goodwrong this thing has a very small cutting circle and waste a good portion of the fruit worse yet it wastes the good tasting part of the pineapple after using it once i reverted back to manual peeling it costed me 10 and a good tasty portion of a pineapple for this experiment,70,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,this tool sounded like a goodbefore i got it however there really needs to be some direction on how specifically to use it i tried to just cut off the top and push this tool down to core the pineapple did not work i then cut off the outer layer of skin and used it but it mangled the fruit i really do not recommend it,69,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,thiswas easy once i got the hang of it it saves time and money be patient and it will work,22,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,this sort of looked flimsy in the product pictures but it is actually very sturdy the blades are very stiff and sharp and the bars that they are mounted to are very heavy-duty squared aluminum it hardly flexes at all so do not be fooled by the pictures it also makes getting the meat of the pineapple much easier i just cut off the top use this tool and then slice off thin pieces of the bottom until i get past thecore it works very well and gives on big chunk of cored pineapple,95,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,good product a little tough on smaller poineapples but great to skin and core and slice to desired thickness,19,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the first thing to note is that this does not slice a continuous spiral as some pineapple slicers do it cores and removes the husk resulting in one solid piece which is then perfect for slicing into rings or cutting into chunks i find the solid piece much easier to work with than the continuous spiral this corer will squeeze out some juice so you want the pineapple to be just ripe not over-ripe although it squeezes out much less juice than the plastic spiral kind the corer is made of sturdy metal which is dishwasher safe to use slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple stand upright position the corer in the center and turn clockwise while pushing down the serrated teeth are quite effective at slicing down into the pineapple but it is still easier with two people one to hold the husk with two hands and one to turn the gadget if you are looking to cut the result into rings or chunks this is the one i would recommend,174,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,core your pineapple with this handy device far better than the plastic models,13,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,cuts perfect and clean with ease saving on precut pineapples,10,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,i had one of these already and i wanted another one for a different location so that i did not have to transport that one back and forth works great,30,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it works but you kinda have to be strong to push it all the way through the pineapple,18,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works really nice runs rings around the plastic cutter / corer offerings out there the wife can now handle the pineapple coring chore much easier i would like to help but she says it is her kitchen and for me to keep out of there yes mam will do,47,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it would not cut through a ripe pineapple darn near broke my hand trying to get it through a waste of money,20,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the diameter is a little small and does not work in large pineapples needs a little more in diameter to make it perfect or they should sell 2 sizes,29,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,in theory this thing is great but in practice it is worthless squeezes out all the juices and you are left with pineapple that does not taste good,26,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,i m sure alton brown would not like this since it is a unitasker but it does the job it is better for medium sized pineapples as it is rather small so it loses some meat on big ones,34,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works great used as recommended without any problems saves time makes it quick and easy easy to clean does not rust,21,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,it works great once you know how to use it cut off the top of the pineapple position the saw on top turn the saw counter-clockwise i first tried turning it clockwise and that did not work take my advice this is a great product it will last for many many years to come,53,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it does not work well at all i have put it in the cupboard because i can not get it to cut the pineapple,22,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought thisfor my store to quickly core pineapples for customers who ask for it and it bent pretty badly on the very first use it is not made from a very strong medal and i certainly would not recommend purchasing this,42,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,this product just does not work very well by the time it gets to the bottom of the pineapple it is no longer round i was oddly shaped and blow out the side of the pineapple a little the instructions say to twist it as you press down but that does not really work it has two metal supports that make it hard to twist it just did not work very well at all,74,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,i used the pineapple prince pineapple cutter and corer once and wil not use it again it is sturdy but it is a very poor design first the instructions tell you to turn the cutter in a clockwise direction however the serrations on the cutting blades point to the right meaning the tool needs to be turned in a counter-clockwise direction to cut properly second the vertical aluminum parts that form the handle are about 1/8 thick and they are attached to the outside of the cutting blades which means they rip through the pineapple this results in a pineapple that is very difficult to slice this could have been easily avoided if the handle was attached to the inside of the cutting blades,124,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,i tried the equity by la crosse skyscan 31269 lcd atomic alarm clock and it was fine except the clock ran from battery only even although they give you an ac adapter the ac adapter is for the ceiling display only when you change the battery on the la crosse the clock and all settings are lost so i returned it and bought the smartset dual alarm am / fm clock radio the ceiling time can not shown right side up with the clock facing you this is like most other ceiling clocks so watch out the la crosse has the most advanced ceiling display as it can be twisted all 4 directions but can not be twisted enough to use the clock with the ceiling display right side up,127,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,how many times have you been awake at night and wanted to know what time it is the lacrosse skyscan lcd does a fine job of projecting the time on the cieling or wall it is not obtrusive and is not too bright although minor i would have liked a little more swivel capability with the unit,57,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,the clock worked as advertised and as the comments of others stated came quickly and set up easily directions are not great but can be used,26,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,for the money this is a great product the atomic part of this clock is excellent as you do not have to set it and the time is always correct,30,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,does not preform as advertised does not keep proper time and the alarm that we have never set will not stop going off i would not recommend purchasing michael piliaris,32,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,the clock will not set to eastern standard time i manually set it and it keeps reseting itself to central time the customer service on this product is horrible a person called during the day and left me no good info,41,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,i have several skyscans where i live we lose power all-too-frequently it works fine has no problem getting the sky signal we can not even use cell phones here and i especially like the ceiling time it projects the time onto the ceiling the only thing i had to get used to is the alarm setting mechanism the in-between setting does not set the alarm you have to slide it all the way and the alarm has an increasingly louder signal so you can not be slow at turning it off unless loud noises do not bother you in the am mine looks just like the picture it always has the right time and i do not have to mess with it what could be better,121,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,received as expected 2nd one we have purchased bought 1st for myself this one is a gift will buy again,20,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,great price for this clock but have read the instructions and set the clock and it always when wave happens sets itself for one hour behind the original time have taken out batteries and unplugged the clock and re-set many times to no avail,43,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,this is probably the best atomic projection clock if all you want is a time display function i have several of of this model it has a bright-enough projection display can do 24-hour format unlike oregon scientific models relatively easy to setup for an atomic clock and the most affordable as is with most digital clocks setting up the alarm is a hassle and i do not use it negative 1 the power-supply is only for the projection and all setting is lost when battery is changed the trick is to replace one battery at a time and quickly to retain the settings negative 2 when placed behind you say on a bed headboard the display can not be rotated enough for proper orientation while sleeping there is a plastic tab inside the projector that can be forced broken to override it,141,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,works exactly as described it actually got the signal from colorado very quickly once i realized i needed to turn on the wave buttons are easily hit accidentally which can because the clock to change to 24time or turn off the signal receiver,46,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,this clock will not keep the right time it keeps kicking back an hour i would not buy this product again I have had other la crosse items that I have really liked this one is no good,36,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,where to start no warranty no instructions would not set time automatically focus knob simply rotated did not focus without instructions is difficult to set up worth maybe 10 for the projection no more overall cheap cheap cheap poor example for lacrosse will avoid them from now on very disappointed,50,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,records will show I have boutht 3 of these clocks in last 6mo i gave them away as presents then my 88yr old moms says you can not see the time during the day unless you punch a button then time will stay on only for 5 seconds this was not refered to in details of clock when i bought them it may work during the night but why would anyone build a clock that you have to go to and punch a button to see time during day to say the least i can not tell you enough how not happy i and everyone on my gift list is with this piece of work geo,114,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with the clock it arrived quickly and was easy to set up we really like the time projection on the ceiling it helps at night,29,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,bought this to organize all our wrapping paper we have it hanging on the back of our bedroom door so we can not access the slots for storing bags not a design flaw just in the way we chose to use it if you hang the bag in the closet you will have access to the bag storage slots,58,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a superb organizer for storing gift wrap and ribbons packing tissue and tape by hanging this stuff in a closet i have freed up bureau space and eliminated the crushing of wrapping paper and gift cards my only criticism is that i wish it were bigger i bought a second organizer just to hold the christmas season themed stuff it is sturdy and i recommend it,67,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i buy way too much wrapping paper i think it is all the pretty colors so my house has been a mess of paper stacked in corners bags stuffed in the back of a closet and boxes of bows thankfully i found this product the organizer is super space-efficient you hang it in your closet and it takes about the same amount of space as a winter coat there are compartments for paper bows ribbon scissors tape bags and flat paper even completely full as mine is it is sturdy and holding up fine however it is not going to hold everything the description says up to 12 rolls but i was only able to fit 8 large size rolls of wrapping paper i still give it five stars although because who really needs more than 8 rolls of wrapping paper bottom line this product is so much better than the plastic organizers you can buy at stores like wal-mart or target i plan to buy some for family members as gifts this christmas,173,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the picture is very deceiving it is actually a lot smaller and can hardly hold anything it can maybe hold 3 roles of wrapping paper on each side and one or two bows in each little bag,37,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,amazing capacity very sturdy and good quality very happy with purchase,11,4

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,does the job but not as pictured or described cheap material much smaller way smaller than pictured even on the packaging not worth the money priced way too high for the size and quality,34,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love this holds so much and tamed my mess,9,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the large pockets on this organizer are all on one side so that when it is loaded up with wrapping paper it leans forward from the hanger and not straight up and down as pictured i bought two of these and put them back to back which helps somewhat but it does not balance out on it is own,58,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,yeah the jokari was on me what a bunch of garbage it did not have the strength to hold any tube wrapping,21,15

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this product is so cheaply made it would not even hold the wrapping paper without flopping over while hanging,23,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,product does not hold as much as described and is extremely small only good for half sized rolls of wrapping paper and super tiny bows and ribbons,27,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very cheaply made not sure how long it will last holds about 8 - 10 rooms of paper back pockets hold some gift bags and tissue paper front pockets were ok for small rolls of ribbon or small bows I shall keep it just because i do not want the headache of processing a return,52,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,please save yourself the time and money and do not bother small small small look again not worth it,19,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is great it is got many pockets and seems pretty solid however the ribbon compartments are not very sturdy so sometimes they fall out,25,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to hold my christmas wrapping paper and supplies and this did the job i was able to fit 6 or 7 fairly thick rolls of wrapping paper in it as well as all my tags tapes pens tissue paper and scissors,46,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,looks much roomier and better maid in the picture i kept it because it does soulve an immediate problem but i will be changing after the first of the year,30,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,cheaply made does not hold much does not appear like pictured,9,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,we ordered this to organize our wrapping supplies it feels a little flimsy and i hope it holds up it is hard to get the bows to stay in their designated boxes i also can not get some of my longer rolls of wrapping paper mostly from costco to fit overall i like it,53,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,so many large pockets no more digging for my gift wrapping supplies,11,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,happy i purchased this product i bought command strips to hang this on the back of my closet door i do wish the bags on the front were a bit bigger and had zippers on the tops instead of being open in the front otherwise I am satisfied since it gets the job done,53,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,when i read the description of this product i knew i needed to have it due to my love of always having gift wrap and all things related to gift giving this organizer hardly takes any room in my closet and keeps my gift wrap nice and tidy as to where it was everywhere before the pockets are very nice and forgiving with different items i keep my ribbon and tape in the pockets but can keep many things other than that for the price this is a great buy that i highly recommend for all the people who love to organize perfect for christmas time and all year round,110,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is the best i have a small apartment and this really helps me save on space and keeps things off my closet floor it is sturdy and has a lot more pockets than i realized awesome product,37,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ripped as soon as i opened it very very thin and poorly made returned,15,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,put it in and set it up in less that 5 min made out of decent material but i would not put more that 7 - 10 pounds in it if you are really into wrapping you should look for something more durable,39,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product is great for holding all of your birthday wrapping paper items i packed it full the hook still holds it everything an looks good,26,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this has been a life saver for closet organization i was able to fit 10 rolls of wrapping paper 5 each side multiple gift bags lots of tissue paper rolls of tape and even leftover favors in the many pockets,39,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,like it a lot does not use floor space in the closet and can hold quite a bit of different wrapping material,21,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,awful this does not even work do not waste your time or money,11,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,only fits smaller rolls of wrapping paper so not very practical for what it is intended to do,17,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,great organized for the money will probably purchase another one,10,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this thing i had a whole dresser full of ribbons bows cards gift bags and wrapping paper that i packed into this thing minus one bag of bows but seriously i had waaaaay too much now everything is easily accessible and visible so i know not to buy any more bows and can easily wrap a present my favorite part are the dedicated scissor and tape pockets on the side because i was always scrambling for these two tools,80,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,really like them i used 2 to organize wrapping iarea works well would recommend it,15,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love this works perfectly for all my wrapping needs i have it stuffed with paper bags cards bows and more no problem with it trying to tear or fall hangs neatly in my closet and helps keep every thing organized,39,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this does not work quite as well as i had hoped but it is still a nicefor managing your wrapping,21,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,there are soooo many pockets could probably fit close to 8 rolls of wrapping paper in this depending on the size,21,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,holds a lot of wrap bags and bows,8,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,helps me to organize my wrappers ribbons gift boxes gift cards and small bags in one space hanged behind my door however i do not really like the quality of the sewing and the way the compartments are designed they do not seem to close properly due to the bad fitting and workmanship things may fall out so i would say thisis overpriced due to it is poor workmanship butwise i m sold i love to organize,78,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does not hold rolls of wrapping paper well not balanced,10,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,it is amazing how much stuff you can get in this organizer and hanging over the door of a spare room closet really makes the best use of your space i will definitely buy another one in the future,39,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,does not hang straight up and down with longer rolls of paper great for short rolls i would not recommend,18,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i am not crazy out it quite flimsy and does not hold very much,13,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,horrible only 6 rolls in and it hangs lopsided the velcro straps do not even come close to holding the rolls in as they are located towards the bottom half poor design and cheaply made even the hanger is cheap so thin waste of money,44,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i bought this and it is companion gift bag organizer to get my wrapping out from under my bed and hang it up in a utility closet we have it worked great i do not have a crazy amount of wrapping paper rolls although i would say it maxes out at about 4 - 6 depending on the diameter of your rolls,58,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the product arrived on time but there was no built-in hangar even although it is described as such there is a series of snaps at the top where a hangar could be placed and removed but the snaps could not fit around any closetand i do not have a hangar wide enough to fit the whole top width then the compartments shown in the middle of the organizer are just cheap plastic walls with no white finishing stitching / fabric as indicated in the picture the result is a much cheaper design than what is pictured and described when purchasing there is no way to secure those compartments closed and no stiffness to the plastic to remain closed themselves i will likely be returning this product,124,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,goodbut it does not hold the longer rolls,10,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the gift wrap organizer the plastic was cheap and flimsy this product is just poorly designed i placed 6 rolls of paper equally divided and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper i plan on returning it,57,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,one thing to note as that depending on how much paper you include the holder does not stand up straight in the closet,23,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,works great we needed to clean up the disorganized mess we had,13,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,as advertised made my closet more user friendly,8,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was terrible and cheap and it did not even come with a hanger to hang it up with it went in the trash easier than shipping it back,29,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ended up in the trash do not waste your money,11,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not wste your money too small and extremely poor quality,10,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,did not hold as much as i was hoping jumbo rolls are too tall but it is nice to have it hanging out if the way,25,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it does not come with a hanger we tried using one of our hangers but it was tooheavy hanger would break or bend we tried putting 2 hangers to support the weight but the buttons will not close a sturdy thick metal hanger should be included with this product,47,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,once you put wrapping paper rolls in the side pockets they fall forward there needs to be a rigid back to this thing it is really junk and does not work at all,32,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does an ok job holding the paper rolls although it is a bit unweilding to get in and out of a closet the pockets on the front are virtually useless pick another product,33,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really like this organizer and i really like how little space it takes up it is about as wide as a hanging shoe organizer it sits in the back of my hall closet and i like that when i pull the whole thing out to get what i need it does not dump anything out of it is compartments the compartments are spacious and numerous and i like that i no longer have a crumpled mess of unusable wrapping paper or a hard storage system taking up space under the bed or closet,92,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i received another brand as a gift at christmas and could not find it to order another so i ordered this one the snaps constantly unsnap and it falls in the closet from the weight the other one i own does not do this would not buy this one again,50,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i love wrapping gifts and making them beautiful for the receiver but i have always disliked having to store wrapping paper and supplies in awkward containers that hide under the bed or in the attic this works well hanging from the door in my home-office where it is easy to get to and out of the way i like having everything i need in one place and not having to worry about the kids getting into it or it taking up valuable office space,84,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i wish i would have read the reviews i would not have paid more than 5 for this if I had seen it in a store and here i paid 20 it is so cheap i did not even bother putting anything in it i just just printed out the return receipt other than it being cheap it definitely shows a hanger at the top yet when i took this out of the package i saw it folds down at the top and snaps with nothing to hang it on I am extremely disappointed and mad at myself for buying it,96,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not the highest quality product the plastic is very thin and flimsy but still functions and is very useful for getting organized,24,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was cheap and i returned it there was no way to even hang it and the material was not up to my expectation,24,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i have not hung it yet but it appears that it will serve it is purpose well it is smaller than i expected but that was reported by a previous buyer so i was not disappointed,34,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this gift wrap organizer there are pouches behind the place where you would stand your tubes of wrapping paper that do not seem to serve a purpose and the front pouches for bows and such would work better if they had velcro to keep them closed but they do not so it all falls out,57,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,terrible it fooled me because it looked like it was a pretty awesome product but i put two medium size rolls in it and it fell over it a silly design it would need to have wrapping paper spots on the other side to even it out,47,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,at first i really could not tell if it was worth it but to my surpise it holds all my ribbons wrapping paper boxes and more great work horse,30,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it is ok for everything but the wrapping paper it leans forward like the paper is going to fall out of it,21,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i did not request a refund or return thisin fairness to the seller this does not work at all the pockets do not hold stuff at all and are really terrible it does not sit up-right like it shows and i really wish i had not ordered mine i would never ever had done so and i hope that you will take my advice,63,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,thislooks much better in the picture than in person the unit arrived without built-in hanger as advertised or any instructions very disappointed because i specifically purchased to hang in a closet,33,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very flimsy cheap material i do not even use it and sadly took too long to return it my bad the picture presents a highly organized tool but the reality is that it barely holds anything and everything droops hideous piece of junk,42,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the description and photograph showed a hanger at the top there was none i returned it and found one elsewhere to meet my needs,24,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,there should be a place to put wrapping paper on the other side too for balance but there is not seems common sense how are gift bags supposed to equalize the weight of wrapping paper tubes not very intuitive the areas for storing ribbons and bows are flat and shapeless it does not protrude like the picture if you store this in a full closet your ribbons and bows will probably get crushed or wonky,73,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,first of all mine does not have a hanger it has velcro which means it hangs horizontally and takes up way too much space instead of thinking i could slide it in as if it were clothes secondly it is not secure just flimsy open spaces that do not close so things just fall out do not waste your time and effort trying to organize with this it is not functional and costs too much,71,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love love love love this good quality plastic strong enough to hold all my wrapping supplies i am finally organized,20,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is actually the second one of these I have owned i do not remember where i purchased the first one and after many years of use it broke the plastic on this one seems a little thinner but i still think I shall get extended use from it the storage is arranged very well there are pockets on the back where i store tissue paper and gift bags there are side pockets just behind the wrapping paper rolls where i store gift tags and shrink wrap bags it even has special pockets for scissors and tape,94,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,great to have in the closet for all my present making supplies it actually fits alot inside more than i thought definitely worth it,24,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is perfect for all my wrapping paper i liked the back pockets on the unit as well between this and the gift bag organizer from jokari everything has a place now,32,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this is a waste of money made with cheap materials when i got this home it was already ripped i should have read the comments before purshasing do not waste your money,31,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was in such a rush to get the gift wrap supplies organized that i bought the one organizer that i thought would fit the bill i received it today and preceded to fill it up i am surprised that amazon would sell something so flimsy disappointed in the poor quality of the cheapo plastic smaller than the posted photo and does not hold much at all i have a feeling that it may start to rip on it is own as it hangs there i will then return it,89,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i does not match up with one i previously had it wore out this one has no place for long rolls of paper and i find those pocikets are about useless for anything,33,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this i only wish there was a larger pocket at the top like the 3 at the bottom i also wish it carried more wrapping paper only 12 rolls,30,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this organizer is just right for the average family there has room for multiple rolls and spools of ribbon with slots on one side for bags and small boxes unless you are a real pack-rat this organizer should suit you needs,39,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,daughter wanted it for her birthday she had picked it out she has not said that she does not like it nice,20,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was surprised at the quality on this the hanger is not plastic and it swivels easily the compartments are roomy enough for about eight rolls of wrapping paper i love the fact that i can hang it in the back of the closet where it is hidden away i figure if it tears a little over the years I shall just make pretty flowers out of coloredtape to strengthen i think this is perfect for my needs highly recommend,80,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer is wonderful i have it hanging in a closet and it is very handy to go to when looking for gift wrap ribbons and more i think I am going to get a couple more for x-mas paper,40,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,barely holds anything without squishing it and it leans over taking up more space would not recommend do not waste your money,21,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this gift wrap organizer is a little on the flimsy side but there are no tears or rips in it and it is convenient to just being hung up in a closet when minot in use i do love it because all my wrapping needs are placed within this organizer,50,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,buyer beware when i finally received this via the mail it was jammed into a mail slot and appeared much smaller than it does in the picture it is very cheaply made and the reinforcements you see on the middle pouches the white strips on the openings are not present i will be inquiring about a full refund for this,61,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really use this alot i wish it had more space for tissue paper and gift bags it would be nicer if it had snaps on the ribbon pockets if you do not have everything distributed properly it hangs forward,39,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this picture looks great however this is made of the same plastic that the throw away bag it comes in is the best thing i can say for this is that it was returnable even although i lost shipping money,40,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it seems sturdy enough so far i like the different pockets it was a little difficult to figure out where everything goes,22,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i was not able to put any wrapping paper in this organizer it is mainly meant for gift bags bows and smaller items i was upset since the picture advertises that it can hold wrapping paper again it is made out of cheap plastic but it at least can hold some things,50,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i hate it when they send a similari did not get samefirst it was black and second it did not have a hanger built in on top it has 5 button snaps instead annoying,38,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it has enough room for most of my gift wrap materials and it does not take up much space i like it,21,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,thisis cheaply made the plastic is very thin and flimsy the opening to the areas to hold ribbon is a cut in the plastic after use i am certain this opening will continue to rip additionally the area to hold the rolls of wrapping paper is not adjustable therefore the rolls fall forward and make the entire organizer fall to one side i would not recommend this product especially at this price point i have since purchased another at half this price and it is made with thick plastic and compartments with zippers,95,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,made from really cheap plastic really really cheap plastic the hook hanger head is not curved long enough so when you hang it it may fall off your rod this will work better if hangs flat against a wall if you have tall wrapping paper this will not fit in your regular standard closet it could work on the back of a door,60,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does what it is supposed to do but it is very flimsy and most of the compartments are not as roomy as i was expecting definitely not worth 20 bucks,29,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,if you are in the market for a gift wrap organizer i encourage you to move past this low qualitydo not buy i would barely pay 5 for this organizer it was so incredibly cheaply made and nothing like the picture suggested it is tiny and the pockets will not hold anything because they have these gigantic slits in them presumably for easy access but they do not hold ribbons and other wrapping accoutrements well because everything just falls out very poor design and another cheap made in china product,88,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I am trying to organize my space and thiswas a very big disappointment it fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging the organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package the retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer the areas for bows allow bows to fall out the area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn actual use of theis difficult replacing items after use tore the assigned compartment even more I am looking for another storage solution this one did not work,129,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product cheaply made and very flimsy i pulled this out last night excited to start organizing and saw that 2 of the front pockets had rips across the plastic would not recommmend wasting money on this,40,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i purchased this to organize scattered christmas wrapping supplies unfortunately this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life it also does not work well at all once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it does not flop around the hanger also can not take a lot of weight on it i tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section it would not stay up and hung kind of lopsided right now it is laying down and barely holding it is contents I am going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer i would not recommend this to anyone,128,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed i bought one of these exact style of organizer over 10 years ago for 1100 it had served me well for this long and just recently the plastic began to tear so i felt that it would be a good value to get another one this one that arrived that i paid twice as much for is so cheap and flimsy that i doubt it will last two years the plastic is so thin that it will not even stand up straight enough to support rolls of wrap and this is while it is hanging i have to tie a scarf around the whole thing to keep the rolls of wrap from hanging in all directions the slide pockets in the back are oddly small and i can not even fit my sheets of gift tags in them this was a complete waste of money and i wish i had not bought it keeping my old one for when this one falls to pieces do not waste your money,166,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,maybe i was not realistic purchasing thisfor the price i did not expect it to be attractive or super high quality but i did not expect it to be as cheaply constructed as it was either it is a very thin plastic that rips easily the pockets that are designed to hold bows have the opening on the front sort of like a portable tissue pack so you when you hang it they are not on the top and the bows can fall out plus the weight of the wrapping paper rolls and i only loaded in 5 it was not like i tried to fill it pull the entire thing forward when it is hung so the plastic starts to tear and every time you touch it things fall out greatpoorly designed do not waste your money on this one,136,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a great thing for getting wrapping paper contained along with all the other things that go with it the organizer is two sided so you can store on both sides and hand it in a closet and access either side such a great,46,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer works very nice with everything you would have for wrapping packages very neat and more sturdy then expected you still have to be careful with the plastic compartments they hold just about everything you can think of very well saves space too,47,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i just received it today i was able to fit in 5 rolls of wrapping paper that i had all my cards tape lots of bows few rolls of ribbons i had scissors everything there was space for everything it is hanging in my closet and everything is accessible easily since i just got it today i do not know about the longevity when i first opened it i thought the front pockets had tears in them but actually that is the opening to access the pockets,85,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i used to have a tall plastic container for my gift wrapping supplies while it was slightly better than storing all of my wrapping items in paper bags it left me more frustrated than anything extra long wrapping paper did not fit bows got squished you get thei have just organized all of my supplies in this hanging organizer and i am so impressed it holds everything even that too tall wrapping paper the mountain of gift bags that i have acquired now have a home on the back of the organizer i used a 3 m hook to hang the organizer on the inside of the coat closet door i plan to check out other organizing items from this company 11914 update looks like the reviews are quite mixed about this product I have had mine since early 2011 and it is still working great i think that hanging it as described in the initial review really helps decrease the wear and tear on thei agree with other reviewers that the materials to make this product could be improved upon maybe something canvas but I am still happy with it as is,192,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i had the previous model it wery well made with fabric netting and i love it needed one more found it is now made only in plastic ordered it amazon sent it quickly the thing looks and feels like a cheap thing i would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape or hang it outside on a hot day but here is the really big problem it is missing the cardboard stiffeners that this cheap version needs to make the plastic compartments have a usable shape yeah assembly is required but the stiffeners are not in the package so i notified amazon i needed a replacement the new one arrived lightning quick it has no stiffeners either theis useless and i have had it so i am just returning it for a refund i can not see re-ordering theobviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces i am not a happy camper,166,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,shipped extremely fast greatfor organizing gift wrap stuff which was what i purchased it for would be even better if it could hold more than 1 roll of gift wrap on each side in their respective pouches other than that a great product,48,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product met all of our needs the storage is extensive for the size of the product and it is organized well the fact that you can place this in a closet and have it take little room is just great all in all this product is recommended to anyone with lots of gift wrapping items and needs to store them in a small space,64,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,get rid of the clutter and get this awesome thing i had one of those under-the-bed rubber maid things before buying this and it was awkward and clumsy and everything was always a mess inside i love thisyou can take it out of the closet and lay it out on the table or bed and everything is easily accesible you can take it anywhere you need to or just leave it in the closet where it takes up minimal space and access what you need in a snap there are pockets for everything buy it,97,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i bought the jokari gift wrap organizer amid much scorn from my family for my consumer habits but now everyone at my house is so pleased i went ahead and made the investment this organizer is similar to one of those closet shoe organizers only this one works it is flat made mostly of clear plastic and hangs off the integrated hanger to fit in your coat closet the front of the organizer is flat with two long vertical pockets on either side which hold about 4 rolls of wrapping paper each between these two wrapping paper pockets are three small pockets which hold ribbons gift tags cards scissors and more on the back of organizer are three somewhat larger pockets which you can use to hold gift bags and similar larger flattish items all of our christmas and birthday wrapping items are stored hanging flat in an easily accessible closet the translucent plastic ensure that you can easily find what you need if you have a coat closet that can handle one more thin object on a hanger and are looking to store 6 to 8 rolls of wrapping paper and would not mind some related items with them i highly recommend this hanging organizer,203,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love thisit has saved so much space in my closet and made it easier to find wraping paper and more no complaints,24,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this product tore the moment i took it out of the box i read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I had simply be more ginger with it it practically ripped to the touch it was impossible to even unfold it let alone put anything in it without the plastic tearing at the folds or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself it is too small for my purposes as well but that is subject to personal needs i will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them overall the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it did not last a half second upon arrival 20 down the drain,136,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i am very pleased with my newly acquired ability to organize all of the stuff that was in bags piles and more i am fortunate to have a perfect spot in my basement to hang the gift wrap organiizer and appreciate it is usefulness great find,44,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,purchased this during a recent reorganization of the closets at my home this works much better than the previous organizer i had it saves floor space since it can be hung in a closet and has plenty of room for rolls of paper bags bows tissue paper scissors and more overall I am really happy with this organizer,56,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i have had this product for over a month now and it is great it fits really well in my closet and holds a descent amount of wrapping paper it also holds bows and there is even a place on the back to put gift bags and cards i highly recommend this product it definitely helped to free some space,60,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the plastic on this product was ripped when it arrived it is very cheaply made definitely overpriced for the quality,20,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it has a great design but the quality of materials is seriously lacking the clear plastic started ripping in one area as i unfolding it most of the plastic seems just about to rip if given any tension also the velcro does not hold very well,45,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really love this product and if i could give it 4 and a half stars i would i wish the material was more eco-friendly but i bought it anyway the only real problems are lack of accommodation for large tall rolls of ribbon the tape compartment fits only the smallest tape dispenser does not fit a normal 3 m gift wrap tape dispenser and the card pockets are too small otherwise the design is great and i like it much more than the rubbermaid giftwrap bin we used previously versatile storage options under the bed in the closet free standing are a plus,102,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is a little flimsy in construction but i can put up with this as it does a nice job of organizing all my wrapping paper and more i am very happy with this,35,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not an expensive product but it has held up very well for the low price it does not hold as much as it says it will but what does i have been much more organized since buying it and am planning to buy another since i reuse bows and ribbon and need the storage,56,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i think this is great i love that it hangs up in a closet does the job i need it to do perfectly so glad i bought it,28,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,pay attention to product dimensions appears to be larger than it is the rolls of wrapping paper in picture must be tiny rolls other than it is size it is an ok organizer it sets up easily and is easy to access,42,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i bought one of these to offset the cost of using baseboard electric heaters this one heater works very well at keeping our 300 sqfeet room at a good ambient temperature at 475 watts i leave it running 24 hours a day during the winter it is a great design you barely notice it,53,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,when i bought this product i was skeptic if this will infact work i installed 1 panel in a 120 sq feet room it works very well heats the room to a comfortable temprature in about 30 minutes after checking this months electricity bill i will buy more of this product,51,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,this has to be the best heater i have ever used i bought some to put in my kids bedrooms and they work like a dream it not only heats the rooms to a comfortable temperature but it keeps the moister in the air so my kids allergies do not act up when i tern them on also i do not need to worry about leaving the econo heaters on with my kids in their rooms alone because the heaters will not get hot enough to burn them it is a wonderful product and i am buying more to put throughout my whole house to replace my central heating so we will save on ourbill fred new york new york,119,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i have bought over 10 of these heaters for both my house and rental properties they do heat nicely the only problem with them is most of them have cracked sometimes they crack right away sometimes they will crack after you turn them off in the spring i have sent many of them back and they do send you a replacement without a problem i have even been told to use joint filler to fix the cracks they are like square pieces of clay with wires running through them i think the contraction and expansion of them being turned on to heat and then cooling down when off cracks them I have thrown a couple of them out wish they would come up with a model that does not crack other then that they are great they do heat,138,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,i bought seven of these heaters two years ago and everyone has developed severe cracks throughout the whole core i have contacted friends who have also bought this product and they all have the same problem i contacted the company by phone and was told the warranty had expired and to use silicone caulking to fill in the cracks these heaters are poorly made if you research other reviews not on the company website you will see similar complaints,79,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,this product provided a nice even heat at first and i found it is quiet heat more soothing than a noisy fan-powered unit one day i carelessly tossed my winter coat on the floor next to the wall-mounted unit and apparently the sleeve landed against the corner of the unit where a plastic circle covers the wiring i returned to the room immediately smelling burning plastic i pulled away the coat to reveal a burn hole through the plastic circle completely through to the other side the unit has not come back on since be very careful about what you put near this device,102,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,the good thing about this heater is that it will heat a 10 by 10 room eventually this heater really needs to be on 4 - 6 hours before you can feel a difference in the room if left on it will maintain the temperature to about 65 degrees the web site says the average cost to your electric bill should be about 3 cents an hour and for me it was more about 30 cents an hour i used the heater maybe 10 times the first month i got it i left it on for about 10 hours each time and my next electric bill was 35 more than the previous month nothing else had change but this heater,117,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i bought a house that used these panels as the main heating source throughout the house unless your attic walls and floors are insulated this product is worthless my electric bill was astronomical and the house did not get warmer than like 63 degrees because the very small amount of heat that they produced was quickly sucked out of the house i froze for two winters my water pipes froze too because the house could not stay warm enough but i just installed centralheatmay be just as expensive but at least I shall be warm,96,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,we bought this heater hoping to heat our bedroom and save money on utility costs it does heat up a small room quite nicely if left on for a while the only problem i have had is that the unit cracked from normal use and i am not sure if it is safe to use or not the cracking seems to be a common problem with these heaters if you read other reviews on the web,76,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i had purchased my panels over two years ago online it turned out that i got a bad batch of the early models that were prone to cracking like some of the other reviewers here had experienced i contacted their customer service department and after a few e-mails and me sending them pictures of the cracked panels and copies of my receipts they replace my panels within a couple of weeks my warranty had expired but i received what they call customer service replacements my wife and i heat our entire condo with these panels and have had no complaints until the cracks started appearing we look forward to using our newer models great heating product excellent customer service,119,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,i have 5 panels 3 cracked and 2 burned out you must leave them on 24/7 to keep up in the northern illinois winter not much of a savings if they need to run constantly customer support is a joke a real joke i was told to fill the crack with drywall mud and sand it smooth i have taken mine down and because the company will not honor them threw them away do not purchase this product,76,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,we installed a panel in our new mudroom worked very well unless it was really cold outside new hampshire after 15 years although it developed several cracks the manufacturer said not to use it anymore but also would not replace it i had planned on installing more panels but not now too bad,53,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,rather high price but then again anything that is going to save money in the long run is so far so good puts out quite a bit of heat but you can not expect to heat a large area with just one i do plan on buying a couple more of them,51,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,this panel heat is really what a lot of us are looking for saving money and being confortablei thought i would just supplement my heat my home presently has a floor heater 1000sq foot house i am in missouri and it does get down in the teens i first bought two panels and placed them in my living room and kitchen they do such a nice job i do not think i will be turning on the floor heater instead i ordered more to handle the bedrooms i could pay money for an old furnace in the maintance and up keep or i can save and use a beautiful efficient panel heater easy to install and not bad on the eyes i recommend this to everyone-try it you will probably fall in love,132,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i bought this heater for my sons room it does a good job of keeping the room warm but the door must be shut or it does not work it is a little hot to the touch will not burn but too hot for an infant to touch it works as described and i would recommend it to anyone especially for a childs room,64,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i think this heater is great for kids rooms we have had this unit over a year now and use it in the winter months for our sons room which is the coldest room in the house we turn it on at night and by morning his room is much warmer than the rest of the house it does get slightly hot not too hot to where you would immediately get burned if you were to touch it in my opinion this is far safer than any other heater it does not run our power bill up and there is no saound while it is on i researched many heater before purchasing this one and i must say this turned out to be better than i expected i was very skeptical at first to whether this would provide enough heat but now this is the only heater i will use in my childrens bedrooms,154,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,great heaters I have used them for years with no problem one thing although when first turned on they outgas for the first 24 hours they give off an odor as the material cures the same way many appliances do if you do not want to smell it give it a day in the garage then move it inside other than that they are the apogee of heating technology they come as close to the comfort of woodstove heat as electricity can and are basically invisible,84,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,for anyone that has a marriage where you can never agree on what is a comfortable temperature this heater will be your winter salvation i have a hard time retaining heat and my wife has a hard time expelling it the problem with most space heaters is that they heat the room well beyond the temperature you set the thing too this heater will always comfortably heat a room very evenly it gives off a comfortable radiant heat this is wall mountable which means it will not take up any space in the room summer storage is just wrapping the cord around it my advice is to mount on the wall near the person that likes it warm it helps to create a slightly warmer pocket that will not affect the rest of the room i have sinusitis and this heater really helps my sinuses drain,144,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,we bought this installed it according to directions it worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks we did have it on constantly during that time then one night we woke up to a horrible burning stench it was coming from the heater the spot where the wire goes from the unit to the plug was beginning to burn the other side of the heating unit was begining to turn black and smolder we unplugged and removed the heater immediately it took about 2 weeks before the burning chemical stench left our room i just thank god that we woke up before it was too late i still have not contacted amazon or the manufacturer to get my money back still just too horrified please do not buy this product,130,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,this appliance is exactly as promised in the ad very cost effective source of quiet soft heat use of this heater on our sun porch allows us to use the room year round,33,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,I have ordered 2 of these panel heaters now we think they are absolutly great they are very easy to install and take up no space they do not even look like heaters attached to the wall we bought 2 because we were so impressed with the first one and decided that we needed one for a different room it is true that they only heat an area of about 100 square feet but they do that very well what has really neat is they get comfortably warm to the touch but do not burn so they are safe to put in small areas and great toback against for a toasty back while at the time of installing these heaters in our apartment we did not pay for our own electric it only makes sense that they cost less than most other electric heaters an old heater we had ran at 2100 watts and these take only 450 my 2 computers run at 750 watts each it must be cheaper than a less-efficient source of heat all in all i think the heaters are well worth it we would buy another and have been recommending them to all of our friends and families,202,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i was disappointed that one of the panels does not work at all and one was cracked the others do work fine did effect my electric bill as expected,29,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,the panel was shipped promptly my wife and i installed it in our sons room during the fall it seemed to keep his room warm during cool weather but before winter came and it could really be put to the test the unit stopped working unfortunately i misplaced the receipt and could not return the unit i rated the unit with a single star because it did not last more than 60 days,73,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i have one of these have had it for about 2 years recently it has cracked in the center from top to bottom i have contacted the company and they stated that since it is past the 18 month warranty period they could not help however did recommend i replace it and then mentioned of a sale on theright now i am going to contact the consumer reports group and email the photo so they may review thisoverall it was alright it takes the chill off of a room it did not raise temperature significantly i do not think in my case of 2 year life it was worth the money spent also it seemed to produce less heat as time went on,126,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i purchased these for use in my bedroom which was an addition that did not have central air or heat in it because of the size of the room i purchased 2 of these i have only used a couple of days so I am not sure what effect they will have on my electric bill but hopefully the same or less as the space heaters we were using i am conserned because the walls in this room are wood shingles and they seem to heat up we are looking at other options on mounting i have purchased the electric temp sensor so that it will turn them off and on as needed they do get a little hot to the touch but for most adults i do not think it will be an issue,133,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,if you are looking to heat a large room this is not the heater for you they work as indicated by the company to heat 100 sq feet you must place them on a solid wall such as drywall at first we tried placing it in our older home on some paneling that had nothing behind it but the studs the paneling is thin and the wall got a little too hot for my comfort however i found that if you place it on drywall or other solid surface the wall does not get hot there is no noticeable difference in the electric bill once it gets cold and stays cold we leave it on 24/7 we use ours in the laundry room which is roughly 100 sq feet and it works wonderfully and we are glad to have it for that purpose but we would not purchase any for the rest of the house as they are not aesthetically pleasing nor would they be efficient for the rest of the house,169,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i bought the electric panel radiator for the express purpose of saving energy but i just wound up cold quite hot in the center but the outer edges were cool to touch I am wondering if that is a fault found in my heaters since the product seems to have such rave reviews it did not have the heating power i expected i found the small soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w which was the same amount the panel heater used i live in atlantawhich has quite mild winters so i was disappointed with the performance but since the panels are permanently attached to my walls i may give them another try this winter,118,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,this product worked okay for us there are few heating options that use so little wattage which was a necessity for our old home however we decided to paint one of these to match the wall after we painted it it is effectiveness decreased by about 50 the website even touts this being able to paint it to match the wall as an advantage of the product but does not warn that the heater will not work as well afterwards we contacted the company several times to complain but they would never get back to us like i said these things are okay but the company does not give you all the facts and they will not get back to you if you have problems i will not be buying any more,129,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,beware if you are buying this product to lower your bill it will not work my electric bill has actually been higher from last year since using the econo heat last year i used baseboard electric heat the econo heat used 200 to 300 more kilowat hours than the baseboard electric heaters i gave it a two star rating instead of a no star rating because it does heat up the living room nicely but at what cost,77,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,from the great reviews i really expected this heater to be wonderful but it fell short for me it might be good for a room the size of a small closet but it did nothing for my bedroom we could not even tell we had added any heat at all it was really a waste of money for us,58,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,do not know about others but live in wi and i set my therm at 55 and let the econoheat take care of the rest 2 br duplex and i am fine when it gets below zero i have to move it up to sixty not going to blow smoke but it works if you have compact area very easy to install,61,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,we installed 4 eco-heaters as supplmentary heaters they were easy to install 15 minutes they take up little or no space make no noise 2 stars we live in boston and had all 4 working non-stop since december 1 2005 the econo-heater give off about 10 of the heat we expected the temperature in a test room was only 2 degrees higher the detail documentation that came with the heater says that you can expect 10 of the heat coming from the face of the heater that is all the heat you get the truth of this heater is in the 90 warranty by the time you figure out it does not work the warranty has expired this econo-heater is a greatbut get an oil filled heater for heat the electrity that both burn is the same but you only get 10 of the heat with the econo-heater,149,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,we purchased three econo-heat panels in an effort to maintain a more even house temperature to take theoff our monitor 441 oil-fired heater also a great product with one each in our master bedroom northeast corner study and adjoining sunroom the results have been outstanding although deep winter has yet to arrive here in maine our monitor runs only a third of it is normal curve the econo-heaters maintaining a soft even heat in those outer rooms for our application i feel it is best to avoid large swings in temperature and we choose to let them run most of the time however one could use timers or thermostats with the units if desired we have yet to figure any specific heating cost reductions but anticipate considerable savings especially as we face increasingly high fuel costs i usually dismiss any type of electric heating units but these are clearly a wonderful addition for most well-insulated applications safe clean aesthetically pleasing simple to use and install all for a very reasonable price and our cats have found new residence in the far reaches of the house we rate em two paws way up,191,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,well i purchased three of the heaters they are easy to instal about 10 minutes each being it is only october and the nights have not been that cold i do have them on and it is been a constant 72 - 71 degrees in the area where they are i installed one in my sons room and with his door closed in a room about 120 square feet it is been nice in there the true test will be in january,77,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,when i got my econo-heater last year i was so amazed to experience it is quiet velvety warmth i also really liked the fact that it did not create dust in addition i was impressed with the fact that it was unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing it cut down on my heating bill even although it was installed in a room with windows on every wall and a sliding glass door i am looking forward to using it in my new place where i can actually use it in the way that the manufacturer suggests,92,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,wow that is outstanding customer service i recently e-mailed you about a problem i was having with my heater i could not believe it when theguy dropped off a brand new one i really liked the heater but i really am amazed at the way you guys stand behind your product it is unusual to find a company that is so responsive and does not try to find fault with the customer I have told a lot of people about the heater and they were impressed wait till they hear about the service thanks a million and i am sure the folks that stay in the guest cottage that is where the heater is mounted will really be appreciative,115,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,well after reading all the tesimonials from users i decided to replace all my old ugly baseboard heaters with econo-heat panels what a difference nice steady heat no tick-tick-tick of the heater warming up but they are warm and so am i i even went out and looked at the power meter when all the panels were active 4 big and 2 small panels and the meter was barely spinning if i did that with the old baseboard heaters the meter would be twirling like mad great product already have a co-worker looking into them for his place and a friend is looking at them too you now have a sales rep in the seattle area I shall expect a commission check in the mail soon,127,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,well we live in a trailer and do not have central heat and air we use space heaters in the winter but can only have one on at a time so can only heat one room at a time or our circuit breaker would pop also we could not leave them on while we were gone because of the fire hazard with a baby on the way we needed to find a safe affordable way to heat our home we tried to the econo-heat panels and they are great three of them use less electricity then one of the little space heaters we were using they are easy to install and i feel safe leaving them on while i am away i know our little one will be warm and safe next winter,132,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i bought them to fit a 1956 sunbeam and it said that they would fit but they did not so i had to return them and went and bought a new kitchen-aide wish it would have fit but the shaft was not long enough,42,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my grandmother gave me her mixed and I have not used it very much because it was more sentimental then anything I have started using it more and i got a spoon caught in the beaters and the original were ruined i was afraid it would be a search for replacements that would last forever these beaters fit perfect and they arrived quickly and the price was a lot less than what i was expecting these are great grandma will never know,81,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the original old beaters had completed worn out i neverthought i would get them working correctly glad these are available the mixer works as if it were new,28,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,in spite of the amount of research i did i could not determine if these beaters would fit even a call to the hamilton beach customer line was unhelpful so i ordered them and they did not fit the middle shaft was too long i returned them,46,3

Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the quality was a bit low considering the quality of items purchased in the past there must be an american factory that could do a bit better allen clark,29,8

Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,thisdid not fit at all if i can not find the proper piece i will likely have to purchase a new mixer,23,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,these are fine for replacements of the original beaters only bad thing is they are very lightweight metal and bend easily unlike the original beaters which were durable at least they work and i am able to use my old mixer so I am satisfied,44,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,work great fit perfect into old sunbeam mixer these beaters are hard to find so if you need these get some,21,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,i have had a hamilton beach mixer for 50 years the only thing i have had to replace are the beaters i am always thrilled to find them,28,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i told the company what year my machine was old but motor works beautifully these were for the newer version and did not fit,24,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,bought this to replace the beaters on a hamilton beach model g mixer i inherited from my parents that had been resting in a box for over a decade my wife is not fond of cooking and what few items we need a mixer for a small hand mixer usually suffices i wanted to mix up a batch of very dry-battered cookies and wanted the nostalgia of mons old 50s-era mixer these perfectly replaced the bent-up beaters on the hb model g also fits many other hamilton beach stand mixer models worked great at whipping up a batch of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies price almost 1/2 of what you would pay elsewhere if you have an old otherwise serviceable hamilton beach mixer and need a replacement set of beaters this is the way to go,135,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,absolutely amazed at how well this works we use it all the time,13,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,very cheaply made thin metal and easily scratchable,8,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i did not use it for about a month after i bought it when i first took it out of the box i noticed a crack in the lid handle washer on the underside of the lid did not look like a problem by the time i went to use it the packaging was long gone the first time i used it i noticed the lid did not fit properly and was deformed when i picked it up by the handles a big piece of the left handle broke off in my hand the function as a skillet was ok but it was literally falling apart in my hands unfortunately i could not return it as all the packaging was gone,117,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,beware this is junk knob on lid will not secure consequently lid spins around anytime it is handled dangerous after spending a lot of time i decided this looked like a good deal and wanted this large size so this was very disappointing to say the least it was printed in large letters on outer box china yep disgusting returning for sure so do not bother who needs this aggravation,74,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,so far I am very pleased with this product it is large enough that i can cook an entire breakfast in it that is eggs sausage and hash browns i also use it to make casseroles and it is great for that the pan is well balanced and the heat evenly distributed the glass lid is vented which is the main reason i bought it the pan itself can not be washed in the diswasher but the non-stick surface makes it a breeze to clean you can wash the glass lid in the dishwasher if you prefer but it s not that hard to wash by hand either the price is also reasonable and after my nearly 200 electric top name skillet started malfunctioning after less than three years i decided to replace it with this one and I am so glad i did,139,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,worked great for all of our needs would buy again if i needed another makes excellent fried chicken nice product,20,5

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,i love this app and it arrived quickly and we use it all the time the non-stick interior coating is holding up wonderfully after months of use,27,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,the first time i tried to use the skillet the electric power plug would not stay in the socket even when i held the plug the pan would only heat a little although it was set to 425 the power plug does not have incremental degree numbers so one would never be able to set the exact heat needed since the plug does not fit tightly enough to heat the pan is worthless stay away from this skillet it is a dud,81,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i bought thistook it out of box and the lid handle was chipped and the left handle was cracked in half amazon replaced it for more and i received it the next day and the replacement was broken in the same places also the plug did not even fit into the skillet properly it just slid right back out will not ever buy this brand again and i will not recommend this to anyone,76,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,the skillet cooks so hot it can only be used on the low setting of 200 degrees,17,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,plug did not fit lid did not fit really bad product threw it away,12,14

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the handle on the top falls off it is not safe at all,12,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,teribble product stay away right away it seemed to heat in hot spots and could barely cook over 250 now just one month old it has stopped heating all together terrible product called the company and received an ra but have to pay to ship it back to them i would avoid this product like the plague as cheap as it is made do not really want to spend more to send it back so it cost us 3500 to use it maybe 5 times,86,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,absolute junk got about ten uses tops out of it before the cheap element on the bottom burned out and cracked buyer beware went back to using my old 7 year old one made by a reputable company i knew the second i opened it up that it would be garbage by the weight of it this thing was made so cheaply and the longevity shows in the quality of manufacture my old one weighs twice as much and is twice as thick all around,85,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,only used 3 times and it no longer heats very disappointing,11,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,i love my electric skillet and what makes it even better i was able to get in theto match my kitchen red,25,21

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,this was great for my classroom i did not want to spend a lot of money for an electric skillet this was large enough for my classroom needs,28,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,this is very big that is a plus it does not cook fries so well but does wonders with chicken big enough to cook 10 chicken legs at a time laughing out loud and i cooked enoughsausage / tater tot covered in cheese dish to feed 9 people and had left overs so i love it the black handle for the lid had a small piece broken on it but did not hurt the way it attached and the legs are kinda rough not smooth and polished so i was disappointed in that especially when it cut my finger but all in all it is good so I am gon na keep it,104,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the skillet is nice but the glass lid was broke,10,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,this is a great machine it heats up fast and brews fast i read the reviews about the coffee tasting like plastic and i had the same problem at first but i cleaned it with the vinegar solution and after a couple uses the plastic taste went away and now we just have a great machine,56,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,coffee maker is working perfectly this is my second proctor-silex coffee pot and the only reason i got a new one is that i broke the carafe on my 10 year old machine which is still working just fine,39,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,works great with auto timmer and more-failed after almost 2 years plate does not heat up and water stays in reservoir,19,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i was lucky to find this same model of coffee maker that i had i purchased my last coffeemaker at least 15 years ago and it finally slowed down too much even with cleaning all i wanted was a reliable coffeemaker without bells and whistles i do use the timer on occasion when i have to leave early for work i hope that if and when this new maker wears out i can purchase this again maybe i should buy a spare,82,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,good simple coffeemaker very easy to thoroughly clean consistently brews a good pot,13,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,lasted only 14 months the heating element failed after 14 months of light use half pot daily my previous coffee maker same make and model lasted a decade before the heating element conked out on the plus side easy to pour without dribbling,43,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,i could of saved my money and wished i would of water all over counter when pouring out of pot clock button can easily be bumped and change the time also the dial is very hard to see it is hard to open the top to get the coffee bin in or out the power cord is very very short save your money,63,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i doubt it is the worlds greatest coffee maker and the numbers on the pot have already mostly worn off after a few months but it makes good enough coffee for us at 7 am we do not have the palettes to justify fancy coffee or machines and it is the one we were used to so it was quite convenient to order the exact same model when i shattered the old one and being able to program it the night before is nice,80,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,we have purchased proctor silex coffee makers for over twenty years the coffee is brewed quickly and tastes great,19,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,our go to coffeemaker the last 3 times i say 3 times because the carafe will break way before the machine quits and the replacement carafes are almost as expensive as the entire coffeemaker down the hatch,38,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i used a mr coffee for years this coffee maker makes much better coffee and lasts longer than any mr coffee pot I have had,24,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,shipper placed one sheaf of folded paper between product box and shipped carton not good coffee maker was dead on arrival this was not a complicated product while it does have programmable clock brew start it has an on switch that when pressed should heat the water and start to brew on switch lit up red as per instructions but nothing happened did not heat the water amazon really aggravating to have to waste an hour or more of my valuable time dealing with a product that is so simple it should be plug inwith water filter and coffee and press brew have to dry out re-pack go online arrange return and waste more of my time writing a review,121,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this product to replace an older model of the same coffeemaker the coffee basket is an improvement but the time display is hard to read unless you bend down to view it straight on it does make tasty coffee,41,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,cheap unit with some nice features while not listed in product description research reveals product has only 180 day warranty from mfgr i can not recommend this unit buyers should be aware that i experienced a total electrical and functional failure after 10 months which nearly caused an electrical and plastic fire while we were sleeping during a programmed brew cycle just before we awoke an internal temperature control module short-circuited overheated and melted a hole in the plastic housing before a slow-acting safety shut-off electrical power to the unit such an pre-mature and catastrophic failure of this simple household appliance indicates an improper and unsafe design,106,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,had this for a couple months now and it really is a great coffeemaker with i think could have had a few improvements 1 led is not lighted 2 too easy to accidentally hit the minute and hour set buttons those are the reasons it received a 4 star instead of a 5 other wise for the price it is a bargain it makes a good coffee in a short amount of time and keeps the coffee hot,77,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,if you do not care about bells and whistles on a brewer this is perfect after 2 weeks of use it developed some spots on the warmer which in time i think might start peeling off which is why i originally bought this as a replacement for my old one,49,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this coffeemake after reading extensive reviews on amazon and other web-sites for coffemakers at this price range my mother-n-law came to visit me and her son for a week since she is a regular coffee drinker which i am not needed to find one that was reasonably price and functioned well this one did my mother-n-law enjoyed her morning cup i bought the more pricier filter cups so I am sure that plays a part in good coffee the coffee maker does notwater on the countertop like other lower-priced coffee maker i purchased the one in white which I am glad i did instead of the white the clock is not lit but that was ok for me all in all for this price range this is a good one,131,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,the best thing about this deep fryer is that all parts could be taken apart and cleaned it works well and is safe but it fills my house with greasy smell it was a lot more than just deep frying on the stove top also it was a little too big for a family of four considering the amount of unusable oil i had to throw down the drain i will still use it for recipes which call for a deep fryer with good ventilation,85,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,i liked everything about this cooker but the heat settings i found myself in need of temperatures of 400 degrees and this unit stops at 375 other than that it was beyond easy to clean and left nothing that i could think of it could use other than for folks like me a higher temperature setting good design style and thinking when into producing it,65,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,I have only used mine twice and had good experiences both times the food turned out the way it was supposed to clean up is easy it takes little effort to disassemble the fryer but although many parts are dishwasher safe they take up quite a bit of space in my average sized dishwasher so i just wash everything by hand i wish the fry basket were larger although i guess the rest of the appliance would have to be bigger so i guess i wish the whole thing were just a bit bigger but it is still a good size for the price i wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital the timer is antimer type dial and the thermostat is a slider amking for somewhat impercise settings although this is relatively minor it is still a very good deep fryer,143,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i like the fact that it is dishwasher safe all parts except for the heating element storing oil in the fryer is an option but if you prefer you can empty the oil pan into a bottle and wash the pan in the dishwasher too no more stinky rancid crumbs in the bottom to deal with i also like the thermostat and timer,63,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,i should have taken heed this rival czf630 deep fryer did not have great reviews but i did like the fact that it had a filter and a break away cord hence 1 star rate the filter zero stars we used it 8 times it no longer works and it is out of the return window so we have this plastic covered can the housing for the oil resivour is even garbage impossible to remove oil from the finish of it so at 60 and an 8 time usage it would have been cheaper to go get junk food out save your money on this,107,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,this deep fryer is great it heats the oil quickly and i absolutely love the fact that there is no spatter while cooking,22,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,purchased this product 3 months ago looks great and easy to clean i tought i would be statisfied big mistake i have used around 3 to 5 times only now thermostat seems to not respond anymore it does not heat at all because thermostat shows that oil is at right temp all the time i am really annoyed about this situation this is a brand newelectric part is totally defective beware,76,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,the second time i used this fryer it stopped working in the middle of cooking i cooked one batch of fries and as i removed them i noticed the power light had gone off i did all the trouble-shooting stuff and still no power i allowed it to cool down and still no power i followed the instruction booklet carefully the two times that i used this fryer and it died in the midst of it is second use since there does not seem to be a reasonable explanation it is being returned,89,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this rival is my first fryer and i love it it keeps you away from the oils splash and you can remove all the parts and wash them in the dishwasher easy to use and to clean I shall recommend this df to anyone,44,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,we purchased this deep fryer two and half weeks ago without warning it stopped working piece of caca this is i would avoid it there are better deep fryers out there because i can not just leave the stars out of this I am giving it one star although i would prefer to give it less than zero,56,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this deep fryer heats up fast and holds it is heat well so far all i fry came out nice and crisp i have not tried chicken yet that will be the big test my last rival i got for christmas lasted a month hope this one last longer by the way this is a up dated fryer from my other one to be all far,65,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk within a month the timer knob broke off within two months the basket handle broke so there is now no way to raise or lower the basket today the temperature control slide knob broke in two there is no way to fix these defects either it is obvious that the plastic used is of poor quality for it is the plastic that failed pieces simply snapped in two or connections failed i do not use this for anything other than average home cooking either and then maybe once a week so there was not a heavyon this cooker it is just junk,106,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i accidentally over filled the first one of these i bought but i liked it so much i got another one it cooks food well and is very easy to clean the ability to close the lid before putting your food in the oil is a real nice feature this is definitely the best product in this price range,59,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i purchased the rival 5 liter cool touch deep fryer and it works great we owned so many different brands over the years and i am very happy with this one the best one yet,33,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i spent hours reading deep fryer reviews and i could not make up my mind which was the best one then one day in the wal-mart i saw this fryer and thought that is it I am just buying it well boy I am glad i did this fryer is easy to use cooks perfect and looks great i am so happy with my purchase I have made taquitos apple fritters little apple pies soft crabs fish fillets donuts wings and more the food does not stick to the basket i have no problems with the magnetic safety cord and the outside gets warm but not enough to burn which is important with my 3 kids running around the basket is not too small for this family of 5 i highly recommend this fryer,128,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,first model was dis functional returned and got unit that worked beware cool touch still requires heat resistant gloves to touch while the unit is turned on I have been able to successfully fry anything from fries fish calamari and much more excellent working quality for the price,47,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,2.0,negative,i bought thisabout 6 months ago it had all the features i wanted was easy to break down and clean but it looked cheaply constructed now after 6 months the lid does not seal well and the handle on the fryer basket has broken which is a big safety hazard next time i will spend a little more money and buy a cuisinart,64,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,2nd time i used this fryer the timer know twisted off unfortunately the knob is made of plastic and is connected to a metal rod when i twisted the timer the metal rod stripped out the plastic do not buy this fryer,42,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i must say this is actually my first deep fryer and it is an excellent pick the deep fryer is huge and easy to use i feel safe and comfortable having it on the counter it is cool to touch a great buy,43,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we have owned this vacuum for 2 years and counting the only negative i can think of is that one must replace the hepa filter every 6 months however this is the standard rule for hepa filters and for 10 bucks on amazon it is considerably cheaper and more convenient than using a bag-type unit contrary to other reviews i have never had a problem with this vacuum in fact it consistently fills up the bag-less container every time we vacuum we were amazed with the amount of dirt this thing picks up we did not expect much when we purchased this vacuum due to the price but considering we use it about 15 - 2 times per week I had say this has been one heck of a bargain,126,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,this vacuum blows literally the exhaust fan blows in front of the vacuum at floor level so it blows everything you want to sweep ahead of you and into the air and you will never catch it until what is to heavy to become air borne is stopped by a wall this is not obvious on a rug because the rug camouflages it and holds the dust better but just try it and see on a bare floor granted you can overcome this design flaw by sweeping backward or only using the tools granted it also has good suction but that just means a stronger airflow coming out of the exhaust i bought this on the recommendation of consumer reports and i already wrote them a letter and told them to test it again hopefully with someone who knows how to vacuum i did not believe the previous amazon reviews that point out this problem because there has always some one who is not happy my mistake check out the other reviews and do not buy,169,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i got tired of having to drag out my big vacuum and having to switch heads everytime we have got mainly wood floors and a few area rugs and this little vac goes from one to the other with ease,39,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i have a bad back and two dogs that she had profusely when i read consumer reviews recent report that recommended this vacuum as being both powerful and light weight i thought this might pick up all the dog hair and not hurt my back i ran right out and got one i found it to be cheaply made which was sort of expected with it is 50 price tag it did a semi-ok job on hardwood floors but when i moved to carpet the suction was so strong that i could barely push or pull it and even although the suction was strong it only picked stuff up on the side that had the air in-take when i went to empty the dirt holder which had a lot of dog hair in it i tipped it upside down over the trash and nothing came out i had to shake it with all my might to get the thing to empty and then the filter fell out in the trash so i had to get that now-dirty thing replaced before i could finish up my back really hurt after vacuuming one floor with it needless to say this thing is being returned as soon as possible,201,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,no problems so far cleans very well just sounds awefully loud what do you want for 50,17,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,we bought this vacuum three months ago and my experience has been similar to the other 1-star reviews it is not worth the money it indeed blows dust on hardwood floors and is basically ineffectual on those surfaces we sweep first then vacuum the pile with one of the attachments and this really defeats the point of having a vacuum then the brush roller broke after 3 months just like the other writer noted it does not turn true it sounds like it is bearings are shot we got it out before it broke the belt or destroyed other internal parts no abuse to it otherwise it is just a faulty part that is not covered by warranty and is now out of stock for another month this is a very bad product and horrible corporate support as a customer you should be skeptical of buying any product from a company that does not stand behind their units this is yet another example of the evils of big-corporation america,164,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,vacuum supposed to have automatic height adjustment but nothing adjusts or changes for different carpet types contacted dirt devil twice and received different things to try but still does not adjust for different heights if you have different kinds of carpet this vacuum is not the one,47,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,this product works just fine in our home upstairs and downstairs i used to use it only on a couple rugs and hardwood floors but we have since moved to a place full of carpet carpet is bad enough but dirty carpet is worse this vacuum keeps it looking nice we have a toddler and it gets messy i have not had any issues with blowing dirt and yes the brush roll as with any I have owned will get stuck if there is too much hair string dental floss and more stuck on it in this case you take a scissors and cut it off then the belt will not burn and you can continue on with the vacuum,118,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend with carpeted floors i have hardwood and to me this is the most counterproductive cleaning device imaginable it literally blows dust away from you before you can get the suction part over the area there is a very powerful air output on the lower front of the cleaner right now i have dust bunnies and dog hair floating through my living room and am sneezing my head off as i write this if you want this effect you might as well sweep with a leafblower awful,96,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we like our dirt devil vacuum very much we were a little skeptical due to the price being low that it would not do the job we needed it to do we we were amazed and happy with it it does well on carpet as will as hard floors it is worth every penny i would recommend it to anyone wanting something smaller that does a good job it does a good job of picking up cat hair,78,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,bought this after reading reviews was not sure if i really wanted this type of vacuum as i am used to pulling around an old electrolux canister still getting used to the upright vacuum but boy does this thing suck up some dirt every time i empty the canister I am amazed and how much dirt I have picked up it is a very loud vacuum but I am over the noise factor when i see how much stuff it picks up,78,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,i can not say enough about this little vacuum it is absolutely amazing i have 2 dogs one of which sheds beyond belief and since i purchased this vacuum i have noticed less dust and hair building up around my house i use it at least every other day and i can not believe how well it performs i have hardwood floors throughout my home and before i purchased this vacuum i would have dog hair all around the floor and baseboards that seemed to build up when the ceiling fans were running since i began using this vacuum i rarely notice it anymore i just can not praise this vacuum enough,109,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,my husband and i have had this vacuum for about six years now it is been great we have not had any problems with it whatsoever it picks up unbelievable amounts of dirt and dust every time we vacuum you do have to change the filter every six months but other than that it is a good vacuum and has lasted us many many years and still going strong,66,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i know that many people do not like this machine but i think it is great maybe it is because my old vacuum is a canister and almost 30 years old it was top of the line when i got it and still works perfectly the dirt devil was so cheap that i thought I had buy it and have an extra vacuum on another floor I am glad i did i have three cats and this thing picks up the fur like nothing I have ever used i did not find that emptying the container and cleaning the filter was all that messy if you do it in a deep trash container it is no big deal it is a lot worse to change the bag on my canister my only complaint is that it is very noisy my cats agree,132,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we can not keep vacuums in the industrial environment we work in this vacuum has worked good and is priced reasonably it is loud but what vacuum do you know that is quiet,32,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i have received this dirt devil about two weeks ago so far i have not been disappointed in what it has done i can pick this one up without a problem and can use it on the stairs without a problem the only thing wrong with it was that i did not get instruction on how to put it together and there was no screws and i had to find them,71,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,I have only had this a couple of months so I shall have to see considering the complaints from people whose units broke but so far I am pretty thrilled we have to vacuum the carpets quite often because of the puppy dragging in dirty roots and all manner of things from the back yard we have very hairy shedding dogs and it is been great to just pull out this little thing and make it all go away within a few minutes our old canister was so expensive and bulky and did not pick up as well also the rug in my bedroom is kind of strangely made and the canister did not pick up the dog hair from there at all this one does i do understand the complaint about blowing but ours has nonetheless done fine on hardwood love the bagless element if it only lasts one year it will have been well worth the price yes noisy i really could not care less update three years later the vacuum has finally had it the carpet brush no longer works although it is still semi-operational we will get the same model again such a great price,190,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,we bought this vacuum because consumer reports said it was excellent particularly on pet hair since we do have a pet and since i have long hair that is always getting caught in the carpet we bought it and think it works great all of the attachments work well it is a sporty red and really the only drawback is that it is quite loud but then again most vacuums are we love that it is bagless which seems a little more environmentally friendly and you can see through the canister so you know when it is full to empty it easy to use pretty lightweight and a good price highly recommended,108,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,roller and belt broke after a couple of months because hair got wrapped in it you also need earplugs because this vacuum cleaner screams,24,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i only used this once every few weeks and it broke after 4 months i called customer support and they were no help at all save your money,28,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,if i could attach a picture to show you what it picked up from our area rug i would and this is a rug i thought was clean already great performance for the price loud yes but I have heard louder before so I am not concerned with sound if it cleans this well i intend to use on rugs and carpets only so the blowing on hardwood floors does not concern me since i sweep and mop them anyway if you are a budget and want a good performer this is the way to go,92,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i have this vacuum and it is now broken the bearing that holds in the brush is made of plastic it started vibrating causing a horrible noise eventually the vibration caused the plastic brush to come out of place and literally melt from the friction of rotation no worries although you can buy a replacement brush for about 20 5 s h which comes to 25 on a 50 vacuum cleaner yeah right the f1 filters are very difficult to find in stores although i found one at target selling for 40 80 of the cost of the whole vacuum cleaner you can get them online most places want to charge at least 20 but amazon has them for around 8 the vacuum does not do hardwood / tile floors it is carpet only it is quite noisy too but that is probably expected for such a low price not worth it since it breaks so easily and replacement parts are too expensive relative to the original low cost,166,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,this is not [ counter to consumer reports ] good for hard surfaces it blows all light material away from the vacuum with dog hair it is impossible other negatives very loud on / off is not for people with large shoes not overly ergonomic very disappointed,43,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,great price for a great vacuum it is very powerful and flexible and gets the job done fast,17,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,there are more hooks than needed so you can fit the highest ammount of unusual sized mugs i bought two and fit 6 regular mugs on one and only 4 giant mugs on the other my narrow width shelves are set in so the rack slips on and does not get in the way of the doors the mugs hang freely which means theyforward so i can not slam my cupboard doors or I shall smash my cups but who does that anyways the doors close easily the metal holder does stick up on the upper part however it is symmetrical so large flat plates fit nicely or bowls centered but i would not put more cups above it without laying a flat cutting board or something similar overall the best looking mug racks durable well balanced and above all else functional,143,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this mug holder looks nicer than many but the way it is built it is virtually useless unless you have very skinny shelves it is all one piece that is supposed to slide onto a shelf but if it is not a small shelf it will not fit unless you bend it far apart then once you get it on the shelf you can not put anything directly above it due to the thickness of the piece that holds it in place it causes anything up there to fall over because it can not sit straight i am going to be purchasing a different unit because this is pretty much worthless,107,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this holder is pretty cool but i have 2 problems with it first it has pegs to hold 8 cups but i can not get 8 of my cups on it and my cups are not overly large second because of the way it fits over the shelf the door of the cabinet hits the arms and prevents the door from closing all the way i can deal with both of these problems and consider them minor so i still give the holder 4 stars,83,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like this mug rack as it keeps my coffee cups out of the cabinet and within easy reach there is a smallin the cabinet door where i have put this but it is not noticeable,37,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i bought two racks for all of my coffe cups i love them extremely good price,16,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not work for me so i gave away,8,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if you have the 3/4 width shelf this will be a snug good fit it holds six normal coffee mugs probably would hold eight matched tea cups happy with the purchase,31,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,smaller spaces than expected my mugs do not fit in it,10,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,a couple things while i really like theand design visuals the racks are too small to hold most of todays sized cups i can squish three together the weight of the coffee mugs is bending the pronged portion of the rack down and away from the cabinet i do think these are good quality but only if you are using them for small 6 - 8 oz cups nothing larger,69,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i do not realize it did not bolt to shelf but it actually works better than i would of expected had it bolted no problem at all with hanging my cups,29,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,if you have normal size coffee cups or mugs do not expect to be able to fit one on each hook i was able to fit at most 3 on each side and they still clanked together however my teacups fit quite nicely be aware although if your shelving is in anyway robust enjoy the struggle of attempting to slide this puppy on there,63,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,hooks need to be farther apart can not fit a reasonable amount of cups to actually save space,17,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i collect pretty big mugs so i can only use 3 hooks on each side but it is really easy to install keeps my mugs safe and saves a bunch of shelf room,32,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the hooks are so close to the shelf it is difficult to put the cup over the hook to get it on or off it will not hold 5 cups on each side only 3 to the most,37,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not hold as many cups as advertised because you have to use every other rung,16,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,while the hooks were too close together to hang my mugs i will use it to hang belts and scarves in my closet it is very well made and fits over the closet shelf without the screws good product can you make a version that allows for larger mugs,49,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very sturdy and i like that it is for 10 cups not 8 like others because of the design the cups nest in each other and i love that because it looks more organized,34,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not fit all the cups to small unless you have small tea cups,14,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,actually holds 6 - 8 big mugs so i am satisfied,9,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,love this it definitely does not hold 10 cups unless they were tiny but i easily got 6 on exactly what i wanted,22,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,love this very sturdy and heavy duty was worried that the weight of the mugs would not hold but this is super reliable and it has gel grips to keep it from sliding around my mugs are bigger so it only only 6 but i already knew that from reading previous reviews overall a great purchase and a space saver in our apartment kitchen,63,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i have pretty small cups and i can not put the all in on one side,15,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,fit next to my coffee maker perfectly i wish the hooks were spaced a bit bigger but not bad,19,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,seems fairly sturdy however hooks are too narrowly close together i was looking for more of a hanging mug display for a cosmetic,23,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,do not like it at all would like to return,9,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,how does anyone actually fit more than 2 or three mugs on each side i thought this would be a space saver for my cupboard but it really does not do much i can not fit neatly the amount of mugs on it as advertised,43,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,these would have been great if it fit over he shelf it has to be a thin shelf,18,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is a great rack for small cups in order to use all of the hooks if your cups are bigger you can only put 2 cups on each side but it worked for me i bought 2 of these i have small cups for one rack and the other holds my 4 larger cups make sure that you think about the height of your cabinets your cups will hang down and you may have to raise your shelf up a little i did,85,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i wish i would have listened to the other reviews this looks like a great product but it will not fit all the way in the cabinet if you bend the top piece to make it fit then the top arm sticks up and you can not use that part of the shelf,51,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i could only fit three coffee cups on each side and it is not the space saver i expected,18,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very attractive and sturdy storage for my mugs without losing more of my very limited cabinet space,17,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i do not know why people leave such low stars for these they are great you can not fit 10 normal sized coffee cups on one but you can fit 6 works for us,32,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,wow i love it it does not look cheap it fits nicely on myshelving unit,16,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,had a very hard time trying to get it on my cabinet after i did i wanted to move it but did not want to go through all the trouble again so i just took it down and gave it away,40,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,just got these in and i agree with other reviewers that they are not good for sliding onto standard shelves at all measuring toward the joint there is only a half inch between the arch of the holders and the bracket i got it about 4 arches in before having to give up with the outside portion no longer lying flat in doing so i also broke one trying to open up the bracket enough to slide the last arch on it looks like some of the mounting posts for the screws are bent too far inward my shelves are 3/4 thick gave up ended up screwing them into the bottom of the shelves which i had purposefully bought this particular product to avoid it is nice looking and works in half it is capacity but do not purchase if you are hoping to slide this onto a shelf more than 1/2 thick too big of a gamble that you will get one that will not slide on edit 2 to 1 star they hold about 2 3 coffee mugs on each side so a total of 4 for me depending on the depth of your shelves,194,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,was too narrow to fit on our standard size shelf and broke when i tried to expand it,18,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,trying thisbecause the books are too close together and they do not hold coffee cups because of that shipping was on time but the product definitely did not do what was described,33,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,space saving way to store mugs as well as display your favourite ones we have ours over the sink can only hold 3 mugs per side although or they do not hang properly maybe if you had tea cups but who does that,42,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this is a greatbut it was way bigger than i thought and hung down a lot lower if i use it i can not have any mugs below it so it does not really save space also you can not fit a mug on every hanging piece maybe every other one even for smaller mugs it is a greatthough hopefully they can update it with a few changes to make it work better,77,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,bought this for inside my cabinet but it just does not fit quite right and the weight of the mugs seems like it might be an issue over time so I am going to try mounting it under my cabinets hopefully then I shall be able to safe store more than 2 mugs on it if not i will be returning it,59,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not fit over the lip of my cupboard,8,40

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,love it it will only hold 6 med size coffee cups if you had small coffee cups it might hold 10,21,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected holds 6 normal size coffee mugs,10,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works good but is definitely meant for smaller cups i have to leave an empty hook in between my larger mugs,21,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,our china cups look great hanging where people can see them,10,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,cup hooks stink which is why i prefer this little under the shelf unit fills the same purpose as cup hooks but without drilling into the shelves,27,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,fits great on the shelf of my kitchen cabinet holds about 6 - 8 regular size mugs comfortably besti ever purchased saves me room and the mugs do not fall all over the place anymore no more stacking the mugs life changer laughing out loud woohoo,44,51

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these do not sag and I am not using the screws because I am a renter at least they do not sag enough for me to see it with the naked eye and I have got these loaded up completely full with china teacups and glass / stainless steel espresso cups if i were hanging big ceramic mugs on them yeah they would probably sag but as it is right now they are doing a beautiful job rescuing my awkwardly sized kitchen,74,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works but hanging design could have been better,8,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,bought for son to use he likes a lot promptly shipped and good price value,15,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i had to return the mug holder it does not hold 10 mugs it holds maybe 4 you have to skip a hook between mugs to get them to fit and I am not talking about huge mugs i tried with regular coffee cups,43,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,unfortunately my shelves were to wide and it did not fit very well made,13,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,a little hard to install once you get to the very end of the unit tight fit once installed worked great wish i would have put it in a different location so that i can have my entire cabinet but oh well gave me room to put 4 mugs on the rack could not hold 10 if i tried on it and my other 4 mugs below the unit,67,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,fits the shelf and looks cool but did not really realize until i tried it that it will not fit ten full size mugs they knock into each other as the hangers are so close together still fits six nicely and could fit ten smaller cups,45,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,even although it has 10 prongs you will only be able to fit 6 normal sized cups on it,18,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this rack looks nice but I am pretty sure it is made for a expresso cups or super tiny coffee cups i could only fit 4 average sized mugs on it i ended up putting my measuring cups onto shower curtain rings and hanging them from it so it would not be a complete waste of money,55,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,disappointed that it does not hold as many mugs as there are hooks only holds six total,16,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,received the product as described in product posting and received it fast worked great under our kitchen cabinet,18,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,after reading all the reviews i still went out and brought this product figured i can make it work wrong this is a waste of money can not even get 4 mugs on there let alone 10 the hooks are way too close to each other preventing other mugs to hang on decided to just get mug hooks at home depot and screw them in under the cabinets,66,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the ad shows a picture of it being clipped to the shelf above it this can not be done even the detail shows a sizeable opening in the clip but it is less than l/2 and much too small to clip to the standard kitchen shelf if installed with screws it will hang so low as to make the shelf below unusable so no space saving at all in fact you could stack the cups in less space than this would take up,83,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,unfortunately i could only get 4 mugs on it so it is back in the box would cost me too much to return it so it will sit here until i can perhaps find someone who can use it,38,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,did not fit on shelf or under cabinet possible design flaw or it might be our cabinets as they are older either way we could not use it,26,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,will buy again perfect size for shallow cabinets and shelves,10,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this only fits very small mugs normal sized mugs must be placed on every other rung and get crowded you also can not place anything on the top shelf because that is where it slides in takes up more room than it creates,41,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,can hold 6 regular morning coffee type mugs and allows me to put a few more cups and mugs between the arms in the cabinet this is a cute addition to my coffee area of the kitchen,37,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,cool concept to save space but did not fit the shelves nor the varying mugs placed into it,17,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not fit my cabinets so will try to use in china cabinet if it does not work I shall return,18,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this did not fit under my shelf properly the bar at the top that is supposed to slide onto the shelf did not slide on properly i returned it,29,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is a beautiful well made product that is exactly what i was looking for I am enjoying it in my kitchen it would also work great in a closet for scarves beautiful design and very sturdy,36,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,liked the first one so much i bought another,9,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,not a bad product but small spacing would only work with tea cups,13,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,it does not let you close door cabinet it sticks out not attractive and very small tea cups fit will return,20,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,look closely at the write up i did not but the product will work anyway,14,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,the hooks are a bit close together meaning i have to space my mugs two hooks apart but i just bought two of these to make up for it problem solved,32,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,the hooks are too close together for standard size mugs i use them for my tea cups so it is perfect to keep from stacking the delicate china,27,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted keeps my coffee mugs near my espresso machine and with my other coffee supplies i did not install it under the cabinets so have not used the included screws,32,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,does not really hold many mugs 4 to 6 since the arms are poorly spaced i did not install it because it was pretty worthless,24,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is exactly what i was looking for,8,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,do not waste your money by playing around you might get six small mugs on this but it does not even fit well on the shelf unless your cups nest perfectly they just hang down all wibbly wobbly big disappointment,38,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,perfect for my tea cup collector daughter might have to order another one,13,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,disappointing it looks nice but when installed i can not get the door on one of my brand new kitchen cabinets fully closed now why did not they test this product in real kitchen cabinets before they started selling them earlier i had purchased one of the under the shelf 10-hook space saver espresso cup storage drying rack cupboard mug holder mygift now that one fits perfectly unfortunately i bought the last one available from amazon and the message is that they do not know when it will become available again that is really a shame because it is a far superior product to the one from spectrum after all what use is an under-the-shelf cup holder that sticks out so you can not shut the cabinet door,125,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it will not hold 10 mugs and if you moun it to slide onto shelf the closet doors do not close and if you screw oount it under the shelf you lose too much room in the cabinet and again it will not hold all the mugs it is supposed to hold,52,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,made for use inside the cabinet to narrow to fit underneath,10,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very sturdy and well-made fit my 3/4 inch shelf perfectly without wobbling around the only drawback is that my mugs face a different direction than i prefer i just put some s-hooks on them so the mugs are shown better with the side design facing forward also saving space with hanging longer mugs,53,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the hooks are too close together you can only put 2 mugs on each side and you end up with not enough room below for other cups i can fit things much better in my shelf by just shoving them in I had return it if i had not thrown the packaging out darn,52,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works although the spacing between is too small to really store 10 coffee cups,14,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,way too small did not fit more than 2 mugs on each side,13,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,if you can find a shelf that works with this holder it is a really great little organizer i was not able to use it in my kitchen cabinets but it works great on my pantry shelves it is sturdy and is holding 10 tea cups easily it would not hold 10 mugs because the mugs were too big to all fit on the hooks,63,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,great product make sure you do not have any word thick trim inside your cabinets or this product will not fit,20,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,product quality is ok can be mounted under cabinet with the screws provided not sure how much weight can be placed on this rack,24,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,these are too narrow to fit on a shelf with trim so unless it is a bare shelf the rack will not fit i would advise against these,27,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,okay for tiny cups not regular sized cups,8,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not slide fully into the cabinet about an inch stuck out i had to return it,16,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,good product had a little trouble fitting under shelve but i made it work,14,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,hangers were too close together for my mugs granted i like huge coffee mugs and expected to have to use every other hook but i could not even put two to one side useless to me,35,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is going to work for me and I am getting more for my smaller coffee and tea cups easy to put on heavy,23,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it works for me but it definetly does not fit big mugs uniformly if your cabinet shelf is not set back from the door you can not use the the two hooks on the end but it frees up space so you can fit them underneath all in all i like it and am glad i purchased it,57,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the product literally fell apart 2 days after sliding it onto my shelf thankfully there was no damage to my cups,21,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,awesome product fits about 6 cups depending on size,9,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,seems sturdy and like thebut no way can fit 5 standard mugs on each side much more appropriate for small tea cups espresso cups or cups that all fit within each other I am fitting maximum of 3 on each side still helps clear out space on shelves,49,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,can not hang mugs as holders too close together worthless as mug holder,12,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,a bit tight can not hand mugs only smaller tea cups,10,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i definitely would not buy this again i have standard run of the mill cabinets in a house built in 2006 nothing unusual i had to pound the poop out of this thing with a hammer to get it to fit it is definitely made for super skinny cabinet shelves can store up to ten mugs or tea cups I am not sure where they are getting their mugs but it might fit 10 espresso cups I am giving it 2 stars because at least it is sturdy,84,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i hesitated to buy this for a few months after reading some of the reviews however after finally purchasing it I am happy to give this product 5 stars it fits on my shelf perfectly it holds 10 cups perfectly does exactly what it says and looks nice too,48,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,did not fit right as my shelf was to thick also you can get a coffee mug on every hook as there is not enough space,25,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this is for small cups i can only get 4 mugs on it you can not really tell that until you try it,22,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,very poor design does not even hold teacups correctly,9,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is the second one i bought the first one worked out so well that after receiving new disney mugs for christmas i bought another just like the first one,30,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,perfect for my cafe cups frees up shelf space for other cups,12,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,construction andare fine just very poor design shelf must be very thin maybe 1/4 inch for it to slide onto shelf i had to break off first hook just to get it to work even poorly disappointed to find one on same search page that does not have this flaw not worth the effort to return so it is lost bucks figure out what I am talking about before you buy,70,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works great if mugs are too heavy although it will droop solved by securing it with thread,17,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,easy to install does not hold 10 normal size cups had to skip holders to get 6 to fit but you can put 2 cups per holder for a total of 12,31,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,you can only fit a few coffee cups on it,10,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like this product a lot it keeps my coffee cups handy just if you want to hang mugs will use only 3 hangers from each side,27,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this is a ridiculous design the hooks are only an inch and a half apart you can not hang mugs or tea cups it only has one function to hang cups and it does not do it i am send ing mine back it is neither use nor ornament,49,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,good quality and design but i had to return it because it would not slide on to the cabinet shelf as one of the pictures theis too narrow for my new cabinet which has thicker shelves however it also comes with 4 screws for mounting if you are fine with drilling on your cabinet i did not want to drill any extra holes on my new cabinets,68,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works great all of our coffee cups and stemmed glassware are hanging by these under our cabinets it pretties up our kitchen and it frees cabinet room these holders are also really sturdy,33,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,good quality but did not fit in my cabinet properly,9,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this would have work if my mugs were tiny the hooks are too close and i could not fit more than four mugs,22,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these look super wonderful in my cupboards they do fit 4 large mugs comfortably on each rack as is what i was expecting from other reviews great space saver and very secure,32,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works great for mugs that are all the same type if you have large worlds best dad type mugs this will probably only hold six,25,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this thing works ok but the spacing for normal mugs seems a little too close together we can fit 6 mugs rather than 10 if you have tiny mugs or mugs that nest inside each other really well then this would be great also keep in mind the measurements of this and the depth of your cabinet some of these are different depths different listings similar product,67,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i could only put two mugs on each side I am not sure what they consider a mug but mine are bigger than a cup i could not even get eight of my china coffee cups on this hanger without them stacking totally disappointed in the description of this,49,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,the spaces are to short between the hooks so you can not hang out 6 cups of regular size,18,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i brought this to try and reduce the amount of mugs in my cupboard only problem it only holds really small mugs and they have to be the same size i am only able to keep 4 small mugs on it i did not even bother to put up the second one i ordered,53,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,you need a very specific situation in order to be able to use thisadditionally i paid 1050 which i consider too high and thishas gone up in price what crazy your shelf to install it on has to be thin otherwise it will not slide on you have to have high distance from the stuff below otherwise you can not put anything on the shelf below it and you can not put anything on the shelf above it either junk unless you have a very specific use additionally do not bother trying to install it under the shelf unless you do not mind going to a hardware store to purchase the correct hardware the screw heads are too tiny to hold the dern thing up properly so you need either different screws or the correct sized washers should be able to install something like this in 10 minutes as it is it will take a lot more effort than i am willing to put forth in order to be able to hang 6 coffee mugs oh yea it will take 10 tiny ones little cutesy tea cups but not normal coffee cups for a red blooded american who drinks coffee,199,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it is sturdily made it attached to the underside of the cabinet with 4 screws and when fully loaded does not sag under the weight of 8 teacups consider your type of cups because anything more than cups that nest when stacked upright will not hang well or many mugs 4,49,135
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i have to return this because the hooks are too large i wanted to use it under cabinet for hanging my utensils it appears to be sturdy enough to hold heavy mugs very well,34,136
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i love it look good on lower shelf and fits perfect on 1/2 inch shelf cabinet door close perfect too,20,137
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,easy to mount under cabinet but barely holds 4 to 6 regular size mugs i would not have purchased this particular rack had i realized,24,138
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like it although it does not hold as many mugs as i expected it all depends on the size of the mugs to hold the described ten mugs it looks good and suits my needs i am pleased with the purchase,41,139
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,there are a lot of questions on thispertaining to how thick a shelf it can hang on and more i found that the slip over function fits a shelf made from a standard one by board so 3/4ths of an inch thick apporximately 25 cm i used it inside my kitchen cabinet freeing up valuable shelf space and the door closes just fine with it in place as the description indicates there are 4 spaces for screws if you prefer to mount it to the underside of a set of cabinets a lot of reviews noted that the hooks are spaced for small tea cups which is accurate meaning that using the standard american style coffee mug you will only be able to hang 4 maybe 6 mugs on this rack if you are clever it seems sturdy and well made the finish did not have any noticeable flaws that i could detect,153,140
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i can only use 3 of the 5 hooks on each side because they are too close together it barely holds 4 coffee cups on each side either way i have hooks on both sides that are empty,38,141
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very nice and sturdy price is pretty competitive with in-store retailers the rack fits snugly and securely onto the shelf almost too snugly the part that fits on the shelf is coated with a thin clear layer of plastic to ensure better adhesion my shelves are not quite 1/2 thick but i had to open up the rack to get it to fit on so that there was no excess poking out in the front try putting it on the shelf first to decide if you need to open it up a bit more although,95,142
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product really made my limited shelf space for my many mugs i am a semi-collector much less cluttered and much more neat it slides onto the shelf fine and is very sturdy the only thing i would like to say in a somewhat negative light is that like others have pointed out you are not going to be able to put a mug on each of the rings they are much too close together i have a variety of sizes of mugs but using my small normal sized mugs i can only fit 6 3 on each side however i ended up purchasing two of these and they work absolutely great for what i needed,116,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this did not work on my shelves the opening for sliding over the shelf is really narrow and would not slide over my shelves in the cupboard plus the hooks are so close together that you can only get two regular size coffee mugs on each side there is no way you could put 5 coffee mugs on each side,58,144
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it is called a mug holder but it does not really fit mugs mine are small as mugs go under 4 and i can only fit on every other hook also can not use hooks closet to door as interferes with door closing with a mug on it kept it as i have not found a better over the shelf holder i do not want to make holes in my new cupboards maybe should be called a cup holder,75,145
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,true it holds 6 of my mugs perfectly but that is all i needed it for so it works great for my needs i love it,25,146
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if you have traditional coffee cups the ones that look slightly larger than a tea cup then you can get away with just one if you have american sized coffee cups or larger 12 oz get more a 10 oz cup is about the limit if you expect to get one on each rung i managed to fit my 16 oz cups on each rung but it looked awful very cluttered however once i set it up for every other rung it looked fantastic the quality is good i have 1inch thick open shelves and this gripped them nice and tight if you have something thicker or need to close a door over it i would suggest a mounted system or hooks instead there are two screws included if you feel your shelf may need extra reinforcement i felt they were unnecessary in my case overall a really great product,148,147
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,holds only four standard sized mugs that is it i supposed if you really really small mugs this would be of use but who has and uses tiny mugs,27,148
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,great little gadget and it needed a high score think this is the coolest thing to have in my kitchen everyone who has coffee cups or needs things to hang stuff,31,149
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,the quality of the material is very goog for the price and it looks very nice too the only bad thing it only holds 4 big mugs,27,150
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,only small tea cups will fit on this rack any kind of mug is to large to use all the hooks i had to return it,26,151
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it did what i she wanted it could be less obtrusive that is a muted gray the hooks could be movable for spacing,22,152
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,do not believe for one second that this product will hold 10 mugs as advertised it holds 6 mugs and they are all knocking into each other beware they list this product as an under the shelf mug holder yet the box says under the shelf cup holder which explains why it can not hold the advertised 10 mugs i give it 2 stars to be nice because it does screw under the shelf and hold some mugs so it does what i needed in a sense but they are complete liars when they say holds 10 mugs,97,153
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,just what we needed real space saver easy to install and looks good glad i got two happy to shop at home,22,154
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works just as described would buy this product again without a doubt made the cluttered cabinet no sightly and good looking organized yeah does not fit one cup per rung i attached with small bolts through the cabinet shelf and worked for me used for eight cups,46,155
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,our shelf was a little too thick to just slide it on but it mounted nicely under the shelf screws were provided but i added flat washers to provide more holding area i looks like it could hold 10 cups but i think they would have to be very small i used every other hook and got three smallish mugs hanging on each side overall it is a really nice space-saver since plates or saucers can be stacked underneath,78,156
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works for mugs but if the mugs are larger you can only place a cup on every other hanger may hold six at best i placed it under our cabinet and above the coffee maker for convenience but use it more for decoration rather than for the cups i actually use,51,157
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this thing is perfect for making use of extra space in a small condo kitchen some reviewers have complained that they can not fit cups on all of the racks these are coffee drinkers that apparently have never heard of espresso cups anyway this thing will hold 6 coffee cups or 10 espresso cups,54,158
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,only gave it 4 stars as it does not hold as many cups as it is suppose to but it does work would i buy it again no if you have tea cups it will work fine,35,159
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this is listed as a mug holder however mugs do not fit it is a cup holder it was good quality but did not meet my needs,26,160
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this rack is way too small for mugs small cups like the older corelle would be fine but anything being described as a mug can be stored on this rack,30,161
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i was looking forward to having an elegant looking holder / rack in my cupboard unfortunately this one did not fittoo narrow so i ended up returning it,27,162
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,bought it to hand mugs and coffee cups and i can only fit small tea cups on it correctly because where it mounts,23,163
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i bought this under shelf mug holder to display my coffee cups in the china cabinet it works great with regular size coffee cups have nohow it would do for mugs it was a perfect fit for what i needed,42,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if hanging coffee mugs was an art form then this thing would be displayed in the louvre or whatever it is nice it is holds coffee mugs since it does it is job there no need to boil into a literary rave on the thing,41,165
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it was so hard to put on my shelf i finally gave it up and donated ti to my local thrift store hopefully some one will get some use out of it,32,166
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this works well for smaller mugs you could only get probably 4 large mugs on this that said it is sturdy well made and attractive,23,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it looks fine but the cup hooks are not far enough apart so you have to space out your cups please note i said cups not mugs if you wish to hang mugs it is even worse i have smaller than normal cups and i can not hang one on every hook because they get in each others way poor design should have spaced the hooks out further,66,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i like this rack it is easy to use i put it under my cabinet for easy reaching the cups,20,169
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this unit is made fairly sturdy and looks pretty good but it is touted as being able to hold 10 cups however i have regular-sized cups and i can get only 3 per side there is no way at all that one could get 5 per side unless those cups were doll-house cups haha i bought this to utilize under the shelf space but I am only able to use 60 of the advertized capacity I am going to keep it because it is not a bad unit however it is actually not what i was wanting or expected,95,170
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,installs pretty easily there has enough tension in the lip that i did not need screws to mount it the last cup moustache was taller than the other two so i had to hammer it flatter to make the whole thing fit on my cabinet shelf a bit more flush also i think it could have been designed a bit better the front hanger moustache is too close to the door so you hit a cup with a horrible sound every time you close the door looks like it fits 10 cups but it is more like 4 comfortably or 6 if you jam them in there wish i got a sideways one,110,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product is made with good quality it does exactly what it is suppose to do it fits perfectly in the cabinet and holds your coffee cups the downside you can only put smaller mugs on the rack because larger ones takes up too much space,44,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it would be great for thin shelfs it is great for tea cups made a lot of room in my cabinet however my kitchen shelf is thick and my husband put it on the shelf because it was to tight for me to due,44,173
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product is exactly as described in the advertisement it was everything i expected it to be and i am pleased with the quality of the,27,174
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i wish the hooks were further apart so that it could handle mugs better i hate leaving hooks un-used quality is ok,22,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,to small will not work with even small mugs makes shelf above not usable gave it to someone else and they do not like it,24,176
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these are really difficult to put up by yourself but it is possible and they are really cool when you have finished,21,177
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,as expected easy to install sturdy i can only fit 6 standard cups instead of the 8 suggested it works,20,178
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i intended to screw this to the underside of my cabinet which worked wonderfully so the size of the arm versus the size of my shelving was not an issue for me i like the way it looks in the kitchen and was able to get several mugs on it however the prongs are not spaced quite as far apart as i had anticipated and the mugs hang very close together which means some of the larger ones do not fit at all when placed directly next to each other i chose to hang my smaller mugs and teacups which incidentally were also what i planned to hang in the first place a few larger mugs could fit if they were staggered although it would be pointless for someone to purchase thisif only half of the space were available for use i am happy enough with it that i am purchasing a second one,156,179
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,not made to hang normal coffee cups only for the tea cup type can you fit more than 4 cups,20,180
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i ordered this product because it is similar to an undershelf wine glass holder which i really like although it has 8 hooks it does not hold 8 coffee mugs i even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks which would eventuallyto chipping it barely fit over the cabinet shelf although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem buy this product only if your coffee / tea cups are very small,78,181
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,the product arrived in time and was as pictured however i could not put it on the bottom of my cupboards as i originally planned due to the size of my cupboard which is a bummer but not the products fault,40,182
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this is a very eye pleasing rack so i am glad to use it on my wire shelves that i use as a pantry in my kitchen i just used the plastic zip thingies and attached it to the closest wires on the rack and snipped off the excess looks fine but when i went to hang my coffee cups i was very disappointed with the spacing of the hooks and could only manage to hang 4 cups i have 12 and 4 other hooks i guess i should get rid of a few but they are all really nice mugs sanga mikasa and more i guess i could use a set out in the garden other than that i really like it and may order a few more and hang other items off of them,135,183
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,main problem i can not place normal sized mugs on all the arms because there is too little space between each one it is a pretty major design flaw i think it would work as designed if you were only hanging expresso size cups i can not comment on the under-shelf feature as i mounted mine under the cabinet last issue is that because it is mounted the weight of the mugs causes the side that would otherwise be supported by the cabinet to sag i would look for a different product if you are interested in hanging more than 4 normal or oversized mugs from the holder,104,184
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i do like this product it fits nicely in my cabinet and holds 8 mugs notice there are 5 hooks but in my cabinet only 4 mugs can fit on each side because of the space i suppose with more room or if i put under my cabinet not inside then all 5 would fit on each side overall i really like the product and i will probably order another one,71,185
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i really love this thing it comes with four screws that you can use to hold it in place but i find that it works just fine without them i do have little tea cups so i can not comment on how well the oversized mugs work hanging on it but for my cabinets it is a great space saver i also like that it looks interesting unlike all the other styles i found it measures 105 inches deep 9 inches wide and hangs down almost 2 inches under the shelf,90,186
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,these are designed for tea cups that fit into each other not for coffee mugs as they are to big and do not fit into each other,26,187
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i bought this to create more space and it did nothing but take it up it does not hold all the cups it says it will it is not worth the money i spent on it i would not recommend this to anyone buyer beware,43,188
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,he has big he has gross exactly what we wanted we are putting rats in the rafters of our boatas a princess bride-themedand he has representing one of the rounited states needed to make it right wish there were more styles,40,0

Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,2.0,negative,looks big in ad but i can guarantee you it is not as it appears sucker is only 7 1/2 tall and is totally misrepresented in the photo wrote to amazon and they said they would credit back the amount however i could keep the mini-rat do not waste your time ordering this piece of crap,55,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,not 18 inches tall not a costume not at all like the product description this is an overpriced 8 inch tall foam rat with a limp tail that is nasty looking buy 4 squeaky rats instead a much much better deal better quality just as spooky and realistic enough to catch a cats eye I am going to put this piece of junk out on the porch and hope somebody steals it,71,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,4.0,positive,it is as described cool decor for halloween back feet do stick up a little bit instead of lying flat on tabletop but stays upright,25,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,2.0,negative,i thought that this rat was 18 inches tall when received it was maybe 16 inches from head to tail disappointed but keeping it anyway,25,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,4.0,positive,cool rat for our halloween haunted house looks a little scarier when you put fake blood on it a good proper for any halloween display,25,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,perfect for hiding in the yard and scaring the unsuspecting many laughs also seems to spook the squirrels i hate squirrels so yay,23,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,4.0,positive,also for my teenage daughter as with the skull phone case she has weird tastes she would have liked it to be larger like her old one was twice the size of this one but she snuggles with it to sleep just like she did her old one,48,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,quality of what was received is not even close to thepictured what i got is like a soft rubber ball completely lacking the definition seen on the amazon store do not buy totally not worth your 300,35,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,just what the description says horrifying but that works if that is what you are into,16,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,this prop is pure garbage i love rats and collect a variety of rat-related items but this would not even be worth it if it were free i threw it straight in the trash not worth trying to return for the price seriously do not bother purchasing this,48,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,2.0,negative,the actualextremely lacks the details shown in the picture it was just acceptable for the low price not worth wasting the time to send it back but i certainly would not order it again,35,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,2.0,negative,not even close to 18 inches so the approximately 18 inches in the description is false disappointed was purchased based on description,22,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,I am not sure what ruler they are using to measure this 18 inch rat but they must fish a lot as well it measures maybe 75 inches very disappointed the quality looks ok but size does matter it is a lie,41,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,2.0,negative,do not sit up well and you can not correct it,10,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,the product description states product dimensions 15 x 5 x 4 inches 25 pounds not even close it stands 65 inches tall might be 12 inches from nose to tip of the loose plastic tail the back feet point straight up in the air and are not the type of material that you can even crease to lay flat the picture on the ad makes it look like a gnarly rat with at least bumps on the rubber the one that i got is almost completely smooth with almost no lines in it even waste of money,99,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,nice rat an option for led eyes would be nice,10,18

Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,he has great have him sitting on the dash of my rat rod i did replace his eyes with dark red beads so they shine in the light,27,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,what you get is not what is pictured it is more grayish then black it is only 8 inches the feet are paper thin no latex covers the bottom and what is exposed in the bottom is a blue sponge like filling it will not stand very disappointing this is being returned i paid 11 dollars for this not a huge amount but would expect something a little nicer i would not pay a dollar for this picture is very misleading,78,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,1.0,negative,not at all what is in the picture I had call this false advertising for 10 at big lots i could get the actual one which is three times the size but it is not halloween yet so i had to go with this one,43,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,this is a great joke piece to hide in a place a coworker will find it if you can set it up so that it moves when a cabinet or drawer is opened it is priceless it is an enclosed rubber form that looks hideous great price lots of fun you may not get it back and might be pranked on you someday,63,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,4.0,positive,not as scary as it looks in the pic but it will do,13,25

Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,5.0,positive,the picture looks really cool the actual thing not quite as good but still acceptable i read other reviews and decided to give this a try for the price i am satisfied what i got,35,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000H3UDM0,4.0,positive,i do not understand all the negative reviews guys it is a 6 dollar halloween prop laughing out loud it is not going to be top notch but i will say I am going to it is made decent it is foam filled latex it does have a solid latex bottom and mine stands up perfect i put it on the carpet stood fine then the table stood perfect and i like the evil red eyes and teeth on it so I am going to for 6 something it is worth it and will add to a halloween display i am happy with it,96,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i got this at an amazing price so i really can not complain it is light but provides amazing warmth and comfort my only discomfort is that the feathers come out from the comforter so getting a duvet cover would be a good,42,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was a little weary when getting this because usually the gold box items are not too great but i am so pleased with this purchase the blanket is warm but not too hot and is so comfy i love the softness of it and the brownis very nice i wish they still had them for sale because i would get another,63,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is a very thin and light weight comforter much thinner than expected but the price was right looks very nice on the bed it takes a few weeks for the wrinckles to come out shams are standard size even with the king set good buy,46,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was hesitant to buy these at first when i saw it in the gold box but then i said why the heck not my hesitation was due to the fact that i had way too many comforters however these were the first that i ever bought for myself the other ones were given to me as gifts this comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time i still need an extra blanket as usual since i can get very cold but it is a lot better than my old comforter like some other reviews said the pillow shams are pretty small but it is fine for smaller pillows a word of advice most likely your comforter will arrive extremely and i mean extremely staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box the solution i have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity so be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy,187,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter in the olive shade and it is gorgeous it is also soft light and very warm n cozy the husband n i love it sadly however the cats at least one of em do not this thing is loaded w / static if you touch it in the middle of the night you can see blue sparks my lil furry guy was acting all weird and did not want to jump up in bed w / us per usual when he finally did he stood at theof the mattress i unknowingly pulled him against me on the blanket welp blue sparks flew off him and he went a-runnin so sadly i can not really use this blanket unless we are purposely trying to keep him outta bed if ya know what i mean laughing out loud o,131,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this as a deal of the day special for 39 for that price it is ok but i would never pay full price the pillow shams are too small and the king size is too small for my king size matress i can use it as an individual comforter but then I shall have to dry clean preferred or launder it more frequently the cover does not come off the feather / down insides it is one piece that makes it a pain in my posterior the cover is very soft and the chocolatebeautiful it is nice and warm and very comfy it is quite lovely to look at and touch for that plus the cheap price I shall give it barely 4 stars for the undersize and launder problem i should give it no more than 3 stars,138,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,what a great product if you are looking for comfort and warmth without all the weight this is the perfect comforter love it so much i am going to buy 2 more in other colors would have given this product 5 stars if not for one thing that they do not mention in the description the pillow shams for the king comforter are not king shams as most all other king comforters come with to accommodate the width of the bed other than that a great buy,87,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,comforter can not hold the feathers had this over a year and i collected enough feathers to make my own pair of wings not to mention the feathers were not clipped so they hurt if they poke you beautiful looking as long as it is not intended to be used to sleep on,50,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it was very nice looking until the feathers started coming out they would poke and poke and i had a very thick blanket under it but the feathers were so horrible i only used thisfor about 2 weeks,40,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,did not last that long it started to lose it is shape after a short time and the feathers kept coming out alot i would not buy it again,26,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was so very nice and more than i even expected for the price the value was excellant it really made the room,23,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this in 07 and I have used it every other week since and it now 13 the only complaint I have had is that the pillow cases never stay on an entire night I have washed it numerous times I have never had feathers escape quality may have gone down since i bought it i also got it for under 35 back then,61,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,looking at the image and knowing it is microsuede urged me to purchase this comforter but the major problem is feathers keep coming out of it i can probably fill up a coffee mug of feathers in just a week of using this comforter seller should have thought of sealing the inside really good or even trying these before selling 2 thumbs down for this I am guessing in a month this comforter would be featherless,74,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i recieved this shipment promtly and was very happy with the quality for the price this was for my teenager and she was very happy very warm implanning on getting a set for my husband and i as well,39,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers coming out of everywhere was soft but could not sit on the bed without being stuck by a feather threw it away,23,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a lot for the moneyvery true easy to care for washes like a dream highly recommend and worth every penny,23,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was staging my house to sell and the stager wanted two red bed spreads on the bunk bed i could not find them anywhere so i bought these ones from amazon i am delighted they are very classy in appearance very suede-like my kids like them a lot and they are soft and cozy for sleeping when i eventually wash them i will certainly wash on delicates cycle and line dry to avoid any feather poking issues as mentioned by others i bought them for staging but i am bringing them to the next house no question,98,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,all the critical reviews were right the king size not quite big enough for a king size bed the filling is not very thick and the material on the back side is a little crinkly but whadda ya want for fifty bucks if you like microsuede it looks great and anyways how often does the comforter touch your skin with this one preferably never i can not say I am unhappy with the purchase the other reviews were real clear i went in eyes wide open it is a decent value and it serves it is purpose nicely but it is not a comforter you are likely to fall in love with when you pick it up those cost way more,115,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought two of these comforters for my boys twin bunk-beds they are cute to look at my boys love them and they are both easily able to make their own beds at 6 years and 4 years their old comforters were had to make and looked messy they look nice and neat even when they are played on i love that they are thinner so if you want a think plush comforter this is not it for you but it is perfect for us,82,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,after a week of use feathers began to poke out of the suede like there is no tomorrow they pinch you i would not recommend buying this comforter,28,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is warm if you can get past the feathers jabbing you in the neck arm rear end and falling out everywhere sharp tips to the feathers that seem to just fall out thru the material constantly picking up feathers off the floor would not buy this again and to top it off it is noisy must have used outside feathers and not down would not recommend this comforter,67,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the only reason this is not getting 5 stars is because it is not as thick as i expected but it gets the job done and keeps me warm thisis what i was looking for and the material feels nice i have not yet had any problems with feathers poking out,50,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i received this comforter about a month ago and i love it it is very plush and easy to wash while looking fantastic in my room the only thing i dislike is that when it came in the mail and i opened it i realized the pillow cases are huge looks like they are made for a body pillow as opposed to regular sized head pillows oh well although i just folded the extra fabric inside with the pillow and they are still very comfortable to lay on,85,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this microsuede feather king comforter set did not fit a king bed it was far too small in addition the comforter makes an odd sound as it moves a rustling noise that sounds like very cheap quality i was giving this as a gift and now am beyond the return date because it was just given back to me i was very disappointed in both the quality as well as the description this was definitely not as advertised i would give 0 stars if possible,85,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,product is nice to look at but that is the only good part when you move it it sounds like there has plastic in the inside layers also little feathers are constantly poking through and falling out of it,37,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the comforter would be all right if the feathers would not be poking through the material everyday i pull out 6 to ten feathers that are sticking out of this comforter,30,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,we use this thing for our guest bed and in limiting the stay of guests i suppose it does a good job however as a cover for a bed and while asleep it fails spectacularly the first thing you notice with this product is the sound it crinkles and sounds cheap the sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant then you notice the big fault it will not stay stuffed from the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50 of the feathers they are everywhere it makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use i would not buy this again and would indeed refuse it should someone offer it to me free of charge avoid at all costs unless you like a loose feather decor and the feel of amateur acupuncture,152,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i guess i do not have to say too much about this comforter set everywhere is feather keep poking my arms legs it is so annoying sometimes i get up and find feathers that stuck my t-shirt or short,37,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,looks as true and nice as pic no apparent flaws have not washed it yet but it does the job and reasonably priced,23,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,unfortunately in thisyou really do not get what you paid for just about every single feather that was sewn into the comforter has managed to slip out my bedroom at times looks like a chicken coop every time you look at the comforter all you see is little white feathers sticking out no matter how long you spend plucking the feathers out of the comforter there are always more and they hurt too it is not the fluffy side of the feather which sticks through it is the needle-sharp quill that always does manufacturer should have done a better job ensuring that their feather product stayed inside of the comforter,109,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is horrible all of the feathers fall out and poke you everywhere do not buy this trust me spend a little more and get down feathers these are the regular feathers and they poke out everywhere unless you buy a duvet cover that is like 4 inches thick do not buy this,52,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice comforter if it is not going to be used nice for spare room the feathers have a tendency to poke through the material and poke you if you lay on it just right I have had mine for about 3 weeks and it has lost hundreds of it is feathers do not be fooled into thinking you are getting a great buy because it was marked down from 11000 to 4000because it is not worth the 4000 i gave for it,78,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered thisto match thein my room thematched perfectly but i regret to say that this was a waste of 40 why well because after using the comforter for 3 nights the feathers started to come out from the comforter there are no holes in it but the feathers themselves poke thru the fabric and eventually make their way all the way out or they hang out half way and poke you all night if you sleep in the nude like i do horrible product i have no choice but to keep using it and cleaning up a few feathers here and there each morning until enough of them poke out to where it will stop at least that is my hope if not i will have to she shall out real money to buy a quality comforter from sears or macys and chuck this one in the trash where it belongs,156,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i got a king size and it looks fantastic but watch out after you wash it the feathers are constantly coming out and poking me it is annoying i would not recommend and it is too bad since it looks so great,39,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i have only the comforter for about 2 months the feathers inside are poking through the material on both sides which not only makes it uncomfortable to sleep with due to the quills coming through but makes a mess because of all the feathers on my floor it also becomes very unsightly my comforter is dark brown and the feathers being white causes it to look like there is something all over it the only good thing i can say is it definately keeps you warm,86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,like i said horrible cheap microsuede material and stitching down feathers poke through the microsuede and poke you in your sleep very painful and uncomfortable also the comforter just barely covers a queen sized bed wished i had never bought thisto begin with had to buy a completely different comforter,52,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered this comforter because i thought it would be a great comforter and very warm for this winter but i was wrong this comforter has alot of feathers that always she had every night and the ends of the feathers actually stick your skin if you do not pull it out once you see the feathers poking through i wish i had never purchased this comforter,66,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,took one wash before the feathers were poking out everywhere and it stunk like wet dog for weeks plural needless to say i donated this to a homeless man just a terrible product overall,34,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the most annoying blanket i have ever purchased the feathers seep out from the entire surface of the blanket i will be purchasing a new blanket this week since this brand new blanket is just a mess,39,38

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i did not notice that this comforter is filled with feathers while purchasing whole night feathers keep popping out of the comforter causing extreme discomfort i keep sneezing as well and worst thing is when we tried to wash it needless to say but all feathers have started popping out and it smells bad too please please never even think of buying this product if you want to have a good sleep in the night,74,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,in case you missed it as i did this comforter is stuffed with feathers not down not batting feathers the kind that have sharp quills that poke through the fabric and scratch your skin the kind that make noise when you turn over this bedding could not be more crackly if they stuffed it with corn chips and you will not want it anywhere near your skin unless you are wearing kevlar pajamas so unless your mattress is stuffed with straw and you drive a covered wagon to work give this one a pass,90,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i searched around for quite awhile looking for a red comforter set before deciding to buy this one unfortunently i did not read the reviews well enough or i would have noticed that it was complete junk i wake up every morning looking like a chicken because the slightest movement will because sharp tipped feathers to fall out i really wish i had sent it back but sadly i had taken it out of the bag and endured one night of it before i noticed this faulty manufacturing detail save yourself from a waste of money and many sleepless nights and buy another comforter,103,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,at first this product looks pretty good after a couple of days this comforter starter to drop feathers from both sides it was very uncomfortable because these feathers would stick to the pillows and sheets do not buy it,38,49

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,we bought this comforter because it was beautifull and a great price I have had down blankets before and i expect some feathers but this is ridiculous my whole house looks like a scene from witches of eastwick feathers constantly come out a few handfulls a day it is beautifull and warm and cozy i loved it other than the embarrasement of having to pluck feathers off everything i own i have ordered a duvet cover but i doubt that will help much do not waste your money,85,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,be aware this is not a down comforter and it is not described as one either we are talking full feathers with calamus if they are not stabbing you on one side are poking through on the other terrible product not worth half the price buy one and you will regret it,51,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the blanket is soft and very comfortable but the care was way to much trouble the cost to have this cleaned professionally was the same as buying a new one so i did what i could to clean it myself since the blanket was too big to really get clean in the washer and micro suede will melt / burn in the dryer i washed this in the bath tub and hung it to dry it was so hard to ring most of the water out and so heavy to move to hang the other thing i did not like was the feathers came out of the blanket so constantly that it was never without a lint covered look and there were always feathers everywhere to clean up you live and learn i now have a different blanket that is not filled with feathers,141,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,good price bad blanket the blanket has a good look to it but the actual usability is not good the feathers poke out and when under the covers and moving around the blanket sounds like sand paper or plastic bags rustling around it is warm enough but i wonder how long the warm will last with all the feathers coming out i would suggest this blanket for a guest room that is for show and does not get much use,76,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is a nightmare to say the least feathers are everywhere the feathers also stab you thru the material and make for a very very very unpleasant experience if you are considering buying this i advise you to think again worse purchase ever made on here people who sell this crap ought to be ashamed of themselves btw the only reason i gave it 1 star was because it would not let me leave it blank or put a negative star,81,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was so happy with the initial appearance of this comforter however i awoke in the first night to an eruption of feathers i felt like i was on the set of a horror movie revenge of the chicken feathers it felt like a million needles were sticking me and it was impossible to clean up i had to move to a new apartment and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only there is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again there are just too many feathers everywhere my maid rosario cursed and ran out of the apartment when she saw what had happened this comforter will ruin your life,113,60

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is a complete mess of a comforter i got a great deal on the price and yes it does keep you warm but at a price and the price is feathers everywhere I am not just saying a couple here and there I am saying this thing is a feather factory which puts out a handful of feathers daily if your goal is to make your bedroom look like a chicken coop then you will succeed if you purchase this blanket set if you trim pine branches outside and go to bed without getting all the sap off you will wake up looking like a bird man this blanket is currently in a garbage bag stored away in a closet waiting for an emergency of to annoy an unwanted house guest,130,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this about 2 months ago it was very staticky at first i did end up washing it and drying it according to label directions with no problems i am really diappointed in the amount of feathers that are constantly working their way out of this comforter although at night the pointy parts of the feathers stick through the sheets and it feels like needles when i have to take this off to change the sheets the feathers go everywhere and it seriously looks like a goose exploded in the bedroom i would not order this again nor recommend to friends or otherwise,104,63

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i purchased thisat more than i see others paid for and one reason i bought it was that it says machine washable i just opened it up and the first thing i see is dry-clean only wow what has the deal i feel cheated i do not do dry cleaning and now I am seeing a lot of complaints about the feathers poking through sigh,64,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this sucker has been moulting feathers since i put it on my sons bed also it crackles when you move it around price was cheap but if i would have known about the feather problem i still would not have bought it at the reduced price,45,71

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,purchased this for my daughter and my mother as their birthdays are in summer we have only begun to use them these comforters are soft and warm beyond belief theworks well with the sheet sets i purchased at the same time i am very pleased with these comforters and would buy more the price as always from amazon was extremely affordable the only negative is they are supposed to be dry cleaned but i plan to spot clean if necessary however the dogs are not allowed to sleep on them which was disappointing to them,96,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers are every where do not buy worst purchase I have made on amazon i do not know why it is still selling this thing should be off the market as soon as possible read the rest of the one star reveiws and take heed,41,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theis true to what you see here on the amazon website nice dark chocolate i recommend washing first since it is such a dark hue it can bleed on lighter colored sheets you may sleep with after time i washed as soon as i received it and had no fading issues provides great warmth as it is luxuriously full with feathers and the shams are perfect for regular sized pillows i gave it 4 stars because the feathers come out a little easily i have other microsuede feather comforters and this one definitely sheds more but still a great buy,100,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i brought the comforter in may 09 and did open the package until recently do not buy the blanket it bleeds feathers that stick you amazon should take it off the market i can not even return it since the 30 days are over,43,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i got it i thought that some reviews were exaggerated well i was wrong withing the first night i felt i was getting stabbed by hundred of little feathers and there a plastic sound every time you move the comforter which does not help if trying to sleep worst part it is waking up to the barb little stick on the feather sticking trough the comforter i send back because cleaning the feathers of something one week old was very tedious,79,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i like it so much that i have been thinking of ordering another one to have as a backup as for this particular amazon page i will never write another review unless amazon ceases at once to virtually dictate yes dictate what the reviewer should do give your customers some credit for intelligence by the way i just previewed what i wrote here and i did not check the box next to receive e-mail when customers comment on your reviews but when the preview page came up i was informed you did not request to be notified when customers comment on your reviews clearly anyone is more intelligent than whoever dreamed up this page,116,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,great price great colors but you would be more comfortable actually sleeping in a real bird nest complete with sticks and branches as well as feathers this comforter had the feathers sticking out everywhere pokey and painful and gross no possible comfortable position unless you sleep on it upside down,49,88

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks nice when you buy it however the feathers keep coming out and it sounds crunchy when you lay on it like there is a plastic bag in the middle of it weird but true,37,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter set black this blanket sucks the feathers poke out everywhere i have to constantly sweep and pick feather from my floor and bedspread i do not recommend this mess to anyone,38,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what was i thinking when i ordered a microsuede comforter i think i was thinking affordable down comforter and blanked everything else out it came with two microsuede pillow cases yet which will see the donation box before they see my head upon them the underside of the comforter is a weird material that makes a swooshing noise I have been using it for two weeks and it is already losing feathers but the very worst feature that i did not know before purchase is that it requires dry cleaning if only i had not used it right away i would return it why why why did i have to use it at all be warned unless you like sleeping with suede,118,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,awful as others are saying it is a very nice set but the comforter is too cheap and the feathers poke through it is a pita because they are all over the floor and it looks awful with feathers on it let alone sleeping with bird feathers right back to amazon it goes not even worth the 60 for the set,58,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,after three months this comforter is a shedding feathers on both sides i will not even let my dog sleep on it waste of money do not buy,26,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,if you like having 10 thousand feathers everywhere all the time then buy this comforter the feathersout of the fabric like water through a sieve if i thought it would do any good I had return it and demand my money back if i could submit this review with no stars i would,55,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the biggest waste of money i purchased it for my sons bed after having redone his bedroom well i found it stuffed in his closet the other day and did not know why well he showed me why it looks fine on the outter side but when you turn it over it has feathers poking out everywhere he said they poked me all night long now this is coming fr a 17 yo who has never cared one way or the other about what his bedding consists of i went to send it back but it was to late do not waste ur money,105,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this thing is way too small for my king size mattress it barely covers the top part of the mattress much less hanging over the sides so i will be returning it,32,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i bought a king comforter for only 40 despite all the reviews about the feather issue well you get what you paid for the feathers are everywhere in my house because of this comforter every time i wash it i spend 30 - 45 minutes pulling feathers out that are protruding through meaning a trip outside to pull the feathers out you can not sit comfortable on top of it because of the feather poking issue this was an issue straight out of the package I have washed it 11 times now and can not believe how many feathers are still coming out otherwise the microsuede is really nice it is just the feather issue is too much for me to handle and i own several down blankets this is the only one with this bad of an issue,135,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is really pretty but it sheds and while you are trying to sleep the end of the feathers come out and stab you all night everyday i had to pick fethers up all over my bedroom and all over the comforter,43,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very upset about this product it is very thin which you would think it would be thick and it crunchs like it is full of plastic but theis really good the size is excellent,38,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i thought for the price that it would be something simple and soft was i way wrong i am still shocked at the quality of my comforter the thickness it is the best buy i have ever had and am thinking about getting the one in chocolate too what i love about this is that it stays in place on the bed no matter how my husband and i and our puppy move during the night it does not slide off the sides it is a must have to any bedroom ensemble,90,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is very inexpensive but there is a reason the feathers started coming out quill first and poking us from the very first night it is warm although i think we are just going to find a duvet cover to slip over it can not be to disappointed but heads up it is pokey and lot of loose feathers,57,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought 2 of these in the full / queen size one for my husband and one for myself we have to have our own blankets because we both like to have control over the blankets haha well when we first got them they were very loud like tissue paper in a way so one of us would move and the other would hear all the noise and vice versa but the noise has quieted down and it is an excellent blanket it is very warm and not too thick very soft i like to sleep with the suede side against my skin and it feels very nice,106,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is made pretty poor you get what you pay for i can see why it is marked down so much one side is softer while the other is stiff and crunchy not comfortable at all i decided to use it for the warmth factor and actually have the sueded side facing down because the opposite stiffer side does not feel very good against your skin therfore i have a quilt on top of it the tags read dry clean only i know as a fact i would not go to the expense to have it cleaned that way as the set is not worth it it does have a decent weight to it but other than that if i had actually seen this at a store for sale i would not of purchased it even at the low price,138,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought thisand with in a week all the feathers are all coming out of it you can lay with it casue the feather stick you in the morning there all over the bed on me and the floor i threw it away it was a waste of money,54,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this the worse thing we have ever bought the feathers are already coming out of it we do not wnat other people making the same mistake we did,28,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the comforter is beautiful it is just what i thought it would be the delivery was prompt and it was a great bargain I am very satisfied with my product,29,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the product that i received is very poor in quality after only having it for a few weeks the comforter began to she had feathers daily all over the bed it is so bad that u can literally feel the feathers sticking you when you lying down i have pulled out over 30 feathers during these last few weeks and definitely think this is a total waste of my 50,69,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is a very nice looking comforter but the thing can not hold feathers at all i would wake up at night covered in feathers with a bunch more poking into me from inside the comforter,34,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,although thisis beautiful when first put on it has some very big downfalls it crinkles because of the filler and it sheds feathers all the time you end up having to vac constantly and make sure to check your cloths in order to ensure you are not walking around with stay feathers on you or in your hair it was really a shame because i have other microsuede comforters and this one was the perfectfor my room but i am at the point where i can not use it because of all the feathers,98,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i had two of these for a month you get what you pay for the shafts of the majority of the feathers are all bunching in the corners and constantly poking through the materiel that is us the comforter is very warm for it is weight seems well made except that the feather shafts are very hard and really hurt enough to wake me up,63,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,very pretty rich browna little crunchy in terms of down but warm and very attractive for the guest room,21,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter looks are deceiving in this good feeling comforter I have used it for two weeks now and already the pointy edges of the feathers are sticking through and poking me there are feathers on the floor and on everything i wear when i sit down on the bed the warmth and weight of this comforter are great but get a duvet cover to keep the feathers inside,71,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i read the reviews and still bought this comforter set at my age i could surely take care of a little static and loose feathers this comforter has it is own power source i have used 2 cans of anti-static spray and a bottle of fabric softener / water mix and still have trouble getting out of bed in the morning-I am stuck to it the dogs fear their morning greeting i believe it is a combination of my hair standing on end the dozens on feathers stuck about my body and my newly obtained super power to shoot lightening bolts i also believe the nightmares of aliens with probes are directly associated with all the loose piercing feathers i gave this 2 stars because 1 it is warm and 2 the manufactures ingenious ability to continue selling this product after reviews like mine and yours,141,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theof this was perfect went great with my existing decor but i keep getting feathers poking me in the middle of the night they come thru all sides of the comforter and make a mess when you pull them out because you certainly want a clean looking comforter overall very warm and great for the price,58,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this product is great however you do lose a few feathers all and all it feels great,17,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,feathers are coming out of the comforter and are everywhere i definately would not have purchased had i known this i have other down / feather duvets and comforters and have not seen feathers come out like this one you usually see the odd one or two it is soft and light and keeps you warm so if you do not mind the feathers everywhere this is a good choice,67,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with thiswhen i received it it looked very nice but had a substantial amount of feathers all over it after picking off the feathers the comforter looked great i bought this for my teenage sons room and after he slept with it the next day there were feathers all over it again i have gone through this pruning process almost daily and the feathers never seem to quit coming out of the comforter i am now finding feathers in other parts of the house i recommend spending more money and getting a high-quality comforter i wish i would have,108,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i ordered this set to go over an existing coverlet on my bed that had camel and browns in it i fold the comforter down and with the shams it makes a beautiful statement for the bedroom the fabric is quite nice and well worth the price i would recommend this to anyone,53,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was disappointed from the get-go with the comforter when i think down i think fluffy and thick this comforter was neither it is extremely thin also beginning the first hour of use feathers began sticking out they poke into you while sleeping or even just sitting on the bed to watch tv vacuuming had now become an every-other-day activity because of the fleeting feathers needless to say i have already gotten the return labels,74,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i am seriously disappointed with the workmanship on this comforter it is been leaking feathers daily through all of the seams while theis nice and I am a big fan of microsuede i would never buy this product again due to how poorly it has been manufactured,47,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was made of newspaper and straw unless you need something to put on a bed your child is often wetting this is not a good deal i would only put this on a bed i knew was going to be ruined shortly the poor quality is obvious in the look and the feel do not waste your time or money,61,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,just want you to know my nephew was thrilled with his christmas present he loves his warm good looking comforter set thanks amazon,23,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,got this comforter for my daughter for christmas and she loves it she is age 17 so usually impossible to please that has to say it all,27,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,oh my god we got this for our new king bed and the feathers have not stopped coming out yet it is been over a month when we first got it it was all crinkly and made a plastic like crinkling when it moved then the feathers started breaking up i guess and they are sticking out every where we have it in black so this looks pretty bad not very snugly or comfy for a comforter either more like a sleeping bag feeling,85,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks great until you wash it once it is washed it is done for i used to pay my sister to de-feather when it comes out the drier because there are feathers poking out everywhere you do not want a comforter with feathers you want a down comforter to avoid this my husband and i have stopped using it because it is so annoying feathers are everywhere in my house i would wake up with feathers in my hair do yourself a favor and get the down one,86,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,love the softness and it is warmis nice and was a good value,14,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i received this after adding it to my wedding list and it looked really nice to begin with after a couple of weeks however the white feathers began poking through and scratching my legs when i was in bed i have shaken it had it cleaned and more but i always end up with white feathers showing showing a lot because of the black cover and eventually coming through the cover completely it looks awful when this happens and i have bought a cheaper microfiber cotton comforter which i cover with a nice quilt no more scratches and no more nights where i wake up looking like I have had a fight with a dove in my sleep,116,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,what is this thing filled with garbage bags it crinkles like plastic it is as flat as a pancake it is uncomfortable it is not warm it is got a serious static problem the feathers poke through the back lining but it looks good on the bed so i fold it down at night and use my old duvet to sleep under,58,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what a bad product is this stuffed with chicken feathers this is definitely only a comforter to put on an unused bed in your guest room after a very short amount of time feathers began to poke out everywhere and it took on a crunchy feel due to the feather spines inside i am very disappointed with this set because it is really pretty in case you are wondering if careless laundering led to the problem the answer is no since i quit using it even before it needed to be cleaned for the first time do not buy this comforter set,99,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i like it it adds warmth without being to heavy but it is a little noisy it also stays on the bed unlike someothers i have had,27,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,thisis so comfortable so warm and so awesome that i can not imagine going to bed without it i wish it were machine washer safe although,27,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,looked forever for a brown suede feather down comforter finally found it at a great price free shipping and came fast,19,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was surprised at how warm this comforter is it looks a little thin at first when you open the box but sleep under it for one night and you will be amazed now i know why birds do not shiver in the cold it is also very soft to the touch due to the micro suede,56,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i love this comforter it is soft and warm the only thing i do not like is that it has to be dry cleaned otherwise it is perfect,28,135
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this quilt is great it is a deep rich brown and very soft to the touch it is not as cushy as i thought it would be it holds it shape and looks great on the bed as a topper with bedskirt,41,136
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,blanket is not comfy very thin and stiff ordered a king for a queen sized bed and it just barely fits,21,137
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is so warm and soft we use it on our bed and we have no problem keeping the heat down at night also great for watching tv would recommend it to anyone looking for a light but warm blanket do not let the thinness or weight fool you,49,138
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in this comforter i have only had it on my bed for a month and already it has feathers poking out all over and i have not even had to clean it yet definately not worth the investment,41,139
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this microsuede comforter for my spare room get compliments on it all the time it also looks very rich i liked it so well i got another one,30,140
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is very very thin a few feathers have already started falling out after a month theis great just as it looks,24,141
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the fabric is soft and theis true to the picture a rich chocolatelike a hershey bar the comforter is not as fluffy as i thought it would be but that worked out for my husband who does not like a heavy blanket it really looks more sophisticated than it is low price i just wish the matching bedskirt was cheaper,62,142
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter set camel i bought this about 9 months ago for 35 when it was on sale at first i was really impressed with the comforter the cover of the comforter microsuede side felt wonderful and it kept me plenty warm after a bit of use and washings i noticed more and more feathers escaping right through the fabric side no holes just right through the fabric also my comforter only has xs and does not have the full sewn boxes like more expensive models to keep the down in place so the down and feathers end up in the edges of the comforter while you lay under the middle i would recommend you save your money and buy a better comforter personally I am tired of having to pluck myself each morning so into the trash this one will go,144,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter last spring i was looking for an inexpensive comforter and found this one the microfiber top is nice and soft it is rather light but is good for the warmer months it washes up nicely my only complaint is that it sheds feathers the blanket i have under it usually has feathers all over it i only paid 3500 for the king size it is hard to find any king size comforter for that price if it was not for the feathers coming out i would give it 5 stars for what you get for the money,100,144
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks nice but feels cheap it crackles when you move and is already losing feathers after just a few short weeks we used to have a great microsuede down comforter from jc penney but they no longer carry it no one seems to have one that matches the quality i think i am going to get a regular white down comforter and a pretty duvet for it this one is just irritating,74,145
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was everything expected very comfortable lying under the cozy down filling on a cool night great productthanks,18,146
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is not only very warm but is absolutely beautiful i have not had any problems with the feathers moving toward the center or poking out and my husband is a big guy also the only bad thing about it is that it is not that big i bought a king for my queen bed and it barely reaches to the bottom of the frame i may buy a bedskirt to go under it other than that it is so warm and so nice,84,147
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this set for my teenage son he specifically wanted a black comforter set which hard to find in department stores i came across this one and decided to give it a try the price was really great and this comforter set looked really high quality however within one month my son was complaining about all of the pokey feathers the feathers are coming out all over his comforter and he is no longer happy with it i guess the price was too good to be true,88,148
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i orginally ordered the set thinking that i was not going to like it as soon as the package arrived i openit ans was surprised to find that the comforter was well constructed and the perfect weight for fall weather in maine i am going to order another comforter set for the guest bedroom,53,149
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,light weight it feels soft it would have been helpful for me to know before i purchased it that it required dry cleaning,23,150
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought this because it was cheap and boy is it cheap it is thin as paper and i think it has paper inside it by the feel of it I am tempted to slash it open to see what has inside because i certainly can not use this as a blanket the material inside is actually crinkly and noisy which is not a benefit when you are trying to sleep the blanket is thin uncomfortable noisy not particularly warm and i highly recommend that you avoid it,83,151
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,great quality and price nice weight of fabric cozy texture description is very accurate i would have liked to know the length of the comforter,25,152
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the price was incomperable 3000 for a king sized micro suede down comforter the only thing i would change is making it more fluffy it is comfortable soft very light and breathes better than you would think i have it on top of one of my very fluffy down comforters and another micro suede comforter a little fluffier than this one so this is almost like the cover of the bed nonetheless it does not matter to me that i have it on the top of the bed it is nice to settle down on the bed and relax into it it is very soothing,101,153
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this comforter set is as plush as advertised and looks wonderful on a bed complete with pillow cases that nestle the head into dreamland,24,154
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a really nice blanket great price for a down blanket light and airy but warm,15,155
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,for the price i thought this is a great fit for my bedroom not big and bulky but still keeps us warm and looks nice we have a queen size bed and bought the king size comforter and it just barely covers the bed so definitely worth it to buy the size up,53,156
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,very pleased with the quality of this product i would never have been able to find a microsuede down / feather king comforter or any size for that matter at this terrific price,31,157
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is really beautiful and i love it the only thing is it is not as thick a i thought it would be and the feathers keep coming out of the material,31,158
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it luck nice at first but after one week the my room is luking like nest wiht feders i do not like this is weary cheep do not buy this your room gona luck like you have a chickiens in it,43,159
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was not at all what i expected i have now returned it awaiting my credit back this is not anything like i would ever purchase againthank you,28,160
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is got a plastic liner which makes crinkly sounds when it moves and yes it sheds and it does not really feel as good as you would expect a microfiber to feel i went out and bought a different one paid twice as much but I am a lot happier with it,49,161
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the feathers in the blanket are always coming out all over and at night you can not cuddle up in the blanket because the feathers are always stabbing you,28,162
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i really liked this when it arrived very soft and warm and thewas perfect but after about 4 months the stitching started coming out i do not lay on it and i have never washed it so i guess you get what you pay for,46,163
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i did not expect anything amazing the king size is the same size as a queen set i ordered at the same time from a different manufacturer this set was thin barely as thick as a quilt it makes a crackly noise too theis what i consider a true brickdeep red thewas exactly what i wanted so the shams are very useful the comforter itself not so much i have it folded across the foot of my bed forrather than function,88,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is not as thick as i prefer my comforters to be and it is noisy meaning whenever you turn you can hear the cover rustling around not good for very light sleepers,32,165
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was such a great deal and so comfortable not to heavy just right keeps me and husband warm and looks great on our bed the matching pillow cases are a bonus thanks so much,36,166
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is very pretty but needs more bulk also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter but the price was cheap you get what you pay for it is okay for spring or early fall but do not expect heavy duty warmth from it,46,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i have a ralph lauren down comforter that I have had for a while but needed something a little lighter for the summer this comforter was perfect as a precaution it is pretty thin this is not a winter comforter but it does keep you warm the materials are semi high-quality you get what you pay for my only problem with the comforter is that the feathers tend to come out through the material on occasion but that is expected with a down comforter for the most part overall i was happy with the gold box price i paid for this set and would reccommend it as a good comforter under 100,112,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,there are two reasons i did not give this product 5/5 it sheds feathers like crazy and is dry clean only otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter,26,169
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i tried to get every one i knew who was redecorating to snatch up this comforter only a few of my friends took advantage of the sale free shipping and we are all very much satisfied at first i thought the package was kind of light for a comforter but once this puppy got some fluffing it worked out to be very nice,64,170
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,when i first unpacked it i thought it looked like a very nice comforter especially considering what i paid for it i soon realized that looks are not everything a day has not gone by where i have not had to dispose 8 or more feathers at this rate it is going to be nothing more than an empty she shall even at 35 i feel i paid too much for this i would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a donaldcostume you are working on but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds / colors of feathers inside thing only 15 of it is content is actual down,116,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is not a fluffy down comforter it more like a down bedspread i purchased the king for a queen size as i want that look it does have a nice feel to it however you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede i love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it people have commented that it does look very nice i paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as i did get king size pillow shams with my set,109,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i purchased this on a friday special sale price and received it for only 2999 it is very lightweight and comfortable and the pillow shams were king size not standard as in the other reviews i have a queen size bed and ordered the king size glad i did because it just covers the top nicely and has very little on the sides i am diabetic with neuropathy in both legs and feet this lightweight comforter is replacing another that was too heavy on my feet at night i reside in florida where you do not need a heavy comforter but because i also have the microsuede throw that i ordered last winter i can attest to the fact that they are also very warm and comfortable while remaining lightweight there was no bedskirt included in my package which was also fine with me because my bed is adjustable the bedskirts do not work well anyway definitely a 5 star product for the money the microsuede is very soft also,168,173
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it is soft warm and all you can say but i have feathers all over my room the cover is not strong enough to keep them inside it is a shame because the price is good and the microsuede is soft,39,174
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was so happy about the quality of the comforter i was nervous that thewould be gray but it was not its definately black and when i first opened it it did not look like it would be too thick but it just needed time to air out it seems thin but it is extremely warm and the under part is almost like a vinyl so it keeps you cool also overall very satisfied i recommend this,77,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was in the gold box and the customer reviews were very positive so i bought the queen / full set for my guest bedroom I am very pleased it is light weight looks nice it is warm and more i found the range ofchoices kind of icky but the camel is sufficiently bland to blend with any decor additionally it should withstand getting dirty easily it weighs nothing and it does not smell at all apparently people have had odiferous adventures by machine washing it there is a rather prominent tag on it saying dry clean only laughing out loud,95,176
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter it appears to be a little on the thin side but is very warm i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it the pillow shams are only standard instead of king very good price too,56,177
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i got this on a gold box sale and i love the price also love the feel of it and the best thing is that i love there d and this is one of my favorites most of the time i only see maroon items to buy but thiswas better oh i also received it on time and in great condition,64,178
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice looking comforter however it lacks in the filling the comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have been to bad they skimped on the filling,37,179
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter might fit a full size bed but it was way too small for a queen,17,180
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i am so pleased with this product very reasonable price and excellent quality and looks good and feels good i highly recommend this purchase,23,181
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i paid 3499 for this microsuede down comforter set i was thinking i was getting a sheet comforter and pillow cases because of the set but this set does not include the sheet I have been using this for about 2 - 3 weeks and it works well i tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it it is really comfortable soft and has no weird odor coming from it additionally you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it one really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter you contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout the reason this happens is because the squares / pattern on the comforter does not completely enclose the down stuffing so the sides of the squares are open allowing the stuffing to move to the sides and end of the comforter,166,182
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is fantastic it is light so you do not feel weighted down it is very warm cuddly soft and comfortable and seems to be very well made and it looks great on my bed i can not find one thing to complain about i wish i had bought one in everygreat bargain for the money,55,183
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,great value for the money a bit on the thin side but very warm great,16,184
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is lightweight but very warm i live in the basement of a home where it is cold in the winter i sleep like a baby now,28,185
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i would only change one thing about this they should use a different material for the inside cover i feel like I am sleeping in a barn with a lot of chickens the feathers are everywhere and sometimes they poke when I am sleeping if the feathers were to stay inside i would totally recommend it btw it is really warm and cozy,61,186
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it was much thinner than i was expecting and i did not think it would keep me very warm but once i started using it i realized it is very warm and am very pleased with it,36,187
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the price was great but other than that it was not at all what i thought i would be getting the quality is not great very thin thin comforter for feather down disappointed for sure,34,188
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,you would think when you open it it was thin and would not be very warmactully it is real warm just has some staticlove the feel of this blanket,29,189
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,while the comforter was not as heavy as I had thought it certainly is a steal for the price and is sufficiently warm when i ordered there was some question as to washability it is machine washable although i have not needed to launder mine yet the oliveis very similar to the picture it is a rich deep olive green i am thrilled with this set,64,190
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,I have bought the cheaper set of barstools with a single metallic looking column they are one of the first hits that show up if you search amazon for bar stools pack of two was about 80 and they were very modern looking unfortunately build quality on both was poor both broke under gentle use and i am 155 lbs well below the weight rating very pleased with my first purchase of this stool cushion is quite good after one month of use cushion is deep enough for you to feel a slight sinking sensation i have no problem practicing guitar on the stool four legs are very good for stability i have mine under an island sitting on mid level apartment carpeting i do not detect any damage to the floor or any slipping of the stool when getting on or off i agree with the other reviewer that buying furniture especially something like a chair which holds your body weight can be bit of a gamble even so i like this particular stool enough to buy another one looks modern and subdued it matches pretty well with dark brown furniture from target if you like shopping for modern looking furniture without designer mark,204,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,i bought one of these in 2009 for small prep shelf really comfortable and looks great we just replaced our dining room outfit with a counter height same style so i bought 2 more of these stools for additional seating very sturdy,42,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,it was difficult to find a single stool most stools are packaged in pairs i always find the best deals and great sellers on amazon this stool took 5 minutes to put together and is very well made,38,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,these stools are nice looking easy to assemble and reasonably comfortable the cushions are a little softer than i would like so if you sit for a long time your rear gets a little sore but they look great and have a nice finish they are a lot lighter than i expected so whatever wood is used is not very dense one of the stools had a small hairline fracture in the finish but nothing major they assemble with good quality screws that are nice and long so i expect these to hold up nicely over time edit as someone liked my review here is a two-year update these stools are still fine i assembled them with a small amount of wood glue on each screw which probably helped the little screw hole caps popped out after a few weeks but putting wood glue on them solved that problem these stools are used only occasionally but are still doing great and look brand new the cushions are as good as new we are still very happy with these,178,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,i got 3 of these for our counter we have had it for about 2 months now for the price it is not bad we have used it enough that we know it is not really meant for heavier people over 225 lbs it is easy to assemble but one of the stools had one leg piece that just would not flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have athat is slightly noticeable they are very lightweight and the seat is very cushy not firm you tend to sink into it a little it is made of pleather or whatever it is so it can stick to your skin otherwise not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be it does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen i do still wish i had spent the extra to get a more solid product oh well i hope these last at least 3 years and I shall be happy with that,176,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,we picked four of these up on a gamble we could not find anything local that was comfortable and sturdy it was always a choice of either comfortable or sturdy these are great looking and really match the bar i put in our basement this may be a stretch but they even make the football games more exciting and the beer smoother and colder what a deal i highly recommend these chairs,71,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,i purchased 2 of these stools but they quickly loosened up i tried to tighten them back up but they do not stay tight they are actually dangerous to sit on at this point i am very disappointed in these stools,40,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,comes unassembled it took two of us an hour to assemble two stools i used two days before one of the stools started swaying back and forth when i sat down i tightened it again and it still does it I am an average size woman and the cushion goes down after you sit on it and eventually returns to it is normal size I am donating these two stools and ordering new ones from another company you get what you pay for,80,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,2.0,negative,not bad construction but the padding was non existent it looks great but the padding is so soft it sinks flat I am 175lbs and my wife is way smaller and it does it to her also the screw hole plugs did not work at all some fell into the holes some flopped out a couple fit just right they look nice from a distance but that is about it i would have spent more knowing what i do now,77,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,these bar stools were easy to assemble great quality and do not look cheap at all I have owned these for about 4 months now and have not had any issues,28,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,nope started falling apart within a month would not buy again bought holland stools and they are great,17,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,i was very hesitant to order furniture online but i could not find any stools this size at the price i wanted to pay in stores they look great and have held up well i had trouble fitting i some of the woden tabs during assembly so i just left those off and they are still very stable i would order again,61,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,perfect for my breakfast bar very comfy,8,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,2.0,negative,not as sturdy as they look rather cheap and would not recommended to a friend when attaching the seating part to the legs the holes did not line up as a result the screws ripped out where the wood is attached to the seat will use my own to fix loosened the screws on stool 2 wholes line up but seat board the srews are drilled is so thin they are likely rip out eventually,76,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,i would not recommend these stool to anyone i hate them i have had to tighten the legs multiple times and they still become loose they are not sturdy at all even my young children under 80 pounds can not sit on them without making them wobble very disappointed with these,50,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,it got to my house in a box that was water logged the bottom of the seat the wood was so wet it warped making it very hard to mount the legs and square up the chair took some time but most would have just refused the box at the time of delivery over time as it dried it formed to the legs and is now in use,68,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,these stools looked great but the legs are all uneven so they do not sit straight had to send them all back sorry they did not work out but they were poorly made,31,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,this stool is very cheap i bought one at world market that was 9900 and returned it to buy this one as they looked the same the buttons go all the way into the holes so they do no good the top cushion is not supportive and i only weigh 112lbs so it is not like my fat butt sinks into it i have spent a lot of money on amazon and been very happy until this but it is more to ship it back than the stupid thing is worth do not buy you will be disappointed,93,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,these have lasted pretty good i do not do much entertaining but i cringe when a heavier person sits on these not sure if there is a weight limit overall they look good and have stood up over a couple of parties i have had the fabric is in tact and there seems to be no problems,56,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,these leads do not fit the gdt-190a even although it was stated on the description for the product the socket probes are too short,24,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,not as pictured and instead of two i got two different ones however the oddball one was long enough that i cut off 1/2 the plastic sleeve covering the meter end of the plug and it works just fine will be returning the other one,45,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,wow should have read reviews mine do not fit either much too short for gdt-190a,15,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,agreed i bought these leads and they do not fit the gdt-190a they are too short see attached images,19,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,the actual claws grip very well but the metal where the probe pushes in is quite flimsy a slight lateral force while the clip is attached causes the metal to bend and the probe no longer inserts securely then it needs to be pinched tight with a pliers again,49,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,4.0,positive,are exactly what they appear to be inexpensive shielded alligator clips that mount push onto the end of multimeter leads you can tell what they are like including the insulation by looking at the picture work exactly as expected should work with any brand leads multimeter quite useful when working with pcbs small components glad i bought them no more to say,66,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,these leads do not fit the gdt 3200 the inserts are too short,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,i suppose these would work great for the meter that goes with them i have a gb model 190a that requires and extended banana plug so these leads can not go in far enough to connect cutting off the shield does not help gb and other sources state that the rtl-103 is the proper replacement for the 190 but they certainly do not work with my meter,66,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,4.0,positive,works well leads a little shorter than original,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,5.0,positive,fits on my craftsman leads perfectly worked as intended,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,5.0,positive,what can one say they convert your test pins to clips allowing you to use your hands for other important tasks,21,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,they do not stay tight on test leads you have to re-crimp every use very cheapi would not recommend to anyone,22,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this is a really great set of hooks and clips for your pegboard i was very disappointed that the set i received had blue bins and blue jar tops and blue tipped pegs unlike the yellow theme in the picture that really grinds my gears when companies do that the yellow would have gone perfectly with my exhisting collection in my hobby room theyellow was the deciding factor in the decision to purchase if you do not mind receiving a mysterythis is an ok set for organizing a hobby room or garage,95,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,if you are expecting construction quality pieces for this price you are fooling yourself i do not use all of my tools daily but i would like them to be organized i am very happy with the quality / price ratio of this set yes the injection molded pieces will probably not stand up to high volume use but they stay where they are supposed to and they seem to be fine with a little love i am happy enough with the quality that i am ordering a second set mainly for the hooks which are of acceptable quality,94,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,this set is great it has everything and more that you need for your pegboard a really good selection of items,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,do not pay much for this low quality set yeah i know it is constructed from the thinner diameter wire i needed a few pcs from it for a project so ordered it knowing what to expect again do not pay much or you will be dissapointed,43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,i bought this set of pegboard tools to augment my already large collection of pegboard hooks and hangars and more i was disappointed in the quality especially of the plastic bins and bottles weak injection molded plastic is not going to stand up to the hazards of my garage the steel hooks were not much better weak and flimsy another lesson learned do not buy hooks that claim to be 1/8 and 1/4 compatible to use with your 1/4 pegboard holes they are going to wobble and fall out period,88,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,great for the price my only complaint is that the small j or u hooks only have 1 place to go into the pegboard where other brands have 2 because of this a lot of items i hang hang fine but as i take theoff the hook falls on the floor and i have to reset it,59,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the plastic parts break easy i have other sets that were much sturdier,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,most hangers have obvious uses but some plastic parts i have not a clue nice if it had a minimum of instructions if nothing they can brag love the plastic bottles that just screw on to mounted lid like the old days of nailing a jar lid to a table and filling the jar with loss junk then screw the jar on to the lid,64,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,pretty usefully but two of the plastic pieces one bin and one jar were damaged upon opening,17,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,no no no quality poor save your money,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the plastic hooks on the mini bins break easily once you have it where you want it is probably best to not ever move it again i was only holding safety pins in it for my craft room the bin did not hold up,43,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,so the plastic attachments the two square trays and two closing cups are cheaply made but they still work and hey it was like 10 bucks this was a great purchase for the amount of items and at that price,40,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,sending them back the plastic hooks for the cups broke off in the pegboard while putting them in metal hooks look fine although,23,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,as other comments say these are made on the cheap side but if you are just looking for something simple to organize your things they are good enough,28,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,practical and well made product do great job mounting and organizing wide variety of tools on pegboard,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,i can not recommend this product for anything other than the lightest of duty the plastic elements are thin and extraordinarily fragile i broke several components just by putting them in the pegboard and the metal hooks are poorly welded and at an angle that makes them practically unusable stay away,52,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,this was a fantastic product for my peg board at home i love the jars for the screws and assorted hook so far i have not used all the space or hooks but hey i am sure i will find a use for all of them eventually,47,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,i just can not bring myself to giving 5 stars for a bunch of wires laughing out loud but this finished my garage project with these and my pegboard,26,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,low quality some of the plastic parts broke while installing,10,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,all of the hardware is ok the issue that i have is that the black plastic clips do not clip in and stay at all i have had to build up the diameter of each hook with tape so that the retainer clips will actually hold in place manufacturer either needs to increase the od of the metal pieces or getting a better designed plastic retainer,65,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,these work great and home all of my tools on a plastic pegboard that i bought from home depot these were a great price i would certainly recommend,28,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,the hooks / hangers in this set are fairly comparable to other hooks maybe a little cheaper but the best part is the little plastic clips that come with this set these clips reduce so much frustration when grabbing tools especially high ones the hooks stay in the board and do not fall out so nice to not have to search for my hooks every time i try to return a tool,69,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,i was going to give it one star but honestly there are a couple nice pieces here to offset the truly abysmal ones the containers and boxes are nice as well as any of the long arm pieces with 2 peg holes everything else is pure crap they provide these little black clips to hold down the pegs but they fall out just as easily really really super crap,69,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i got it from another brand called crawford but this is actually for wood pegboard not for metal as is very similar kit in lowes this is much better yes it is cheap but i do not feel this it fits perfect to the pegboard i got from lowes wood one that is brown will buy one more when get more tools this is the best choice you can find on amazon for about 11 i checked it,80,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,first packaged shipped with the storage boxes broken amazon shipped another one out immediately free of charge these are cheaply made but you get what you pay for these days would be 5 stars if not for the broken storage boxes,41,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this will make ur pegboard look great lots of pieces to organize ur tools,14,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,great product works great in my garage i love it,10,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,very cheap plastic pieces breaks quite easily local hardware store should have better options,14,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,good value and worth the money has a wide variety of hooks to choose from would buy again,18,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,flimsy materials did not work on my new pegboard which is a wall control board,14,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,threw them out completely useless hooks fall out when you lift the tool of the hook the little plastic ties that supposedly hold the hooks fall out break and simply do not hold the hooks tightly buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself they are a little harder to attach to the pegboard but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble i found that by stretching the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some,106,30
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,good price and very handy with a good variety of hooks thought i might purchase a second one but one kit has basically all i need only down side is some of the plastic containers are pretty flimsy and can break easily just be careful with them and they will work fine but i did break a piece putting it in the metal hooks that make up the majority of the package are all well made although,77,31
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the containers were all broken inside they kinda screwed me out of my money the hooks were ok but that is it,21,32
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i was weary at first at the construction of these but they have turned out to be really solid and they work / look great above my work bench definitely buying more in the future,32,33
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the jars are only made for a 1/8 inch peg board not both 1/8 - 1/4 as described also one of two bins came with broken tab so in-usable,27,34
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,cheap worst peg hook i have ever seen buy in person so you can see what you will get,19,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,no zero stars option i guess hey crawford i ordered this organizer kit instead of a second one from stanley because its got a couple plastic trays bins in your parlance and a couple jars or part organizers also not brilliant to use the zero-descriptive word organizer for a component of a product called organizer anyway crawford newsflash crappy plastic hooks break when you insert them into a peg board i just told amazon that they are embarrassing themselves by stocking and selling something so obviously shoddy well made pegboard trays and jars would have hooks made from something sturdy a metal band around the jar and a metal hook might work I am pretty sure I have heard some good things about metal hooks but I am not an expert,127,36
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,bad plastics in this product the hooks that hold to the peg board are broken off,16,37
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,really useful box set of all needed hanging pegs,9,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,have not used it yet but it looks great and is just what i need for the pegboard on my new workbench going to love organizing all my tools and bits and bobs with it,34,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,used these on my harbor freight steel workbench pegboard,9,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,I am using these on a pegboard with 1/4 holes and they stay in just fine the plastic clips for keeping them tight work really well and the bins and jars clip in nicely the variety of pieces is a good mixture and gave me everything i needed and then some mine are dark blue not orange like the picture which i actually prefer i would buy this kit again,69,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,arrived on time and was in good condition easily installed and stay in place,14,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,holds all my tools and helps me keep organized shipping box was a little banged up other than that it is all good,23,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,poor construction and quality control but what do you expect for the price gets the job done and now my shop is just a little better organized,27,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,2 prices were broken other than that i guss it was ok box on the wall the leg was broken an the long screw driver holder 1of the holder was broke off both of those items were both needed i try write a review sooner but would not let me or return them,52,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i gave this to my husband as a christmas gift and he loved it it cleared up a lot of clutter and is sturdy,24,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,first off the this came in a differentthan the picture shows i did want thethat was on the amazon picture they did not say it could be anothersecond the plastic tabs that hold the bins to the pegboard was broke off making it impossible to hang if on the pegboard anything plastic if very cheap and tabs break off very easy the metal ones appear to be ok but not overly good quality i would not buy this set again,86,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,nice package good product thank you for perfect and timely delivery,11,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,do far the metal pieces seem ok due to lacking of packaging all of the bins are now useless the tabs on both of the bins broke off in shipping,30,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,too small and falls off everytime you touch it,9,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,not much to say about thisexactly as described easy to install works great and is pretty much what i wanted,22,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this is a very useful product for anyone starting to use a pegboard in a work space the quality is excellent apart from the plastic items which are a bit light,31,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,they do not fit in the pegboard holes properly the plastic bin broke the first time it was put in garbage,20,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,not 1/4 and the locks do not work i was able to use less than 1/3 of the hooks in the set,21,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,i like the mix of components hooks holders for screwdrivers hammers pliers and more it is hard to screw that up right what takes away 2 stars is that the plastic jars are cheap however they are better than the bulldog kit i bought at the same time the plastic jars are hard to screw into their mounted lids because the threads are so poor the jars from bulldog barely work at all although,72,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the bins are almost acceptable but the jars are absolute junk the plastic legs are too soft and bend horribly while trying to insert it into the peg board as a result i can only use one of them the other simply refuses to mount on the peg board the metal hooks at least are worth the price i paid they are consistent and fairly sturdy,65,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,poor quality light-weight materials numerous defective pieces i would return it but i do not want to waste the time or money a piece of poor merchandise,26,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,alot of pieces makes orginization of my shop better looks clean not all junked up great price still finding places to hang stuff,23,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,they do not pad their numbers with the little plastic clips either which is good solid parts tools are neatly organized now,21,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,if you are in need of pegboard accessories for a 1/4 pegboard do not bother with this product the product description states it will work for both 1/8 and 1/4 pegboards and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4 pegboard they are ridiculously loose to be expected and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place do not work at all in pegboards with 1/4 holes all in all the products price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars while flimsy are usable if my pegboard was drilled with 1/8 holes I am sure I had be completely satisfied with this product,120,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the pegs themselves are decent quality but they do not fit 1/4 boards when you put them into a 1/4 board they do not sit flat against the board and so you can not put those plastic clips on to secure them they also do not come with the 2nd peg not sure what you call them that keeps it stable as stated by a few others too the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy i was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break on the other hand the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent the entire set is still far less than just the few parts i liked bought individually so i gave it 2 stars but do not buy this expecting to use the l or u shaped hangers,135,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,we are very happy with the quality of this set we bought two sets because we can not buy these in western australia we could not be happier with the variety that is in the set everything you need for most hand held tools plus it has two small bottles to hold tiny screws or washers and a couple of small bins as well we particularily liked the small clips that hold the hooks and holder to the board so they do not move we have never seen those here we can buy a few hooks sold separately now and then we recommend this set to anyone that is starting out because the quality and variety is all in one box,118,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i was quite thrilled when my package arrived fairly quickly i received a lot of stuff for the price i definitely would recommend buying the 43-piece set if you are just starting with peg board organizer as i did my peg board covers one wall in my craft room this was a great value,54,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,i bought a set of hooks only from this company last year it is really really bad I shall never get anything from crawford again i do not care that the hooks are made of thin wire and do not hold much weight that is plenty fine for most tools it is that the hooks refuse to stay on the board the little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place do not they are difficult to get in place use up holes that could have been for other hooks fall out of the holes after a few uses and get stiff and break in half with age overall the whole package is a waste of money every time i try to remove a tool from the board the hook comes with it and falls on the floor i was putting them back up now i just throw them in the trash give it a pass and get pegboard hooks that have a second metal stud on the back to hold them in place,171,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,if you already have peg board this is a great buy lots of useful items to store tools,18,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the box came holes in the sides of it with nothing in it,13,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,great set for a good price add all the hooks i needed to the garage,15,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,you are better off picking individual hooks or getting a bulk pack of the regular double hooks over half of this pack is useless and will fall off every time you hang something on it,34,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the metal parts of this product are fine but the plastic parts are total junk all of the plastic cups and jars wall hook holder things you stick in the peg board broke all of them if you are using this for a peg board for sewing supplies and you have the hands of surgeon you will probably be okay i broke the first one thinking it was durable the rest i broke trying to be as delicate as i could be very disappointed would not buy this ever again,89,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,the pegs are great the jars are useless and I am not using the cups because i do not expect them to last long the cups and jars are 100 plastic since the hooks on them are so small i do not believe they can handle continuous use just the pressure of putting your fingers in them to get stuff out is likely to break them off the jars are also designed to sit upside down so you have to remove them completely to use them,83,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,i just ordered five more and am waiting for delivery that should tell you that they are quite good at holding small parts,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,these storage containers are awesome but the little plastic pegs are quite brittle so unpack it carefully install it carefully and hope you do not forget when you move it but once installed it is great and ideal addition to the pegboard fanatics habit,42,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,i received some with the tabs broken off the back and they do not install easily,15,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,had to break off a pin to get it to attach to my board but it works well after that handy to have a few of these around,28,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,does not fit the pegboard i ordered yet everything else does fit i am sad this does not work,19,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,this product is made of cheap plastic it broke when i installed it on my pegboard,16,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,says it can fit any pegboard but did not fit mine and 2 of the 3 i received had broken hooks,20,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,very fragile peg board clips most are broken when shiped,10,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,all of the lehigh crawford pegboard stuff is weak it will break before it is even hung in the pegboard save your money,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,there seems to be a lot of user error and confusion regarding this bin so let me hopefully help some people out these bins are made to work with two sizes of pegboards so that means you need to break off the lower pegs that correspond to your size pegboard if you have the smaller 1/8 pegboard you have to break off the middle peg if you have 1/4 pegboard you have to break off the two outside pegs this bin will not work if you leave all three lower pegs in place this is a must have for simple organization on your pegboard they mount up solid with no play so you do not have to worry about them falling off the wall as you are using them the bin can be taken out and moved around if you need to but this leads to my only grip the bins are quite loose which is necessary in order to be able to take the bins out but to me it feels like they are a little too loose it would be nice if they could be a little snugger in there,191,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,thought it was bigger it is like 5 wide,8,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,these bins have 3 upper hooks and 3 lower notched pegs that should align with corresponding peg board holes when you hang them none of the lower pegs align after you hook in the uppers i ordered 8 of these and none align and because they do n't it holds the bottoms away from the peg board which creates an upward angle when they are secured in addition 1 had all of it is upper hooks broken off my guess is that someone received it in a previous order and tried to force alignment and broke them off i believe i am going to take some side cutters and snip the lower pegs off to get a flush mount without the lower pegs securing the bins they pull away at their bottoms when you pull items out of the bins but i will put up with that i am contacting the seller to see if they will ship me another bin to replace the broken one i would n't buy again,168,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,this is a quality product i am a single woman who loves tools and i have to rely on honest descriptions when i purchase products i just bought a peg board and wanted some good containers this is a good one,41,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,wish it was larger i like to be able to have some supplies covered or enclosed i have eraser in one and automatic pencillin another wish they were easier to get out work on a larger size,39,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,just what i was looking for i read the reviews about them braking but they where packed very well i did take care installing but the went in very easily and work great,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,fits perfectly on the pegboard in my van for easy access to screws and parts makes for a well organized work truck,22,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,one of the boxes was broken when i received it and another broke when i hung it up on the peg board the 3 upper plastic pegs break off easy and so does the peg on the inside that holds the clear bin from falling out,46,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,fits standard peg board easy to use and keep small parts organized on my work bench plan on purchasing several more in the near future,25,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i love these little bins and I have used them on the pegboard of my shop for years adding more and more be warned if you order these in large numbers they bulk ship them in one big box where they rattle around and break off the plastic pegs expect amazon claims,51,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i was looking for ani could zip tie to the cage in my truck and this fit the bill perfectly,22,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i like these little things i have several at my work bench great for keeping solder rolls screws or any other smallthat just does not work to hang on the peg board some complain the that little plastic comes out but i actually like that it is nice to be able to pull it off the bench an take the little drawer with you when needed,66,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,this is well constructed molded plastic durable and although has minor sharp area watch out with the kids although it is like a miniature pegboard for screws nails and or bolts gee waddia no very satisfied,35,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,this works well at helping me keep my tools organized the quality of manufacturing is not quite as great as i would have hoped but it works quite well as long as you are not too rough with it,38,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,one of the tabs broke of on day one greatbut build quality is not up to par,18,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,the tabs were too fragile and easily broke off during shipping and made attachment to the peg board impossible poor quality,21,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,storage bin is held in by two plastic tabs and one was missing completely opened clear storage bin and the entire bin pulled out it did not break off it was never attached and could not find tab anywhere to try and superflue it back together do not waste your money on this brand,54,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,it arrived with 1 i repeat one intact peg cheap and worthless,12,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,when i found myself with a flat tire on my way from bikini waxing to the shoe sale at bloomies i knew I had be ok because my bestie bought me this safety girl roadside kit for my birthday this year i knew there was something good about turning 30 it had these nifty instructions for how to change a tire so i can totally sound like i know what I am talking about if i meet a guy who likes strong women unfortunately i do not really know where my spare is tee hee and i let my aaa membership expire whoops as i gazed into the swarovski cover on my iphone i thought i have just the thing i applied my lip balm rolled up my shirt and proceeded to look seductively helpless alone on the side of the highway lo and behold before long men were honking and slowing down and eventually one stopped long story short it would have been great if the safety kit had some condoms too but i managed to flirt my way into having a big strong man change my tire for me thank goodness,190,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,i think this is a cute noveltyand gift to give to friends and female family members for their cars i do not think it is completely practical but it does have some nice essentials for non car related emergencies and a couple of good actual emergency items i have one for myself and will be giving a couple as gifts but i think an actual road side assistance kit is needed to go with this,76,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,as a woman who has an emergency kit and has had to use it I am grossly offended by this package an emergency kit should have flares jumper cables a first aid kit things you can actually use to get yourself out of an emergent situation not chocolate a nail file and breath freshener all the things young women might need to prepare themselves for when someone else strolls by to rescue them i own pink apollo tool kit i have no problem girlifying things but if you are going to call it an emergency roadside kit it should actually be able to help you in an emergency not point out how your ovaries and lack of self-esteem should render you useless,125,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,the safety girl roadside kit was a novelty gift that i thought was cute to give a first time driver i think it could have been improved by changing the matches to a mini flashlight taking the chocolate out and maybe adding some reflective tape the container was the size of a lunch box and the grafics on the outside were nice,62,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,this is packaged in a cool box and has a lot of things a girl might need in case of a flat tire or being stuck somewhere and more i gave this as a gift to a 20 something and she really liked it it makes women less dependent in a stressful situation,52,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,great gift for my 16 year old niece,8,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,was not at all what i expected very cheaply put together,11,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the contents of this kit i bought this 1st week of december 2014 for christmas gift for a teenage girl who is just starting to drive but i was embarrased to give it the energy bar expired october 3 2014 the chewing gum expired june 23 2014 and the 6 safety lightstick expired 04 - 2014 i do not know why the seller even included perishable items and did not check the expiry dates before shipping the stuff,79,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,awesome thank you so much for the quick shipping,9,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,i purchased this on recommendation from our local news station it has everything someone should need only thing was that my bar was outdated but i kept everything else a friend of mine saw it one day as i was going in my trunk and she ordered one laughing out loud,49,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,as expected great product great gift for college bound student,12,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,i thought this would have car safety things like booster cables not kleenex and lip gloss or dime store items,20,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,this kit proves it buy a real kit and learn to use it learn to do simple repairs yourself otherwise you would better forget about driving a car,27,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,love it it was shipped in a timely manner and exactly what i was lookin for for my neice who is starting to drive thank you,26,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,this was a great choice for my nieces 16th birthday all of the girls at the party young and old wanted one i would recommend this product,27,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,i was so excited to find this kit for a sweet 16 birthday gift however when it arrived more than half of the items that were supposed to be included are missing my kit is missing the accident record card bottled water deodorant emergency blanket gum hand wipes ibuprofen light stick lip balm energy bar nail file how to instruction card pencil stain remover and hair brush it did however include a few items not listed like hand sanitizer tooth brush key chain and antibiotic cream still not as advertised and very disappointed since i have only 2 days now until the party below you can see what actually came in my kit not much,115,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,contents received are not contents advertised kit was missing the following no hand wipes no hairbrush no bottled water no nail file no peanut butter energy bar no chocolate bar and no gum everything else listed was received and they included 2 rolls of mints a facial cleansing cloth and a small lint brush not worth the money i bought two,62,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,very cheaply made and the items inside are things you could pick up at the dollar store it might be cute as a silly gift but not for a 16 year old,32,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,great gift for anyone getting or who has just gotten a drivers license,13,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,false advertising it is a lot of money to pay when you do not receive all the items listed i just received a kit for a gift and it is missing at least 6 items i guess i will have to supplement from target so it does not look cheap,48,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,i bought about 10 for all my girlfriends they all love it totally sexy,14,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,when thisarrived it was in pieces the packaging was torn and crushed it is useless it is a piece of junk thanks for the scrap metal,28,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,lots of fun to play dr with simple to use and stays in place well,15,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,bends very easily made with a very cheap thin metal,10,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,a little more flimsy than i thought it would and does not stay in place as well as i thought it would but overall i would say this is a good product,32,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,i forgot about a tampon in the heat of the moment of sex with my fiance and the tampon got shoved up high and i could not reach it well then what happens infection bacteria which produces a funky smell and i was so embarrassed but did not understand what was wrong until i went into a actual hospital and the doctor found the tampon stuck up sideways oh my god i felt so bad i wish i would have had a speculum to check for myself and now i will every woman needs to be responsible for her own body and having a speculum is a good aid to seeing what has going on inside of us it is not gross it is our bodies and we need to be in charge if we need help beyond that by all means get a doctor i will purchase this because i never want to be so embarrassed again by that odor from a tampon that gets stuck and you can not tell or reach it that is life take care of yourself and do not be ashamed,179,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,we likes this tem it did as it was suppose to do we get into kinky play from time to time showed it to friends and they want one,28,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,good for fetish play and fantasy play made with real actual stainless steel not cheap coated materials works as it is intended to for it is purpose,26,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,this was a gift for a friend as a joke but it was well received and enjoyed watching him open it,21,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,this is cool it opens up the vagina and hold it in place it is smooth and easy to enter inside do be careful since it is metal and make sure you clean it thoroughly,35,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,great device does just what it is supposed to do and that is open things up for a peaky peaky inside will tell anyone looking for one about this,30,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,problem one is it is made very poorly the ends are fairly sharp which makes insertion an extremly delicate process the metal is very very thin and bends incredibly easy it is not easy to adjust once inserted and i was told the edges are very uncomfortable once in looks like they poke into the area around the point of insertion nothing nicer then a jagged bit of metal in a sensative body area overall identification say look at other products the collins speculum for example is far superior in construction and ease of use,93,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,this speculum functions but feels flimsy but for the price it serves it is purpose,14,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,does not look like the advertisment to flimsey made of steel not stainlesswill rust up fast,14,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,horrible sharp edges stay away from this thing is junk,10,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,smooth but poor quality difficult to adjust due to misalignment of the two pieces,14,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,the quality of these pins appears good and the pitch is right to fit the standard 01 perf boards however due to the length of the pins and the roundness these do not make contact with the headers on a netduino apparently longer square pins are needed for these and presumably related for example arduino boards,54,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,2.0,negative,pins are too thin to work properly with most female header receivers and breadboards they do connect but they fall out easily plus the pin has a thick base which shortens the pin on one side from what i can tell these would work great if you are soldering them to a pcb and planning on using them to solder that component to something else also like someone else said the plastic holding them together often breaks in the wrong spot leaving the end pin exposed or it falls out,89,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,pros quality is superb pins are attached thinly to eachother makes for easy separating into segments lots of pins for the price cons none,24,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,as far as pin headers go it is hard to have a bad set at least in my experience the only complaint is if you are soldering something to them the plastic starts to melt faster than other pin headers i have used in the past nothing terrible but just be cautious of this when soldering,56,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,these do not work with the common female jumper ports purchased for arduino work these are very narrow pins which do not fit into anything useful for hobbyists,28,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,if you need pin headers these are excellent they work great for soldering serial ports on embedded devices or for whatever electronic project you might be working on,28,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,must be a type o yes 010 on center great for making custom connections on costume circuit boards i find them indispensable,22,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,these are nice pins and fit the listed pitch perfectly my only complaint is that the plastic strip which you must cut to size for whatever header you are attaching to tends to break along the side of the pin not between the pins where you would want it to this is rarely an issue but if you are working in a particularly cramped space on a board or project be careful not to short the side of the pin with anything,83,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,well built product easy to solder it on the pcb effective while using in protoboard i would definitely recommend this product,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,they are header pins it seems like something difficult to fail at manufacturing with a decent level of quality and maybe it is either way these header pins are good and snap easily,32,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,ad stated pins were round received header with square pins,10,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,they advertised male rond pin and i received female one they are exactly the size they advertised and i was expected but on the picture you clearly see that they are male and not female ones i think it just an error,42,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,first and foremost what i received is not what was advertised i received some kind of male-female connector which are so small it is completely useless the pins are extremely short they are barely the thickness of a pcb board hole in the female side only will take an extremely small wire attempting to separate into segments results in destruction of the two pins saddling the break i do not recommend this product nor for anyone to purchase from this vendor,81,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,breaking a piece off for a header the plastic was a little brittle so it cracked around an extra [ wasted ] pin have not done a lot of this but expect this is not unusual and i just need to learn the knack soldered it up to my board and works perfectly,50,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,2.0,negative,i did not read the reviews before buying it and yes they do not fit useless for arduino breadboard in the other hand they seem sturdier and nice but i have not see a female that fits,34,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,is not exactly matched with our can but it does what we need keeps the dog out of the garbage,20,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i just received this product and it is missing a crucial piece the medal rod that stops that flaps from folding down on one of the sides please contact me and send that piece thanks rubbermaid commercial fg267360gray slim jim rectangular trash can swing lid gray,61,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,i ordered three of these lids for the slim jim cans that we have in the office we typically use glad 30-gallon trash bags in the cans they are nice because the footprint is not wide in two directions so it fits nicely against a wall or the end of a counter without being in the way the lids are a nice touch because they stay shut after trash items have been dropped inside i realize that the lids are a bit costly about the same price of the trash can itself but i think we need it in our office environment because they look much better than just having an open trash can i have it four stars because of the price is higher than i would have preferred 3184,130,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,i ordered a replacement lid 14 1/2 x 14 1/2 i received the slim jim instead the company took no responsibility for sending the wrongand i had to pay return shipping very unsatisfied i will never deal with this site again,43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,not worth the full street price I am going to but I had still keep mine the plastic is surprisingly thin and light and mine did come with the jagged flashing as another reviewer photographed the rods were shipped loose as was expected and as i suspect they are supposed to be shipped installation tip do not attempt to take the doors out of the frame to install the rods instead push the rods between the door and the frame then loop around from behind to pop the rods into the doors another reviewers trick of using a sturdy hook or s-shaped tool works great i just used my fingers as for the doors catching on the plastic liner that is solved by buying the correct sized liner such that it is stretched taut over the mouth of the trash can buying too large a liner inevitably results in ballooning or bunching of the bag which invites the door catches getting caught on the excess plastic,162,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i had to fix the inside rod on the lid i returned the first one and received a second one with the same issue so i fixed it myself,29,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,durable and sturdy material where the flaps come together in the middle wish that they touched each other instead of leaving a smalli feel that bugs flies and more can still get into the trash,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,fits very well woks great easy to clean,8,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,matches my garbage can works perfect and conceals the mess / smell one flap has a little slower spring so it is slow to close but still does close and works fine,29,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,these are not the commercial quality that the slim jim cans are i returned the grey and the blue the same day for fear they would break before i could box them back up and ship them,36,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,it is a trash can lid it fits the trash can what more can i say,15,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,works great with the slim jim can no more manually opening the lid,13,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,the lid arrived with huge scuff marks making me wonder if it was used turns out the doors do not reliably swing into closed position you have to constantly adjust them if you want them closed seems a waste of money to pay extra for hinged doors to hide the trash when the the doors do not work,55,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,perfect for hands free and keeping garbage smells at bay,10,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,terrible expensive product lid does not close gets caught on bag and feels very unsmoith anyway even if bag not in can just lays on top of can no firm fit touch it and falls off hate this product,39,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,i ordered two of these for my middle school classroom to help improve the aesthetics of my space and encourage students to place trash in the appropriate location it has helped in both cases the lid is generally sturdy unfortunately one of the sides came loose on one and it took several minutes and some creativity to get the metal rods back in place to restore it back to working order as mentioned in some other reviews the swinging lid sometimes gets caught on the plastic can liner,88,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,this lid will not stay closed once i put trash into the garbage can the lid swings open and then hangs there i have to manually grab the flap so it will swing closed or i have to try and jostle the can a bit so the lid will swing closed this makes thebasically useless i could have just kept the garbage can open and achieved the same thing i added an extra star because it looks nicer than an open can even although it still functions like one,91,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,while the lid itself is what i expected however there are metal bars that allow the doors to swing open and close those metal bars when not in their track properly which is impossible to do fall out some of the lids came with the metal bars in their track properly most of the lids did not and the metal bars fall out constantly i own a childcare center and purchased these for the classrooms to use for food disposal but the doors are suppose to close very disappointed with this product as they were expensive and are not performing,100,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,the weighted rods were shipped loose and were difficult to install i thought i was going to break the plastic when bending it back other than that it does the job,31,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,fits the matching trash container perfectly easy to take off for project cleaning and easy to replace,17,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i ordered nine and six of them came with the weighted bar that closes the popped off i had to put them back on myself which was a pain i expected better from rubbermaid,34,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,did not last 24 hours in use waste of money,10,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,we recently moved into a new house and one of our dogs likes to eat the trash when we are gone happened once l before we ordered this lid we ordered this kid came home from going to the grocery store only to find that she tried to tip over the trash and eat it due to the lid being on she could not get ahold of the bag to pull the can over we have never been so thankful for a trans can lid before one of the best purchases,90,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,made with heavy duty plastic durable a must have for container,11,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,one hinge was snapped off when product arrived the other hinge would not close the lid just stayed in the down position,35,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,it worked just fine with the trash cans it matched i like the way it closes and it is very heavy duty and i think for the money you can not go wrong,32,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,for the most part this lid is great it covers the rubbermaid slim jim garbage cans perfectly my complaint rests with the flaps not always closing at times it gets caught on the garbage bag and at others it seems like the weights are not strong enough to close them a slight tap on the side gets them to close and these garbage cans fit nicely in tight spaces,68,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,can not get both lids to open while mounted on can,10,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,works great after being used a lot only issue is when it arrived one of the flaps did not go back into place after being pushed down it still does not bounce back up all the time after someone puts trash thru it but it is only that one flap we can live with that,52,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,5.0,positive,my 8 year old was recently diagnosed with a sensory perception disorderrecommended this site for tools for him he has loved every thing we have ordered could not be happier,31,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,5.0,positive,my son has to be messing with something at all times this is perfect very thick good quality i bought 3 more for each teacher,25,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,4.0,positive,we love this series of sensory fidgets but the little plastic snake hidden in the sand of this one freaked some of the kids out because they were not expecting it,31,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,5.0,positive,my three year old twins loved this game it was easy to understand and simple to follow perfect for a first board game to teach young children about taking turns and rules of games,34,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,4.0,positive,i got this for my 4 year old son who needed something tactile to fidget with my son loved the ball and does use it and i love that you can clip it onto things however i am only rating it 4 stars becuase my hope was that i could clip it to his belt loop so he woudnt lose it at school but it is too heavy and too big think sized for adult hands if they could make a smaller version of this i would be so happy some people complained that there was a film on the ball i did not experience this and it has held up extreemly well to the trials and tribulations of an active 4 yo,123,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,i have many tactile hand toys but this is my least favorite it does not squish enough my students do not like this one either,23,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,my son is 7 and has aspergers syndrome with sensory issues he finds fidget tools soothing i liked theof this one having a clip that could maybe go on a belt loop as he constantly misplaces his toys the plastic on this ball is too stiff so it is hard for him to squeeze it is much too large for his hand the plastic feels oily i do not know how to describe it other than that i was hoping he would be able to squish it he has lost it already i thinks it is a greatbut the product itself leaves a lot to be desired,108,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,has some hard nobby thing i side and very hard not at all what i expected did not bother giving it to my son,23,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,i thought this was really great but the plastic is not very durable my daughter broke it in a few days sand was everywhere in my house it would be better if the plastic were much thicker,37,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,1.0,negative,came out of the box leaking sand ordered 3 balls sand one was leaking sand penguin ball was leaking oil all over,23,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,5.0,positive,my daughter has sensory processing disorder and she loves this it is very firm and is just a thick clear smushy ball full of sand great for stress and nice looking as well as durable great brand,36,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,1.0,negative,plastic is to thick does not make a good fidget ball would not recommend for 8,14,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,1.0,negative,it is hard it has a rubber stopper right in the center making it uncomfortable to use you are better off filling a balloon with sand biggest waste of money and disappointment ever,31,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,5.0,positive,my son has a very anxiety problem and we love this sand ball we feel a little less anxious since he received this product I am buying another one for my daughter,31,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,4.0,positive,wish i was able to see the little snake inside but nonetheless it is a great product,16,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,coupler works just fine just a bit lower quality than i expected for the cost the threaded top that holds the spring and o-ring in place required reseating and a bit of tightening before it formed an air tight seal otherwise a decent product at a reasonable price after said adjustments,51,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,ball lock pin did not work with either the stainless steel carbonation cap nor the plastic one i replaced it with a different brand that works fine,26,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,it came in the mail a little slowly it was shipped to my house and was exactly what i was looking for,22,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,the reason everybody is saying this leaks is because the 1/4 mfl male fitting does not fit standard 1/4th mfl female fittings this thing is not manufactured correctly no way prevent leaks with this construction,35,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,actual product was not the same brand as advertised leaks co2,11,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,it works pretty well but it does require quite a bit of force to mount onto the carbonator,18,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,we use this in combination with the carbonator cap it works but it only last 6mos before it develops leaks and must be replaced we are looking for another brand that will hopefully last longer,34,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,used in my custom built home carbonation system i did not want to pony up the cash to keep refilling sodastream tanks so i built a system myself and this little gem along with the carbonator adapter also available on amazon made it all come together,45,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,i made my own beverage carbonator like the soda stream search around you can find tutorials this was a key component,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,maybe it is the hose clamp hose combo i have but something i think this leaks i am using thein connector for home carbonating and fluid is able to pass through the connection easily and backs up in the tube build quality is good maybe i am doing something wrong,51,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,i use it to carbonate my own water i carbonate at least a half gallon a day no issues yet and i have been using it for 3 months 3 to 4 times a day,35,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,worked well for about three months then the valve stopped working but still sealed ok then it produced orange dust replaced it after another month,25,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,plugged this into my home made carbonation system and it works like a champ just make sure that the hose you have is the right size as this lock,29,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,this product worked for me just a few times before the spring assembly broke on me and all the ball bearings shot out everywhere i managed to get the bearings back in but could not get the spring fixed every time i did use it there were leaks i would not recommend this product,52,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,this piece is very hit or miss about 50 of the time it works as expected otherwise it does not seal when not connected which leads to escaping,28,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,i bought this product to use on my bissell proheat 2x professional i purchased at a big box store this was exactly what i wanted because i can use my bissell to clean the entire house and not just my carpet this really can make your investment in a floor cleaner even more useful i have a 550 square foot apartment and this tool has made cleaning the kitchen and bathroom a dream i used vinegar instead of cleaning solution and this mopped the floors better than any traditional mop and bucket also the floors were dry after i was done cleaning so my dogs would not track water paw prints through my apartment,114,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,it did what it was supposed to do,8,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,for the newer models it just clips on no screwdrivers needed the problem is that it lifts up off tile and brushes make no contact so basically you end up with a squeegee with a really weak vacuum attached,39,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,product came as described and my wife was quickly able to affix this our bissell work fairly good but our floors need some work,24,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,while this will work for many it is not what i wanted it raises the machine up so the brushes do not touch the floor acts more like a squeege with a vacuum attached,32,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,this is the second time i have order the floor tool they do wear out the foam but by using this tool attached to my bissell steam machine my ceramic tile floors are clean so much better than getting on your hands and knees,44,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,well the title of this review pretty much sums up how i feel thisworks as described which is a real blessing considering how many hard floors we have in our house for the quality the price is good which is another big plus the major downside is that this came with no real packaging and absolutely no instructions at all thewas just sealed in plastic with literally nothing else instructions packing slip and more if you do get thiswhich i would say is a good move assuming you have hard floors and a bissell floor cleanr be prepared to search for directions on the internet granted that is simple to do but I am docking a star because of poor packaging and complete lack of materials,129,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,old fashioned mop will do a better job this is not exactly a bad product for some reason i thought that it would be as good as mopping,27,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,did not buy the product through amazon went through bissell direct since i was not sure of the part number this attachment does not work well the squeegee portion is much too flimsy to effectively remove the cleaning solution even after multiple passes and the design does not provide adequate suction btw wish i would have bought it through amazon as i would be returning it now bissell wants return shipping so the cost outweighs the refund,76,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,lifts the brushes completely off the floor so there is no scrubbing just a rinse and squeegee action,18,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,did not fit the machine i have although the description said it would fit,14,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,these things make cleaning our brick floor much easier but the seams in the brick destroy the foam in the tool head so we need a few every time the floor gets a major cleaning about once a year i have noticed the same effect cleaning tile floors from the grout lines overall i still like these very much and will continue using as long as i can get them,70,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,this bare floor tool works very well the proheat cleaner puts the water / cleaner on the floor and the squegee tool does an excellent job of getting the water back up i am sure it is working well since the water is dirty i used this on a tile / grout surface without any problems you can still adjust the amount of water and cleaner just like the carpet settings my only issue is with high traffic areas still not perfectly clean this is probably more to do with the bissel cleaner than the attachment i would recommend this attachment to clean hard surfaces,101,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,awesome if you have hardwood floors it lowers to vacuumto where it needs to be for floors from the carpet height,23,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,i would recommend to others in fact i think I shall get another one and modify it for other purposes i need it for,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,work well nice holder for the price note does not come with the holderto hold the indicator but does have a dovetail,23,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,the turlen test dial indicator holder quill clamp is what i expected in it is quality and it is price my order arrived on time and in good condition,27,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,cheap knockoff all the adjusters had flat washers on them instead of wave washers so every time you would slightly move it would fall down,25,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,product is of low quality would not recommend,8,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,it works well on j head bridgeport it is to bad the dial indicator i bought with was defective on delivery same company,22,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,i had to remove one of the plastic washers in order to use the dovetail portion of this holder after that it worked perfectly I have had a name brand holder before and while i can tell the quality between them making small bump adjustments to your indicator are not as easy with this holder for example the cost difference made it worthwhile,62,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,fantastic holder used it all day today and it works perfectly,11,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,not a good product sometimes u can get away with being cheap not here i ended up paying 65 for a indicol and it was well worth it this one u pretty much need agrips to tighten the indicol can easily by hand it seems to be the slringy washers that make the difference,56,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,well worth the the price does what the more expensive ones do,11,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,it is useless as shipped the friction is to low and it does not clamp well look at it as a parts kit you have to modify it to make it usable,31,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,good price same quality as similar units trimmed my turret mill and it works fine,15,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,this can be used it is only good for 001 kind of work gets the job done sometimes higher quality indicator holders get the job done everytime period,29,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,this thing has bushings that are so slick that that no matter how tight you make the thumb screws the arms still move around freely instead of wasting your money trying to save a buck but the real one not this knock off,43,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,low price what do you expect it is awkward but it works one good thing is it folds flat unlike some others,20,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,this product is not good for a toolmaker you get what you pay for homeshop might be fine,18,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,was disappointed in the lack of quality i have bought other turlen products that i had better luck with 1 all of the joints slip 2 the collar does not clamp on hass milling machines very well,37,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,i work in a tool room objective judgement total garbage tried to fix it by reaming the hole larger and replacing main rod with precision ejector pin to match hole still does not work the material used is a metal that springs and settles as you try to make a pick up do not waste even 10 if you are a machinist it is scrap unless your tolerance range is 250 even then i would not trust the crap,79,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,inexpensive but not cheap works well fairly robust does the job,11,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,not the usual welders cap has light cardboard in the bill that is malleable should still be okay under a hardhat i have a fat head for being an average albeit fat male 58 188lbs this is really tight fitting and fabric stitching audibly stretched no visible signs of wear when examined very well made and strong thick material should loosen with wear and not show it,67,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,works like it is supposed to and it is a good price,10,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,super deep like beanie deep with a really stiff bill,10,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,very uncomfortable i was not a fan and the material is really stiff,13,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,been buying this brand for over 20 years been welding longer they are nice when the brim gets soft probably have owned 6 of these hats they are true to size i wear 7 1/4 like when they cover tips of ears i wash every other week unless welding over head then more often let air dry do not put in dryer will shrink and slowly deteriorate in a shorter period of time i usually get a few years out of each hat and I am pretty hard on them,88,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,this welding cap has really held up to a ton of washings and has kept it is size without stretching so I am confident that this cap will last i gave it 4/5 stars because the cap has frayed a bit,39,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,i do not know who would even wear this it is gigantic it has a hard bill and it is taller than any head I have ever seen definitely sending it back does not even resemble the picture do not buy,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,love the way it conforms to my head,8,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,offers good protection and is comfortable to wear once you break it in it is a non reflective black which hides stains be aware that the brim is stiff like a ball cap,33,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,had is awkwardly oversized really baggy ontop of the head the brim is also basically a brim off of a fitted hat it looks like a fitted hat with a soft cap,32,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,do not believe that this will fit your big head it is a med at best medium in european standards,18,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,good quality hat runs a bit small although,8,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,i did not expect the versatility of this hat i bought it strictly for protection during my welding classes when not using my helmet this thing wears just like a hat spin it around and it covers the back of my neck very well what i could not see was how fully it covers my head and acts as a buffer between my head and helmet band and actually keeps the helmet from slipping on my head as it tends to do without the hat my head is not huge 22 3/16 around which is a med in practically every motorcycle helmet manufacturers size chart,103,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,had to return these the sizing was not as expected the brim was stiff uncomfortable for welding,16,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,hat is worn under hard hat and welding helmet does a great job of absorbing sweat and fits well with one issue hat must be worn tight to top of head due to hard hat and welding helmet hat is so deep it covers top 1/4 3/8 of ears i do not like that i have not gone back to read the description so could be my fault good quality overall,70,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,just a touch of elastic makes it fit well,9,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,tooo big zize for me but i sold it to a friend,12,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,fit well and it happened to be the something my husband needed but did not know he needed it until he had it,22,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,more like a baseball hat and runs small,8,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,i have a small-medium head this is for an xl or xxl head,13,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,bought one of these awhile back because my new tv did not have rca out the new standard seems to be toslink digital product did what it should for anyone thinking of buying go with one that supports 192khz sample rates and fyi if you plug this in and get nothing but a clipping noise repeatedly it is because you have to go into the tv / devices settings and change the sound mode to pcm / linear pcm i stead of dolby digital/51 / dolby pro logic this is because the tv senses the toslink digital audio wire and assumes your using a source with surround sound it can not auto sense that your plugging the wire into a converter to rca which only supports 2channel audio,117,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,it worked one time for about 10 minutes then would not power back on,14,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,shipped quickly great product for the price easy to install and works perfectly,12,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,this works extremely well if your tv has a digital optical audio out only as my lg does converts the optical to standard analog which then can be transmitted by bluetooth to my hearing aids takes a long time to get although as it came airmail from china,48,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,doa the converter never powered on not worth the trouble to ship back,14,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,could use off / on switch but great product otherwise,8,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,2.0,negative,it works well with dvd player but with the satellite the volume does not play loudreally disappointed,16,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,i did not expect how good the quality of the product i was totally impress the sound quality for the price,21,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,this actually works really good i have an lg 50 inch going to a kenwood surround sound older unit sounds beautiful,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,under 40 bucks with free shipping they are great using to connect a cable box to a legacy stereo system comes with a nice quality toslink cable,26,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,cheap connectors did not work did not make a good connection,9,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,with my tv setup i am now able to use this device to listen on headphones while tv volume is not muted before when i turned on my surround sound the only choice i had was speakers or headphones,39,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,what a disappointment firstly the soft cloth that is supposed to be included with this product is nonexistent okay so I shall use my own soft cloth no big deal right the instructions say to clean the electrode with distilled water no problem i always have several gallons of those all the time then it says to sucks it with filter paper coffee filter paper that can not be I shall use a cotton swab instead i turn it on wow the back lit display is green pretty i had one exactly like it in yellow the ridges the placement of sensors dimensions it is the same stuff with a different name now heres the big difference my old stuff worked for 3 months before it began to flash random numbers this one right from the plastic container it came in just flashed random numbers am i disappointed what do you think,149,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,small compact and did not cost too much it preformed just like the write up said it should,18,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,not user friendly directions in english but written by someone who did not understand english,14,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,easy and fast but always good to double check the accuracy occasionally,12,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,does not work even after calibrating which was a chore it still would not hold a ph reading it would swing 20 whole readings at a time bad product guess you get what you pay for,34,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,easy to use be sure to calibrate with distilled water and follow the directions good instructions if you follow closely without trying it on your own,26,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,tester appeared to work fine when delivered 1 month later the readings jump all over in test media and tap water used supplied test buffer solution first reading should be 4 get 47 clean and try again in 1 min now reads over 6 and not steady not reliable enough to trust would not recommend,55,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,great ph meter for my sons science fair project,9,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,seems to work real well for checking the mash ph,10,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,i received thisat no charge in exchange for an honest review i have a more expensive ph meter which has a few more features but for basic checking where accuracy although this is still accurate is not as huge of a deal this is a no brainer the biggest difference here is that when you calibrate it you are responsible for turning a screw screwdriver is included to reset the ph level others automatically calibrate this the cap also does not have an easy way to store sterilized water in it which can help keep it calibrated the good news is that it has a decent plastic case which holds the meter and the screwdriver it is an incredibly low price in my opinion and having to manually calibrate is not a huge deal this is a no brainer,138,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,works well under open air conditions when used in enclosed bucket with the lid only open enough to fit device gave wildly inaccurate readings 15 to 11 in actual 6 ph water removing lid completely always worked although a good product for precise usually and fast ph readings,48,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,this ph meter is easy to read and comes with a nice case for storage it comes with a screwdriver to use for calibration and a sheet with instructions i tried it with distilled water and tap water and found that it does not give a precise reading it sort of fluctuates a bit around the correct ph of the fluid thus it can give an approximate reading but is not precise enough for scientific work this is fine for home users and a usefulfor this price range i was provided a free sample of thisfor my honest review,104,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,for any accurate consistent readings thisis next to worthless if you are measuring something where the reading does not need to be completely accurate this will do just fine however if you are getting this for hydroponic or water testing use i would recommend investing more money in to something more accurate i am using this for water testing and need to re calibrate every single time i use it which ends up costing me calibration-liquid cost so in the end i am no better buying this cheap tool for me it is barely tolerable,95,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,this device turned out to be perfect for my purpose i distill my own water i like to raise the ph to give the water some character with this meter i was able through trial and error to come up with the exact amount of solution to add to my water to bring ph to the desired level i can not imagine how many ph drop bottles i might have gone through had i gone that route it is a little slow to get to the final level but you can speed that up considerably just swishing it around a little one bonus shocker was i did not know how high my city water ph was until i tested it oh and the calibration was easy with the two packets supplied,129,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,good value for the money however at least two pack each of the testing solution should have been part of the shipment the instruction for calibrating the pen needs to be written better,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,inexpensive easy to use seems to give stable results although i have not checked it against any lab-quality instrumentation good enough for telling if my water and fertilized water is in range or seriously out of whack,36,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,did not last more than 3 months became impossible to calibrate,10,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,do not last just failed after two years without using it,12,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,for the cost you can not do better it even has a backlight which is super useful in darker areas please remember that when using a ph meter keep the unit in your test solution long enough for he numbers to stabilize or your reading will not be reliable,48,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,junk does not even hold calibration for 10 secs when you turn it off buy gallons of calibration solution if you buy this meter you will need it,26,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,this thing is so moody it never settles on a number i use it to adjust the ph in my hot tub this thing is not accurate and has caused me to over acid the hot tub too many times it will read 84 for 4 rounds of adding acid and then jump down to 24 crazy thing that after calibrating it before each use I am going to toss it in the garbage and go buy my old version it worked great until i accidentally tossed it in the washing machine with my robe,94,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,horrible and worthless the readout is so sensitive the numbers jump around way to much as soon as u pick it up to calibrate it it starts reading 1 or 18 and then jumps around everywhere look elsewhere for a ph pen,42,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,5.0,positive,nice product firm rubber with a fairly sticky adhesive exactly what i was looking for i used it on a bench press rack so the bar would not get destroyed while racking the weight would buy again and have,39,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,2.0,negative,picture does not represent the size of the product,9,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,4.0,positive,i would give it 5 stars but the adhesive is not holding up so well outdoors I am going to have to re-glue it using contact cement otherwise great product,29,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,4.0,positive,results of the test was exactly as i was hoping for the size was also what i needed happy to find it available in smaller quantity foam was right thickness but it really smells like rubber made in china lots of voc laughing out loud i am storing it in an enclosed plastic bag laughing out loud,53,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,1.0,negative,I am sure this product description said self-adhesive turns out the adhesive must be old and tired because it will not stick worth a darn on clean steel,27,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,1.0,negative,is supposed to be adhesive backed the product i received has next to no adhesive properties whatsoever not recommended,20,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,5.0,positive,thick rubber with adhesive backing on one side no problem sticking to truck toolbox would purchase again as needed,18,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,5.0,positive,used as scales on a knife wrapped over with paracord the adhesive on the rubber was enough to stick the pieces to the tang just fine,26,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,2.0,negative,the adhesive on this is plain terrible also the provided picture does not represent the actual product as this is only aboutr 2 wide,24,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,1.0,negative,adhesive will not stick at all i will not buy again,10,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,4.0,positive,not enough for what i needed i had to compromise my useage,12,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00P5VH46C,2.0,negative,once you peel the backer off it would not stick to a clean dry surface,14,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,really functional just be sure your drill is large enough to accommodate it,13,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,the bits do not secure well in the holder and the holder did not secure well on my drill wasted money,19,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,real handy does cover up switches on top of drill I shall work around it,14,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,just buy what ever the brand sells for your drill to hold bits do not buy this it is rubber with no way of securing it i tryed using tie wire nuisanve,29,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,i have one on my drill and one on my screw impact driver you may want to cut out a hole for the drill speed switch on top if the holder is too loose use a zip tie to tighten the loops around the drill,45,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,nicebut i wanted it to fit an electric screwdriver and it is a little big for that i just need to shorten the straps,25,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,works perfectly on my 18v bosch impact driver,8,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,does what it should it holds bits and stays in place on my ridgid drill,15,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,drive holders are starting to lose their grip,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,difficult to use bits are larger than each holding space,10,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,this is such a great invention i wish they were more available and/or that they lasted longer i have them on all my drills at work and home but have to replace them often as rhey stretch over time and then the bits fall out,45,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,it interfers with other fuctions of my 2spd drill,9,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,this was apparently designed for older models of drills compact modern drills do not have the real estate to accommodate this large holder but maybe you can put it somewhere else wherever that place is it is probably a lot less convenient than right on the drill it is made of good quality materials and functions well but it is too big,59,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,straps either cover built in drill light or interfere with chuck clutch when trying to change direction on dewalt 18v,20,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,this is junk did not hold bit they just fall out do not waist your money like i did,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,so the only key design i needed did not line up i got it to work but it keeps slipping i only needed it for that one key so i can not comment on the rest of them I shall probably never use it again,42,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,appears to be good quality easy used and heads swapped however wrong key for my need,16,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,wish it had a 3/8 end as well,8,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,a good tool but does not have either of the heads we use for twc,14,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,i was shocked with it it is awesome no more carring five tools for one job,16,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,I am going to have to send it back the inserts are larger than the opening it seems like the most primitive quality control check would be to test fit the inserts before packaging perhaps even packaging it with the tips inserted to ensure they fit would be the way to go very disappointed i gave it two stars because it seems the quality of the materials are decent,68,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,can wrench is smaller than star keys none of star key is able to insert into can wrench,18,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,bought this for the multiple star attachments as i work in multiple markets and did not want to buy multiple 25 50star tools worked fine for a month or 2 but then the star tool tip separated from the interchangeable piece and is no longer usable I have tried using the tips with pliers but they are too smooth to be able to apply enough pressure to turn the locks,67,7

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,rusted in 2 months and the heads are stuck low quality,11,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,none of the tips fit the mdus in my area very disappointing being that there was four tips one of the tips was the exact opposite,26,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,great ped key but the additional star keys do not really work on any peds in central florida,17,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,worked perfectly to open a comcast pedestal with the irregular 5 point slam ped tamper proof lock,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,head was slightly mis-shapened and would not catch the lock correctly,11,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,the hex sockets do not fit together and the depth on the star key made them slip out of the lock really disappointed and I have found better on another website just a waste of money,34,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,the inserts do not fit the wrench also some of the star patterns are deformed i actually read the bad reviews saying the same and thought they would have resolved the issue by now sadly they have not this is a scamit is literally useless in every way what a waste of my time and manufacturing resources,57,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,actually pretty decent not or quality but will work in a pinch,12,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excelent product i would buy more in the future good grip and excellent suture cut far better than the olders i used before,23,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,absolutely the best if you do a lot of suturing and i do these are head and shoulders above stainless steel shears and worth every penny the tungsten carbide blades fly through gutand silk threads the needle drivers also grip fantastic these days i actually get in a bad mood when suturing without this little work of art some people are not big fans of the olsen design but if you pay attention while working you can avoid accidentally cutting your thread prematurely this has cut my suture time down a lot I am one very happy customer,99,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these were awful you can not grab anything without having to lock them which is incredibly annoying i guess you get what you pay for,24,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,I am a medical student who purchased this needle driver for tying practice and it was such a disappointment the drivers do not open and close smoothly and it does not put a good grip on the suture at all if you were looking for something close to or quality needle drivers do not go with this brand i found that the ones provided in my medical kit i ordered through school worked a lot better,74,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,not a good needle holder ok as hemostat clamp,9,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,very poor quality product the instrument is not comfortable in ones hands and the it does not move smoothly at all when adjusting the grip would not recommend,28,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,they work pretty good but the scissor part is hard to get to you still need to have separate scissors,20,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excellent quality will be using a long timel,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,this is a good product and is very useful,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,perfect for practicing my sutures in veterinary school,8,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,bought these for my son here is his comment I am a fourth year veterinary student and can honestly say these are fantastic I have had problems with my basic first year needle drivers having the lock pop all the time typically at the worst time or the inserts dull down the lock is very strong on these and the inserts have not dulled or pitted these are probably better for people who wear a size 75 surgical glove or higher as they are a tad long some people may not like the suture scissors incorporated right behind the inserts but i think they are fantastic ok i can not add because i have not the vaguest notion of what he is saying but he did tell me after he had used them for a week that one of his professors asked to borrow them because she thought they looked awesome,144,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good heavy duty needle holder I have been building my emergency surgery kit great product at a great price thank you,20,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,these are 185 cm long not the 16 cm as described quality and function are good carbide insert surfaces meet uniformly and lock / unlock tabs function perfectly with 185 cm length they are a little larger than i desired but i can make them work while made with german stainless they are manufactured in pakistan according to the stamped imprint on the device,61,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these are cheap garbage they are absolutely not even close to or grade the needle drivers in disposable suture kits are better,22,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was fine works pretty well although they were different from the picture,13,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,have not had occasion to use yet went in my shtf kit but appears to be a good quality piece of emergency gear,23,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was shipped quickly they look legit although they are a little stiff maybe they will loosen up with use,20,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,good product there is a slight amount of catch when opening the jaws and a very smallis visible that is light streams through but functionally not an issue unlike another reviewer i received exactly what the description says an olsen-hegar driver with scissor function needle holder,47,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,it seems to be great quality and durable I am no professional but it seems to do the job ordered on dec 28 and it said would arrive on jan 10 actually arrived on dec 30 if i could change anything maybe dome paper in it with some info would be nice or specifications be aware that the neck is short and i have small hands but it might be uncomfortable for one with longer hands,75,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,although this products works flawlessly I am taking a star off for mislabeling of this product these needle holders are actually called mayo-hagar needle holders olsen-hagar needle holders have an incorporates scissor portion near the tip fyi in case you are wondering these needle holders can be autoclaved without rusting just shows that even although these are generic they are excellent,60,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,this product is poor quality easily rusts and turns grayish rust after putting via autoclave,15,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,worst pair of needle holders ever can not open with one hand piece of junk,14,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good s steel no rust from class b scican bravo autoclave,11,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,i am picky about surgical instruments regardless of what i use them for given several years of training in general surgery i think I have earned that right I have found that buying german-made instruments has been a reliable guide to quality not these there is no stamp on them to indicate where they were made but they are absolutely unusable another unhappy reviewer said pakistan so i guess now they are not stamping them at all they are very uncomfortable to hold and use I have never had my fingers hurt from a needle driver before the alignment of the jaws is off and closure is for want of a better term lame i now get to delay my project while i look for something i can actually use photos show the pointy ridge inside the handle rings ouch thebetween the jaws at one click of closure are you freaking kidding me and the malalignment of the jaws seriously this has to be a joke,169,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,using this device allow me to nicely have multiple spools of plastic for a quick switch product is exactly as advertised the only thing to be aware is that it will not work for spools with smaller holes many of the spool i get from other suppliers work well but only on the outside the much smaller ones like taulman 1 lb spools will not fit at all so just be aware of that,71,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,i was really excited to try this out because I am sick and tired of swapping between different colors putting this together you can definitely tell that it is a bit cheap but i have no doubt that it is plenty strong for holding filament my biggest complaint is that you can not easily swap between filament rolls i would not use this if you are running through pounds of filament every week which i am but it is useful for the colors that you only use occasionally the big advantage that this has over the plastic spool holders that come with printers is that the metal has a lower coefficient of friction with the plastic spools so the resistance is lower as it comes off the roll theoretically this would reduce your likelihood of failed prints but I am not entirely sure to what extent i can say that I have been using it for a week and it appears to be working better than my standard plastic holder summary for those machines that are not able to hold standard filament rolls for example davinci and flashforge dreamer this would be fantastic but for makerbots and other printers that you can easily swap spools i would not suggest it,199,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,you can not really beat it for the price putting it together it felt a little flimsy but once it was together and loaded with spools it is solid so far i have not had any issues with it feeding filament to my makerbot replicator dual,45,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,2.0,negative,same problem as others have stated this product is not made well it is a solidand i wanted to keep it but the manufacturing needs work the female threads are held in place with just a pinch of metal and any weight on them causes the thing to fall apart also you can not even tighten this thing without the threads coming out either if they spent the time to spot weld the threads in place it would be a good product and very solid disappointment from hatchbox as they make great filament,94,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,easy to set up my 4 year old put it together and works great will likely end up getting a few more to organize more colors when i get them,30,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,the sections come apart under the weight of filament spools where they screw together,14,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,great looks good fit but easily falls apart from weight of hatchbox filament,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,i have the spool holder mounted upright on the pegboard on my workbench i use it to feed my printrbot simple metal the spool holder works great i wish it was a little more stout but all in all it is a great filament holder,44,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,this spool holder fits perfectly on top of my machine loading the holder is straight forward and easy to do seems very rigid and seems like it will last forever so long with the single spool holder this makes life so much easier,43,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,welding / gluing / whatever is terrible pieces have fallen apart since day one,10,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,would normally get five stars but the two of these i own both managed to break in the same way the metal spacers between where the rolls go tend to have the piece with the screw hole fall off i have these on a shelf above my printer and sometimes they break and roll off onto my printer i have a bar in front of them now but be careful if you plan to buy,75,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,nice filament stand but stick to the one with the 2 or 3 sections the 4 sections model tends to sag with 4 x 1 kg spools,26,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,great christmas present for my husband works great,8,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,2.0,negative,the construction of this is pretty lousy my side frames came bowed at the middle and were not straight but were aligned again with a bit of force the entire assembly basically needs to come apart if you need to replace a spool a giant headache if switching a spool in the middle when under full4 rolls the entire thing bows and sinks as the weight is actually on the threaded ends and not on the bar itself you are better off buying some closet shelf brackets and a dowel from a hardware store instead,95,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,this spool holder broke immediately after it arrived poor chineese design thin walls metal hollow hand wrenches inserts are fixed with cheap stamping instead of proper welding inclined inserts which prevent proper aligning i do not recommend to buy it if you are not a professional welder to fix it all the time,51,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,mounted on wall and it feeds 3 3d printers without a jam,12,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,spools do not spin not even the hatchbox ones and causes the extruder to run dry it warps with 2 or more spools on it,24,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,5.0,positive,timely delivery theis described study easy to snap on the stethescope 100 satisfied,15,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,4.0,positive,very cute just a bit larger than expected,8,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,5.0,positive,cutest accessory ever for a doctor purchased for my babys ped,11,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,4.0,positive,great workmanship well crafted but i bit heavy to be walking around all day this this around your neck,19,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,1.0,negative,it is too big when you try using the stethoscope with the elephant attached the top of the elephants head and ears impact on your chin really bothersome a total waste of money,32,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,2.0,negative,it is does not fit to littman pediatric stethoscope,8,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,1.0,negative,cute as pictured unfortunately could not fit over my stethoscope although description said it would littman cardiology 3 seamless return and refund,21,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,1.0,negative,too large for the littmann classic stethoscope it hits your chin when you try and put the stethoscope on,19,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,2.0,negative,does not fit well on littmann cardio 3 or 4 and on lightweight either and it adds a lot of weight,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,1.0,negative,it is way too big to be used on a normal stethoscope like the littmann classic it is pretty much useless in this combination,24,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,4.0,positive,my only issue is that it can not attach well to the stethoscope due to it is size,16,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,2.0,negative,too much big for a female really annoys u when u have to check a patient after putting it on very cute but disappointed that i can not use it,29,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,5.0,positive,thisis a little bulky but overall cute and definitely an eye piece to distract a toddler,18,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,poor product clogged printer extruder i was forced to clean and disassemble the printer extruder,15,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,makes very nice prints however with a small note this plastic is not flexable at all this makes support structures tend to damage parts when removed so best for models with no support needed or be extremely careful,38,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,my printer jammed 1 hour in after setting the heat at 228c between the 225 and 230 they decla still fixing the mess from the print nozzle,27,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i could not print more than 1 - 2 layers before filament became jammed measured with a caliper and found it to be 179 mm in some places and 189 mm in others i was disappointed because i received this for a birthday gift and was saving it for special occasions only to find it unusable it was jammed so badly in my extruder i had to pull it out with pliers hopefully there is no permanent damage,75,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,printed fine at 185c even although the spool said to print at a higher temp i was happy with the slightly metallic sheen to the final finish i was printing a joke trophy / award and it came out better than expected,41,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,the filament was visibly tangled and kinked on the spool when i received it my review is based solely upon that at this point I am attempting to print with it now but i have very little hope as I am sure the tangles will because the filament to break or pull out of the extruder during the print i will never buy this again and identification advise not to take the chance on it,73,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed using this filament it has a nice finish and sheen after it is been printed on average it requires higher temperatures than standard pla filament i was using a nozzle temperature of approximately 230 degrees celsius and a bed temperature of 65 to 75 degrees celsius it was not difficult to calibrate my slicer software i would like to try other filaments by this company as i was impressed by this filament,74,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,it printed well at the suggested temperature on my printrbot metal but it is definitely more brittle than other pla i have used objects tended to break a little easier,30,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this bronze filament prints particularly well and it really does have a metallic shiny look to it i was impressed with the results of my first print with this filament no problems with printing at all my only regret is the limited amount of filament on the spool but hey it is a specialtyif you are looking for that true bronze look without the cost of buying a tumbler then i would recommend this product just keep in mind that it does produce a shiny metallic look i have already purchased a second spool,96,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,if you are looking for a bronze fill this is not the stuff you are looking for i was dooped do not do the same and think that it is,28,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i purchased this pla the extruding temperature was higher than most of the pla i had been using so i set everything up however when printing the pla does not produce even results also this is the only filament that has gummed up my printer i had to take apart my extruder and clean it out afterwards after that experience all my other filaments work like a champ,68,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,this is a repurchase and they must have changed the formula because theis different it is more of a dull brown / green than bronze and does not have a look metallic at all also unlike colorfabb and esun bronze filaments this brand has no actual metal content the last time i purchased this it had a very accurate bronzenot this time the photo still shows how it looked as the bronze metallic material this is a bait and switch i will not be purchasing it again after this experience i can recommend their metallic silver however,97,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,printed fine but it was brown not bronze,8,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,prints fairly well but it is rather expensive considering it is only a 05 kg roll and theis not bronze not even close,23,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,more of a brownbut if you shine it up with high grit sandpaper it really shines on an odd note it smells almost like maple syrup,28,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,prints great at 225c theless metallic than others and has an even opaquethe diameter is consistent and the filament is smooth off the roll with hardly any bends,32,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,not reflective at all comes out as a dull brown,11,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,very pleased with this filament on my mod-t printer from new matter I have made several successful prints with it the spool has a thoughtful slot in the side to hold the end which is a nice touch for storage,39,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i keep hoping to find a bronze filament that is bronze and this one is not it at best it is a yellow ochreno metallic properties and certainly no actual bronze disappointing may be good for a poop emoji although and after the poop emoji it made a nice loofah sponge out of what should have been a sculpture with 20 fill unfortunately iy decided that clogging the nozzle was more fun so is getting returned to amazon innediately crap filament,81,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,it is a bad filament when i tried to print something the plastic can not melt it good it is like has air inside,22,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this is the s i love this stuff more than any other filament i have it adheres like a champ and spools nicely although i do reccomend feeding out the first 10 or 20 feet and then re-reeling as in the begining of the roll it can get a touch tricky the pieces I have made with it come out beautifully it strings a bit at high speed and requires around 235 for heat and i like to use 70 on my bed but this is all to be expected it is brittle when it is done so it makes it easy to remove supports or stringing can not say enough good stuff about this material,112,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,one of the best pla filaments that i ever used very sad that is not availabe anymore,17,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this filament prints very very well i print at 210 degrees on an unheated bed i was nervous to use it for support material but it broke off easily it has a bit of a sheen and looks great,39,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,it is most definitely not bronze looking like the sample they advertise with which is disappointing considering that is what i chose to buy it,24,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,do not be fooled by the preview pictures this is not a metallic filament it is brown plain and simple that being said it prints extremely well this would easily be a five start review for quality alone but they are vastly misrepresenting theand type of pla i would return it but I shall find some other use for it sadly this was purchased for a clients print which i do not have time to order a proper metallic pla for,81,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,printed fine at 225 per the manufacturers recommendation but it has zero metallic look just a dull brown not a bad earthy dull brown mind you but the word metallic is in the product name and it is just not true I have used many other filaments with much more metallic effect so i have a point of reference,57,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,very good material it absorbs moisture more quickly than other brands I have tried so definitely store with desicant I have gotten into the habit of using airtight containers to store all my filaments as i live in a very moist environment,40,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,printed well not as shiny as i expected it to be but prints turned out nice and strong,18,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,this filaments very frangible and breaks easy the coil length i purchased either was not a single continuous length or was so fragile it broke into several pieces of various lengths in shipping the filament breaks so easily it is not practical to print with since it can not bend well enough to make it to the extruder from the take up spool and has a tendency to break during printing was never able to get anything to successfully print because of this but the failed aborted printed pieces were also very fragile and broke into pieces trying to remove from the print bed i would not waste any money on this filament despite the fact that it looks great on the spool just like a copper penny unfortunately more fragile than dried mud,131,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,stuff looks brilliant and prints wonderfully for me unfortunately the last batch i purchased the filament was missing the metallic additive so it was just poop brown returned for a refund i ended up switching to gizmo dorks 175 mm metal bronze filament 1 kg for 3d printers,49,29
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i have used the kit for about 2 - 3 weeks i have not been using this daily but probably 2 - 3 times a week the products are easy to use the creams are thick and easy to apply the containers are small but as described on the package i definitely feel that my skin is softer smoother and tighter i do not think it is a dramatic change but using it consistently or especially right before an event could be worth it,78,0
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,this bliss product smells and works great can def see a difference in problem areas would recommend to anyone wanting to firm up,23,1
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i have been using it sparingly for about a month and definitely see results i did not have a huge problem with cellulite i am around 18 body fat which is prettyfor a woman but i had a few dimples in the back of my thighs this stuff will not work if you do not workout in addition to using it it is not a magic potion i read a lot of reviews that it did not work try doing some dead lifts and squats or eat better in addition to using the product line i would recommend this to anyone,103,2
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,not too shure this is working use it 3 - 5 ties a week had also cavi-lipo treatments also not sure it is worth it,23,3
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i love this stuff it is working very nicely ive been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin looks so much smoother just in time for vacation to mexico i would reccomend it to anyone especially if you are person like me who has very sensitive skin bliss fatgirlslim is gluten free i will totally be buying this again,60,4
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i tried it it did not work for me i was hoping for the miracles i read in the other reviews but it just did not happen for me,27,5
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i do not know if this works i think this is a good start to see which of the items you want after you run out if you do the whole thing every day you will run out before too long but i like th tingly feel of the daytime cream i like the soft scent of the nighttime cream when i ran out of the daytime i just used regular lotion did not have caffiene but i like to think this works the motion of rough massage seems to be real likely more benefitial than than just magic cream i think i will re buy the day cream,107,6
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,it works well if you exercise with the product,9,7
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i love these products they make my skin feel so fermantown even after one use the peppermints it is wonderful give them a try you will not be disappointed,28,8
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i normally do not write reviews but had to do with this it is deathly not a crazy miracle potion that you put on and bam cellulites gone but i could definitely see a difference it is one of those products that you will have to keep on buying to achieve the results you want I have been using for about three weeks and there has definitely a change in my thighs i will continue to use this product and hope to see a bigger difference as i continue my only complaint and the reason why i gave it four stars instead of five i only wish that the scrub was a bigger i used it up within a week other than that the product is great gives a slight tingle and smells awesome would definitely recommend,135,9
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,i have been using the product for awhile and have not seen obvious results i can say are from the product i have been using it for about 2 weeks now have bought the larger sizes to continue this sample size will not last very long possibly a week i have made changes to my diet and have been working out daily while using this product so any results i am attributing to that i still have cellulite there has not been really any change to that i should have listened to my inner voice that told me to save my money and just get results the good old fashion way of good nutrition and daily workouts did provide a tingling sensation when used but other that that it is a worthless product,132,10
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,great cooling after application smells good and all containers were filled to the maximum,14,11
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,very small containers i only used the scrub in the shower and the lotion you are supposed to put on before bed I have had this for about 6 months and the rubber is discolored to a gross looking yellow and there has mold in between the cracks where water gets in and stays trapped i noticed a small difference in my thighs but nothing dramatic would most like not buy again,69,12
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,bought the entire system took pics from day 1 to day 30 not one difference does not work,17,13
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i followed the directions perfectly as much as it made my skin feel soft it did nothing for my cellulite,20,14
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,love the massager and the firming cream I am not sure if the sleep cream really does anything the stimulating massage is temporary results that only last a few hours but it still works wish they gave you larger amounts of the firming cream and the shower scrub,47,15
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i have been using this product for almost 2 months now and only see a slight difference this pack only lasted me 2 weeks but that is with me applying it on my thighs butt arms and abs the results were not great enough to persuade me to pay 90 each month for new lotions i will stick will nivea at least i saw dramatic results after 2 weeks of using their product,73,16
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,it is not worth wasting your money i have not seen any improvement and i do not really care for the smell of it,21,17
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,not worth it in my opinion it really did not do anything,11,18
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i did not notice a change at all and i was working out everyday and eating on a strict diet disappointed in product,22,19
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i saw no change when using any of these products the scrub was not special in any way i saw no improvement when using the fat girl slim creams day or night i will say although the night cream is a pleasant sent which did help me fall asleep i do use the massager in the shower to get out kinks in my neck but again did not help my cellulite at all i would definitely save your money,79,20
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i have not seen any benefit at all,8,21
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,my wife loved the product and was very happy with the outcome,12,22
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i just wish they came in bigger containers but i like this brand,14,23
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,these products arrived really fast and i instantly started using them i really like them they have a strong mint smell and i started noticing a change in cellulite within a month obviously you have to exercise as well with this product i recommend although,45,24
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,when i opened the white bottle day creme i can not believe my eye 1/3 of the creme was gone it is shrinked maybe the sealing had not been placed at the right place because it came off with the lid when i opened it disappointed,43,25
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i have been using this for a few days now and i am thrilled with my results it really firms out everything and makes you look so slim i would defiantly recommend this just remember to work out and eat healthy,41,26
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,these are really nice products and i love the scrub really does smooth the skin and the night cream is great thick to go on but not so heavy that you feel smothered before you go to bed it is also greaseless so you will not leave any residue on the sheets either,51,27
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i have been using this product for several weeks along with an exercise routine i have noticed a difference in my tummy area i have had two kids and have stretch marks and loose skin in that area i found it did tighten up my problem areas i think i will need to purchase again in order to get the full effects of my continued exercise and toning with this product it is however not a miracle in a bottle,80,28
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i just ordered this product 2 weeks ago because the price was not too bad and i had to try something to get rid of my inner thigh issue before i went on vacation at the end of march truthfully i can already see a difference and i am happily surprised with the product due to the mixed reviews so i had nowhat i was going to get yes the creams are small but if you have a small problem area then it works great i put the fatgirlslim on twice a day as recommended and fatgirlsleep on before i went to bed and i used the scrubber to put on both lotions because i feel like it got it in there more and i have a feeling that is what made it work for me i was expecting the products to have a bad / powerful smell due to other reviews and it really is not that bad it just smells like a scented lotion overall i am happy with this product and would suggest buying it for a smallish problem area because it is not that expensive and you never know what would happen,192,29
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i love it i think it is useful i will buy it again i hope i can get more discounthei hei hei,21,30
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i like this set and once i used it up i reordered in larger quantities i think it works my skin is definitely smoother,24,31
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,i thought this product would have worked in fact i was hoping it would well after i used it all up i think the areas that i was trying to get rid of the chubbiness in areas became worse and i used it everyday and exercised everyday i would not buy this product again i repeat i would not buy it again i will not recommend this product at all waste of money,73,32
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,i made a purchase and i get very upset about it because i would give a gift to a friend on a special day and i could not do it,29,33
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i just received my bliss fat girl slim care treatment kit even although i do not like the name of it i do love what has inside the packaging before i bought what looked like a tub of cream i had been using just the white packaging cream with qusome i was getting massages 4 times a week all over my body with that cream i saw results the first week dimished dimples in my legs and buttocks reduced my lumps on my back and smoothed my skin overall i feel the need to say i am overweight after having a baby which is now 14 months old and when i was getting the massages i was not working out two months ago i will start using the treatment kit and workout so i will come back to review on the whole routine however i know that bliss qusome product does work so i bought the treatment kit with faith that all of their other products will also work,168,34
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,bought this on the recommendation of a friend i currently use eminence products and was looking for something different i like this product but i still prefer eminence no creams can work miracles but definitely improves the skins appearance when used as directed continuously,44,35
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i have had 4 children and have recently been working out and eating healthy so i was looking for something that would help tighten in that department to be honest i really did not notice a change your money could probably be spent better else where,45,36
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,this product actually worked for me and i really liked the rubber buff tool for the shower i used all products but the buff remains useful in the shower with any soap product the fat girl skin creme did help to condition dry or puckered skin appearance cellulite but i had no expectations that this would rid my body of that anticipate improvement especially if used together at regular bathing intervals,72,37
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i thought i would try this kit before buying full size products the day and night creams are both wonderful and have shown positive results however the scrub has a terrible scent it is also good but the scent of it will prevent me from buying again overall worth the money and my thighs look much better than before i am so pleased with this product that i have purchased others in the fatgirlslim line to try,76,38
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,i bought this mainly for the massager which i love the body scrub is very nice I have not noticed any results with the creams although but with the sizes being small i may not have been able to give it enough time I am hooked on the love handler and the six pack so I am just going to stick with those,60,39
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i liked being able to get this an a sort of trial run pack with all of the components doubly so after the fact because it did not work for me and i did in fact follow the instructions i do still like to use the shower massager from time to time although,52,40
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,not worth the money it is an okay product i would not buy again,12,41
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,i used this product on my stomach for 2 days after day 2 my whole entire stomach started breaking out in a terrible rash i would not recommend this product to anymore,32,42
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,i tried religiously and i really wanted this to work on my post baby belly but alas i still have the dough tummy fatgirlbroke,25,43
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,i love it leaves skin soft and smooth,8,44
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,1.0,negative,i have been using this product for over a month twice a day and have seen no change my dark spots have not lighten at all,26,0
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,5.0,positive,a sales woman at walgreens told me vichy dark spot remover is what dermatologist use i purchased a tube and I am very pleased how well the product works in a week i could see a difference I have been using it for about 2 months and i like the results i checked out amazon and the price was more to my budget,61,1
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,i bought this product to see if it would get rid of dark spots / over-pigmentation left behind by acne after about a month of use i found that it only made the spots a little lighter but overall did not really help reduce their visibility nor did it prevent the formation of new dark spots as i got more acne given although these marks were very old scars after using a second tube of proeven i found i had much better results however the spots were not entirely gone but were much more faded as the product advertises and less noticeable my overall conclusion is that it will perhaps take more than one tube of the stuff over a period of nearly 3 months in order to really be effective for some people this is pretty good considering that by themselves the spots would probably either never go away or take years to disappear,151,2
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,as i have mentioned in my other reviews i really really like this product for giving my skin an instant radiant shiny look and it does whiten my skin to a great extend and evens my skin tone while at it it also smells great and feels great on my skin like I am putting on natural milk on my face but after more than a month it did not really do anything for my spots neither my reddish acne spots or my brown-ish sun spots i started using a filipino product that is a combination of black soap and whitening cream along with using vichy and it seems to work better although the filipino product is very harsh on my skin i believe in no pain no gain especially since i have very stubborn red and brown spots due to the fact that i have dry and sensitive skin i probably will not buy this product again unless i came across a good deal but overall I am satisfied with it is whitening and radiance features,172,3
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,it smell good the skin get a better tone when you use this cream coud be better if work on dark spots more fast,24,4
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,1.0,negative,all skin is different so maybe it will work for somebody but it did not work for me the texture is nice silky without being oily not thick or too creamy so it felt nice on my skin but in the end it just did not do anything to help with dark spots i ended up going with a rx hydroquinone cream and that has made the difference and costs less than many of these correcting / dark spot creams,76,5
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,1.0,negative,i bought this product 3 months ago base on good review i used it all up the whole tube last me for about 3month i have some brown spot on my face and this product did nothing to change it waste of money,43,6
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,5.0,positive,although i do not have any major dark spots i do have a few areas that have slight scarring i really like using vichy dark spot corrector it is light smells nice and seems to do the job of correcting the problem areas over a short period of time,48,7
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,5.0,positive,this by far is the best product i have used for dark spots i could see a difference in as little as 2 days i will continue to use,29,8
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,1.0,negative,i used vichy proeven daily on four of my age spots for about six months nothing happened unfortunately i have forgotten the name of the drops that did work for me in the past bad purchase,36,9
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,i received 3 separate tubes of this product in my beauty boxes glossybox topbox luxebox birchbox i have always had a hard time using moisturizers because they were always too greasy or felt unnatural on my skin so i always started using them then eventually stopped i have not had issues with dark spots other than freckles which i actually like so i probably would not have bought the product on my own however i love this product the moisturizing effect is excellent i love the scent and it feels great on my skin i have used it for 3 months straight without getting sick of it best moisturizer i have ever used period,113,10
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,5.0,positive,i have fair skin and this product works wonderfully for me on acne marks just have to experiment to find the product right for you this one always goes on light smooth and the results are nice,37,11
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,2.0,negative,i did not get the results that i was expecting from this product i used it consistently and as instructed and i did not see any results the delivery was fast tho,31,12
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,this product is good really helps the only thing is it takes awhile to see results like 3ish plus months for me to notice plus too see change you must me using it continuously twice a day as directed do not stress if you do not see immediate results be patient,49,13
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,5.0,positive,love this my grandma has switched to use cruelty free makeup and complains that cruelty free masquera is clumpy that is not the case with juice beauty goes on super smooth there is a unique smell but once you use it for a while it is fine not waterproof but worth it if your all for the ingredients,57,0
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,1.0,negative,the portion of the case that keeps the wand from getting all full of mascara comes right out with the wand making this mascara impossible to use any longer,29,1
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,2.0,negative,i wanted to like this mascara but after a week it went clumpy i tried three times and finally gave up and returned,23,2
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,4.0,positive,yes i like it i like her products,8,3
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,5.0,positive,it is really hard to find a mascara that does not clump stays on and most of all does not smell like a bunch of bad chemicals i think this is great and best of all it is organic try it you will not regret it it is worth the splurge for your health,52,4
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,4.0,positive,a little liquidy so it takes a bit more effort then regular mascara but is great stuff no problems with my sensitive eyes makes my blonde lashes look long and black my lashes are healthier and longer from using this against regular mascara,43,5
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,2.0,negative,this mascara gets two stars for being an organic plant based product but that is the only reason it gets two stars first let me say that my lashes are fine in texture and average in length i have enough of them although so that with the right product they have the potential to look lush and longer this is not that product this mascara comes out of the tube very wet i curl my lashes and it is so wet that it will undo the curl and weigh them down it does not separate my lashes in fact it does the opposite it clumps them together it does absolutely nothing for volume and if i happen to accidentally get a little bit of it on the water line under the lashes of my upper lid it stings by no means did i expect this mascara or any mascara for that matter to give me kardashian type results but i was hopeful for at least one positive result it miserably falls short of even reasonable expectations,175,6
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,1.0,negative,this was the worst make up i have ever bought in my life i wish i had not wasted my money it is clumpy and it flakes so badly that both of my eyes are now irritated please do not waste your money on this crap,46,7
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,4.0,positive,it is gets a solid four stars from me when i first bought this i was thrilled this was the first mascara in decades that did not give me bloodshot irritated eyes but after three or four weeks the same old problems came back it got very clumpy and my eyes got irritated by the end of the day this is probably because there are no preservatives so at 1875 once a month or less when it is on sale at whole foods it is a much better deal than chanel lancome and more which have because me misery for years,96,8
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,4.0,positive,i wish it were waterproof but it is a nice mascara,11,9
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,1.0,negative,this product is terrible in terms of coverage and manufacturing of the tube / wand the opening of the tube broke on the third use so the whole wand pulls out without having the piece in place that wipes some of it off to evenly distribute the product on the brush before the wand broke the mascara itself provided minimal lash coverage you would need five minutes worth of constantly coating to get anything to even show up,77,10
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,4.0,positive,wand does not get fully saturated with mascara but it is enough for daily use good separation and not clumpy because there has not enough mascara on the wand,28,11
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,2.0,negative,like the application except it is a two-coat mimimum but that is about it if you do not remove it before sleeping when you wake up it comes off in these tiny prolific flakes the get in your eyes will not buy again,39,12
Luxury_Beauty,B00F39TBKS,5.0,positive,i had been having eye trouble for a month and a half and realized i was reacting to my mascara i was getting stys red watery and painful eyes so i picked this up to hopefully find a natural option since i like wearing only mascara can not explain how happy i am with this product i have not had any eye problems and it looks great,66,13
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,this is a very amusing film with delightful performances of it is stars peter sellers sophia loren and nice second roles de sica-graham stark easy going film highly entertaining recommended,27,0
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,viewed in a theater would prepare one for viewing but video leaves much to be desired too trite choppy and predictable,21,1
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,anything with maggie smith is interesting to me I am one of her biggest fans,14,2
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,this movie was very dry and boring i could not even get thru the it all,15,3
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,great performances and shaws dialogue could not be wittier fantastic it is shot as scenes in a play rather than having been opened up / expanded visually for film which was a good choice for this vehicle and the intimate relationships between the characters maggie smith heads up a fine cast and gives a truly stellar performance,54,4
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,2.0,negative,maggie smith is a wonderful actress but this one did not do it for me,15,5
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,fast shipment but movie was like a play description was not accurate,12,6
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,i am so so disappointed in viewing this movie just last night the english accent is difficult to understand and moreso with maggie for this part i had to fast forward to see if it got better which it did not i would not recommend it at all i love watcing her in all so far this was not so good and surely not my favorite maggie smith film,69,7
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,very early maggie smith a video of a play and hard to understand i did not enjoy it,19,8
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,this movie is worth seeing just for watching maggie smith it is theater like play like i urge you to keep that in mind when watching it,26,9
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,a terrific movie with dame maggie walking away with it as she does everything she is in i believe this is from a bbc set and it is excellent,29,10
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,love the movie and your quick shipping thank you sincerely catherine buechting,12,11
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,this is a better movie than i had expected peter sellers did another uncannily dead on imitation of an accent to go with his many imitations of accents from england and america and he got to read some actual gbs lines which was nice there was more language from the george bernard shaw play than i had expected dennis price and alistair sim offer nice comic support i just wish they could have used an actress less concerned with how she looked and more interested in the language of the play sophia lorens performance almost ruined the film for me,100,12
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,this turned out to be really boring but i love maggie smith from the old days thanks betty,18,13
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,the millionairess is a great film filled with comedy and romance i watched this movie lots of times sophia loren is wonderful in this movie,25,14
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,never find fault with maggie smith she has one of the great actresses dvd arrived on time and was packaged fine,20,15
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,it says dvd but what i got was a pal movie that only plays on your computer if it was not for sophia lorens fine ass in this movie i would have cut it off at the beginning,37,16
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,2.0,negative,it was a stage play and it was not one of maggie smiths sort of movie sort of silly it did not appeal to me and i love her acting,25,17
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,having just viewed ms smiths other project for this same year travels with my aunt it is quite interesting to compare this television project both being about a similar type of woman for me this one is the shining star and deserved the big budget film treatment given to travels which did not go over with me both were knock yourself out parts with an over-the-top type of woman again there is such a notable difference in ms smiths portrayals in this one she definitely exhibits the energy but successfully i thought in travels the aplomb was a bomb i was actually embarrassed for her it was an era of wacky and outlandish characters and doings with again at least one high energy character for me this production carried it off without chewing up the scenery definitely interested in revisits here but nevermore for the annoying travels ms smiths painful parts included however that one is a rare exception for the wonderfully versatile and capable star performer [ note millionairess is worth it just for the dual fur flaps in the face at the beginning indeed no one can assault a staircase like epifania ],194,18
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,2.0,negative,i love maggie smith but i did not like this picture the dialogue sounded like a machine gun in it is delivery which took away from it is content her character was supposed over the top but this time it was too much,41,19
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,the millionairess tour de force for maggie smith she pulls out all registers a delight to watch all the best and thank you,23,20
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,i love sofia loren her movies she wore so many good outfits in this moviethis is a good one but i aready it exellant service wish you had that kind of woman staring sofia and tab hunter,36,21
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,after reading the first review of the millionairess 1960 here i made sure to heed the warning about the fox lorber dvd of this movie which is what this listing is for i bought one here that was the pal / all region format but the back of the case said region 2 and there has confusion there and i returned it for a refund but thankfully there are other offerings of this movie and i had to do some hunting but i found one and in cinemascope avoided that pan and scan where i found it as on ebay for 1699 disc only it is got and image of sophia loren in a hat and black oorset on the disc this one is the real deal as i remember seeing it on tcm delightful cheers,132,22
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,i do not need to say anything further about this video of course maggie smith is delightful unfortunately this movie is not,22,23
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,i love my movie collection 97 was bought from amazon i will continue to collect and i do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did i receive a broke or scratched movie just make sure you read about the seller that they have good scores and reviews,60,24

Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,i never got to see this one i bought a used one it skipped and was so messed up i could not watch it,23,28
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,maggie smith is one of the great old ladies of the british stage and screen their movies have a certain style and flair about them that seems to make them special and maybe a little corny too this one is no different a millionaires go to a barrister to make sure her prize fighter husband can not get any of her money because he is running around on her can not divorce because of the scandal in walks the husband with his girlfriend to the same barrister corny enough yet not quiet until her gentleman friend comes to the same barrister a laugh a minute,104,29
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,this movie was a crack up it was fun to watch with my kids the millionairess was a drama queen fun movie,22,30
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,i love maggie smith but this is slow get a book go for a walk but skip this movie done on a stage and just a sad piece of acting,30,31
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,you will see sophia loren in black stockings and a girdle in my opinion this is sophia loren second best movie a boy on a dolphin is her best,29,32
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,the only reason i bought this was because of maggie smith but this has to be the most ghastly production the bbc has ever created maggie must have been desperate for employment to have taken on such a shabby tasteless idiotic inane show as this it has the hollow one room approach you might see in a stage play but no sane person would be able to watch this terrible show from start to finish it is so bad the dvd is not even useful as a cup coaster i have thousands of movies in my collection and this one rates with the bottom 3 worst movies imaginable which are not even worthwhile of being listed as part of the collection perhaps the british can tolerate this tripe but i do not know of too many on this side of the pond who could save your money there are other movies with maggie smith which would be worthwhile to buy,159,33
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,thank you for this movie it arrived when expected and in excellent condition i am very happy with the quality and response for this product,26,34
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,maggie smith is great in this film the story is not one of the best I have seen but her performance is spectacular as she always is,26,35
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,i have a collection of films like this i am happy to have added this one to it,18,36
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,i am a big movie buff and have hundreds i have collected this one is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever attempted to watch i got about a half hour into it and took it out absolutely boring,40,37
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,the bbc usually produces excellent movies and television series this was not the case with the millionairess this was a very low budget movies without any story-line the acting was poor i normally keep my dvds to view for a second or third time i gave this one to the salvation army this movie should not be sold it should be given away free of charge,66,38
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,this is an excellent production if you are at all interested in this i recommend getting the shaw collection dvd set instead these are a series of televised bbc play of the month the production values are not always top-notch but the acting is typically quite good the direction and sets are very stage-like as opposed to a tv or cinema movie this would be more enjoyable for shaw literature or theater fans than your average public maggie smith does a fantastic job the rest of the cast is excellent i have not read the play so i do not know if anything was changed the first time i tried watching it i fell asleep several times the next time i watched it i was glued to the screen,126,39
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,2.0,negative,the milionairess is a stage play that did not translate well onto the silver screen the filming was done many years ago and the acting is over-the-top to the point of haming-it-up the story line is good but presented in a somewhat hysterical and at times almost frenzied style as a stage play it would have been good but as a film i do not recommend unless you are interested in the history of theatre and acting i do not think gb shaw would have been pleased with this production the typical british humour seems lost in the frenzy of the acting,102,40
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,2.0,negative,i order two copies of the millionairess one for myself and one for a gift after watching it i was too embarassed to give it as a gift the play is simply poorly written and not up to the standard I have come to expect from english comedy there are a couple of clever lines here and there but it drags on and on maggie smith is a brilliant actress but even she could not save it,76,41
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,the millionairess has always been one of my favorite plays by bernard shaw along with pygmalion and caesar and cleopatra and this bbc production of it is definitely worth your money dame maggie smith is absolutely perfect as epifania and as expected steals the show and runs away with it the rest of the cast is perfect as well with the possible exception of charles gray as adrian who did not really fulfil my expectations of the character,77,42
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,shaws writing with maggie smiths performance makes for a most incredible play england oh how we love england,18,43
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,5.0,positive,when one gets tired of the violence sex and quite frankly impermissible bad language in modern films it is nice to go back to someone who knows how to use language eg george bernard shaw this movie was done poorly with sophia loren and peter sellers but i adored the play with maggie smith oh how she dominates her role at once we understand how magnificent a star she is she plays the richest woman in england who is obsessed with getting what she wants and having the cash to do it she is beautiful and arrogant yet brilliant in the ways of capitalism when she is given the challenge of getting a job and supporting herself without her wealth well she can do it because she understands money indeed she walks into businesses and transforms them into profitable enterprises whether the impact of her changes hurts the poor or middle class is of no concern to her profitability is the key this is a wonderful production and is a must for any maggie smith fan,172,44
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,the dvd does not offer the cinemascope version it s like flat coca cola,13,45
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,4.0,positive,there are obvious flaws in this film for starters it suffers from extreme staginess it is socialist message is not so much delivered but bludgeoned home i give this film a pass because of the appealing performances by the films leads peter sellers and sophia loren sellers gives a terrific low-key turn as the sweet humanistic doctor loren is earthy yet manages to humanize the spoiled heiress she plays as written her character comes of as unappealing but loren manages to engender empathy good supporting cast that includes alistair sim as lorens barrister vittorio de sica as a sweat shop owner and dennis price kind hearts and coronets as lorens psychiatrist stanley kubrick fans should note the presence of miriam karlin the catwoman in a clockwork orange as de sicas wife,128,46
Movies_and_TV,1572525509,1.0,negative,too bad this is pan and scan the film is utterly charming but the pan and scan detracts from everything particularly the sets and of course the actors a letterboxed edition is badly needed surprising from the previously reliable fox lorber i bought this without checking too bad,49,47
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,5.0,positive,todd haynes who earlier made a film about karen carpenter that used nothing but barbie dolls sets this story in 1988 los angeles with a woman juliana moore who is allergic to the 20th century the film opens with moore and her husband making love but the brutality of the mans thrusts and the bored expression on her face reveals her alienation from her life this is later reinforced throughout the first half of the film when we see her with her friends and family finally unable to combat her psychosomatic illness she withdraws to a retreat in new mexico run by a subtly tyrannical new-age leader the results are disturbing and bewildering and moore gives the performance of a lifetime safe works as documentary satire and allegory all at once,131,0
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,2.0,negative,perhaps my expectations were too high considering how hard this title is to obtain i ordered a copy from amazon uk todd haynes other films poison and velvet goldmine are visually striking and the framing of safe reminded me of artwork this formality however distances us from the narrative and seems to highlight the miscasting of julianne moore moores previous supporting roles showed a tartness which was very appealing however it is perverse of haynes to cast her as a bimbo she may have the skin for her character but she really is not believable and haynes strands her in his huge long shots when she is called upon to give a speech near the end of the film it is almost embarassing the story behind safe is interesting enough but i think it could have been much more than the curio that it is if haynes had used jessica harper in therather than giving her only a few minutes of screen time in a supporting role,170,1
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,4.0,positive,the first part of the movie is very realistic on how it feels to become I shall with chemical sensitivities although i doubt healthy people will get a lot of the subtleties that is masterfully played by moore the second part looses it by suggesting this is all in our head and we just need to go to a spiritual retreat in the desert to heal i reality there are real medical centers like ehc-d in dallas that treats this disease or maybe the movie really means to say that there is little hope for the I shall as the world successfully imposes the view that it is psychosomatic i can not figure that out,112,2
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,4.0,positive,this is one of those films that starts out funny and ends with a serious undertone much like heathers did weird sterile atmosphere throughout and definitely thought-provoking if you can handle a slow-paced dreamlike film this might be a favorite,40,3
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,2.0,negative,i gave [ safe ] more of a chance than i would anything else because i hoped and prayed that after 118 minutes there could somehow be an ending that made up for the silence the tension the depression leading up to it i was impressed by only a few things in [ safe ] the acting by all involved most importantly the completely different looking and sounding julianne moore is simply excellent it is understated and drab just what the film succeeds at best the music the clothing and the sets evoke the 80s the time of the film the single biggest problem is that you desperately want the plot toto a huge ending that wows you especially after sitting through such a depressing ride of a film and it does not happen i just do not get it,137,4
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,2.0,negative,gets off to a great start that is eery and weird but then it morphs into something about people who are allergic to the environment that is when it gets very boring indeed you keep expecting something scary to happen it has a stepford wives quality that never pays off not worth the bother,53,5
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,2.0,negative,as an individual who suffers from some chemical sensitivities i purchased this movie thinking that it was really going to be an eye-opening movie for those around me who do not smell the off-gassing carpets particle-board furniture or fabric softeners instead i found a movie that begins with a woman who suddenly becomes environmentally I shall but ends with her entering a safe haven do nothing for her community instead of a true environmental clinic that would actually assist her in improving her health i was very disappointed in the movie and yes there are some of us who have been over-exposed to some chemicals that truly become environmentally sensitive,109,6
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,4.0,positive,this is not a movie where the heroine struggles against all odds to triumph over her illness as the audience learns facts about it it is a bleak look at how society fails those who are different or have a problem then tells them it is their own fault and if they would just do some positive thinking then they will be fine carols illness is real and serves as a metaphor for her alienation from society our modern world makes her sick on many levels but no-one will help her only blame her i do not think the movie is as ambiguous as some claim it is clear that we are meant to sympathise with carol and not with her bored husband uncaring doctor and greedy self-help guru if we admit that carol is really sick then what does that say about the world we live in kubrick fans will not mind the slow pace fans of dark satire will enjoy haynes harsh take on modern life and self-help cults,163,7
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,4.0,positive,i liked it it is disturbing cuz there is no escaping this world something incredibly sucky always lies at the heart of it no matter where you are or what you do there is no answer but people continue to make themselves sick by searching in vain for one,48,8
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,5.0,positive,i received the dvd promptly and in very new condition,10,9
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,1.0,negative,nice shot composition great performance from a young julianne moore however will her domestic-housewife-in-a-dilemma act get old and with a menacing realism this movie is painful if the fast forward button had not been invented i would have never have finished this one i believe haynes was making a statement about mental illness and institutionalization that it does not work and by substituting an environmental virus for mental illness haynes makes his audience feel vulnerable but despite how successful it was in reviling and depressing me i hated sitting through it so i have to give the lowest recommendation,97,10
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,1.0,negative,i wanted to like this movie i was intrigued and it was visually beautiful but it was so heavy handed and asked too many questions without giving any answers how many shots of car exhausts or aerosol dispensers does the director need to make his point why is everybody around the main character so devoid of any emotion or compassion why is her life so full of material possessions so empty why is everyone at the retreat either crazy or entraced by the charismatic figure who runs the place surely there are people affected by this disorder who do not end up living like the bubble boy i like ms moore but she plays this role with a deer in the headlights look i do not understand all the rave reviews i give this turkey one star,136,11
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,5.0,positive,this is the most unforgetable movie i have ever seen,10,12
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,5.0,positive,thank you to the storytellers of a modern american reality this is an educational movie referred to as sick building syndrome or acute environmental illness / sensitivity / allergy it is a real affliction for many whose immune systems are already compromised by the ambient toxic chemicals in our environment and yes further weakened by an atmosphere of soulless consumerism and isolation from meaning julianne moore is her usual stunningly effective character artist the pace and tone are perfect for her nervy confidence to go out on a limb in her work this was bound to be box office mistake so unconsoling it turns one to the truth of ones own ordeal in society there is just the mystery of a lone person misunderstood struggling against great odds that are counter to her well being she is unconsciously in complicity with those forces and learning to reconnect with her authenticity i was stunned at how much this movie made me care,158,13
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,4.0,positive,this film demonstrates todd haynes cinematic mastery even more so than his newer more critically praised film far from heaven his ability to create extreme levels of unease and tension in his audience with seemingly simple scenes is amazing this film is satiric at times but the satire is so dark you will more likely cringe than laugh this film has a similar theme to american beauty but rather than attempting to be hip and sugar coated this film goes straight for the jugular no punches are pulled in this shocking and profoundly disturbing vision of the claustrophobic monotony and falsity of life,102,14
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,1.0,negative,yes i noticed how this movie very subtly points out the monotony of so-called normal lives and usually i appreciate any film that is willing to do this unfortunately in this film it all adds up to an excruciatingly monotonous story if you like movies that drag on forever scenes that linger on boring people for way too long this is your movie i like julianne moore but here she is misused i did not care about her character i did not care about any of the characters everyone is just very dull,90,15
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,1.0,negative,safe is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen it ranks among ace ventura 2 and the remake of the island of dr moreau featuring marlon brando safe is agonizingly slow stupefyingly boring and if you are any kind of a skeptic like myself you will be rolling your eyes constantly do not waste your time with this stinker multiple chemical sensitivity has been defined as if you sympathize with people who wear foil beanie caps and live in overturned toilet bowls this is the movie for you by the way i say all of these things as a huge julianne moore fan if it had not been for her i would have stopped the movie 15 minutes into it,119,16
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,1.0,negative,I am sorry i just did not get it i know people like this movie but i do not like it at all it is by far the slowest movie I have ever seen it was beautifully shot and a slightly interesting plot even a tad eerie but just [ was bad ] right up until the end when absolutely nothing happened nothing happened the entire movie she gets sick from everyday chemicals that are everywhere and seeks refuge from all this pollution in a new mexico retreat run by a swindler / preist guru type that is it call me spoiled expecting an ending too village voice called it the greatest movie of the decade and the new york times said it was unnerving it is not darkly comic either all lies the movies one redeeming factor is that it is in fact original,134,17
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,2.0,negative,if you are looking for a terrific visual and audio experience you can pass on this dvd the soundtrack is pure mono and the picture is average if you really want to purchase this movie get theversion although that is not much of a bargain at 18 better yet rent it the only reason i bought this movie dvd is because jessica harper is in it she had two very small scenes there are some other supporting roles that are nicely done and appealing yes julianne moores performance is extremely good she literally looks weak and sick throughout the film but makes some nice fashion statements i do not know if this film is for or against environmental whackos and it will a while before i watch it again sometimes you roll theon dvds and that is what i did here i really prefer a presentation with great sound and picture that is what dvds are about,158,18
Movies_and_TV,6303900798,5.0,positive,haynes style in this film reminds me very much of kubrick the static long shots the deliberate gradual pace the startling and unexpected cut to black at the end it gets under your skin and stays there moore the best actress of her generation has never been better although you should see vanya on 42nd street for more of her range i respect haynes for respecting me enough to let me decide how to interpret what he shows me great movie by the way someone earlier wrote todd haynes is an amazing director and he hasof course I am still trying to decipher that one haynes is also caucasian does that also make him an amazing director,117,19
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,1.0,negative,it was only average at the time of it is release michael j fox was pretty good in this film but the film goes no whereforgettable on a whole,28,0
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good film depicting the darker side of the 1980s the story behind thecharacter in the film portrayed by michael j fox is one that takes a turn for the worse but leaves the viewer with a glimmer of hope this film encapsulates the indifference of the fast-paced professional world as it collides with the toxic indulgences of the 1980s,65,1
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,it has very little of the brilliance of the book but bright lights big city provides a somewhat entertaining look at the decadent 80s most of the merit resides on michael j fox who manages against great odds to make jamie a relatable character on the verge of self-destruction kiefer sutherland is also great as his sleazy enabler and sidekick phoebe cates on the other hand is the movies worst mistake she has pretty enough but not for one second i bought that she was a runway model how tall is she five five or for that matter that she would inspire such passion from fox,104,2
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,some people may think it is difficult to watch a movie where thespends almost the entire film being a jerk and snorting his paycheck but stick with this one and you witness michael j fox reaching his sort of salvation the score is outstanding 80s especially the donald fagen version of the title song and the closing number watch for a great cameo by jason robards and the painful reward given to keefer sutherland,76,3
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,1.0,negative,man they call people today self-absorbed this movie felt so repetitive how many times do we need to see the main character bolt for a bathroom stall to get high and forced i ended up leaving it on as background noise while doing better things with my time than continue watching the only thing powerful about this movie was how powerfully self-important and tedious it was,66,4
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,this movie was so dissapointing fox did a good job but phoebe cates was only in it for 5 minutes if that and so was dianne wiest although the scene between wiest and fox while she is dying is heartbreaking this movie really goes nowhere but at least the soundtrack is great,52,5
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,5.0,positive,this is one of my favorite 80s films set in new york city night culture based on jay mcinerys classic novel this movie i call the less than zero of the east coast break out character for michael j fox the story mj fox plays jamie conway a cocaine addicted journalist for a new york magazine who can not let go of the past his character really struggles with letting go and adversity phoebe cates plays his model wife who leaves him he just recently lost his mother the flashbacks really show how the past haunts him he is struggling with cocaine addiction going out partying at new york city nightclubs his life is spinning out of control you can not help but feel sorry for his character a film about one mans high expectations on himself without letting go of the past great soundtrack and new york city setting essential to collection a great 80s new york city culture film,150,6
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,this movie was very consistent with the book if you liked the book made this a very good movie having read the book before seeing the moving gave me a bit more insight into the story but even without reading the book first viewers may watch in disbelief wondering how long will it take for michael j foxs character to kill himself or change his ways suffering through this drives home the ending of the film and makes this the moving story that it is a well done film with a strong cast the soundtrack is not bad either,98,7
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,great movie i had it onbut wanted it for dvd but sadly it was not released in widescreen and not having that option kind of bothers me about dvd releases given all that since i got the disk for free at best buy they offered a free dvd from a small set if you bought the sure thing and valley girl together i can live with this format for now maybe they will do a special edition some day although i doubt it as it was not a high profile film sigh,92,8
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,first touchstone home video releases new york stories in full screen only now mgm does the same thing with bright lights big city is this the beginning of a new trend i sincerely hope not at least give the option of selecting full screen or widescreen on the disc really liked this movie but the dvd release could have been better to say the least i give this 2 stars for dvd quality only one star for that the movie got released in a decent transfer even without widescreen the other that at least they bothered to include the theatrical trailer other than that disappointing,105,9
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,the first time i saw bright lights big city was when i was pretty young and knew nothing about drugs i also only saw michael j fox in comedies like back to the future and i was absolutely shocked to see him in this type of role my innocent childhood hero looked like a horrible person in this movie because he portrayed a horrible person after watching this film i vowed to never touch a drug in my life and i keep that vow jamie conway foxs character is a cocaine snorting selfish scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock bottom it took me years before i was able to accept fox in other roles after being literally taken in by his performance as far as entertainment value this film keeps you interested but it is not for casually viewing because you will be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that state of mind stays with you did i love the movie no did it do a good job scaring me off the night scene and from experimenting with drugs yes show it in any health class,190,10
Movies_and_TV,6304286481,5.0,positive,even if you do not get the storyline how can you not like the music this is like the ultra eighties music track and i thought the story line was excellent this movie is about an innocent guy nice guy who is trying to make the best of a life that should have been more if you do not like this movie than you must not have a heart,69,11
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,it beat my expectations i can say that much actually i thought it was really good while i was watching it i was very interested in the story line and how it would end but unfortunately they go ahead and ruin it with basically no ending you are left with too many questions it just leaves you hanging which would be fine if they were planning on making a sequel but we know that is not happening so i have it at 4 stars i took a star off because of the ending,92,0
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,this film has to have one of the most irritating beginning it plays a about two minutes and credits break in well some films do that but this keeps doing that once it finally gets past that you have a nice small film but it tries to tell you it is a smart film no show you it is well acted with ian mcshane as a police inspector with a daughter in school named sara sara plays games with a video store owner highlanders adrian paul but then someonethe stakes of their games the abrupt ending hurt the film but all in all a very enjoyable effort and hey i would watch anything with mcshane in it,118,1
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,5.0,positive,very fun movie to watch loved the riddles love adrian the whole movie is basically a game in which the players try to puzzle out the meaning of life and death i believe the plot was well organized and it kept me very interested this was the first film i have seen staring carly pope and i was impressed with her acting ability I am keeping my copy of this movie,70,2
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,5.0,positive,exceptional movie with great acting directing and storyline i do not know the people who gave it one star but i think they missed the point or was unable to keep up with the story and theorize it has a whole,40,3
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,sara was cute but the movie was dumb,8,4
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,2.0,negative,a good premise ruined by poor acting and a worse ending nothing is answered i sat through the whole thing hence 2 stars i kept waiting for it to take off but it never did sara carly pope is wooden almost beyond belief if you accept what is happening to her goodruined by bad writing and direction,61,5
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,2.0,negative,better than i thought ending a bit disappointing good for a rainy day if your an adrian paul fan,19,6
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,i liked it for the mere fact i love the riddle and clues like a treadure hunt game fascinsting,18,7
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,ok i do not think it does much good to be overly snarky about this the budget was obviously small and who knows what obstacles the filmmakers faced that said the end product is poor if one was looking to say something good atmospheric comes to mind however the script is not as clever as it would like to be and is difficult to follow even assuming one gets the premise and the ending well it is pretty irritating frankly,79,8
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,i enjoyed this movie different psychological / suspenseful kept me thinking also if you like riddles this is one for you not quite twilight zone but ever so close,26,9
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,love this movie so i was vary upset when i got it and it did not work hope i can find a replacement soon,23,10
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,this is sort of like exam or cube if you like that kind of thing the ending could have been better on the whole although pretty good,27,11
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,to begin with without question it is a very bizarre movie not enough background to the plot is provided and the ending left me wondering what i had watched and why i watched it,34,12
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,2.0,negative,i thought the show made an attempt at being very unusual and erudite but definitely failed too many unanswered questions and weird situations that made no sense sorry but it just did not make the mark,35,13
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,4.0,positive,this movie is great and suspenseful and will keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next what makes it even better is that it is a true storybig fan of carly pope and adrien paul they work well together,41,14
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,i watched this movie on television wanted to see it because of ian mcshane adrian paul was an added bonus truly a bonus the thing about this movie that makes me say it could have been better was it left holes perhaps that was intentional and I am just a plodding predictable movie viewer but i did not like how in one scene you see a photograph of the detective his daughter and emily and they are all smiling this for me was a what the fuck moment this was never explained in the movie and the connection of how emily knew what she did about the detectives wifes accident is another weird moment verns adrian paul involvement is creepy but still cool the riddle game was interesting but what did the flashing photos have to add besides shock or creep out value anyway this for me is a once in awhile viewing pleasure watch it once and then hope you forget before you watch it again best part is the beginning when ian mcshane is intergotating emily i did like the way they intermixed things like the opening scene which actually happened later but the ending still leaves you feeling left out of the loop,202,15
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,2.0,negative,just finished watching this movie in itself it is a decent thriller and adrian paul for a change does not play the good guy what is the meaning behind all the unexplained bad events in the world who knows but it is not this i guess we could blame the devil and old fashionedand concept it is as good as reason as any and much better than the mumbo jumbo in this flick worth watching once but if u are going to buy buy it on the cheap not new,88,16
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,5.0,positive,for a first time film maker this movie was quite intelligent the twist and turns kept me guessing and the end caught me by surprise i could not help but try to guess the riddles before those on screen well thought out script and acting if you like riddles or your just a fan of anyone in the cast definitely give this a look,63,17
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,5.0,positive,great movie for people who like riddles and suspense must see adrian paul is just as good as when he did highlander,22,18
Movies_and_TV,B00008WJBO,1.0,negative,oozing in pretentious atmosphere riddled with a nearly unfathomable plot and acted with little intensity or credibility nemesis game is an empty meaningless thriller carly pope first to die plays a young girl whose mother was killed in an auto accident adrian paul phones in a performance as a fellow game player with a repulsive tattoo and brendan fehr sneaks in for a small but pivotal role as a spacy game player despite some of the clever riddles the movie makes little if any sense and the wonderful character actor ian mcshane is wasted in the role of saras father a policeman an interesting premise but i hate movies where everything is so ambiguous you get no payoff if that is the design of life we are in big trouble,128,19
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i plugged this into my computer and pressed record i was in a 12x17 room and no one as more than 9 feet away from me when i played back the audio i could barely hear anyone i have to attach my speakers to my computer and turn every volume way up i have been continually dissapointed with omni-directional microphones,60,0
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,while some people complain about this mic to me if it is connected with mic preamp with enough phantom power it really shines much better than using the battery that comes with it i purchased two of it for stereo recording connected directly via tcc tc-720 stereo microphone / riaa phono pre-amp preamp preamplifier and interconnect the preamp output to the line-in in the pc sound card not to mic-in which provide a very good quality capture from all directions but you will have to record in a quiet room to avoid recording unwanted sounds anyway with these combo you will not be disappointed highly recommended,105,1
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i tried this microphone out and it really was not worth the money it recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones and while that is the point of a uni-directional microphone to dampen out background noise this seemed to be creating some interferance of it is own I am sending mine back,49,2
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i purchasd two of these microphones to record conversations during data gathering meetings using a computer i was using tools such as camtasia and audacity the mics did not pick up enough of the conversation to be useful i tried four different computers with the same result they did not meet our requirements i purchased a more expensive sony ecm-f01 and it works as described great so i am stuck with two mics that do not perform,77,3
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,this mic is surprisingly poor quality for a brand name like audio-technica the sound is distant and thin and basically makes the mic unusable for a speakerphone,27,4
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i managed to get sound into my pc only when the recording settings are set close to maximum even then the mic had to be fairly close to my face to record my voice audibly definitely not what you would expect from an omnidirectional condenser boundary microphone a waste of money,50,5
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i bought this mic with the intention to use it in an interview while it does function pretty well when it is about one inch from your mouth audio quality rapidly degrades any further than that the audio it picked up at 3 feet had to be amplified beyond reason everything maximized to get almost normal speech volume and when i did the audio quality was worse than what you would from a cell phone call admittedly I am using a mac to test this on and they have unpowered mic jacks as opposed to pcs typical powered and unpowered varieties since the mic uses a battery i do not think the lack of a powered jack was the issue but since i do not have a pc to test it on i can not say any more than for mac users to stay away from this product the microphone built into your mac is likely far superior I am returning this product,157,6
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,works as well as expected for 3000 picking up non-directional sounds was delivered in or less than the time specified all is well,23,7
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i have been happy with the atr97 for years it captures voice very well it is compact and unobtrusive the one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it and run the battery down and then there has no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result but overall it is a stylish boundary microphone i also like it because it resembles aor more accurately our domestic military industrial complexs arv alien reproduction vehicle enjoy,104,8
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,it is now sometime I have had this product it works fine as i got it i was able to use it even from the room next to the mike as battery goes down the radius of action decrease accordingly battery life depends on how long you use it and other conditions I have already changed battery ones but i do use this mike quite a bit i would not call it a major drawback it works ok and that is what counts,81,9
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i can not beleive the sound that this captures i use it running to a small digital recorder as a backup for main sound at depostitions i could use this for the main sound it is that good last week i placed it on the floor in the middle of a room about 10x14 it picked up every voice perfectly my main sound had a terrible buzz in it from some electrical source and this was perfectly clear plug it into a zoom h2/4 and you have a really nice sound unit conference rooms podiums at conventions you can depend on it,101,10
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i purchased this product refurbished from beach camera and within 90 days it stopped working on any computer or amplifier that i used it with no sound came in besides a click when i turned the switch on or off and brief electronic noise when i plugged it in or took it out of the computer i would suggest that if you are thinking about buying this product pay at least 25 for a high quality new one,78,11
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,i bought this microphone so i could record conversations in a meeting room it is a great improvement over the built-in mic on my digital voice recorder it does not pick up every voice at the far end of the table but it has been sufficient for my needs i wish it had a light on the top as a power-on indicator I have forgotten to turn it on but that is my only complaint overall i think it is a good value,78,12
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i was doing my videos for national board certification and to my horror found that my students could not be heard audio-technica to the rescue with the included adapter it fit perfectly into the ancient video camera at my school and my problem was solved,45,13
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,just want to tell everyone that previous to this purchase we had problems in recording and broadcasting the conversation of our clubhouse board meetings which composed of 6 to ten people seated around a long a 20 ft conference table the voices recorded were not very clear and picks up hiss and lot of background noices when learning of this product we bought 2 sets and placed them apart on our conference table to our delight the recording became very loud and clear and devoid of hiss and annoying background noices i give it a 5 star to this wonderful mic,100,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampers really allow for several effects from tight to none i really needed more although i wound up with screw dampers mounted to the she shall these were nice and would work for most needs,35,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,i wanted something to subtly dampen my toms and these seem good over-damping is something i was concerned with so i liked that these could be adjusted or removed entirely via velcro I am not sure i notice much difference between the different placements as far as adjusting the damping but removing it only leaves the one tiny sticky dot which pretty much does not damp at all i used a small one on my 12 and snare a large one on my 13 and two large ones on my floor tom,90,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,this evans minemads are good but u have to put a little bit of tape so they dnt dismount from ur tomes or specialy ur snare drum but anyways they are a good product,34,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,they did not make any difference where i used them in a church the drums are still too loud these may be just for recording or a setting where the drums are miced although,33,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,honestly i should have just stuck with moongels on the plus side they can be adjusted some what i use them on the resonant heads,25,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,for the tom-toms it is perfect on snare drums i had to use 2 dampers to get the proper reduction of unwanted harmonics,22,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,excellent product to damper the toms armonics easy to install mount and unmount also the package comes with 6 dampers great for a big drumkit,25,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,moongel wears out mine melted in the van these are subtle and adjustable and durable if you are expecting a dead thud from your drums then these are not for you but if want to adjust the resonance of your heads they work beautifully highly recommended for drummers who tune properly and like controlled resonance,54,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,it is a waste of money it barely changes the tone of the drum i recommend getting some damper pads instead,21,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,i ordered it and found out that the product does not improve the sound dampening at all for heavey heads like remo power-stroke 3 i would not recommend but if you have a thinner head that has alot resonance then may it will work other than that i would not waste my money on the product keo,56,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,works well for the first couple of days then it begins to fall off pros eliminates ringing amd some overtones cons adhesive does not stay on for long,27,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,sticks to side of drums with adhesive poorly designed product with little actual muffle effect it is the first time i have been disappointed by an evans product,27,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,did the job it was designed to do damped my snare and tom toms perfectly,15,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,sorry but the moongel gave me best results,8,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,i noticed a sharper and more precise sound from my snare which I am really liking i have not noticed much of a tone change from larger toms but they probably require more than 1 minemad to sound noticeably different the ends are sticky and hook on to the side of the drum and you can place the other end anywhere on the drumhead the damping will vary by how far or close you set the minemad i believe they are removable but i have not actually tried because I am satisfied with my placements they are definitely worth the low price,99,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,these were straight up bad they did not stick to the drum heads or the rims and all of them had come off after a week of regular playing do not buy,32,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,so far these work real well on cutting down on the ring,12,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,i think these sound better than those gel type dampeners you can get and they are definitely better than those mylar rings people use as well basically they are small efficient and fairly unobtrusive they can tame a troublesome drum with ease,40,17
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,do not waste your time or money these things do not stick to the heads especially if you ever put your drums in cases they come right off they look pretty stupid too i usually do like evans products use their heads but this was a huge miss for them stick with the control rings moon gel or good oletape,59,18
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,got itas described fast shipping worked fine for what i wanted it thanks,18,19
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,as efficient as moon gel and less messy,8,20
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,these are horrible they do not work well at all,9,21
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampers are an original concept so i thought to give them a try i find them far more useful for resonant heads than for batters but one on the batter side of my mcx master snare with evans g2 coated head actually did the job quite well for removing that irritating ping from the snare moongel did nothing unless you want to use three of them on one drum head the adhesive on the velcro dots is not very robust so i find myself having to reattach them too often not sure if it is the choice of heads or what all in all they are as good or better than other damping choices out there but a little strip oftape still does the job best for me,131,22
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,for seven bucks I had say you are better off getting a roll of masking tape with cash left over for a six pack to keep you on the level while tuning your drums the only advantage i see with these is the appearance they certainly look cooler than masking tape or if you like the adjustable nature of this product you can buy a dozen feet of sticky-sided velcro tape and make your own the bottom flat ends of these doohickeys have a small 3 - 4 mm area of sticky stuff that does not adhere very long to the side of your drums so most of mine are currently on the floor under my kit unlike the picture they come in a variety pack and the smaller ones are so small that they barely reach my drum heads once the sticky end is adhered to the side of the drum i have a gretsch energy kit maybe your rings are shorter than mine but overall I had suggest another method,169,23
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,these dampers came in 2 days when 6 were expected and they did not disappoint exactly what i needed to make my drums sound much better for a very low price,31,24
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,i thought i should have returned these as soon as i saw them sort of a sillymight yet,20,25
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,from the humble opinion of a drum dept manager the evans dampners are the ones i recommend the most from the 4 choices we offer yes tape and gels may work and may be less money but tend to be and look messy especially tape which give you no real option once they are in place and really leave a mess or damage heads when you need to remove it each dampner give you 3 options just enough extra dry or none at all depending on your sound the dots do stick and stay they certainly do a great job getting rid of over ring and more and yes they do look great find exactly where you want them then 1and very important make sure to use the alcohol pad included or get more to insure clean surfaces read the instructions or watch a video or two on ytube do it right and you will not have the problems the folks with 3 stars or below have then if you still want a roll of musicians tapeyou can usually find a roll in the pro-audio dept or the dollar store,190,26
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,velcro loose every time i go back to the drums miss the point,13,27
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampeners are very good quality and very easy to install and take on and off they were great for the price and exactly what i wanted however they did not effect the sound as much as i hoped they removed a lot of the overtones however there were still a few ringing sounds left but when i added a second dampener on the drum it improved the sounds to more of what i wanted,75,28
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,the stickers do not hold up after a few weeks of playing going to be switching to a different product worked fine when they did stick to the surface of the drums,33,29
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,they deaden way too much and can not control too finicky to use i found that strips of black gorilla tape work excellent and easy to control amount of ring you want,31,30
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,i teach a couple of theory and ear training classes at a university and this tool was exactly what i needed it works great is easy to use and saves a lot of time that i was wasting while trying and failing miserably to draw straight staff lines on the board freehand the price was extremely reasonable I am really glad i bought it,63,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 1st grade daughter for her bedroom chalk board and she loves it it is great,20,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in this the chalkholders are loose and they often twist the chalk falls out i will toss this and pick one up at the nearest walk-in store that sells them,33,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,works as expected wires can twist slightly I am not a music pro but imagine they make some that do not do that so that is why 4 instead of 5 stars i feel i got what i paid for,37,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,using it to make straight lines on the chalk board works well,12,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,it works just fine with the chalk here in japan the tines twist a bit but it works just fine,20,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,very cheaply made the kids bent two chalk holders after one pass i tried it and same thing spend more and get one you can use,27,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i guess i got so excited over ordering this for the kids chalkboard that i did not read the reviews what a piece of junk not even worth the 299 it is flimsy does not even hold the chalk steadily do not waste your 299,41,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,a little flimsy but for the price it does the job very helpful tool for my students who struggle with fine motor control i use it on the board to give them lines to write on,36,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,i like being able to draw straight staff lines on the chalkboard for students to write their notes this does the job nicely,22,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,my 6 year old is addicted to teacher supplies and i bought her one of these for her christmas stocking the wires are super bendy and do not hold the chalk very well i think she just has it there for show at this point would not buy again,49,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i deliberately ordered this one with the dark heavier looking prongs because i did not want a junk staff liner it came today it is junk it has the copper looking very thin prongs the handle is also very thin not quite 1/4 and a cheap plain piece of wood as soon as i loaded the chalk in the prongs some held tight and a couple did not i notice the prongs twisting i can not imagine they will last very long with such thin wire since i could not give it a negative number of stars I shall just say 5 so i guess i paid to buy an example that the hubs can use to make one very disappointed indeed,116,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,great concept but the metal pieces do not stay in place and continue to twist which ruins the staff lines,19,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,i intended to used this tool for swiping acrylic paint the metal pieces are not facing the same way good for chalk but not for my needs i will see if i can adjust them,34,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,there has not a lot to it but as a music teacher i use it class everyday it works,18,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,i bought this to lay down guide lines for chalk signs you will probably want to reinforce the handle withtape or something as soon as you get it it split beneath two of the tines as i was just trying to get chalk into it the tines also tend to twist around on themselves so i wrapped the chalk and tines with tape as well to kind of hold them in an un-twisted position sadly i could only find one other listing for this on amazon and it looks like the same product so whatever,96,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,perfect for what we needed in our arabic language class,10,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,while it did not clean deeply it still did clean the cymbal gime it makes my cymbals all shiney and awesome haha,21,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,the cleaner performed well considering it is not as toxic as some of the other spray cleaners out there a good choice to use to keep the dust and fingerprints down after your gig,34,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,better off with the blitz cymbal cleaner for way less works way better and easier than sabian or vater cymbal cleaner,22,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,my cymbals were definitely brighter after using this and finger smudges were taken off for a day i had to use more than one application and rub hard for any serious cleaning it is not good for trying to reverse any aging of cymbals or serious deep cleaning you really should think of it only as a surface cleaner or as a brightener possibly with a brush of some sort it might work better in the grooves but generous application of the product and rubbing with a soft rag did not seem to achieve penetration of the cleaning process into those grooves that is probably reasonable and to be expected anything that cleaned very aggressively may be on the border of being a threat to the cymbal surface the stuff has a noxious smell i cleaned my cymbals outdoors and even then the wind shifted and i feared for the effect on my eyes i have three cymbals ride crash and top high hat and when used generously one bottle was good for two separate cleanings of the full set,178,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,this is an ok product you just want to make sure you dry nicely after spray or else you it will be yellow,22,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,worked just like the bottle says takes more than one application on duller finishes for 20 bucks sabian will re finish a sabian cymbal and relabel assuming there is no damage however the shipping time will mean no cymbal for a few weeks,43,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,this is an awesome cymbal cleaner it does not get the stick marks off at all but it does an amazing job at the grime oil and dirt just rub off the stick marks then use this you spray enough of this on the cymbal to cover it wait 15 - 30 seconds do not let it dry on the cymbal and then wipe it off with a soft cloth great product highly recommend,70,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,do not buy this whatever you do plastic spray bottles were shipped in a loose small thin bubblewrap envelope both spray heads were busted off with a large quantity of the contents pooled in the plastic envelope i currently have three unopened bottles bought previously direct from sabian the cleaner should have a raspy acidic smell that borders on toxic smelling I am not sure what the liquid is that they shipped but it is not sabian cymbal cleaner more like watered down dishwashing liquid nice try and an obvious scam buyer beware,90,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,works on sabian brilliant cymbals but is does not work at all on other brands,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,purchased to keep my new sabian aax brilliant finish cymbals basically keep looking brilliant the product is easy to useabd very effective in cutting through fingerprint oxidation and restoring the originaland luster it is an acid based product so be careful when applying to the logos if you want to preserve them i cover them with blue painters tape and then remove after i have cleaned the entire cymbal the fumes are very strong and being an acid will make you cough if inhaled i found that diluting the product 31 part water was very effective and a little less noxious I have used this to clean both brilliant and traditional finishes on various cymbal brands and it does a great job each time,124,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,good stuff while it will not remove multiple layers of tarnish from an old cymbal this will refresh a well maintained cymbals that has some buildup of fingerprints and marks,29,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,did not work very good could not see any difference,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,this stuff worked great but tape up your logos and be careful of you can wipe it off pretty quick even if you follow the 15 - 30 second instructions,28,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,save your money thisis near worthless it removed practically none of the tarnish from my cymbals just use lime juice and baking soda this will work wonders simple inexpensive and all natural,34,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,my son has a drums and required clean his cymbals i use it but did not think properly because they were 100 clean and shiny now i will try again but using the product with a polishing machine but i think the product is good,45,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,i ended up using brasso on all my cymbals because these cymbal cleaners are a joke I have tried most of them when you use brasso make sure you do not wipe off the logos although,34,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,stick marks show up in a yellowishafter using it and you have to clean your cymbals often get music nomad cymbal cleaner they stay clean for a long time and it contains no acid that destroys your cymbals over time i am just a fellow drummer and i am not endorsed by music nomad i just love it,60,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,i used it once to clean my 16 aax xplosion crash altho it does remove oil finger prints and grease it eats away the gold shiny finish look also removes black lettering if not careful,37,17
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,i did a lot of research and reading of many different reviews before i purchased this cleaner just as advertised it cleaned up all of the dinge and oxidation and did not remove the cymbal logos i highly recommend this product i cleaned five cymbals front and back and still have quite a bit of the cleaner left your cymbals will not look brand spankin new but they will have a good clean look,72,18
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,let it sit on the cymbal for about 30 seconds then wipe it off wal-la clean cymbal great product thanks,20,19
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,i thought i was getting an spray like advertised but got a wipe on cream instead i should have read some of the other reports that people left same thing happened to some of them,35,20
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,what i wanted was cymbal cleaner spray like the picture but what i got was a tube of polish paste,19,21
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,this stuff is like a creme that drys like a paste wax and then needs buffed off problem is it did not do anything no pay off for my labor sabian b8x and one b8 pro,35,22
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,this cleaner is junk it is more of a cymbal polish than a cleaner it does shine a lot better but without removing the grime smudges I have been drumming for 15 years and cleaned a lot of cymbals I am going back to the zildjian cymbal polish you want to clean and polish your cymbals not one or the other,58,23
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,what i received was not thepictured i received a cream cleaner not spray on and wipe off it does clean brilliant finish cymbals fairly puts a good shine on them but does not clean them very deep,38,24
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,good product for the in-between quick cleans problem is that if you order from amazon and etailz is involved you may not get what you really wanted recently i purchased this product only to receive the safe and sound sabian cymbal cleaner instead since no explanation was given for the switch i can only assume they were out of the pump spray light cleaner / polish and substituted this anyone in the business should know there is a huge difference between these two products and it is not a suitable substitution will purchase this elsewhere in the future,96,25
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,1 star because i did not receive what i ordered i ordered 2 bottles of the sabian liquid spray cymbal cleaner as was pictured on amazon etailz shipped 2 bottles of the sabian safe and sound cymbal cleaner a paste that will remove the logo from your cymbal i will be returning these etailz also failed to include an invoice in the package something that is certainly second-rate i would give the sabian spray cleaner a 4-star review based on my usage but that is not what i got,88,26
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,i own a backline business and keeping shiny cymbals is a bane of my existence mostly everyone puts fingerprints on everything without a care and sabian brilliant cymbals turn orange with a humid breeze notice this is cleaner and not polish if i pulled out the brasso every time i needed a set of cymbals to be stage worthy i would spend my entire life polishing cymbals i hit them with this stuff for 30 sec a side and wipe they look great gets rid of most of the gunk and discoloration and the logos are all still intact i do this about 6 times between real polishing and as a result i can spend time with my kids this will not get those fingerprints you left corroding for a few months but if you are on top of maintaining your brass this is a huge time saver I have used a couple bottles and will continue to do so,158,27
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,i thought when i saw this together i would receive two but i received one and we love it great price and excellent quality,24,0
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,2.0,negative,this tambourine tore through the fabric the first time we used it i do not think we put this much pressure on it so if you are planning on using the fabric part invest in a more quality product this might be good for little kids,46,1
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,you will never again say there is nothing to do as long as this is within reach you will always have a dependable friend sturdy and light and inexpensive wonderful way to introduce someone to music after time you will start to notice sound differently especially great for children who are very active if you have the passion and energy go for it i learned to play and i knew nothing about how have a good day,78,2
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,i thought there would be a pair medium and small instead it was only one,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,really nice rhythm instruments but do not have quite the sound of my moms kindergarten ones from the 1950s,18,4
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,these work well for a kids dance but you can not pound them a lot because they tend to break overall I am satisfied for what i paid,26,5
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,either i did not read all the information and also do a measurement before orderingis too small and is now taking up space,24,6
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,since i was planning on using these infrequently in plays and skits and never leaving them permanently in the hands of children i was less concerned with durability than with cost these are not likely to survive three days in the unsupervised hands of kids but as functioning tambourines they are great props for use in a 15 to an hour play if you are new to tambourines i suggest you buy a wooden mallet to use with this kind if as i was planning you were thinking of getting the drum effect by striking the head with the hand and not getting much sound from the jingles you will be disappointed striking the head with the finger will always give you jingle as well i bought soft mallets to use with them and that did not work because they had the feel of a finger only when i bought hard wooden strikers did i get a relatively pure sound from the head with little jingle the other side of the coin is that with your hard mallet you can get two distinctly different sounds from the one device,188,7
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this was an impulse buy and i do wish i had done some more research the zils the metal pieces that clang block out the thump of hitting the drum head so i wish i had bought a tambourine with just a single row I am not sure what the tambourine head is made out of but it is pulled tight and seems durable it does say it is an economy tambourine which is accurate it is a good size for adult and youth hands for the price it is a fun instrument,92,8
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,this product did not meet my expectations and i will not order this again and will not recommend to others to purchase,22,9

Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this is a good buy for the money it has a leather skin head and seems to be of sturdy construction,21,13
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,thiswas used in a dance processional i added some ribbon around the 6 openings to give it a miriam affect i plan to use thisagain it is of very good quality and just the right size for an adult hand 2 thumbs up,47,14
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,when i opened the package a few days after i ordered it i was excited until i saw the broken area near the disks that my husband had to repair i would have sent it back but i needed it for a dance at my church so i am not happy with thisbut because we have done a repair to it and had to alter the original in order to make it work i was unable to send it back and had to pay full price for theso not happy at all,93,15
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this is a great instrument for the price we bought it for our family instrument collection and for our young children to use much better quality than any of the toy instrument companies and comparable pricing definitely recommend,38,16
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,2.0,negative,the drum skin ripped the first time we used it laughing out loud,11,17
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,just what i thought they would be it sounds good,10,18
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,did no play it but once and the center broke,10,19
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,these powered monitors are a great solution for providing accurate sound reproduction for performers in many difficult situations they are small enough to be mounted where you need them up close or at a reasonable distance consider their size they can be daisy chained for like feeds they have built in eq they have speaker outputs that are powerful enough to power larger speakers if you need more bass they have headphone outputs if you can not get them close enough they are mic and line level compatible stand mountable with the adapter they are not designed to shake the house so if you do not abuse them and they will work great for a long time,114,0
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,compact and easy to take to gigs i used it as a drummer and it was great this has all you would want in a powered monitor,26,1
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,puts vocals right there for better clarity the only issue i have is that it is not as loud as i thought it would be it is loud enough although it would be nice if it came with the stand adaptor even so i knew that going in the main difference between this and the beringer model is this has a headphone jack otherwise they are similar,66,2
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,i liked mine until the bass blew out i never even turned it up over 1/4 volume lasted about 7 months at that volume,24,3
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,have only use it 5 or 6 times but does a fine job so fall,15,4
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,i received it today the first thing i did was plug 3 different vocal mics into it and check the sound of the monitor just having the volume 35 of the way up and speaking into the mic the low frequencies of the vocal make the speaker buzz or vibrate in the casing of the monitor all 3 mics did that and the eqs were all straight up at the 12 o clock setting which is probably 0 db this monitor basically does what most hot spot style monitors do they can not handle any kind of volume and sound like am radio i even tried turning down the low eq to almost 10 and it did the same thing just not as bad i might try using this with a friends band who is performing this weekend in a small club but honestly as a pro level touring sound engineer and as a musician myself i can tell you that i do not want to put a buzzy speaker that can not be turned up loud in front of any musician i will probably be returning thisin a few days,189,5
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,so far so good i really did not expect it to be as good as it actually is i bought it for a few purposes one of which was to be a personal monitor for our drummer i sat it on a mic stand beside him and turned the volume knob halfway up and he liked what he heard mission accomplished this saved us a lot in the way of needed equipment because we did not have a powered monitor for him and had to use an fairly heavy monitor amp and passive speaker plus a stand for the speaker it lightened oursome and any working band knows what a plus that is as long as you do not expect it to sound like a 15 speaker with 200 watts pushing it because that would just be silly laughing out loud you will like it our drummer can hear the mix just fine with this and we played a little on the loud side that night one gig down with this baby and hopefully many many more to come,175,6
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,not he best monitor we have but for the price itl do for now,14,7
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,1.0,negative,horrible the thing explode literally in the inside at 30 minutes of usage without clipping fireflames and smoke came up from the front panel never buying nadys products again is so cheap,32,8
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,not a full range hi fidelity speaker however it is very well suited for it is purpose on-stage personal monitor we use this daisy chained to a pm-100 for our drummer and keyboard player both of whom sing in a classic rock band it has a pronounced mid-range but that tends to deliver more volume for vocals without feedback no problems bottom line not high-end gear but effective and good bang for the buck,73,9
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,enjoying it allot great for the price use it all the time and have bought 2 more only bad thing adjustment are on back,24,10
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,great monitor with a lot of flexibility can be used as stand alone or to drive passive wedges only downside is the input jacks are connected directly to input board and can be fragile still a great product for the price just handle with care,45,11
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,so much better than the one i replaced with it better sound more flexibility very impressive,16,12
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,worked for exactly 3 karaoke gigs and then nothing second one showed up today so we shall see but not impressed at all yet,24,13
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i bought this to use as a handbag with my 1920s gangster outfit for a company party it was perfect yes it is plastic yes it does not tolerate rough handling hey what do you expect for this price i read the product information so i knew what size it was before i ordered it i popped my cell phone drivers license and some cash in there and carried it around all evening it made my costume it was too cute for words and everyone who saw it loved it i can not wait to have another excuse to use it,98,0
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i bought this violin to be used as a container to put a floral design in it i entered a floral competition and came in 3rd i was thrilled the thme was the godfather it looked fanastic decorated with red roses and red carnations,44,1
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,piece of junk the worthless clasp broke the first time we opened it and tried to shut it again plastic toy overpriced too expensive to try and ship back i am just going to give it away as a gift to our music teacher propped open and filled with candy or something nothing i would really keep for my kids,60,2
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,i thought it would be a full size plastic violin case to fit a toy tommy gun it is about 1/4 the size of an actual case,26,3
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,this was just a super cute accessory but the cost to ship it seemed disproportionate to it is size and weight granted i got it shipped to australia but i also go other items that cost far lest,37,4
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,this case is made of very cheap plastic and broke within one hour after we received it unfortunately i did not have enough time to return it for a replacement so that is just money down the drain i will not order from this company in the future however,46,5
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,a bit small although i should have read the description before hastily ordering this for a halloween custume it is sturdy although and the latches do not stick my teenager is using it as an art supply case it is probably half the size of a normal violin case,46,6
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,very cute perfect size for my 6 year old nephews costume hard to open although,15,7
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,it was a lot smaller than i expected but it worked out fine dimensions on the listing would be a big help,22,8
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,this is very small take the time to look at the dimensions,12,9
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,not what i expected i was looking for a regular size violin case and this is not what i wasbelieve it was,24,10
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the size i knew it would be a cheap facsimile of a violin case but it was much smaller than the size i expected seller shipped it quickly,32,11
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,so small it could be used as a pencil case would work only as a babys costume prop,18,12
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,i thought it would have handbag straps but the thick handle to carry like a purse over 25 makes adding one impossible and i need my hands free to film so if you like carrying it as a purse all night it is perfect for you also it is smaller than expected will not hold all i need it too so it will be a challenge to use this with all I had hoped to carry in it instead of small camera bag that is smaller but holds all i need to bring just not at all gangster violin case is about 4 - 5 in main with about 3 4 of unusable space in long skinny part should have got tommy gun shoulder bag instead,121,13
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,hit of the party this made my husband 20s gangster outfit it is small although but it did not matter,20,14
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i was warned it was a small inexpensive toy so i open it very carefully looked perfect for my prohibition party,21,15
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,used this for my 2 year old sons out fit works fine would be too small for an adult to use as a prop,24,16
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,2.0,negative,the case is way smaller than expected i should of read the reviews before i purchased there was no size description that i could find so here are my measurements apporximately 14 1/2 long 5 3/4 at the widest part and 2 1/2 deep hope this helps someone else when looking at this product,54,17
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,u need to put more info about it i thought it was for a full size violin not a toy,20,18
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,even at the most generous measurement this is only 14 1/2 inches long however i read the reviews and question answers and was prepared for this fine for what i bought it for a prop for roaring 20s photo op w / costumes nothing too fancy just fun if you are looking for realism this is not it however it arrived on time undamaged and is fairly sturdy,65,19
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,it was not what we expected we were looking for a real violin case,14,20
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i use 2 of these very thin nanokeys one for the right hand one for the left had and have them plugged into a laptop with pianoteq installed set them at different octives and it works very well touch sensitive keys in such a compact form awesome 5 well earned small,51,0
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,the korg nanokey is great for the traveling musician when was the last time that you wrote and recorded music on a flight or in a car and did it comfortably even if you have it probably was not this easy to get set up it may not be the sturdiest feeling keyboard in the world but for the price it is awesome the software is not too bad either once you find it it would be nice if it just shipped with the software or a link that actually sends you to the software but it took only 5 minutes to find it online and i was up and running it works great on windows 7 I am very satisfied and am considering getting the other two controllers nanopad and nanokontrol soon,129,1
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,running in her blood is the pure soul of rock and roll she is amazing,15,2
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,like probably most computer composers I have lived with the tradeoffs of trying to have a computer keyboard and a midi keyboard handy when basically they are designed to be in the exact same position relative to my hands while i will not be writing masterpieces with this little guy the size puts it right where i want it for putting in a few notes or chords while keeping my desktop organized for regular non-musical work just having it there is like finally getting to scratch an itch I have had for years the build quality is very good for what it is a tiny handy two octave musical data entry tool also it looks very cool,112,3
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,great little keyboard excellent for traveling however when i received it one of the keys did not work so i had to get a replacement the keys do feel a bit on the cheaper side of things a little bit wobbly plastic springy-feel but it works fine the velocity is fine too works much better than using your keyboard pad if you are a logic user which does not have velocity sensitivity,69,4
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i bought this keyboard specifically to learn to play piano / get used to note locations while it is perfect for it is intended use i was slightly disappointed in the mechanism of the keys they do not press down quite as easily as i had hoped you do not necessarily haveto put a whole lot of force into pushing them but you do need to be thorough when doing it and there is not a whole lot of feedback for when the connection is made however with some getting used to it would be no issue at all,93,5
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i loved this keyboard like some i had a few problems to record with it i had to use 2 computers and do an analog feed no big deal i live jerry rigging then i was able to download thousands of korg instrument sounds wow i used this for almost 2 years and the usb connection broke very poorly made i used the device a lot but have never had this kind of a musical device failure be careful with this device it is fragile,85,6
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i was delighted with this keyboard for the price it definitely has some serious shortcomings the keys feel like keyboard keys and the lack of contour makes it much harder to locate your hand on the keyboard without looking think of it as a small portable velocity-sensitive computer keyboard take it with you on your next stay in a hotel room and be happy that you have something to mess around on,72,7
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,this is a great product easily connects to any computer and easily fits in a laptop case / backpack for easy travel this product is very easy to use and did not take very long before i had it running like a dream with both apple garageband and apple logic express the only problem with this keyboard is that it is sometimes hard to press the keys when you are trying to do soft strokes also the velocity is sometimes hard to keep consistent depending upon where on the key you are striking,91,8
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,pros it is the most portable and the least expensive usb midi keyboard out there cons it is very difficult to use for recording music the keys are built like a laptop keyboard it is difficult for entering chords playing melodies the keys do not provide the proper feel when playing they squish when you press them it is hard to explain it is ok for entering in melodies one note at a time i can see how this could be very useful for the traveling composer because it is extremely thin but that portability comes at a price usability i should have bought the akai lpk25 instead normally i love korg products they make some of the most amazing innovative stuff like the kaos series it is just that this product does not provide the tactile feedback of a real keyboard and it is too difficult to enter chords for me verdict this keyboard is extremely portable so it is a good 2nd keyboard for the traveling composer but i would not recommend using it as a primary keyboard in a home studio as it only provides very limited utility,183,9
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,the nano series is perfect for the musician / producer who wants to have beneficial aspects of being in a studio all in portable devices the nanokey is very good ultraslim and works with almost all programs i do recommend,38,10
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,the korg nano key is an answer to my prayers as a guitar player with no piano experience whatsoever i was stymied when first learning to use a daw digital audio workstation i knew nothing of midi or the dozen or so vsti plugins that came with the daw i knew i needed a keyboard but did not want to sink a lot of money into one enter the nano key it does everything i need for entering midi data into the daw it is velocity sensitive meaning the harder you hit the key the louder the note sounds I am sure some will say it is light weight or a cheap piece of plastic but i do not intend to do much pounding on the keys after all I am not little richard or jerry lee louis laughing out loud hey for 35 bux I am completely satisfied,139,11
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,great basic midi controller for the price and intended purpose it is fantastic dead easy to set up and intuitive only drawbacks are expected ones because it is such an entry level device the keys have no pivot point and feel like computer keys rather than piano keys the keyboard itself is scaled down significantly so playing chords can get quite squashed also the pitch bend tool is a button not a wheel so you have no control over the speed of the bend or the inflection amount for a basic cheap midi controller it is fantastic and does the job very well i use it primarily for input into finale 2010 via the speedy entry tool and it works perfectly takes up very little real estate on my desk which is a bonus,133,12
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,this midi keyboard controller is nice and compact it fits in a side pocket of my computer bag it has the range of an entire piano when you use the octave up / down keys so there is no problem entering notes in any octave i use it toenter music into finale and it works great the only drawback is that the keys are kind of cheap and do not have a positive feel to them when you push them down like a computer or midi keyboard other than that the korg nanokey is a great addition to my computer bag,99,13
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i just received the korg nano key it is stylish small / thin which i wanted and fairly functional but the keys feel like stiff laptop keys i was expecting something a little easier to play i do not really need the unit for anything fancy but i do not think it work even for what i need,54,14
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,hardware never played the keyboard before and purchased this one to create simple chord progressions one octave only very limited space between keys and very bad sensitivity unables you to make nuances or to make accents decently very good to on the go music because of it is size but not rugged enough keys started to fall apart around two months after purchase software very good software included and easy to install too tested it in cubase 345 reaper and various vsts the key mapping is almost perfect in every case overall i consider the product more like in the toy side than for professional use,106,15
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,I have gone through three of these in the last two years i guess i do not learn too easily the first one broke because the usb connection cracked i opened it up to see if it could be repaired and realized the only thing that had been holding the connector to the circuit board was a tiny blob of solder the second one lost several of it is keys because i had it in a padded laptop bag the slightest amount of pressure will because the keys to fly off like springs and they are designed in such a way that they can never be put back on correctly I am now on my third nanokey a few keys have popped off this one as well I have glued them back on with silicon but this affects the action but even in new condition the key action on this device is no more playable than a computer keypad how such a product ever got past the r d stage is incredible for a while this was the only mini-controller on the market but now that the akai lpk25 is available I shall be picking up one of those as soon as i can find a place that has them in stock,204,16
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,small light and compact the nano key is perfect for the in home studio setup,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i got this because it is so compact and easy to toss into my briefcase you will have to get use to the small amount of key stroke compared to any real keyboard for single note entry it is fine however if you want to enter a three-note chord with any black notes forget it you know how when you depress the edges of black keys that you slide in depressing the far inside part of the white key well there is no far inside part of the white key it does not exist which makes chord entry very slow four-note chord with any black keys forget it spend the extra 10 and get some real keys,113,18
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i got one of these things when it was new and loved it it was usable rather inexpensive and tiny however it recently broke i had it in a cabinet and i slid a magazine on top of it one of the pages caught a couple of keys and tore them off wow this thing is fragile it is ok if you take care of it but useless when you have to throw it away akai came out with the lpk25 which is the same concept but looks more like a real keyboard it is about the same width and depth as the nanokey but is over twice as thick which may or may not be a factor for you the lpk25 adds an arpeggiator but drops the pitch-bend buttons the nanokey also comes with a license for the basic m1 software synth also usable as athat the akai does not come with and the akai is about 20 more,162,19
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,the keyboard is compact and works very well fr such a small package it has many features and I am satisfied witht this purchase i would recomend it to everyone,28,20
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,the keys were much like a laptop keyboard which had little depth and made a loud click when you used them which irked me,25,21
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,although the laptop-style keys are a far cry from a real piano this lightweight modular keyboard lives up to all it is promises with a little practice any issues i had with velocity sensitivity or missed notes disappeared if you are looking for an ultra-portable easy to use midi keyboard that costs about half what i would have payed for something this useful look no further,64,22
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,super cheap super small does the job I am not a keyboardist and do not use it to perform i use it paired with finale and my macbook for putting together sheet music does the job simply and well and fits in my little laptop bag uses just one cable no power cord or batteries required it was exactly what i need,60,23
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i thought it would make writing music easier however it was just more of a pain first it took me three days to set it up it did not come with directions and offered no technical support second once i finally got it working it was very glitchy and did not work well with the music software i have finale 2010 it was delayed and did not read notes well it is a low price because it is pretty much useless i will likely never use this product do not waste your money,89,24
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i got this for when i am working away from home i use finale and sibelius and need something for note input mainly chorded input the size of it is very small not even as thick as your average magazine for that reason i would pack it carefully do not put it in a soft pack because it appears that it would not hold up well under normal travel impacts luggage handling and more my last portable midi controller was a novation this one is literally an eighth of the size of that one it works as advertised i am happy,99,25
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,was hoping to have a decent midi controller to take on the road product arrived with several keys not working right out of the box was not expecting much for the price but especially considering brand name this is disappointing not recommended,41,26
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i was looking for an inexpensive midi controller to connect to a pc for my 5 year old to play around with he has already playing with my old dx-7 and does well at drums he has making his own songs using an iphone based application i have so i wanted to see if i could get him going with an inexpensive basic multitrack midi based studio i read all the reviews about this against the akai and decided he does not need anything fancy or expensive he may only like this for a week or not at all and i did not want to spend a lot of money this is essentially a computer keyboard with large buttons i plugged it into my pc and loaded up mixcraft 5 it worked fine but the velocity sensitivity is so bad i really had to apply a good amount of force to get reasonable volume out of this there was no real control over the sensitivity and given my frustration over it there is no way my 5yo would have done well with this at all it is already boxed up and ready to go back tomorrow,191,27
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i was looking for something similar about 15 years ago there was no such thing so i waited after i bought it i was reading the reviews and getting buyers remorse because of what buyers were saying about the keys falling off and it being cheap cheap was why i bought it having 4 kids and all i bought this nano key to use with reason 4 the only downside is latency now i have to wait until next tax season to get a sound card the keyboard is well worth the price,93,28
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,if this thing was 10 dollars i would say yeah go for it maybe it would be nice for your laptop when you are on a road trip or something assuming you do not have a mac and are not using logic or garage band which have keyboard pianos built in unfortunately it is not 10 dollars it is 60 dollars the thing seriously feels like a toy and not a well made toy it feels like the kind of toy you buy at the dollar store it is plastic keys make snapping sounds when you press them down which make you think it is going to break at any moment not only that but sometimes the keys just do not work are they seriously asking for 60 dollars when it clearly costs under a dollar to make korg you have gone downhill since the 80s get your act together i owned a korg m3 for a while which is the top of the line music workstation it did not impress me either a week after i bought it a few of the drum pads stopped working and i returned it bottom line is do not bother with this nano it is not worth your time,196,29
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,un producto excelente con un gran desempeo facil de utilizar ideal para presentaciones en vivo y no estar llevando muchas cosas,21,30
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,keys are far too small to play anything it is too soft really different from regular keys you have to hit them hard to get a sound strong enough used with cakewalk other full size quality keyboards work well the keyboard is built well and the quality overall is good the problem is really it is low sensitivity,56,31
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i know this is not suppose to replace a full size midi keyboard however it feels cheap one of the buttons i had seemed like you had to hit harder to get a sound i looked into having korg replace it the cost of shipping and waiting for the exchange would have been way more than the cost of buying one,60,32
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i bought this for my husband he has a pretty smart guy but is currently having problems setting it up on his computer,21,33
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,and the key response is poor check out reviews on this versus the akai lpk25 before you make a decision,20,34
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i bought the korg nanokey with much excitement from the very good reviews but my experience with the product is similar to the person who wrote the bad review right out of the box one of the keys was not working a few days after i discovered it was unhinged and it eventually fell off the rest of the keys are ok plus the key sensitivity is good as advertised however the keys are just not sturdy and secure that minimal transit can because them to fall off,89,35
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i was looking for a simple keyboard to play around with apples garageband and that is what i got with this korg it is very good and i like that the keys are velocity sensitve but the keys are a tad small and while you can use this for learning to play or to goof around in garageband i would not want to try and play anything more than a melody with it i suppose if you are good at using the octave up and octave down keys you could do something more complex overall i like the keyboard the downloadable software m1 is wayyyy more complex than i need with the ability to change all kinds of parameters might be good for someone that knows more about midi than i do,129,36
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,nicely done thank you appreciate the fast service,8,37
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i eventually got rid of this on craigslist because several of the keys kept popping off when playing with just a little force i recommend the newer version from korg,30,38
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,it works but be careful very fragile our cat knocked it of a table onto the carpet the three foot fall caused a good portion of the keys to pop off the board rendering it useless i was not too freaked out over the loss of this as i rarely used it in the first place i thought it would be nice for doodling ideas with when i was away from home but it is felt very unnatural to play and reminded me more of the toy keyboards i buy for our six year old not very practical the slider and the percussion versions may have met my needs more most daws have a setting for using your typing keyboard as an interface comparing that to the nanokey 25 i would save your money instead and use what you have you probably will not notice the difference either,145,39
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i mainly use to trigger my drums in my daw a little too small to use as an actual keyboard but i did not need it for that works well as a simple controller and it does what it says,39,40
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,my son was studying music education in college and needed something to compose and arrange music that he could use with his computer we purchased this and it has met te intended purpose with perfection,35,41
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,nice little keyboard it is very easy to transport if you travel a lot and it gets the job done,20,42
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,worked perfectly great product for production on the go i travel a lot and when i want to make a beat while in a hotel room i can easily pull this out of my laptop bag and have at it,40,43
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,love it amazon is the best shockmount looks so cool with my blue mic yeti if you want pictures just ask and i will put them up i have the samson stand i bought that from best buy a primacoustic voxguard reflection fliter from guitar center the blue mic yeti professional usb mic a sterling audio pop filter temporarily and of course thee blue microphones blue radius shockmount i love my set up now I am ready for my music to come out have fun words can not describe how happy i am so just read the other guys review laughing out loud,99,0
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the microphone mounting screw is the wrong size how they screwed up something this basic is beyond me this mount had one job fit the blue yeti microphone it does not fit the blue yeti microphone,35,1
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,if you know nothing about sound quality when you are just starting out your podcasting radio shows youtube channel or any form of media where you are using a professional microphone remember you only need to know one thing shock mount this product is for the blue microphones line of products and will instantly improve the quality of your production and sound if you are searching for microphones right now and see this product linked with blue yeti microphones do not even second guess it purchase thisi use this product along with my blue yeti for my podcasting live streaming and youtube business i know this product will never fail me nor will this review and recommendation fail you,120,2
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,agreeing with all the other reviews here very poor design and it can not even support the weight of the mic it is made for,24,3
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,I have had and used this shock mount for months so am finally leaving a review pros it is designed for the blue yeti and does hold the blue yeti and does what a shock mount is meant to do the holes around theof the mount are convenient to permanently attach a pop filter through with a nut and bolt cons as many complain about the knob to tighten the shock mount is absolutely worthless when i first set it up it would not hold the yeti straight once tightened it just flops down i then tried to tighten it and the hand knob snapped off completely most people would have just returned the product at this point but i really wanted to get it setup with the yeti so i drilled out the broken piece and took the mount to the hardware store after getting the right size bolt and some washers and o-rings the mount is 1000 better at staying up thanks ace hardware for the shock mount viagra,173,4
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the screw broke almost immediately i got a screw of the same size but recently it failed also stripping the hole it seams as although the blue microphones yeti usb microphone silver is too heavy for the radius which it was designed for,45,5
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,loved this shock mount loved being the key worked perfectly with my rode psa1 swivel mount studio microphone boom and blue microphones yeti pro usb condenser microphone but after using for less than a year the thumb screw where you tighten to support the microphone snapped it is now unusable i do voice over work and use this combo daily as of right now i would not recommend this product as it will not hold up over time,78,6
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,ever notice a hum when listing to someone on a video or audio it is the vibration of their mic get one of these and leave the humming to the birds,30,7
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,just got it today and i originally ordered the radius shock mount and they gave me the improved radius ii shock mount i was worried that thiswould not suit me well because of all the bad reviews here i am very pleased with my purchase and happy it came early i used prime shipping for this and to just let everyone know that everything is made of metal and not plastic as previously described by others,78,8
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,fyi they are selling radius ii units from this listing now or at least that is what happened to me the radius ii listing was out of stock so i bought this instead but the radius ii is still what showed up overall i am pleased the only major con is the price i do not know that it is really worth 65 not sure what all the one star reviews are about the threading and such has all worked well for me has worked flawlessly with my yeti and rode psa1 boom arm the combination totally isolates the mic in cardioid pattern while recording with my kef x300a loudspeakers on either side of it typing away on my mechanical keyboard there is no background noise unless the speakers are blasting music and then the amount is negligible,136,9
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the only gripe i have is that the hinge does not hold the mic up very well over time i found that people took the plastic washers spacers from the mics original stand and that made a difference it definitely helps but every so often it will still droop other than that it is a nice little piece the seller was quick to ship as well,65,10
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the screw does not hold the product very well i was always afraid that it would all-of-a-sudden give out and flop down right into my laptop screen,26,11
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this product has been a great disdain of mine for a while at this price point you expect premium quality but what you receive is poor design and build quality look elsewhere,32,12
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,does it is job albeit at a terribly overpriced cost,9,13
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,great product bought for my son and he loves it,10,14
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,kind of expensive but you do get a solid product out of it seems like 40 50 would have been a more reasonable price but it is not too over priced i suppose,31,15
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,looks great but mic is to heavy has to be at a upward angle i do not like that,18,16
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the thumb screw and joint are not designed to hold the weight of the mic,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,after buying this stand i had a look at the reviews i was a little worried since a lot mentioned a problem with the screw not holding due to the weight i inspected it and they replaced the old plastic washer saw on youtube review with a metal washer with teeth it holds very well easy to tighten and i am very pleased with the purchase,66,18
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the mount seems to be too big i have mine set up with a rode psa1 swivel mount studio microphone boom arm within days of owning this product the thumb screw snapped off so now i have it jerry rigged with various items from my husbands toolbox if it gets bumped in the slightest it falls it is very concerning and i worry for the safety of my blue yeti i also have the blue pop filter that does not seem to have a set home in combination with this set up which boggles my mind it is all blue equipment minus the boom arm which i have no problems with so why does not it fit together next time i will go with another company for all my audio recording needs,128,19
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,great microphone but known issue apparently with windows 81 reading on their site and had to follow instructions to use an old o / s version driver not happy about that and is keeping me from giving a 5 shame that latest is not supported properly in latest o / s otherwise great microphone sound quality and construction,53,20
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,thisbroke shortly after purchasing the metal knob which is used to tighten the mount is not strong enough to support the weight of the yeti blue microphone all and all a very expensive waste of money,38,21
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,good shock mount does the job perfectly easy to install on mic and on the boom,16,22
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it lasted for 2 months or so before it started to get loose i tightened it up and it stayed for a few days before i had to tighten it up again eventually the thumb-screw or whatever it is broke off and now it is a big pile of junk overpriced piece of crap time to look for another solution and burn more money on something that shall hopefully last long enough for me not to get pissed off when it eventually does give in,83,23
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i saw alot of bad reviews of this mount being faulty or the wing-nut breaking off well be careful with it and be patient during setup / re-adjusting it holds firm looks pretty professional and definitely does the job no complaints as of now,42,24
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,my son loves this as part of his microphone setup,10,25
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it does not support the weight of the blue yeti or the blue yeti pro,14,26
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,very bulky and heavy thumb screw broke so now it is unusable waste of money,15,27
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i like this shockmount a lot however i wish they could be a little more innovative and shrink down that size this is a gigantic shock mount,26,28
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,super heavy and the bolt holding the swivel mount on broke and my blue mic fell right on the ground was not even home when it happened bolt just snapped over time from being tight you can tell everything is quality except this little bolt it is cast molded and junk pretty bummed had to rig it up to fix,59,29
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,works on the yeti but it adds so much weight that the whole thing starts to sag unless you use a wrench with some rubber protective pads to tighten everything up i had this on a swing arm and it was constantly drooping with the yeti pro i would not recommend this for the yeti series at all nothing wrong with the product itself by the way it works as advertised and i use it with other mics on occasion,80,30
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,horrible do not buy this it does no good it easily breaks and does not support the mic at all,20,31
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,love the radius shock mount i do recommend this product,10,32
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works good the hinges need a lot of tightening and i twisted of a bolt and do not know how to replace it,22,33
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,yes like many other reviewers have said this is pretty much not worth it for the yeti keep the yeti on it is base it is just too heavy to be mounted on a stand you will frustrate yourself with clamps trying to keep it mounted in the air,46,34
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,not strong enough to hold up the blue yeti just ordered a blue microphones yeti and yeti pro custom spider shock mount instead to solve this problem,27,35
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,blue mic customer service is great but no amount of customer service can fix this mount I have been sent two replacements and like all other reviewers the mount can not hold the mic up and is constantly drooping down,38,36
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this stand looks beautiful but it has flaws it constantly need re adjustment and recently the thumbscrew broke off,19,37
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the radius is one of two available shock mounts of the blue yeti that is the reality is it overpriced yes does it do the job also yes however the thumbscrew that comes with the shock mount is extremely prone to breaking due to the extreme weight of the yeti and whatever pop filter you use the radius will inevitably sag some users suggest exchanging the plastic washers included with the radius for the rubber o-rings from the original yeti stand that is a mistake the o-rings merely provide a different form of friction less surface area of the o-rings will make contact and the o-rings will eventually wear out they will work temporarily however the solution get an m5 hex cap screw from the hardware store and use that in place of the thumbscrew yes you will have to use a special wrench to tighten it however your shock mount will be rock solid I am docking a star because the thing is hilariously overpriced the fixture is large which might make it more expensive but for a product that comes with flawed hardware i expect more for the price,189,38
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,I have gone through 2 of these first one broke because of a faulty screw in the hinge but second one is working out just right does what it is suppose to i can imagine there are other shockmounts out there that do a good job as well but aesthetics of this are unmatched,53,39
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,low quality materials i followed a youtube tutorial on exactly how to mount this along with a rode psa1 swivel mount unfortunately the hardware that it comes with is not strong enough and after about 48 hours of being setup gravity took over and broke the clip so that it is now just dangling helplessly from the mount and it is not fixable unless i usetape or a soldering iron,71,40
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this does not fit a blue yeti microphone the threads do not line up what a terrible terrible product i hope the microphone is better,25,41
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,here are a few reasons why you should not even consider purchasing this mount 1 it is massive put two pop cans on top of each other that is the approximate diameter 2 it does not support the weight of a blue yeti mic not only does it not support the weight constantly swings down because the little screw can not stay tight enough to keep it up but the mount itself weighs a ton this makes it a nightmare for any spring-based arm 3 it brakes after a couple months of use that little screw i mentioned that holds it up yes it snapped off due to I am guessing constantly having to re-tighten it for the mount to stay up 4 just read the other plethora of reviews saying the same thing as me i was lucky enough that amazon allowed me to return the product but I am still out 10 for restocking,150,42
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,I have gone through two of these things with my blue yeti for both the little bolt that holds the mount in place snapped off only by using hand-torque on the bolt I am no hulk of a strongman by any stretch of the imagination seems the weight of the yeti pulled on the bolt joint enough to snap it makes me sad because the yeti is such a quality product and you are basically stuck with this piece of junk shockmount,81,43
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,I am very serious this shock mount gets 2 stars because of one little screw allow me to explain i got this mount for the same reason anyone does it is the mount made for the blue yeti that said it is huge and a bit unwieldy on top of that my mic was drooping every day and so every day I had untighten the screw move the mic back up and tighten it again this process got old fast so finally i tightened it as hard as i could and lo and behold the screw snaps i was startled because I am not a strong person at all i looked at the screw and it is made of plastic please be warned this screw is cheap plastic and will not hold the mic up at all until they fix this part do not buy this is not even shoddy workmanship this is pure bad design and laziness cheapness even there is zero reason for this part to be made of plastic it is a screw something like this should never happen,174,44
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it looks great but it was very heavy and made the yeti huge it was so heavy that it brought the stand down no matter what adjustments i made ended up using the yeti without it and I am fine with it for podcasting,43,45
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,there was a problem with the screw in which to hold your mic in place the screw just snapped completely now i can not adjust my mic to be upright it just dangles now it was a pain to constantly adjust it and now i can not adjust it at all i have a friend who has the same yeti set up as i do with the shock mount set up and he had the same exact problem terribly disappointing but hopefully a warranty is out there for this,87,46
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the screw that holds the microphone to the shock mount can not support the weight of the microphone for the month that i used it it consistently slid out of position then today when i attempted to record some audio it completely snapped in two when i went to adjust it,50,47
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i have tried to use this product and it always came loose i was careful with it but it still broke it dos not support the weight of the microphone,30,48
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works for what i need works fine with the yeti mic allows the mic to swivel around so you can position which part of the mic is facing you,29,49
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,just like everyone warned about the point where the shock mount attaches to an arm i have mine on a rode psa1 is terribly designed and can not hold the weight of the blue yeti which is the only mic that this mount is intended for it is very disappointing because i can not afford a different mic at this point and the only shock mount available for the blue yeti is this one i was very careful with tightening the thumbscrew but gradually over time it would not hold the mic in place and it would pivot down i tried to tighten it tonight and the screw sheered off when i turned the thumb screw I have only had the mount since 2/28/2014 very disappointed,122,50
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,perfect fit and mount all i can say is watch out simple minded rappers cuz s s about to blow up,20,51
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works as advertised helpful with such a large microphone easy to install and to adjust i would recommend this product to others,22,52
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,does this do it is job in the audio department sure the problem is that the attachment to a tripod is so flimsy and loose the microphone will fall down immediately so tighten it right well tightening it by hand is not nearly enough as it will fall back down again so the next obviousis to tighten with a pair of pliers unfortunately the damn thing snaps at less than a quarter turn literally no way of holding up the yeti on it is own without buying extra little bits and parts for it it had one job and it can not even do it hold up a blue yeti but it can not which is sad for such an expensive piece of hardware,122,53
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,listen to the other 1 - 3 star reviews the turn / handle that twists and allows you to tighten the mic into place completely snapped off today I have only had the mount for about two months look elsewhere or wait until a redesign happens,41,54
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it does what it says reduces a lot of nearby vibrations and excess noise feedback from mounted objects i am satisfied with the rig i have going and this shockmount,30,55
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it is the shock mount you want if you bought a blue yeti microphone do be aware that this does wiegh around 3 - 6 pounds just by itself so if you get a mic stand make sure it can take all the weight you need it too,45,56
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought thisjust over a year ago along with my blue yeti i love the blue yeti and i wanted to make sure i recorded the best possible sound i could so i bought this and after over a year of use i can say it is completely useless the stand the yeti comes with is just as much a shock mount as this i also have a few other cheap desk mounts which i tried out the shock mount does not help secondly even is this thing did work as advertised that would not make up for the terrible quality it broke a month after buying when i was adjusting it and cmon that price 60 dollars for a shock mount that is 2/3s the price of the freakin mic it is made for i do not know what i was thinking do not make the same mistake,145,57
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,based on some of the reviews posted on here i was unsure about this shock mount when i first ordered it however i must say it works great it works rather easily with the blue microphones the pop universal pop filter the only reason i find to rate this 4 stars and not five is simply because of the price tag it really could be cheaper,68,58
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,not only did i receive back to back defective pieces but when i finally received a good one it worked just as others are describing the threads on this clamp are far too weak to hold the blue yeti mic it is almost as if they built this without any testing whatsoever do not buy this unless you are interested in frustrating yourself to no end if you must use the blue yeti use a mic stand not a swing arm if you prefer the swing arm go with a different mic / shock-mount combo trust the others and myself this mount is garbage and the only guarantee it offers is frustration,109,59
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,legit looks exactly like it does in the picture have not set it up yet but i do not think I shall have problems,21,60
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,well-made product that fulfills it is purpose it looks pretty and costs far less than a night out with marilyn what is this presumptuous minimum-word requirement that amazon imposes regarding product ratings this is my last one ausgezeichnet,37,61
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it looks cool as heck and i get no bumps or vibration while recording this is worth the cost i got the blue yeti pro the pop filter and this shockmount my set up looks very professional and sounds very professional,41,62
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the thumb screw broke and can not use it tell i find a new one or get a replacement so of be carefull when u buy this product,27,63
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i broke the screw part because it would not tighten enough to support the weight of the yeti do not do that it will not be perfect but do not try and force it to be any tighter but as for the shock absorbing part for which you by it it does not do a great job right off the bat but you can unwind the band from a few points to loosen it up a bit which will significantly help reduce any noise from accidentally bumping the table it is on and the like sadly i figured that out after i broke it do not follow in my footsteps,103,64
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it was a xmas gift for my grandson he says it is great works really well it met with all his expections,21,65
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,bought one of these for a blue yeti mounted it on my boom stand the weight of the yeti was too much for the joint and the shock mount kept bending down so i tightened it but it was still bending down and then tightened it too far broke off the tab so I have got the boom pointing straight up and the loose shock mount naturally bends at 90 degree angle it works in this configuration but I have got to rearrange my desk and it is not the setup i was hoping for,92,66
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i have seen lots of reviews saying that the yeti does not fit my blue yeti not the pro mounted perfectly to it it took a few tries but it screwed in perfectly i put it on my arm stand and it works fine one concern is that the swivel mount seems fragile it can barely hold the mic without falling and i had to use a wrench to tighten it perfectly i am worried i will strip it and break the mount other than that it seems fine i have so far had this for a day and i will see if it keeps mounted for a long time without breaking,111,67
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i do not know why there are so many negative reviews about mounting the yeti on this product i had this installed in about 2 minutes without any issues with regards to threading are people trying to mount it on the thumbscrew i find this mount to be incredibly sturdy with just the right amount of tension,56,68
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,works extremely well took quite a bit of effort to adequately tighten the thumbscrew that holds the mic itself in place also annoying that blue made a mic so big it absolutely requires it is own special shock mount especially when many comparably priced mics have some kind of internal shockmount a la the shure sm55,55,69
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i want to say that i love it but this shock mount is very short by that i mean that the shock chords are short taking very little shock away from the microphones receptivity in other words sounds do get transmitted to the mic the best bet is to place your mic on a thick bath towel folded over several times that will absorb much of the shock created from a desk mount stand but the shock mount is supposed to work on a boom i do have one set up in my studio but as i said it is about 80 effective i will say this it is ok for the price if you visit a microphone store where you can see all the professional shock mounts they can run into hundreds of dollars a really good mic with a really good boom requires a really good shock mount the professional set up i am talking about can cost from 2000 to as much as 10000 if you are an interneet podcaster like me then you do not want to go there the blue microphone shock mount works very well with the yeti i highliy recommend it for the price,197,70
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this mount because it was recommended to use with the blue yeti microphone the microphone is too heavy for this mount it does not stay locked in place and does not get very tight so it still moves and I am scared it will fall off i will be returning it soon,51,71
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i briefly skimmed the bad reviews and paid the price sure enough the thumbscrew used to attach the mount to the mic will not turn more than a couple of revolutions furthermore on my unit the 3/8 to 5/8 adapter that came with my rode arm will not thread into the female end on the mount the unit i received had various other defects about half of the screws used to assemble the unit were loose be warned,76,72
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the blue microphones radius microphone shock mount shock mount did not fit my stand had to modify it but other than that it works perfect,24,73
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this shock mount is pretty massive which adds to just how heavy the yeti mic is as if it was not heavy enough to begin with so if getting this shock mount make sure you get a mic arm that is very supportive or it will droop and not hold it up,50,74
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this is a red letter product you can only buy this for your yeti and it is what it is works for what it is but when i bought it for 80 bucks it felt like a rip off,39,75
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,very happy with this there is not much that fits this little beast but this works great i use it with a desktop mic stand,25,76
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this f ing thing now before you say stuff like this amazing shock mount held my blue yeti just fine i want to tell you that i bought it used that should not matter but it will not tighten enough to support the weight of the mic grrr would send it back but i think it is too late now,56,77
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the threads do not 100 match the threads on the blue yeti pro when fully hand tighten the rig is super wobbly when i unscrewed you can see the threads on the microphone have been damaged i just hope it does not break off completely do not buy biggest waste of money i wish i could replace my blue yeti pro now,61,78
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this because i have a blue yeti mic and this is made my blue what could go wrong right everything worthless it does not fit the snugly into the threads on my yeti waste of time and money do not buy,41,79
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,great solid mount for the heavy blue yeti microphone easy to install well constructed looks professional let us me mount the microphone upside down to keep it spit free,28,80
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,pretty cool and probably the only one that fits the blue yeti microphone the only drawback is that it does not hold place very well when taking it on an angle you constantly have to be adjusting and tightening and readjusting it other than that it is great,47,81
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,let me start by saying that i like this mount it has a lovely retro style and i would have absolutely loved to use it with my mic sadly in spite of being made by the same company and specifically marketed for use with my mic it is utterly incompatible due to their threads not matching according to another negative review the radius uses a metric thread while the yeti uses an imperial thread i can not attest to this myself but i can absolutely confirm that the two do not work together all those looking for a shock mount for their yeti look elsewhere,104,82
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it works great with my yeti and allows me to bump the table a bit without distortion a bit heavy although,21,83
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,this product is fantastic and hard to find through amazons search engine do you have a blue yeti microphone if yes do you want to use it in a microphone stand if yes this is the product to buy too bad that when you look for blue yeti shock mount or blue yeti tand adaptor this does not show up but one from samson mics i had to return one of those this product is the solution amazon change the keywords,81,84
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i needed a mount for my blue yeti mic and thought I had try this with the hope that I had receive a version that has the correct threads the one i received from amazon does not have the correct threading and does not work with the blue yeti mic i will not be buying any more yeti products,54,85
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,after trying to rig something up i decided to just go with this mount for my yeti it did not disappoint the fit was perfect install was easy use your logic and the microphone looks sexy as he shall on it,40,86
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i really like the blue radius it is very useful for when i do my gameplay recordings for youtube it gets a lil loose form time to time but is still a great product i love it,36,87
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the blue microphone radius shock mount is excellent it got rid of all vibration sounds through the microphone especially the fans in my computer i did not realize how much they were actually in the background now even if i hit the pop filter with my lips or chin it can not be heard although the microphone great product and very well built a must have,64,88
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,it did not perform looks cool but that is it very large and inconvenient would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti,25,89
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,until the company clearly marks the packaging to distinguish standard / english 5/8 27 tpi thread version used in the us from the metric m16 x 10 thread i received customers here will be very unhappy I am lucky that i did not strip the mic threads but be careful others have complained of just that will return this and hope to get the correct standard threaded one without delay this was not purchased from a reseller ships from and sold by amazoncom update I am not sure which part had the standard thread and which was metric but i sent both mount and the yeti microphone to blue and am happy with their customer service they are correcting the problem by sending me a set that fits i only paid for shipping it to them I am bumping from one to three stars for that and will update again based on my experience with the returned set,149,90
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,as another reviewer mentioned it looks great although it is probably bigger than it needs to be however this is not well designed from a functional point of view only on aesthetics this holder does not take out much vibration which it is supposed to do i have 3 other shock-mount mic holders and they all do what they are supposed to unfortunately i do not know of any alternatives for my yeti pro if you know please enlighten me,77,91
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i purchased this shock mount for my blue microphone as advertised unfortunately the weight of the mic is too much for the mount and when it is on a mic stand it will not stay fixed without serious torque in the screw after one or two times of me tightening it to the required torque the screw threads gave way and now it will not stay in position at all disappointing for the price and otherwise it would be a nice shock mount it certainly looks nice,87,92
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,fits on the mic perfect and looks very professoinal i am very happy also with the construction looks to be very sturdy and fits like a glove go for it,30,93
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i had a little issue with matching the threading of my microphone and the radius it works but not quiet as deep into the threading as i would prefer i am using it to hang over my head when shooting videos,41,94
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,hard to complain in spite of the price tag it works great and looks nice when paired with the yeti microphone,21,95
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought the blue radius shock mount for my blue yeti microphone to reduce secondary noise when i move near it i was glad when it arrived but devastated when i attempted to screw the radius into my yeti the screw does not fit the microphone the screw is metric but is the reason it does not work i chipped my microphone on the bottom trying to screw it in i do not know who to contact to have them replace my microphone due to blues error i had to return the shock mount to amazon and I am afraid to order another one in hopes of getting another screw that is metric i would give it zero stars if that was an option stay away from this shock mount,127,96
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i literally bought this shock mount friday may 24 and received it saturday may 25 great transaction quick delivery obviously works perfectly this company deserves an award for amazing service bc this is honestly the fastest i have ever ordered and received a product keep up the great jobs guys,50,97
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,despite other users having issues i ordered this shock mount to use with my yeti and was glad to find out that it does fit the threaded insert in the bottom of the yeti pros worked with the yeti reduced noise significantly looks nice feels sturdy cons it is gigantic elastic is too tight overall it works well but would work even better with slightly more shock reduction the elastic bands are too sturdy and are still passing along some amount of shock it is not enough to make the shock mount a bad value but it is enough to cost it a 5th star on my review,111,98
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,goes great with my yeti pro i was surprised with the size and i am so glad i bought it,20,99
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it was exactly what i needed and came just in time there is no other product quite like it thanks,20,100
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i bought this mount and paired it with a blue yeti and rode psa swivel mount all three work perfectly together and the shock mount allows the microphone / arm combo to move smoothly the only issue i had//have is that when connecting the yeti to this mount is that when if feels like the mic has tightened all the way there is abetween the base of the mount and the mic itself this problem is that this allows the move and clang and bang i used some shims to keep it tight but i would expect the mount / mic to be flush I shall upload a picture to show what i mean other than that minor hiccup awesome shock mount for the blue yeti,123,101
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the threading on this mount does not fit the yeti completely loose ridiculous for the amount i paid for each so pissed off,23,102
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the shock mount does a nice job with my yeti in terms of sound mitigation coming from my computer desk i purchased this in combination with the rode psa-1 and the on stage asfss6 gb dual-screen pop filter good combination,40,103
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,thiswas a huge disappointment it looks nice but it does not function in anyway like it should the thumbscrew to lock the head at the appropriate angle is made of pot metal i never once got it tight enough to hold the microphone at the right angle without it slipping this could have been easily solved by putting teeth on the joint so that it would lock after 3 weeks of trying to tighten it enough to hold the microphone horizontal the thumbscrew simply sheared off in my hand it did not once hold it correctly and now it is just a pile of junk that i will have to bore out and put my own hardware into to top it off this joint attaches to the main frame with about 1/8 of slop so that even if this joint was made tight the entire frame can rock up and down basically this is some stylized pot metal that i regret buying i purchased a rode microphone arm with this and a blue yeti pro microphone both are fantastic but i hope no one else has to deal with this thing,192,104
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,it seems to be constructed well however the screw that joins the shock mount to the base of the blue yeti binds it does not want to screw in all the way by hand and i would not attempt to use tools to tighten for fear of stripping the threads,50,105
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this along with a blue yeti when i got them i put them on a nice floor stand put the shockmount on the stand and then tried to mount the yeti i could not get the microphone to thread up properly i kept thinking it was me because mic threads are pretty universal before i knew it i stripped all of the threads out of the yeti i currently have a service request into blue to replace both items now that i look at the reviews i am most certainly not the only person with this issue with the radius however it looks like we are isolated meaning there are some mounts that are fine and some that are not so when you recieve thisand you can not get the microphone to thread do not keep trying over and over either return theto amazon for another or contact blue i might update the rating on this when i get the new shockmount and microphone but for now i have no choice but to say i hate this,181,106
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works really well especially with the rode psa 1 swivel mount i purchased i can no longer hear my finger touch the desk anymore or any other vibration for that matter,31,107
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works as intended however beware of the weight of the mount with the yeti mic is pretty heavy so if you do not have a beefy heavy duty stand you will not be able to extend the arm very far if that is the case,45,108
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works with yeti good product for good price,20,109
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,ordered this together with the blue yeti in the same order the thread on the radius does not match the blue yeti so i can not mount the radius securely probably a manufacturing defect of some sort what a waste of time for products that are supposed to be designed to work together,52,110
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i have the blue yeti and a rode psa 1 swivel mount i was afraid the weight would not hold but all together it is perfect yes when you have the mic hanging upside down the swivel mount does not do the best job of holding the mic in place you have to constantly tighten the cinch bolt i might wind up doing some sort of modification to fix this other than that one issue this shock mount does exactly what it is supposed to do,84,111
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,much bigger than i expected i wish it did not cost so much money or there were a generic option to fit the yeti but oh well,26,112
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,seems well made but the clamps that hold it up to make the mic stand upright do not tighten properly therefore making it useless do not buy,26,113
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the mount is great other than the screw that goes into the bottom of the mic would not go all the way in had to use pliers to get it on even after a drop of oil it goes on far enough to hold the mic to where it will not fall off but not enough to keep it from wobbling i placed a nylon washer in the open space to fix the issue only bad thing is my grip of the screw is a little messed up from the pliers so it is not easy to take off fortunately it stays on the stand at all times,105,114
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,gave thisas a christmas gift he said he would use this at work and for his own personal use,21,115
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,this shock mount takes out a hum i was getting in recordings it truly reduces shock also if you turn the gain down on the yeti and talk louder next to your mic you can get some great recorderings with this duo shock mount and blue yeti it was 65 shockmount but it is worth it,55,116
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this thing is huge as is the blue yeti my only complaint about this mount is i constantly have to tighten it to support the unbelievably heavy yeti that it must support if you need a shock mount for a yeti this is the only one i could find and it does work pretty well,55,117
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,bought two of these thing and they do not fit properly it seems the thread on these shock mount are not threaded correctly i do not recommend this,28,118
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it does not what it is supposed to and I have even noticed i that the way i keep my mic i can slide my blue pop filter through it without it touching or being a bother it looks great and absorbs shock i wish it was cheaper but besides that it was a great purchase i use it on a 20 mic stand that i also gone from amazon,67,119
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the shock mount for the blue yeti and yeti pro has worked out just fine for me i can use it either on a desk mount stand boom floor mount stand or the desktop extension arm mic holder in all broadcast studios i have worked in we always used the extension arm holders i run two stream full time on the net so this shock mount works out great with my having to switch from one pc to another to make announcements on the different streams,86,120
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,bought this for a client doing e-learning videos excellent sound quality i was very impressed the drivers on the website did not work i had to contact tech support it was smooth and the women sent me a dropbox link for an updated driver those worked like a charm,48,121
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,since my home studio is pretty small vocals are not my specialty and i really only got this to dress up my little blue snowball microphone so in that respect it does give my blue a much more professional overall look and it was easy to attach was it an absolute necessity i do not know that i hear much of a difference than before so the verdict is still out on that but it does what shock mounts do i suppose so yes i like it,82,122
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,definitely prefer this over the desktop mount that came with the microphone bought an arm to mount it on and it works great,23,123
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,looks cool but this thing is a gigantic 8 in diameter i got it because it seems to be the only way to hang a yeti vertically on the end of a mic stand boom arm there must be a better solution I am going to send it back and try the on stage posi-lok,54,124
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,if you are the owner of a yeti micophone and you need to isolate the mic with a shock mount then this is the mount to get well constructed not too heavy but keeps the vibrations at bay combine with a good boom stand and you have a nice piece of kit,52,125
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,for the brand and price i expected better quality i think they went more for style and looks when designing this i used it with a desktop mic boom and every key pressed on my keyboard when right up through it and into the mic this resulted in a slight muffled background sound that was annoying to solve the problem i bought a floor mic stand with boom this solution works great with the shock mount and blue yeti i think the problem is that the ties between parts are too small and tight i looked at the shock mounts for blues higher end mics and they are designed with longer ties i also used the samson shock mount that was wonderful with the samson mic it has longer ties that are more flexible so i believe this shock mount which looks cool is just flawed in design for the money asked i would have expected them just to do what they know works on a side note the blue yeti that goes with the shock mount is wonderful,178,126
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,hello before purchasing this shock mount i emailed blue support i previously had the ringer universal shockmount for my snowball mic looking at the pictures it looked like the same shock mount to me so the emailed i sent was asking if the two were the same and if i could just order the attachment piece that looked different to hold the yeti never heard back from them emailed a couple of times asking the same question finally just bought the radius shock mount the two are the same except the piece the holds the mic to the shock mount,100,127
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i bought the yeti and then the yeti pro microphone by blue wonderful mics but the lack at the time of a workable shock mount left me feeling less than satisfied the recently released radius shock mount is perfect it fits great attaches and un-attaches easily and the look is stellar both vintage and rather spacey I am definitely going to buy a second one for the other mic note when you remove the mic from it is original stand screw the attaching bolts back into the mic otherwise you are left with two holes in the side of the mic,101,128
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works great I have had this for a few years now and it is still holding strong i have a yeti mic in it,22,129
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,can not be tightened enough to really stay in the desired position without fear of snapping the mechanism too many horror stories it has to be left a bit loose and hang at an angle as a result they really need to come up with a more effective design,48,130
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,very disappointed for the price we pay we should not have to drill use pliers a hammer extra screwsto make these products work / function as they should,28,131
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,bought it for my son he loves it,8,132
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i have a blu usb attached and the pivot bolt broke after about 1 year they used cheap alloy for the main connector that receives all the tork most of the position adjustment knobs and screws come loose and just do not old in place so i have to continually re-adjust and tighten i managed to hobble together a main connector bolt from parts from the local hardware store and i still use the thing however it is becoming a frankenstein fixture,82,133
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,i was happy that this came pre strung my only complaint is that tuning it was a pain in the posterior i popped the bridge numerous times and when i came close to getting the e string in tune snap i bought a new e string but i could not figure out how to install it with out taking off the fine tuner the rosin is severely dried out and only after a piece of it broke off and i could use the inner part of it that was not dried out was i able to fully rosin my bow now that it is rosined enough i can finally get the right sounds from it and am able to fully enjoy it,120,0
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,my bridge is missing and i did not get my rosin so as thrilled as i am to get my first electric violin I am very upset and not happy,28,1
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,the only thing i was unclear of was the headphones are for use with an amp only can not plug headphones directly into instrument this was my mistake but not the end of the world because we have an amp,39,2
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,my son is 8 he is fascinated with all things technical and musical he has started learning the violin in school and i wanted to get him something that would be all his his favoriteis blue i love the variety of colors available on this model and he has a little rough on his things not intentionally he just uses them for the money spent on this i could have probably tracked down a used more professional violin however this is new it is his and for about 100 it was a great investment he has practicing daily and we can see the confidence booster this has provided him the violin was very easy to setup i had some musical training so i knew what to do if you had none you can pretty much google anything you need to know in addition to what comes with the package great value and what I am happiest with is if in a few years he has no longer interested i did not invest a grand into an instrument that will loose it is value immediately,179,3
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,i do not know how the violin plays yet because i bought this for my girlfriend it did not come with a hard case but a soft case the bow is extremely cheaply made also like others i got the rosin as hard as a rock the headphones are junk they hardly work at all due to a short in the plug the smallest string snapped as when i tried to put the bridge on even although it had not yet been tensioned but was still very loose now as for the quality of the violin itself i can not say yet due to the fact i do not play the violin i can say that the violin itself is not made very well just pay the extra money and get a good one,131,4
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves her violin and wanted a new one this company was fast and very efficient,24,5
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,the violin did not work at all the chip was sticking into the battarie compartment and when i tryed to take the battarie out the whole back of the violin almost came off the collor of the violin is varry diffrent from the picture too i did get a full refund back although so I am varry happy about that,58,6
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,low rating because when plugging it in the electric part does not work i have tried everything i can to fix it but still does not work the way it is described rosin dried out and popped the e barely tuning it,42,7
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,sounded like a violin my first upgrade would probably be a bow although does not have a very good tone or sound but it is to be expected from the cheapest electric violin on here you get what you pay for,39,8
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,my daughter loves it she was surprised by the quality for the price especially the case she figured out would be flimsy but it surprisingly better built,27,9
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,i just got my violin today when i opened it i thought it was in great shape but when i went to get it all set up and in tune the string broke none of the other strings even stay in tune at all none of the electrical works except to the power light but that do not help the bow feels cheap like the rest of the violin please if anything can be done to fix my situation i would appreciate it,82,10
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,i bought this and when i tried to tune it the first time a string broke and the knobs are to stiff the resin was in broken pieces,28,11
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,maybe it is just me because i consider myself a beginner although i played the violin while in high school over 40 years ago i have settled for playing clasical guitar since then and own many guitars i have been wanting to play the violin again and thought this could be a cheap entry level instrument to learn the result was as follows the battery was dead one of the strings popped while i was trying to tune it i could not get the chin rest to stay in place the strings do not stay in tune and i find it impossible to play the a string without touching either the d or the e string the bridge may need sanding but where and how much since i do not know how to set it up properly and the price of the instrument does not warrant new strings new pegs three more fine tuning screws new rosin and a new bow i am having serious thoughts to returning it before the 30 days expire any help,175,12
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,arrived on time as expected the bridge wanted to keep popping off during the initial tuning but we got it the sound is good for the price works in our amps if you want a cheap electric violin for practice sure go for it,44,13
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,did the job one pest c string was out of tune and this little guy allows me to make any quick adjustments without shelling out 75 to tuner,28,0
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,i prefer this style of handle because it fits inside the piano better and I am not sure who broke their handle but maybe they need to work on not jerking the tuning pegs so much i did my entire piano and the long handle allowed for a finer adjustment also great price especially because i did not need all of the sponges mutes and more that are in other kits,68,1
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,works great but i wish it were just slightly longer to give more torque i have a very old piano and have to micro-tap this thing with one hand while turning it with the other to get small adjustments of around 3 - 5 cents I am sure with another 15 - 2 inches extra on the handle i could get it down to 1 cent I am tempted to take it to the saw and weld it onto a bigger rod,76,2
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,it did a good job tuning the strings to themselves on my piano which had a some strings that were out of whack it easily tuned the strings that had dropped out of tune and if i got a little sharp it allowed me to loosen the string and try it again the square end fit tightly on the square pegs and did not have any play in it i have yet to tune my piano with a tuner because it was not that far out and i did not have that much time on the day i got it so i can not comment on how durable it is in the long run yet the fake wood plastic handle did not feel like it was going to break at any point it has been worth the money i paid for it just getting it back in tune with itself i will update my review if i find the quality to be poor when i redo the whole piano to a tuner but otherwise you can assume it still works good at this time I am happy m,182,3
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this is a good price for a useful tool i like it i used it and it worked well for our piano,22,4
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,thought to be on the safe side but the handle broke when used the second time i can not recommend this hammer,21,5
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this tuning hammer easily fit in my hand and did the job perfectly i have small hands and appreciate finding tools that are easy to use,26,6
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,small good for quick touchup would not want to do an entire piano with this tool,17,7
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,too short hard to use with any degree of accuracy get a bigger one,14,8
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it works but this is so short it seemed harder to use than the ones with a longer handle,19,9
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,i was really excited to start tuning my piano that I have had for years now however i realized too late that this wrench is much to short to be even slightly accurate you are going to be struggling for a long time trying to get it in tune on top of that the fit of the wrench is less than ideal it has a lot of wiggle room definitely not something you want for a tuner as it will slip off if you let go of it the worst part of it is that after about 3 or so hours of using it the handle slipped right off of the metal wrench part seems like very cheap glue was used to secure the two pieces i can not recommend this product i suggest spending more money and getting a tool you can be accurate with that will also save you time,150,10
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,do not buy this product if you want an accurate and non frustrating tuning experience 1 it is way too small you need to attack something to the back to extend it if you want the leverage to tune easily and accurately 2 it bends a lot it has a lot of give this makes it really hard to tune accurately since the thin neck of this hammer will bend quite a few degrees before it provides enough pressure to the tuning pin to turn it 3 this has a square hole instead of a star the star is superior i know that this is the cheapest but it is not worth it spend an extra 20 dollars and get a decent hammer this one is just a waste of money i would have taken it back except that it was a gift,141,11
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,worked perfectly for me my piano was so far out of tune one of the strings that was supposed to play a b was closer to playing an e so it definitely was worth it particularly since it is only a couple of bucks,43,12
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it works but it is loose on the pegs a bit shallow and a bit short,16,13
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,really really s m a l l useless for the fine adjustments needed for tuning,15,14
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,delivered on time and it works great also can not beat the price,12,15
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,could have had a longer handle could have had an angled handle but it could have been 50 used a smartphone app as a tuner and a couple hours later it was a done deal,34,16
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this worked for what we needed it for but if you are going to use it alot i would not waste your money on this one we used it to take apart an old piano,33,17
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,does his job i managed to tune my piano and save lot of,14,18
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,works great for the baby grand saves alot of money iphone piano tuner app helps,16,19
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,granted this is the cheapest one offered by amazon so no complaints if i had it to do over i would have spent a bit more for a wrench with a longer handle a tighter fit and a star asterisk shaped hole it is a little harder to get the wrench at the correct angle with only 4 contact surfaces still it works fine,63,20
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,very loose fit to not fitting most pins at all had to wiggle and wobble to remove which put the piano further out of tune do not waste your money,29,21
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,the piano tuning wrench was very cheaply made after very much fine tuning on my upright piano i began to notice a hairline crack in the plastic i did not think much of it until one day it completely cracked in half this is a good tool if you are going to use it lightly but not a very good tool for fine tuning a lot,65,22
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,too short and seems to wear out pretty fast would invest in a better one in the future,18,23
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,i used it to take out a couple hundred pins in a piano and it held together you are getting what you pay for it has a plastic handle and the pins get stuck in it but it is cheap and gets the job done,45,24
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,poor constructed socket that did not fit my pianos tuning heads returning,12,25
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,by the time i was 1/3 done the soft metal had deformed into a useless circle,16,26
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,oversized for either set of tuning pins i needed it for loose sloppy poorly made this will damage any tuning pins it is used on,25,27
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this has a metal socket and neck with a plastic handle simply does what it is supposed to do when tuning a piano a lot of the difficulty comes in how tight / old the pegs are not on how expensive the wrench is i was able to fine tune an old upright with no problem and also take strings completely off with little effort but again this will vary by piano,70,28
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,fit too loosely on piano pegs so tuning was difficult handle broke after several uses buy a better one,19,29
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,works well i wish the handle was a little longer jl,10,30
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,very good value and works well as expected,8,31
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,broke within one hour of using it metal shaft does not go all the way thru the handle and it snapped off,22,32
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,my husband attached some sort of tool to the end of it for easier tuning but other than that worked fabulously and much cheaper than paying the piano tuner 150 to come to the house,33,33
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,this broke on a d key one with two strings it is good for it is price and works fine on the keys that have 3 strings but it can not handle much pressure at all,33,34
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,not a very reliable or effective tuning hammer it barely grips the pegs and some pegs just slide around inside it,21,35
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it fits to tune the piano but after a while i was getting a lot of play the tool will soon strip and i will have to buy another better off getting a better quality on,36,36
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,the plastic handle snapped on the very first attempt to tune I am still using it without the handle and it works fine just a little awkward you get what you pay for,31,37
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,great tool saved me 500 on a retuning,8,38
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,very cheaply made soft metal barely made it through one tuning before being so stripped it was useless returned and ordered a different one,25,39
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,while this hammer works fine i should have bought one with a longer handle the hammer is quite small which makes it difficult to fine-tune the strings a larger hammer would make it easier to make small movements or adjustments when trying to tune a piano it takes forever to get a string exactly in tune i think it is worth to spend a bit more money and get a better hammer with a larger handle,76,40
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this tuning hammer together with the mute kit and the olympus l-12 recorder with tuner all helped me in tuning my daughters piano and will probably keep helping me in the future,32,41
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,it stripped out on the second tuning pin i used on a waste of money,15,42
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this wrench allowed me to tune my antique piano for free along with an android phone tuning application i am very happy with it,24,43
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this worked great for my needs which was to loosen the strings on my piano to get to the screws underneath which i needed to unscrew to remove the string plate from the back of the piano and then hang it on my wall as a decorative piece,48,44
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this is a very inexpensive tuning hammer but it works and I am glad i finally got one so i can make tiny tuning corrections to my piano,27,45
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,terrible product not only does the length of the handle make for inaccurate tuning but it is head fits the tuning pin loosely i had actually measured the size of my tuning pins beforehand and they fit exactly the measurements of the head while trying to tune my piano i had to jimmy the tool to get it to turn and when it turned it did so at an odd angle after being nearly done with my first note with this tool the head itself stripped all in all this thing will definitely turn two or three tuning pins but do not count on it to tune your entire piano it is much more difficult to use it than it should be and more likely than not it will because damage to your piano like it did mine,135,46
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,came rusty in the package did not bother returning just threw it away for fear of tetanus,16,47
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,was skeptical but it was so cheap i gave it a try i have a weber baby grand at my vacation home and can not easily schedule tunings to align with when i am there but i wanted to get some of the bad odd notes fixed did the trick i used a phone app for tuning and this did entire piano in about 2 hours first try and now do as needed not a replacement for long term care but great for my situation,84,48
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,soft metal starting to strip inside square now looks more like a circle after about 8 hours of tuning,19,49
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,quite small and makes it hard to reach the point one wants when tuning,14,50
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,worked perfect and made piano tuning much easier,8,51
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,great value but they need some weight at the bottom when you extend the boom the stand will fall over i use some small bags of sand as counter weight for the money they work good in my music studio but if your looking for some thing to gig with this is not a good choice,58,0
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,one turn to loosen or tighten for adjustments and it just falls apart in your hands cheap plastic pieces that are brittle and too light of duty of metal for a boom arm i think i could have made a better stand out of pvc pipe some glue and fittings do not buy them if you have to move them anywhere,60,1
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,these are very very light duty stands they might be ok for home or home studio use but not much beyond that they are light flimsy with low grade plastic and metal parts not for any kind of professional application,40,2
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,this was an awesome deal and worked perfectly for us thank you,12,3
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,light light duty not at all what i expected when a mic is placed the stand topples,17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,these are very lightweight intelligently designed stands when i ordered them i thought they were just giving you a choice of mic clips for each stand i did not realize that they were designed to have both clips on simultaneously in different places interesting why not so these are not real heavy-duty i would not let big ed the roadie manhandle them and i would not mount any neumann u87s on them but for spares to have around the studio they are great especially for less than 15 apiece recommended,87,5
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,it is a great purchase it may be of a cheap material but it gives many possibilities of movement,18,6
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,pretty good stands for the money i suppose i would not think they would be rugged enough to withstand multiple transportation scenarios at least not without putting them in a protective case of some kind,34,7
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,it came as expected could be bit more sturdy but makes sense for the cost,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,literally useless these do not even work for my 8 year olds jam room set up total trash all plastic even the screw in parts zero stars,26,9
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,really cheaply made but 4 for the price of one quality stand,12,10
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,wow this is fantastic perfect in every way,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,i wait and write reviews till I have had time to actually use them i bought these for my daughters at christmas last year who are in a choir and the mic stands are more solid than they appear and inexpensive i needed this type so i could use them in front of the choir but the stands set out to the side so as not to block the view from our audience,72,12
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,these were very flimsy got them for church and our singers said to return them,16,13
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,a real multi tasking microphone stand for two microphone works well for seate acoustic sets,15,14
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,2.0,negative,total waste of money internal parts are brittle plastic and do not hold up even under minimal use,17,15
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,came with a damaged box broken pieces and missing clips I am glad it did although one look at how crappy this thing was made and i was sure glad i had a reason to return it that would not cost me a restocking fee not even close to pro audio,49,16
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,a little on the flimsy side but it does what i need it to do,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,the microphone holders are not big enough for wider mics but works nicely besides that,15,18
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,good occasional use stand not sure it would hold up to constant use plastic pieces look and feel a little on flimsy side,23,19
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,very semple and easy to use i wish if this product would have sound adjustment control,16,0
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,the first one i received the display did not work second one works great easy to use sounds great on playback through headphones,23,1
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,recording to usb drive worked fine for a month and now nothing we use multiple usb drives in rotation at the church to record sermons and songs to mp3 this was the ideal tool for a little over a month totally disappointed,42,2
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,same as gemini rmr-1000 with different lable no operating instructions product states it does not work with above 4 gb sd cards well it is working with a 32 gb scandisk ultra micro sdhc it will record anything you feed it via rca,40,3
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,noisy made high pitched squeeling sound when loading and playing songs cheap is not always a good thing,17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,first of all this is a no frills recorder there is no way to do anything to your recordings other than adjust the volume of input and playback the buttons can be buggy and need pressed quick and hard not held upon booting up i have had the sound be very quiet like the auto gain inside the unit is not on restart fixes this the sound through the headphones has problems on my unit there is interference and other sounds so it is not good as an extra line out for audio playback the recordings do not suffer from this problem however and sound great recorded at 128mp3 sometimes the buttons do not respond and the unit takes a few seconds sometimes up to 10 secs to set up finally it only accepts 4 gb and under sd cards and no sdhc the usb stick seems to handle any size this is not perfect but it is better than the gemini recorder does the job with a little patience,165,5
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,2.0,negative,i can not get it to work with my mixer can not say how well it works because i think i need to update my other equipment,25,6
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,excellent recorder at low cost highly recommend this device,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,very much enjoy thisit does not recognize all usb stock thou sucks but great,16,8
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,works nice but for registration songnames no possebillities,8,9
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,what a piece of junk it records sporadically but never consistently tried to use the recorder to record via a usb stick some tests worked some did not nothing recorded missed several recordings because even although it said it was ready and recording timer was ticking after hitting rec button nothing recorded not an improper wiring issue since some tests worked fine with the audio system no hard copy users manual and no online manual lousy customer support for this product i should have spent a little more and got something that actually works,93,10
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,i got 2 of these and they work great love it and the only thing i do not like about it is it do not have a remote but other then that love it,32,11
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,defective right out of the box would not record on any media recording volume clip indicator always on,18,12
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,the white controller boxes do not seem to be quality i bought 5 of these none worked well enough to be usable you will notice this issue if your lights or a variation of astays light / on when you turn the power off it is like these control boxes are not stopping all the power from going through when in off mode so that is an issue the led strings look good the remotes look good it is just the power / controller white box that does not seem to perform up to standards with 5 sets we tried all combinations to make sure to rule out everything other possible component in failure uniformly it was the white little controller box that seemed to have the issue not sure how to resolve this maybe a better controller will make these use-able,134,0
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,fantastic product great value we have purchased several more sets and will probably buy more in the future,18,1
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,awesome package works flawlessly for a month now,8,2
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,great lights adhesive strip did not work had to buy additional hangers but for the price pretty cool lite set,20,3
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,lights work very well but i have two issues minor issue is that the remote is very weak it only works at half the distance of my tv receiver or satellite remotes major issue is that the power supply connections are so loose they are constantly working themselves apart and have to be pushed back together often unfortunately where i have this installed that is very difficult and in reality should never have to be done,78,4
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,received on time typical chinese instructions in broken english and very fine print have seen similar lights for msrp of 39 and 49 for only 1 meter length remote is necessary but dysfunctional but hey at this price this is a bargain not sure if can daisy chain or not according to instructions no but looking at unit it looks like yes have not tried yet they are bright with adjustable light intensity various colors mostly used for accent / mood lighting up stairwell and behind curtains for nice effects for this price it is a good buy not sure how long they will last,103,5
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,saw this for much higher prices but decided to give this a try directions are typical chinese but pretty simple to operate have to plug in correctly even knowing that i got wrong first time around and there is a line coming out of the white plug in that goes no where has pull tab for battery and takes standard lithium battery easy to find have not figured it all out but it is really pretty coolletting you change colors and pick how you want to operate for mood or christmas lighting clever ledhow long it will last have nobut at price i paid does not make a lot of difference on other sellers saw some adverse comments but so far this is working well will use to replace some of my older christmas lights next season,143,6
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,it is a lot of stuff for 10 it broke soon after turning it on but i was able to fix the defective transistor i am just it was just a fluke the lights work great still not sure what to use them for but fun to play with,48,7
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,got 2 of these and both do not turn off goes into dimming red glow,14,8
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,the leds look and work great however the remote or controller box not sure only allows me to change to 2 colors after about a week of using it the only way to get the other colors is to hope it registers the fade input right now they are stuck on blue also the sticky tape on the back is not the best so plan on something to hold it down could be a great product,75,9
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,just received my replacement of the generic led and like others my two units will not turn off although the colors on the remote actually match the correct colors of the led when on off is red not off the only way to turn off the lights is to unplug the power this unit is the second one with the same problem,62,10
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,i found this on a one day sale for 6 and bought it on impulse they were impressive for 6 but half the strand no longer changes colors and is now stuck on white only i bought the more expensive inateck brand strip and it is much better but for 6 i can not be too mad,55,11
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,lights seam fine but i bought two of these light kits and one controller shorted between the red and green so the red led lit up whenever the green lit up and both power supplies are faulty one never worked and one only works when lights are almost fully dimmed one star because the lights do work,57,12
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,i know these things need fine tuning on the production end control module but for the price and the amazing effect they have i will still go with 5 stars they may not last forever although i have two sets doing some lighting at church and have been for about a year but if you only get a feel for the possibilities with this set it will be worth it,70,13
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,i bought 2 of these one had a section of lights that was partially burnt out would only produce two colors right and neither of the strands shut off all the way i would try a set with a different reciever as it does not work vary good with the remote,51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,like some others mine will not shut off all the way the green stays on after multiple attempts to turn it off and ended up unplugging it,27,15
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,worked great for the first 15 minutes then it failed to respond to commands requested and received a replacement with the same issues receive your credit,26,16
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,looks great but selling these myself and other things i know this could be at a better price point lower,20,17
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,there has no instruction on how to configure thebuttons I am not sure if thisis defective or not but pressing the power off button will not turn off the led strip it just make it switch a very dimmed greenthe light are still on instead also the led strip gets very hot just after about 5 minutes leaving it on steady lit,65,18
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,very inexpensive and worked great these leds are bright but can also be dimmed plan ahead when laying these strips down as there are parts in line with the cord that need to be out of sight,37,19
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,i love these lights and will be ordering lots more to put up in my mancave,16,20
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,great product works as advertised power brick does not get very hot when powering whole string the two plastic eyelets on the white control device broke off when screwing down the first one i thought i just tighten too much but the second one was only tightened until it would not allow the control module to lift up and it too broke off ended up using ultra-strong velcro,66,21
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,the led strip is amazing in terms of light output and programmability however the sticky back is a little weak and the remote range is very lacking 1 or 2 feet at the most still great value for the money,40,22
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,work just as described only downside is the adhesive on the back is not very good would be 5 stars if not for that,24,23
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,works great and gives out good light but not bright white has bluish tint,14,24
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,these light are great for indoor use the lights themselves are waterproof but the control box and power box are not waterproof i placed these around the tops of my kitchen cabinets as accent lighting i suggest if you want them for outdoor use that you buy the 15 foot extension cord that runs from the control box to the lights that way you will have more options as to how to run them,74,25
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,returned them odd colors / not solid full light at one end-no light at the other makes you feel it is going to blow-up it looks so odd may be worh 5 for the plugs,32,26
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,kit came with everything needed except for connectors if you want to cut the strip still going strong today the sticky material used to hold the strip up is not all that great so be prepared to use 3 m tape or something else to supplement the light is bright enough and can be dimmed or brightened up from the remote remote works well feels super cheap but they are all the same i have a few of these from multiple different companies / vendors and they vary very little in design,86,27
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,when i first plugged this in i loved it but the 3 m tape does not stick well at all the jumper wires needed if you want to make turns make horrible connections that short out very easily i spent over 30 to get this mounted properly and then the controller completely quit save your money spend a little more on a higher quality led product and be happy,68,28
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,these are pure garbage one of the power supplies did not even work the adhesive does not stick to anything one slight bend and half of the strips went out straight in the trash,32,29
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,so they do not turn completely off and the battery was almost dead a day after i started using it or so i thought not all the colors that are on the remote display the entire red column does not work for me except when i power off then there has a red glow sticky back needs additional adhesive I am going to leave them in place never change thewhile i look for another controller box,74,30
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,2.0,negative,the clip on the neck strap is too big you have to jam it on the cleaning brush is too thick gets stuck easily the end cap actually broke off inside my clarinet reeds are very low quality,38,0
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,4.0,positive,as per described but would be nicer if had a container of some sort items are just loose,18,1

Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,1.0,negative,cork grease was not included in the package,8,5
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,5.0,positive,exactly as described however i thought that the cleaning cloth would be one of the weighted ones for cleaning the clarinet or any of the woodwinds because the description does not state what type of cleaning cloth i can not hold them responsible,42,6
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,4.0,positive,as described shipped fast good price would buy from again,11,7
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,5.0,positive,fast shippingwas exactly what the description stated,9,8

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,can not beat this kit for the cost files are great nut spacing ruler is great and mine was not sharp like others said the action ruler is a nice laminate cardboard with a really cool scale design on the sides that make it easy to get a good measurement on the string and the string winder actually is two pieces and the end comes off and has a hex for an electric drill so you do not have to manually wind case is great quality with some extra room so you can toss a few more tools in there if you work on your guitars or want to this is a must have,111,3
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,files are worthless i will need to buy another file to complete grinding down the saddle,16,4

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,i asked about the quality before ordering and was honestly let down one of the nut files is improperly marked with 3 - 6 stamped on the handle on one side then stamped opposite on the other side of the handle i messed up a nut before i noticed it was improperly marked the files are of lower quality and I am not sure if they are gauged correctly you get what you pay for so buyer beware,75,6
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,1.0,negative,this kit is a toy not a real luthier tool,10,7
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,pleased with the speed of shipment and the quality ofgreat for the price,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,1.0,negative,poor quality file sizes are misslabeled square corners on files instead of rounded,13,9
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,4.0,positive,this came fast you get what you paid for folks the file faces are numbered so notice that when you try out the files they are different sizes nice case sw,31,10
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,4.0,positive,pretty good set of guitar nut / saddle files for the price the height gauge is nice to have,17,11
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,initial review the wording on the box makes it questionable but once you look at the files it becomes clear that this set is for acoustic guitars not electric guitars the file are definitely not slim enough to file the nut for the 1st 3 strings on en electric guitar nut i will add more once i have used them a bit but i wanted to get that word out there for anyone who thinks this set will work for the great 99 dollar electric guitar kits on sale here stay tooned,93,12
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,exactly what i need to quick small repairs,8,13
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,plastic measure card not marked accurately files are not sized properly and the edges vary a lot not for precision work not for my guitars,27,14
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,this guitar needs new steel strings so it holds it is tune better i contacted customer service with an issue and they took care of it promptly and courteously,28,0
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,i recieved the guitar and it was not what i expected it to be the amp plug was loose there was chipped paint on the neck of the guitar it will not stay tuned for very long and when i recieved it there were fingerprints and smudges all over the body i was not very impressed with this,59,1
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,very disappointing it looked so beautiful in the pics and when i got it i felt like i was a beginner with no respect all over again giving me something that looks like there was no care in making it i thought it was going to be a good deal when i seen it but when it got here this so called new guitar looked like crap like a 8 year old put it together the decal around the sound hole was a poor sticker that is falling off there are dents all over the bottom feels like it was made with plywood from mexico the neck is so thick i swear only basketball players could play it with their big hands the g string buzzes sounds like crap this is the worst deal on here for guitars i would not send my worst enemy here for this guitar,148,2
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,the finish paint the sound and another things are so diferent that i was expecting i do not recoment this guitar for any body really this is a bad product,30,3

Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,bought this for my daughter who wants to learn to play different instruments she is happy with it and plays often,21,5
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,this guitar will not stay in tune i would reccomend it for someone that likes to fix up guitars because the finish is pretty yet even with new strings it will not hold tuning i would not reccomend it for beginners unless the tuning problem could be fixed it is hard to learn to play with a guitar out of tune,59,6
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,cheap very poorly made but for the price i did not expect much so i guess for a beginner is okay,21,7
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,even if you are a beginner do not buy this guitar as soon as i opened the box and saw it i knew it would be a piece of junk the sound is terrible plugged in or not save your money up and get a nicer one not this,47,8
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,toy guitar i thought this guitar was going to be worthy with the shipping and handling cost i could have bought a real worthy used guitar at guitarcenter if it was my guitar i would give you one star however since i bought it for my 10yr old brother and likes it because it is blue i will give you a 2,61,9
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,so i was pretty excited about buying this and although it was cheap it seemed legit however my friend went to replace the strings and realized that it was a nylon string guitar that was sent to me with steel strings of course this bent the neck and rendered the guitar pretty unplayable I had definitely like my forty bucks back,60,10
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,i see a lot of people were expecting a miracle for under 50 i was expecting a very cheap guitar that i could use for learning the basics of hand placement and movement i got exactly what i expected a cheaply made product for a cheap price and it even came with a ton of extras do not expect a 500 - 1000 guitar for 50 expect a 50 guitar and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how much you get for your tiny money,82,11
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,great product for the price strings included are cheaply made definitely recommend purchasing better made strings and a warning to be careful in tuning these cheap ones as they tend to break in the middle and almost took out one of my eyes twice on the same chord electric portion of guitar is made possible by battery within guitar which i did not really care for but for the price it is a great starter electric / acoustic,75,12
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,i am really glad that i purchased this,9,13
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,poorly put togther paint had runs damage above one fret,10,14
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,it did not meet no expectations poor product will never by again and hope noone else does as soon as i tuned it the neck separated emailed did not get no reply no money back no nothing,35,15
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,ok the product arrived with details thanks you,8,16
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,so many things you can do with these brushes i highly recommend them,13,0
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,these brushes are as good as or better than any others i have not as stiff as rods and a bit sturdier than wire brushes these belong in every drummers gig bag,32,1
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,edit unfortunately these have just fallen apart the material that the brushes are made from is brittle and they break off at the point where they leave the handle after maybe 3 hours of use I am down to just 4 bristles on one of them shame because i like the feel but they are just so badly made i have to go to 1-star and definitely do not recommend anyone buy these i like the weight but they are not brilliantly made the plastic caps from the ends fall off and when they are fully extended the ends of the brushes left in the handles rattle pretty bad the handles are a little short too another 1 1/2 would make all the difference but cheap so good enough,125,2
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,the pair i received was very fragile slightly impassioned playing and the rods started falling out,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,bought for fun and one of the plastic strands has already fallen out without much use okay for the price,20,4
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,they are fine brushes as far as performance goes and for not being metal no real complaints there but they do not retract very well at all every time we try to push them back down no matter how carefully it shaves off part of the brushes so that kind of sucks i assume that after a while it will not be so bad but hopefully this does not lessen the life of the brushes otherwise they sound fine and work fine the black and blue colors look cool,86,5
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,decent quality does not sound the same as a metal wire brush but is definitely softer on things such as a cajon or such,23,6
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,they are brushes and they are cheap that is about all i can say,11,7
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,can there be a zero star category these brushes are cheap and terrible they sound awful and arrived bent i do not recommend purchasing them at all,27,8
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,pretty cheap plastic pieces broke off first time i used them but what do you expect for the price,19,9
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,helps keep the noise down for my kids they are definitely a cheap set but that is what i expected for the price my 5 year old loves them,29,10
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,only got one brush when there should have been two the brush did not retract over all very cheaply made and not worth the time or money i returned theand ordered from another company,37,11
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,okay brushes but order only comes with 1 not a pair,11,12
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,the bristles are very weak and break too easily they have an interesting sound but they are not going to last more than a few hours i broke two bristles off in the first five minutes and I am not a heavy hitter,41,13
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,if you need a product to amplifier your music this is it i love the big knob the headphones jack and the 3 usb ports i love it i use it for my computer to play video and music works well for me,43,0
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,this was a very disappointing purchase this unit seems to be the perfect solution for someone who only requires an output interface but it lacks support for any sample rate greater than 48khz or bit rates other than 24-bit it is also very quiet almost 25 30 less volume output than my firewire solo for the price i can not even recommend it as a windows interface as it would be wholly unnecessary it does exactly what is says on the box bu the box does not give you the whole story and neither m-audios website or the amazon description mention the sample and bit rate limitations it is possible that a firmware or drier update could correct these issues but it honestly should not have to i can not give a recommendation to anyone in regards to this device,134,1
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,extremely disappointed with this product i was hoping for a simple usb da with good quality converters and a little control the interface has not program to control parameters and only works at 44khz 24 bit when tried to switch to 48khz 24bit a dialog pops out saying it is not supported it might be ok for music but not recommended for video returning the unit ps i got bunch of driver irql not less or equal m-audio blue screens regardless of what usb port i had it connected,89,2
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,using to connect to krk rokit 8s to my macbook works perfect with ableton the usb hubs on the front allows me to power both of my midi controllers and charge my phone if needed great purchase for a small production studio setup,43,3
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,was kind of hoping for 48k phantom power love the volume control knob great feel portable easy to use great product,21,4
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,works for my set up all i needed it for was a usb dac for my m-audio bx5s,18,5
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,using it as a standard hub for music production and studio monitors works just fine for me,17,6
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,this is my third m-audio piece of gear and my second m-track hub i bought my second one in jan 2017 and now it is june 2018 and this is the third unit to go bad within 18 month period this stuff is garbage I am really tired of m-audio at this point and will never buy again,56,7
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,the usb ports in front stopped working a couple months after i bought it i like the large volume knob but it sucks that i can not use the charging ports,30,8
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,usb ports did not work and low volume for headphones,9,9
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,it worked fine for a few days and then this morning i plugged in my akai mpk mini like i have since i got the device and noticed it was not working properly also i was not getting any sound out of the m-track shortly after this i began to smell electric fire it was coming from the mpk i quickly unplugged the mpk i tried to plug it directly into the computers usb port the mpk was destroyed i decided to see if it was the m-track hub that was faulty so i plugged an old flash drive into it it did the same thing so i quickly unplugged everything it is highly possible i got a bad device but i will still be cautious of m audio gear in the future rip akai mpk mini,134,10
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,i chose this audio interface because all i needed to do was connect a pair of studio monitors in my room kinda wish the volume wheel was clicky but i also kinda like it the way it is the usb hub is wonderful i only wish they were 30 ports maybe in the next model this is not a headphone amp so do not expect crazy loud volume from the headphone out overall very satisfied with performance looks alright usb hub is awesome,82,11
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,excellent piece of equipment well made good sound card i was advised by a studio sound engineer to buy this hub for my particular needs,25,12
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,the potentiometer sends a signal to the left channel first then the right so at low volumes you can only hear out of the left speaker only at about 1/10 of the dial does volume come out of both channels i returned it,43,13
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,was disappointed that it is a soft covered book description failed to state this just assumed it would be a hard cover,21,0
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,this was not what i expected it is very thin and more like a paperback book i was not happy with it and i had bought 2,27,1
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,i cut the edges if the pages shorter so i could put stick-on alphabets on the edges so that my mom copuld more easily find the addresses and phone numbers of family members,33,2
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,it is perfect it has plenty of room for writing all i need and it is still compact and easy to throw in my bag and carry with me thanks,29,3
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,wish it had tabs on the side alphabetically,8,4
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,i purchased two not at all what i was expecting for 2000 looks like it was done entirely on a copy machine returned for refund,25,5
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,i did not look at dimensions when i purchased it was my fault too small lesson learned,17,6
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,while it does have an eye appealing cover design it is actually very cheaply made no tabs for the various letter sections plain paper cover horribly laid out entry blocks very cheap paper stock will not buy again,38,7
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,small address book for those of us old fashion folks that prefer to keep addresses written down so we do not lose them,22,8
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,larger than i wanted but nice heavy leave at homebook,10,9
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,ordered two but not what i would have bought if i had see the inside first,16,10
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,looks great will help me get rid of sticky notes,10,11
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,cute but no tabs and no extra space if the address changes in the future,15,12
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,love it i am a letter writer as in stationary pens stamps and card seals this book not only an address book but it helps me with birthdays in my very large family i would recommend this to family and friends every day of the week and twice on sunday as the old saying goes,55,13
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,i wish it had tabs but there is lots of space to write and lots of categories that are all ready entered,22,14
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,absolute worst address book i have ever had,8,15
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,it was awful it was torn on oneand looks cheap i did not use it,17,16
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,it is easy to carry and like the cover a lot,10,17
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,sent as a gift she like it everybody else wanted it perfect,12,18
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,i loved the address book just what i wanted but it arrived damaged and could not give it as a gift like i intended will keep it as cost too much to return,33,19
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,one star for the colorful cover however it is a softcover so when your filling in information you constantly have to be holding done the book using the left side is nearly impossible i picture myself writing out christmas cards and having to hold the book open instead of holding done the cared and envelope puts a damper on it the job for sure not worth the money,67,20
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,it has no tabs so therefore it is useless to me looks nice although for a book not an address book as such i would be eternally hunting and folding pages over i foresee this becoming a big mess quickly,39,21
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,the keyboard tray that arrived was not what is pictured not even close the tray itself is plastic flimsy and the bottom edges are sharp which were cutting up my legs until i puttape over the edges i will never buy from this seller again,47,0
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,i liked the size and price of this product it fits a full sized keyboard and mouse / trackball with relative ease the wrist rest was a nice surprise it is not as cheap as i thought it might end up being the mouse pad however is although that is not my gripe with this thing as i said before it is nice and big seems to attach to the underside of a desk rather sturdily also the left and right swivels are nice and make things convenient the tilt works nice the lock to control it works nice as well it slides in to tuck away completely as long as you install it far enough back this thing is wide and can be very long when pulled out completely all good traits in my book the only downside to this product is that it hinges all it is support in the middle of the tray making the platform quite wobbly it does not feel weak or unstable just wobbly other than that it is a fantastic product for the price if i could give it 4 and a half stars i would,185,1
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,purchased thiswith the hope that it was a quality piece you get what you pay for the keyboard tray is plastic a feature which was not mentioned in the description i will give them credit as they did say the tray was modular very misleading the unit is flimsy and unstable that is the tray moves quit a bit when you type not good if you are a touch typist my recommendation is to purchase a more expensive unit from another vendor you can not trust a company who will employ misleading descriptions,93,2
Office_Products,B00009U175,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get this product now that i have it installed not so much in order to fit the keyboard and mouse on the tray it makes it wobble a lot when you type the entire tray leans to the left it is not as stable as i hoped it would be i am going to look for a replacement and probably return this one,68,3
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,installed on a small corner desk and having been using since it arrived holding up so well,17,4
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,very well built will most likely outlast me lots of steel little plastic,13,5
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,our ito has so much stuff on his work area that finding his keyboard was a real chore we made him install it himself he got it on the right way the first time that is saying something for the instructions just kidding it is easy to install,46,6
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,overall quality is decent two factors keep it from getting 5 stars 1 there is bit of vibration when i type in this regards it is much better than the fellows keyboard tray it is replacing but it is not as solid as my workstation at work hard to characterize the actual amount of bounce suffice to say i can live with it but it is not optimal 2 there are two width settings basically comes with three plastic squares and you can use 2 or 3 of them i did not have quite enough space for 3 so i ended up using just two might have been nice to have more options 3 the left and right end caps of the keyboard tray are just pressure fit they are not screwed together will have to see how long they hold up meanwhile i will try not to fidget with them,153,7
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,apporximately 28 inches usable width using all 3 planks apporximately 185 inches using 2 planks apporximately 95 inches usable space from the front of the shelf to the far end this includes a slightly lowered area where the wrist rest s would be inserted beyond that distance there are cord guides cut into the planks on the back that are appoximately 025 inch round followed by a slightly raised backto prevent things from getting pushed over the shelf the height and tilt adjustment are released and locked by a single handle the keyboard tray may have a tendency to retreat downwards slightly for people with firm typing pressure or if the track was not attached to the desk securely the track may need to be installed with it is front apporximately 4 inches behind the front of the desk to allow the keyboard tray to cross behind the front of the desk when pushed straight in although this may vary with the selected tray height,165,8
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,this platform utilizes a strong and stable platform arm i had a need to fit a keyboard under a narrower-than-usual desk space and the regular under-desk keyboard trays with support guide channels located on the outside were all simply too wide this design utilizes a central arm think crane boom arm that connects to a steel sub tray i threw out the main plastic tray and made one of wood it is strong stable versatile and fits my needs to be recommended especially for smaller desk openings it was a bit of a fuss to locate the support arm in it is front-to-back orientation that is when the tray is slid under the desk one wants it to disappear entirely under the desk conversely when one pulls the tray / keyboard out from under the desk one wants it to fully extend out for effective use not have a portion yet remaining under the desk however no big deal,156,9
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,the keyboard tray is a little bit bouncy it lacks structure but it is sufficient for my daily use at work,22,10
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,all the hardware is missing for thishow the he shall am i supposed to put it together now i have to go find all the differnet sized screws spend more money and waste time,35,11
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,after putting the tray together to attach to the desk it would not angle down like the picture it only went in straight so it did not fit what i needed pretty flimsy if you used all three panels,39,12
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,i installed this keyboard platform to a secure table but the platform itself shakes / wobbles / bounces i had to wedge a thick book between the platform and table so that the platform would be somewhat stable i would not recommend purchasing this,41,13
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,i have gone through 2 plastic kensington keyboard trays in as many months not only do the screws fall out i just read that using super glue will help this but the screw sleeves on the tray are plastic and just crumble apart terrible product and what a pain to have to remount another one after already having this thing attached to the underside of the desk do it right the first time and buy a different brand,78,14
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,easy installation plastic keyboard / mouse tray foam wrist pad for keyboard does not adhere to keyboard tray and is a little larger than the slot that is cut in the tray metal bar that is attached to bottom of tray during installation if you are using the extra plastic tray extension for your mouse be aware that the tray can be sensitive to pressure as the metal bar does not extend across the entire length of the tray overall i have been pleased with this product when using the mouse you just do not want to put much pressure on the tray it does not feel like it will break just bends down a little,112,15
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,the kensington underdesk adjustable keyboard k60067 works well the installation directions are vague and not well written the product is well constructed and despite the poor directions easy to put together it takes two people to mount the under desk bracket easily however one person could do it the tray is long and requires a large desk opening note the dimensions when ordering overall very pleased with the product,69,16
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,the quality and finish of thewas better than i thought it might be it was easy to install and works great i would buy anotherfrom this company thanks amazon for good merchandise,36,17
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,i used this keyboard tray to replace one that came with our desk the old one had metal slides and hangers on the edges of a wooden tray the corners were sharp and would catch and tear my pants legs and desk chair this one is durable plastic and it is supported by a central slide arm i no longer have the catching problem in addition i can move the kensington tray to the most comfortable height and angle,78,18
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,it is sturdy and just fits in the space between the drawers on either side of my desk slides easily in and out so i can get it out of the way when not using the computer mounting instructions did not say how far from the deskto place the bracket i got it wrong the first time otherwise installation was easy,62,19
Office_Products,B00009U175,2.0,negative,i was expecting this keyboard tray to be more adjustable and not so flimsy i am still getting used to it but so far i am not very pleased with it is performance,32,20
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,looks great nice and big bounces with each and every keystroke bought two both of us quit using it within a couple of weeks it is just not sturdy since it is only attached at one point which is in the middle,39,21
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,if you are looking for a quality keyboard tray keep looking although i was pleased that the support bar and articulating arm were metal the tray itself is plastic it is a fairly sturdy plastic however the tray bounces up and down when you attempt to type do not pay more than 30 for this thing you would be better off making one yourself I am currently trying to return thisto the seller not amazon and I am having difficulty getting my money back i certainly do not want a replacement issued i do not want it at all definitely keep looking for a higher quality keyboard tray kensington has some nicer more expensive trays but after this one I am leery to buy a tray from them again my advice would be to look at the bush articulating keyboard tray still on the expensive side but appears to be of better quality,148,22
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,first a response about the hazlewood review that text should be added to the seller review the fact that the product is not the same pictured is not appropriate as the product review it is just that the seller shipped the wrong product duh anyway regarding the product itself i use this every day it is well made and sturdy i can put significant weight on it fully resting my arm on it and it fully supports it easily slides in and out from under the desk the slide mechanism is made of thick gauge metal,95,23
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,this is my first laser printer and at first i was very happy with it then the honeymoon ended first of all the toner cartridge is fitted with a smart chip so you can not refill it yourself this is in the opinion of many an illegal practice as it prevents you from using a third-party toner refill note that the 1250w previous model does not have this feature so you may be better off with that one do not ever try to use the duplex printing feature print on both sides of the 1350w if your document ends with an odd-numbered page the resulting output is misnumbered also do not do anything on your computer concurrently with printing as the driver has a very short attention span and forgets which page it is printing many one-sided pages emerge smudged on the reverse side paper feeding is fair but occasionally the printer stops with a jam message you must open the cover and look for a sheet of paper jammed inside but you will not find one honestly forget minolta and look elsewhere for real,184,0
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,warning this is a gdi printer therefore you can not set this printer to work on a home network using dedicated tcp / ip print servers that is d-link dp-301p linksys etherfast print servers and more as a gdi printer it does not have a builtin command processor in other words it is a host based printer relying on your pcs processor as the brains to process print jobs i made this mistake be forewarned do not buy this product if you wish to use it on a home network,88,1
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,this was a great printer as far as print quality and speed but what minolta does not tell you in advance is that if you either refill the cartridge or use a non-new or non-factory cartridge the printer goes into deep cleaning mode permanently while printing and slows down to about 6ppm it will not go back up to regular speed unless you install a new minolta cartridge this of course is a completely bogus excuse for forcing you to buy minolta toner which costs 130 i called tech support to confirm that there was no workaround and the woman i spoke with had received 4 complaints that morning on that issue so i sent it back and bought a samsung ml-1710 which although a little bit slower 17ppm instead of 21 can use any toner and seems like an excellent little printer,141,2
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,I have worked in a print shop with lots of high end laser printers and i have to say that the low price of this little thing had me thinking twice toner seemes reasonable to replace i print 50 to 500 pages at a time at home and jet printers were killing me for b w printing you can not do anything but be surprised at the quality and speed clear crisp even with a photo was a bit confused at the instructions for putting in drivers but worked it out easily hooked up quick and i was off and running in 10 minutes reasonable all around could not be happier,106,3
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,i work at an office supply retail store where i sell printers all day long we ran a sale for this printer for 65 and for the price i could not pass on it what other reviewers have said about the page limits is correct it will slow down when the counter has reached the page limit however if your cartridge drum and toner is in good condition you can very easily find replacement chips and a bottle of toner at any online auction site i got a 6000 page chip with toner for a total of 22 after shipping so printing with this is almost free about 1/3 of a cent per page in toner costs the quality is not the best on the black and white laser market but for just a basic laser printer it does the job well,140,4
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,a cnet reviewer tested this and discovered that it is output tray could only handle 10 pages and then the pages went everywhere i wish i had known that i would never have bought it consider this it prints 21 pages per minute so you can only leave the printer for 30 seconds before you are in deep do-do and that is when the output tray is still on the printer mine broke in the first week and you can not repair it,80,5
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,i am using this printer for more than a year and so far seen no issues ppm is excellent i would hight recommend this printer,25,6
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i hate this printer it tells you the cartridge is low when it is not and the paper guide never stays on so i have to take a page off one at a time i can never leave this printer unattended,40,7
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,the printer installed fine under windows xp and small text looks ok but pictures and large text are very streaky pages often print a little crooked even although the paper looks aligned ok in the feed chute when it prints it almost always feeds in extra sheets no matter what type of paper i use and this often leads to jams on documents over 5 - 6 pages or so it will dump paper eveywhere because the receive tray is so poorly designed does not matter how i adjust it not to mention the toner limit of 1500 pages and the new toner replacement for 6k pages costs as much as the printer i made a big mistake buying this printer and will buy a different make once the toner runs out konica-minolta should be ashamed for creating such a low quality printer,141,8
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,although the printer requirements list windows98se as the minimum oldest operating system this printer will install and work just fine in windows95 if you are using a parallel port lpt1 the windows98se or newer requirement comes in if you are going to use usb i bought this for my sisters older system that she just uses for e-mail and some web surfing look around for an active rebate that cuts the price nearly in half,75,9
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,i got around installing the annoying software by installing it using the windows printer installer it will ask for a file location goto the driver directory on the cd find your language and windows version and select the only file that shows up only the printer driver is installed no other popups or crap is installed on my pc it is a fast printer and great for personal use,69,10
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,i purchased this printer through an office supply store and am quite unimpressed with it is output the printer will suddenly start giving errors such as fatal laser unit error causing the printer to sieze and need to be restarted and this was only after 10 months of light usage a total of 2700 pages were printed from it the toner cartridge and it is connection can at times also be a bit faulty in that it uses the toner despite being on save mode like a sieve just not a good investment overall,92,11
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,the printer worked well for a short time after the toner was empty i tried using a guaranteed remanufactured toner refill it did not work very well so i tried another guaranteed toner refill i refused to pay more for a toner cartridge than the printer cost the second toner smeared everywhere and did not print a new konica-minolta cartridge did not fix the problem and konica minolta refused to service the unit even although it was under warranty save your money,79,12
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,I have had this printer for a few months and it has been flawless in operation the sheets coming out of the printer did tend to fall out like another reviewer said until i figured out that the support for the outbound pages was not fully extended the printer status message does appear on start-up but it is a very minor irritation other than that it is a gem i just refilled the toner cartridge with a generic refill for about 20 and it works ok the internal chip has hit it is limit and the printer is now operating at 6 ppm which is ok for my limited home use 6000 page aftermarket chips are available now for about 10 to correct this they are easy to change so if you are willing to do a little work toner can be pretty cheap,140,13
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,so I have been using the printer on and off for personal use i estimate i have printed about 200 pages of items the last print out was fine no fainting of ink and and more that would hint that the toner was low but minolta does not care about that it sets it is toners to stop working and gives an error message first of all the error message is of no help you need to research what it means via the website as for the online status bar it does not tell you anything except there is a communication issue argh what a ripoff to summarize pros prints well cons status page worthless and confusing error message confusing and toner set up is a rip off,123,14
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i wish amazon gave the reviewer a no star option i appreciate the speedy printing of thisbut that is all also that is not saying much since it was my first new printer in several years and i had missed several generations of speed first problem i find that the top paper-holder that is suposed to keep the pages in order while they come out does not pages end up falling over the front of the front of the machine so that you have to pay extra close attention to make sure you catch all of them and that they are in order bigger problem is that it jams a lot and it is very difficult to pull the paper s out it has a vice-grip on the sheets so that you end up tugging and wripping the paper then the area where the tornis is too small to fit fingers into to manipulate there are not enough removeable parts to aid in paper extraction do not biu tjos [ romter i think it is an example of you usually get what you pay for,184,15
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,I shall get right to the point the printer is going to cost you a bundle to replace the carterage which will cost about 80 after a few months it jams a lot do not make the mistake i made and buy it from staples on sale for 99 your better off buying a dell printer for 200 also the paper tray is outside and jams a lot i got so upset that i took this printer lifted it up and threw it to the ground and broke it after it kept on jamming again and again for my business i have a dell printer it almost never jams do not be cheap and stay away from this piece of garbage,118,16
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i bought this printer about a month ago at staples for about 100 dollars it worked fine at first good print quality but it soon began misfeeding papers this thing is pretty tenacious about holding on to stuck papers so removal means shredding into tiny pieces from several angles and hoping that you will not miss any and that you do not get burned a few days ago after several paper jams in a row it froze up it is still frozen i use this for my work and now I am stuck just like the papers the machine keeps eating my previous printer was a hewlett-packard laserjet 1100 and i never had a single problem with it during the years i used it not one paper jam ever nada it was not compatible with my new laptop unfortunately to sum up please buy a different printer,141,17
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,setup is okay printer instalation is fairly easy if you have multiple usb ports that is usb001usb002 be careful to select correct one printer is very fast and quality on text is good have not tried graphics yet toner saver mode prints to light to be of much use printer is slightly noisy because of constant runnning fan suggest leaveing it off when not in use i paid less than 100 for it at that price it is great if your paying over 12000 go with the brother 1440,86,18
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,i would not buy thisagain there is no screws to hold the shelf together only pegs that you have to glue in and it was the worse thing ever that i had to put together not happy with it at all,43,0
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,it can be picked up at staples store but around 50 or above it is light and stable i am satisfied,20,1
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,i ordered this sorter and it arrived in a little flat box what the website does not tell you is that it comes completely unassembled and they send you about a dozen wooden pegs and a little tube of glue and a bunch of teeny tiny nails to hammer on the very flimsy cardboard backing i decided to ship it back it was not worth my time and effort to go through this for such a piece of junk i will say that the lady i spoke with at amazon was very sweet and kind and treated me very nicely through the whole phone call but amazon needs to let folks know that thisneeds a ton of assembly,119,2
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,for the price of thisi was disappointed to find that the shelves were made out of cardboard not what i was expecting for the price,27,3
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,4.0,positive,i ordered this for my boss so that we can use this in our copy room,16,4
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,it would have been more cost effective to purchase the all cardboard one sold at staples,16,5
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,we use these at work and i knew that this would be just what i was looking for great for keeping things separated at first they may seem flimsy but after you get it together and let it sit it becomes very sturdy it really worked out well for what i needed very very pleased and it was shipped very fast,61,6
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,the dividers were made out of very thin cardboard as we were putting this together the flakeword mailbox cracked and i could not even use it very disappointed in this product for the amount of money instead i bought a cardboard mailbox for 800 and it is made much better do not buy this product,53,7
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,i really like this product it has only one drawback and that is the glue that comes with it it is inadequate in amount in it is ability to dry quickly and in it is bonding power i have a lot of experience in these boxes by fellowes because I have purchased many of them over the years for the resource room where i work with students who have learning disabilities i got two 24 compartment sorters and had the same problem but the good news is that it is fixable all you have to do is purchase an epoxy glue and you will find that it bonds quickly securely and you have enough of it to go around i also recommend driving 2 small nails into each end of the sorter to strengthen it while the epoxy sets up with those two caveats this is a great product and well worth the money get the epoxy and the nails or you shall be wishing you had not ignored this caveat,165,8
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,the shelves are cardboard the thing comes in parts that get put together with glue and thedoes not match the picture looks like something out of the 70s,28,9
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,thewas broken in two and had been used and returned the pre drilled holes had been srewed into them and broken on the sides of the holes so you could clearly see that someone had tried to assemble it and must have returned it,47,10
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,the shelf broke before we even had it assembled the shelves are made of cardboard not wood or even laminate very disapppointed do not buy this one,26,11

Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,I am a teacher and handling paper is always a chore with this product my students can turn in their papers in alphabetical order which reduces my paper-handling tasks substantially,29,13
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,4.0,positive,i got thefellowes 25400 12-section compartment sorter melamine laminated medium oak laughing out loud medium oak not full oak i was thinking it was all wood it is not the shelves are cardboard however it is a vary nice cardboard and was vary strong with the plastic supports on front of the horizontal card board shelves the assembly was some what ez for me but i am good at that all in all it is strong after assembly and looks good once you get past the vary nice looking cardboard the price is also the lowest you can get and not get something that is made of all cardboard,107,14
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I have had the printer for two weeks I am in the process of printing invitations and have gone through two ink cartriges of bothand black i am priting only about 40 cards on both sides yet i used up the ink cartridges in one sitting i did not even finish rinting them at over twenty dollar each it is not a cheap printer to use the low price of the printer does not make up for the high cost of running it,81,0
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,mine has lasted longer than any printer i have ever had they all seem to get clogged eventually but not this one works great does not need ink as often as others say nut it is not an office printer just for casual usage mine last more than 8 monthsyup,48,1
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,i got this printer handed down from my mom i will have to say it is a good little all-in-one printer i would not say it is the fastest printer in the world but for my needs it works fine for being a home printer the scanner is really good and has clear crisp images once again hp never ceases to amaze me i would buy again,64,2
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i have had this printer for a few years now and am very happy with it for the 80 or so paid for it and myself and two teenage boys using it it has worked great for all our needs pictures school papers copies and more as for the ink i always get the refills from cartridge world where i can get both for under 20 and they usually last a few months,72,3
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i had this printer for about 1 1/2 years only and it already broke down i was never happy with the software it comes with it is cumbersome overloads your computer with heavy code that is unnecessary freezes all the time and takes a whole lot of time to install and i have a decent 18ghz cpu 1 gb ram computer i just wanted something that allows you to scan and print this is my 2nd hp printer first one was also a multifunctional and was also frustrated with the software i decided to go for another hp to give them another chance but now I am convinced will never buy a hp again,110,4
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i purchased my hp 1410 a few days ago and i am delighted with it i owned an hp 1210 a few years ago and kept it until i wore it out and really liked it so i got the next best thing i like it because the computer is not needed to just make text copies or printing pictures for the money i do not think one can find a better little printer and it does not take up much desk space at all i am so glad i found it and at a less expensive price regards hl ragan greenville texas,102,5
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I have had the printer for some time now and i agree with everyone on here who mentioned how fast the ink goes in bothblack but what really makes me mad is that the printer jammed one time and now it is busted when i went to print in sucked in all the paper and now it does not work thanks for making this in china like everything else that is made there it is junk,73,6
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,when the cartridges are replaced the machine automatically runs a test page fair enough however for some time now it runs the test page every time it is turned on on tech assistance web sites many others report the same problem forget hp tech support this machine is a cartridge-eater avoid,51,7
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,everything is designed to be an inconvenience every time you turn it on a full page test print is done and wastes ink it prints horribly fails consistently and is awkward to use in every respect it jams and does not feed correctly print processes will hang endlessly stay away no matter what,52,8
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,a printer is a printer i am more impressed with the editing of scanned pictures i scanned pictures from 20 years ago and they look like new pictures the image editting software is easy to use i quit using the software that came with my computer and the software that came with my camera i only use hps software now,60,9
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i bought this printer around mid 2005 it worked well printing and scanning my usage is very low i print a few pages a month and maybe scan a few pages a month some time ago the scanner just stopped working all scanned pages came blank i tried to contact hp support but they could not fix it concluding that i should exchange my all-in-one with a new one i bought an hp because i thought it would be a relable printer for a long time now i am stuck with an all-in-one that can print and not scan,102,10
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i have had this piece of garbage for over a year shame on me for keeping it you get what you pay for noisiest clanking and banging back and forth i have used more ink just resetting this so called consumer best buy just try and print out an envelope i have tried to allign after each new cartridge and i get error cartridge stuck or page did not finish printing i hope this machine is outdated and would not recommend this to anyone save the money frustrated in jersey,84,11
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,i have nothing negative to say about this printer it works perfectly and i have had no problems it is quiet and much quicker than my last printer so i am happy my ink runs out fast but that is because my 8 year old seems to think she has to print everything she sees [ ] just wanted to pass this info because i am sure there is someone out there that appreciates saving money as much as i do,80,12
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is easy to set up and use for the person who uses it every now and then,19,13
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the psc 1410 is simple and easy to use but it has the smallest capacity 5 ml print cartridges I have ever seen be prepared to buy new ink cartridges every week,34,14
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,i have not been having any trouble actually using the printer however it goes through ink very quickly the hp site reckons you will get apporximately 150 pages but i do not think it is anywhere near that i would be surprised if you get through 50 pages before running out of ink I am referring to black ink i try not to use the colour too much but it appears to be running out quite fast too if you want a printer that you can use fairly often say 10 pages per week then i would not recommend this,98,15
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I am not sure what to say about this it has been a very frustrating product for me after every page i print i get two errors one says that the ink cartridge cradle can not move and the other error says paper jam the paper i have in the tray is not jammed in i have looked repeatedly for any obstruction i even shined a flashlight inside and i am baffled as to what is causing the error no other printer has given me this much frustration i have sought help and even my sisters husband computer repair is his specialty is confused as to what the problem is i would not recommend this printer for anyone,116,16
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviewers comments about the ink cartridges hp has totally scammed their customers by putting so little ink in the cartridges required for this printer I have had this printer about six months and I have already spent more than the cost of the printer on ink and it needs more again my last printer was from hp and i was happy with it i got totally burned on this one guess what brand my next printer will not be,81,17
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,it is very simple to print in black and white and save theink for when you really want to use it pull out theink cartridge when you hit print you will have one button to push to tell the printer to print anyway and that is all there is to it since i print many pages of college level papers i find this printer to be so good that I am ordering a second one i broke the first ones glass by knocking a tv table into it but it still works the cartridges last a long time a person with no technology know-how whatsoever can use it me i admit it and the person who really knows computers will love it too i can not speak highly enough of the quality of the print and photographic work and the cartridges are available everywhere i got a free dell printer with my laptop but i want another hp also i can copy pages from books since the top can accomodate thick hardcover books,172,18
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,past inkjet printer died and i needed a new one fast and at a low price this fit the bill plus i could get rid of my old scanner to boot it seems to be printing and scaning fine and quility is good have not had it long enough to use all the options yet i have had it long enough to find so far the only draw back ink the cost of cartridges are a little steep,77,19
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,I have been using this multi-purpose printer for the past 6 months and i have not had any problems with it yet the print quality is good and scanning is decent but not as quick as some stand alone scanners,38,20
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is so good it has never let me down it has great graphic quality and will look just like the original if you scan,26,21
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the printer is not more than an ordniary inkjet and they changed the ink cartridge size to very small ones so you keep buying them it seems but the worst part of this printer is the software that goes with it if you want to install all the features be ready to let go of 780 mb of space that has to be bloatware incompetent programming if you choose the light version you will only need 384 mb of disk space how can this be i regret having bought this hp printer and it will be my last from them,96,22
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i got this printer actually the hp 1401 from walmart for 49 bucks a couple of weeks ago when i went on maternity leave since then i have printed over 100 christmas letters 4 lost dog posters including large pictures printed return address labels with graphics scanned my medical release from my doctor and emailed it to my work and printed tons of recipes this thing does it all i bought an extra ink cartridge under 15 bucks and still have not needed it great buy,85,23
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,this was a great buy for an all in one device i needed something at a decent price that could copy scan and print this was definitely it it came quicker than expected in the mail and it prints off copies really fast hooking it up was very easy too i recommend this for anyone looking into all-in-ones,58,24
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,I am a college student and i mainly use this printer to print out documents and photos so far so good i love the fact that this printer is very compact it is not like those humongous all-in-ones that not only are heavy but take up a lot of space this printer is as wide and as light as a regular desktop and prints pretty quickly i really love it i have absolutely no complaints,73,25
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,nice to have it all together in one package i will be out of luck if it fails service was excellent from amazon don maxwell,25,26
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,i was skeptical because of the price but I have been using both off an on for weeks now and have had no issues with either,25,0
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,i received the ink cartridges and the ink was beautiful for maybe 2 weeks and then thefaded to green and yellow and the black became grey striped i only printed maybe 4 - 5 pages and it started messing up i missed the note that is was re-manufactured i have been trying to call the company so that i can get a refund and i have left several messages but they have not returned my call do not purchase this ink cartridges from this company i want a refund,89,1
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,this product is certainly priced right for the remanufactured cartridge market but the quality of the ink transfer is a problem the best description of the issue is that for example with a laser printer if the toner is not fused to the paper it smears badly and in some cases can be wiped completely off the page with as much as a puff of breath this product is an inkjetthat does not require fusing since it is actually ink but even after a couple hundred pages having been printed the ink still smudges and is uneven btw all tests have been performed on the dell printer for which the cartridges are intended without any failures the alignment and nozzles are aok as well,126,2
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,they were either clogged or dried out or something they did not work nothing i did would fix them i installed them very carefully and followed the instructions would have been better off buying new ones,35,3
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,the remanufactered toner cartridges came in as expected they work great in my dell printer thanks,16,4
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,i ordered a set of dell ink cartridges from eforcity in january and when i received them thecartridge only printed in red and the black cartridge lasted for 2 pages of printing i was very dissapointed as i have ordered these same cartridges from amazon several times and they were great it took me 4 months before eforcity returned my money to me this is not good customer service i told amazon that i would never use their company again but my daughter changed my mind i can not blame amazon for one bad experience with a company so i am trying again through another amazon company to get my cartridgesas long as the cartridges do not come from eforcity i will try one more time,127,5
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,not a drop from either theor black and white huge waste of money and time,18,6
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,everything looked good when i opened the box however after installation in dell 720 printer the black cartridge would not work correctily i bought two sets for these and neither of the black worked theworked just fine do not know if i just got bad cartridges,47,7
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,those dell to529 and to530 - 2pack-blackink cartridges that i has ordered only used for 4 pages copies and than all the lnk is gone and fainted can not come up and shown up any works on paper those inks can not be use any more totally unused therefore i rated idont like it,55,8
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,it was certainly much cheaper to buy these from amazon than dell but i have to say that the ink takes longer to dry once it is printed out it smears even if just another piece of paper prints out on top of it i will still order it again although it is fine in every other aspect,57,9
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,very pleased with thecartridge however the black cartridge has streaks in the printing i cleaned it according to the printers instructions several times but this made no difference anything i try to print in black is streaked and unreadable so i am displeased with this product because of this flaw,52,10
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,thecartridge was good with true colors the black cartridge printed ok i would recommend to my friends as well,21,11
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,worked fair for a short time butphotos are streaked and not sharp would not buy it again going back to dell,23,12
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,my black ink cartridge was not working when it arrived and this company went above and beyond to fix my order,20,13
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,this ink worked great in my dell a920 printer and at that price i stocked up and bought 3 black and 3cartridges,24,14
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,it worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month I am so exasperated a previous panasonic cordless phone i had was muffled for the person i was talking to apparently with this phone they can hear my clearly but i can barely hear a word they are saying sometimes it is really hard to hear and other times it is downright impossible either way terrible it is like having your tv on volume setting 1 you can hear there is some kind of faint noise but you just can not make out anything being said,99,0
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,this phone has every feature i was looking for and alot more too it is very simple to set up and is user friendly i love it,28,1
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,the unit provides crystal clear phone service in conjunction with a dsl and wifi system it does what it says it does it is well worth the price,28,2
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,phones work just like they are supposed to my wife wishes they came with clips so you could carry them around the house or yard while doing other things overall a good value,33,3
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,excellent clarity user friendly for programming does not have capability for receiving messages,13,4
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i used this phone once and put it back in it is annoyingly complex packaging for return to start the handsets are poorly designed on my first call i twice hung up on my callers since the off button is located exactly where you would rest the phone against your cheek besides this two of the three handsets had communication problems with the base even when they were in direct sight of the base such that they could not maintain a constant dial tone and kept cutting out,87,5
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i recently purchased the four handset version of this system and am very pleased with it all of the features are convenient and work well and the voice quality is very good one feature i especially like is that it can store up to 50 names and phone numbers in each handset and once programmed in one handset entries can easily be tranferred to the other handsets if desired another convenient feature is that the system can be used as an intercom with each handset capable of calling each of the other handsets this is the most complete and most convenient phone system I have ever had and i like the quality and reliability of panasonic products note however that this model is just a versatile cordless phone system and does not include an answering system this feature is included in model kx-tg5633 which also has all of the features discussed above,151,6
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,we have always considered panasonic phones and their other gear to be first rate but the volume on these phones even with all possible boost applied is much too low other reviewers on the target website have noted the same we have returned them for a set of well-rated uniden phones from amazon and are hoping for better results it is good that amazon has a fair return policy that makes this kind of disappointment less annoying,75,7
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i can not believe that this panasonic 58 ghz can not hold a candle to the verizon 900 mhz i gave up for this phone i could not hear my party at all buzzing noise horrible stay away from this phone returning today,41,8
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,this phone has it all as far as features as long as you do not want to actually hear the people you are talking to worked good for about a week and then could not hear anyone buzzing and sounded like people were standing next to an electric tower i tried several ways to fix the problem once i went back to my uniden 24 ghz i could hear great save your money,71,9
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,number entry from the handset keypad does not work properly this evidences itself in 2 ways 1 long phone numbers such as international do not dial properly 2 keypad activated programs like prescription refills do not recognize the numbers otherwise the phone worked fine except the handset volume was very weak even with the enhancement turned on but the number entry problem was extremely frustrating and a major issue for me i returned the phone and bought a uniden which seems to work fine,84,10
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,this phone has no back light on the key pad you can not see the key pad if you have to make a call in the middle of the night and or darkness this is a big deal panasonic phones used to have back lit key pads also you can hear a back ground buzz or white noise sound while you are on a call you and your callers will think i can not hear you now poor design,76,11
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,the phones work great no problems at all reception is excellent i would reccommend,14,12
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this phone was exactly what i needed i wanted a phone without an answering machine to put on a wall outlet i wanted at least 1 extra handset that did not need to be plugged into a phone jack with this phone i got an extra one lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones you can even assign different colors and rings to different callers one thing i do not like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from there are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone i have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and have not had a problem with either one the phone is pretty easy to program but i did have to read the instruction booklet,143,13
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,super if you have any type of interference from your computer dial up conection this is the phone to have even if you do not this phone is easy has great options love it absolutly no problems,37,14
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i love my phone it has all of the features i wanted and more the sound is also great i could not be happier,23,15
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this cordless phone has the best reception of any cordless telephone we have previously owned so far we like the feature of conference calling between three handsets the paging option for the handsets is another great feature to page another handset during a call to include another person in the conversation or to contact another person near one of the other handsets instead of yelling down the stairs the flashing lighted ring around the top of the antenna makes it convenient to locate the handset in the dark when you are receiving a call,94,16
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,you can not go wrong with this phone I have always been a fan of panasonic phones I have still got 3 old panasonic cordless phones that just will not die pros feels solid and comfortable in your hands sound quality is good even at a good distance from the home base speaker phone is clear and callers can hear me well blinking light on antenna for voice messages black and greyis attractive and looks good almost anywhere in house cons i wish the keypad had a backlight when you scroll through calls the name and number are not on the same screen,102,17
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,lots of good featuresunfortunatly the most important feature of a phone is clarity and this phone system does not deliver hard to hear your conversations,25,18
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,after having tried two other systems i found this one really worked well the handsets are very functional and the sound quality is excellent the speakerphone capability has proved handy i did not think i would use the intercom feature much but it turns out to be very handy given it comes with three handets we put all throughout the house,60,19
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,where to begin very difficult to hear even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets programming is not as easy as many other brands those are just a few of my concerns I shall pick a uniden model next time,57,20
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i have had these phones for a week now and at first they worked great and one week later you can hardly hear the person on the other end this is my second set i returned the first set for the same problem n hopes that it was just bad phones but the second set is just as horrible do not waist your money,63,21
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,overall i really like this phone great features and more however like some of the other reviewers who have posted here my phone began buzzing almost immediately so badly that i could not hear the person on the other end they could hear me fine since i have digital phone service connected to my dsl modem i followed the owners manual tip and bought a noise filter this worked fine for about a week then the buzzing returned i bought another filter thinking the first one had crapped out but the buzzing persisted i even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment which was in perfect working order i was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone so after much frustration I am returning this to amazon today luckily it has not been 30 days since delivery yet beware when considering buying this unit,151,22
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i bought these phones on the recommedation of a family member and i could not be more thrilled these are the best phones that we have ever used the sound quality is unbelievable and they had all the features we were looking for i have to emphtically disagree with some of the other reviews on this page you will not be sorry with this product,63,23
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,have not had the buzzing problems people have written about very nice range and clarity,14,24
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,1 there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base 2 phone features worked as advertised but the voice enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse 3 it was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset i returned it mainly because of the buzzing,62,25
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,at first i thought this phone had everything and it is loaded with features and has a good range however after using it for about 5 weeks i now have a very very loud buzzing noise on all the handsets it appears to come from the base and it is so loud i can barely hear the caller i have tested this base on other jacks still same problem and i have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack and they work fine with no buzz I am convinced it is in the base unit of the panasonic phone but after multiple email customer service attempts at panazonic i have not yet heard anything from this company I am scrapping the phone and buying a much cheaper but more highly rated at t,133,26
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,toy maybe i never spend coins have not in years i save all of them bring them home and put them away my coin fund paid for a lot of outings when my children were young i have given this toy to a lot of adult friends it worked forever until i accidently knocked it to the flour my fault it was 10 years old and smashed to pieces but now i have a new one yea buy one for yourself or your children or your friends,87,0
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i just purchased two of these banks one for me and one for my 24 year old son both banks worth just great and efficiently i have had no problems with my unit it is extremely easy to retrieve a coin tube and place the coins into a wrapper there are more expensive units but i think that this unit which is a lot cheaper will work for the average person to avoid jamming the unit you do need to not flood the unit with coins this would be just asking for trouble which would not be the units fault this is the little bank that can,107,1
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,after i ordered this bank i was amazed at how quickly it arrived it replaces one i had stolen and is superior to the previous bank i am very happy with both it and the service,36,2
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this bank was purchased as a gift it has help motivate my child to keep track of his change he started using it right out of the box thanks,29,3
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this money mill bank is easy to use and it works well with any bank wrappers which is a money saver by itself i would recommend it if you do not have lots of coins to sort or if you do not need to do it very often i am pleased with this purcahse,52,4
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i purchased this for about 2000 and i followed the directions carefully despite that a coin slipped into the mechanism there was no way to remove it even although i tried that as carefully as possible i threw the device in the trash i did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins and i now separate coins by hand the advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins so you avoid counting them,81,5
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,my husband is very happy with this bank he had one for many years and when it wore out he purchased this one which is very similar to the one he had he gets free paper rolls from the bank and when the bank is full he rolls the coins himself,51,6
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i got this for my son and he did have fun with it but i spent a lot of time trying to unjam the coins from the mechanism as an actual coin sorter it stinks the number of coins or even the types of coins that end up in each roll is fairly inconsistent also it comes with a top to keep little fingers out of it but there is no way to keep the top on so my son got his finger caught by the rotating coin sorter once and was pretty scared until i could pry his finger out of it i would not reccomend it,107,7
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me,14,8
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,did not work motor would not work out of the box junk,12,9
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it is noisy and it needs tube wrappers not the flat type on the good side it does a fine job of sorting the coins,24,10

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,does not count the coins just keeps dropping them in the slots even if the wrapper is full,17,15
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,came in the mail all of the packages for the coins were smashed,13,16
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product the coins get lodged in the top do not flow into their correct coin slots and uses the batteries like crazy i spent more money on replacing battering by using it the first day then the cost of this product it works better tothe coins in their respective coin slots up to the fill line and there is your counting process very disappointed in this product,73,17
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,like it but it does not stay down on the first try,11,18
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,cheaply made and the latch system sux it broke the first time i tried it it is definatly not worth the money should be ansold in dollar tree,29,19

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,not as good as the old one without push to start but still does the job,16,23
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it did not sort the coins effectively the coins often dropped down inside of the sorter frankly I had like to return it for a full refund and maybe try another sorter,31,24
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,the money coin sorter is great but had one problem the dime cylinder was too small at the base to accept the wrapper i tried several different ones as i had a previous coin sorter that finally broke after 10 years i called the company and their customer service department sent me a new cylinders for all the coins and the new dime one works awesome company magnif that makes this product,72,25
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,fun way to collect change entertaining to watch the change go to the correct coin holder,16,26
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,eh it is alright jams a lot plus it is hard to get the paper rolls at the right height,18,27
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,terrible box open pieces fell out not usable,8,28
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i bought one of these coin sorters in a yard sale and it finally gave out coins would not roll down the track so i purchased this one worked fine tested with coins dropping into the proper coin tubes my old one was auto start / stop and this one has a switch in the rear inconvenient but not a real issue however when i went to insert the preformed wrappers that came with the unit into their tubes the penny and dime wrappers will not fit the bottom of the tube tapers some probably to make it easier to insert in the machine but too narrow for the wrapper to go all the way into the tube top sticking out about 1/2 i tried with some other wrappers that i had and they had the same problem so i really can not recommend you buy this unit that said I am keeping it because i still have the tubes from my yard sale machine and I am using them instead,166,29
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it comes in very handy to count change,8,30
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this is a simple but automatic sorter works on batteries occasionally does not sort a coin and the coin slips down behind the scene when this happens you just turn it upside down and the coin s slide out for an uncomplicated sorter that works 90 of the time it is just the ticket,52,31
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the plastic is very thin and can break easy i had to re order another one because the original came in pieces broken all over the place the way it was shipped but the product was completely ruined as of the product itself it is ok not all that great coins get stuck even if you put a couple coins in at a time,63,32
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,nice unit do not overload except for that all works fine,10,33
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,gave it as a gift broke down during very first use he only inserted a couple of coins so we did not overwork it must just suck would not ever buy again,31,34
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,unfortunately i never got the chance to fully utilize this product it arrived with a huge crack down the side so i returned it and found a better sorter for my money i think that the plastic used is not the best quality unless i just had some very abusive delivery person however from what i could tell the hopper seemed pretty small i do not think it is meant to process s lot of change at once,76,35
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,great counter used it everytime i came home with pocket change had it for over 15 years but the sorting disk now slips on shaft only changed batteries 2 - 3 times in that time will jam if too many put in only negatives is lack of overflow area and if coin tubes fill up and are not emptied coins can back up chute into inside of machine making retrieval difficult,69,36
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,did not work at all coming out of the box it is crapp being returned,13,37
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this is actually a no star rating very disappointed failed on the first attempt tried again and again it failed this product should be discontinued do not buy,28,38
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,new and improved from the last money mill i had for 15 years do not put paper coin wrapper in tube i do not know why they show to do that just fill plastic tubes remove it and slip paper coin wrapper around coin and tap it down forcing coins in alignment it is so easy i like the new power button and wider tray on top,62,39
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we leave this on the kitchen counter so i like it cuz it does not take up a lot of room easy to use,23,40
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,did not last through three loads was surprised because it did not look as cheaply made as the others kinda sad but will keep looking for a decent one,27,41

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,reliable a simplified version of a very similar coin sorter i used for years,14,43
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,do not buy this it is bad you are better off counting by hand,13,44
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the penny papere does not fit in the tube the coins get caught easily not worth the money,18,45
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,a replacement unit figuring it out but looks like a keeper,11,46
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,brand new batteries machine stopped working after 4 minutes returned the next day,15,47

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,if you keep your change and take it to the bank this it is for you,15,50
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,nice dealgets bumped in shipping needs more insulation outside box ok but once you open the product box it shows signs of pressure the lid on one of the banks this time was cracked,32,51
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,pretty crumby quality for the price i paid,8,52

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i had another one and loved it works great,9,56
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i got the money wrapper and the coins shoot out when i use it i have to manually put the coins in each slot pissed me off it is to much of a hassel to return it,36,57
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,do not buy it i had about 15000 in change to count and roll took a few days because i had to stop so often when it says it only can manage 1 to 10 coins it is not kidding it jams up alot i said it will be good to keep by my night stand so when i empty my change it will not be much so i ll use it like that still jams you have to stop remove tubes and shake it upside down to get coins out it is disappointing but when you only pay about 20 bucks you get what you pay for on the up side it is better than nothing,113,58
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the change keeps getting caught in the middle of the machine and i need to turn it upside down to get it out also the dime wrappers do not fit in the dime slot,33,59

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this is piece of junk avoid buying this jams incessantly after just a few coins save your money also the dime tube will not hold standard dime paper tubes it is too small,33,61
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it arrived with a broken case that was broken in several places it was disappointing because i had saved up a lot of change for my twin boys to put in and sort i could assemble in and hold the pieces in place with several rubber bands but it is not a long term solutions,55,62
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i bought this machine and two to three weeks later it broke the mechanism stopped working i was a little late in reporting the problem but i expected better customer service from gohastings i have to go and order another but it will not be from gohastings very disappointed,48,63
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,not happy with it first thing is the description says it includes 1 coins so i bought wrappers and it does not have a slot for 1 coins the slots fill up before the wrapper is full when take the wrapper out of the slot it does not add up to the full amount per denomination pay a little more and do not make the mistake ordering this like i did,69,64
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,does not have an automatic coin sorter but has to be manually turned on my old one turned on when i dropped in coins i like my oldone better but this one does work,34,65
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,came used and broken repackaged with scotch tape,8,66
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i received a money wrapper coin sorter as a gift it worked well for a few months then began experiencing problems money slipped into the sorter and i had to get it out finally the battery died and i replaced it three times it would not turn at all i called customer service left my phone number twice and they never returned my call sorting by hand is a lot easier our use walmarts sorter it is free,74,67
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,works well but did not come with a lid as pictured,11,68
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,no power to actually sort coins it bog even with new batteries i wished i had done something else,19,69
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,the on off switch fell off the first hour amazon was great about giving me the ability to return it wish someone could recommend a really good coin sorter,29,70
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it arrived defective a critical operating lever had never been placed in the machine,14,71
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,have one myself and bought one as a gift very helpful to have,14,72
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it does the job for me and then some i follow the directions because i do not like my things breaking feed it a few coins at a time and it works the tubes do not fit the exact amount of change the cardboard tubes are counted for but i took the time to double count after filled all you have to do as add 1 nickel after it is full in the tube an the pennies dimes and quarters all add 3 after filled in the machine I am okay with this for 23 I am happy plus I have got a lot of ready coin rolls for the bank,105,73
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this one replaced a prior money wrapper which i had for many many years our grandson is the benefactor these days laughing out loud,21,74
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i had one of these in the past tried a different style i am back as this style sorts so much faster,22,75
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this is a nice little sorter for someone who just wants to dump their change from their pockets when they get home from shopping and more it does get stuck if you drop a handful of change in at once need to drop the coins in slowly just a few at a time it is fine for my needs i am happy with the product,66,76
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,listen to the negative reviews this sorter jams mostly because the coins can not generate enough momentum to roll down the chute towards the containers i only had this for a month before it started jamming because the sorter is essentially one piece i could not take it apart to clean it to see if this would help i had no choice other than to buy another one save yourself the 20 and look elsewhere,76,77
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,I have been saving loose change for a long time and the time it takes to sort it out and count out the number required to fill a coin wrapper takes a good while this money wrapper coin sorter makes all of this so easy do not have to put all change in a wicker basket any more just put it in the coin sorter and it is all done saves time and money,74,78
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it arrived with a piece of the housing broken off and inside the machine i decided to keep it since it was not interfering with the mechanism the coin sorter does work but an occasional coin will drop into the wrong receptacle so using the sorter with wrappers is not a goodif you have to fish out the odd coin,61,79
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,when i opened the amazon box the box for the coin sorter was somewhat mangled and i was immediately concerned this was a gift for my teenage son and he did not care about the condition of the box and was excited to start using the sorter however it was impossible to try out given that the on / off switch was broken through the clear smoked plastic you could see the on / off switch shoved back inside the machine with no way to pop it back out i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 only because my son really likes theof it sure seems like we received a sorter that someone else had already returned and no one fixed,119,80
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i have this the instructions are not clear it feels cheap and i still have not gotten this thing working i am not exactly wanting to either as i feel it will fall apart,32,81
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,thiswas broken when i received it the start stop button on the side was loose inside the product and chips were missing or broken on the top of the container i had one like it that lasted well over ten years this one was very cheaply made,49,82
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,awesome it is so helpful and we got what we needed has made our lives easier i would recommend this100,23,83
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it did come with a crack in it but it is ok for the use we need thanks for your survey,21,84
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i have had one of these for awhile now first the motor went out and now coins fall into and get stuck in the middle of the counter i would recommend to pass on this one,36,85
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it is hard to place the coin wrappers in the tubes it is also hard to get the wrappers out of the tubes the top of the device was cracked on the top a piece of plastic fell off when it was taken out of the box,45,86
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,easy to use and does just what you want a sorter to do came promptly and works great a good acquisition,21,87
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,unfortunately despite it is attractive design useful to see when it jams it jams way to often at least you can remove the top and coin holder turn it upside down and clear it out again and again,37,88
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we bought this product to replace one my dad had by money machine that was many years old it is basically the same product but for a bit less money except for one thing the original machine had a button to push to make it spin when you put the money in this one has a switch which is either on continuous spinning or off when it says it comes with coin wrappers it does 1 of each type but banks will not accept wrapped coins any more because of too many people filling them with slugs so no matter we bought a second one for our boys ages 5 and 7 to learn math money sense they love it the product is durable unless you drop it the reason we needed a replacement in the first place,138,89
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we had an older model of this bank and liked it very much this version iss even better it has an on / off switch and works very well,26,90
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,nothing i would spend money on constantly jamming up tried different ways to use constantly jamming and drop coins inside unit,21,91
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this product works very well i hope it lasts because we have had a few of them and they do not hold up,23,92
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought this as a gift since i already have one i knew it would be good as i expected it was up to standard on quality everything was as it was described and works really well the person i bought it for can not stop telling every one how much they like it and use it i will definitely buy another as a gift in the future,68,93
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i sent it back the same day it arrived because it was broken the box it was mailed in was not damaged the product box was open and a medium size piece of the plastic at the top of the sorter was broken off and inside of thethe on / off switch was in the bottom of the box since i could not use the sorter i can not give it a true star rating,75,94
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this coin counter has helped me tremendously in the past few months turning a project that would have taken months into a project that has only taken weeks and i have already started on another project with this coin counter i have counted almost 1000 in just a couple of months i highly recommend this product,56,95
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it is made so poorly not like the one i had for 10 years too much of a hassle to return and get new one,25,96
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it was exactly like the one i have and we are going to use this new one as a gift,20,97
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the machine jammed because i put too many coins in too fast i found it easier to sort out the coins and then fill the plastic tubes by hand i had over three hundred dollars in coin if i dort the coins at he end of the day i can run the machine,53,98
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,my old coin sorter had an automatic sensor when you dropped in the coins it started automatically to sort and distribute this new model works great as well except it has a manual slide switch to turn the motor on after you drop in the coins it was not listed with the switch as an option and there was no mention of the switch on the advertisement it is not a big deal except now you have to wait for the coins to go thru and then manually shut it off where before with the automatic motor sensor you could drop the coins and walk away not that i did but i could be doing something else within hearing distance just to make sure it shut off,126,99
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,machine works pretty good but still have to count coins as it misses one here and there still it helps to count many coins fast,26,100
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,works well but is a bit noisy then in motion from the battery operation i thought that the old model was quieter but this never jams like the old one,30,101
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,first let me say that iv bought 3 of these prior to this one and i am happy to say that this one worked exceptionally well the money was sorted very quickly but the only problem is that the quarters nickles and dimes never dropped into the plastic holders thankfully i had extra containers from the old ones I had bought and i switched old containers with the new it seemed the new containers holders of coins were not held tightly in their stationary holder instead of asking for another bank i was happy to find something that worked other than that i absolutely love it,106,102
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i just used my coin sorter and it broke within the first 2 mins sorry i purchasedwould not recommend,22,103
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,we have had this model of coin sorter for fifteen years or more and i dropped it so we had to buy a replacement i was glad to see they were still around when the grandkids were small we used to collect our change and deposit the rolled coins into bank a account for them now that they have grown we just keep collecting and rolling coins to deposit into our own account it is surprising how fast your pocket change adds up,80,104
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,takes a handful of coins and disperses them rapidly older model did not have on / off switch was on always highly recommend,20,105
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,money wrapper coin sorter compact small accurate great for all the spare change coins add up to make dollars and more,20,106
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it will do the job if the coins dropped down slowly it could be jammed if too many in the compartment at once it is not 100 with coins dropped to the correct slots but mostly works it is still better then separate and wrapping coins by hands the battery compartment was already cracked and damaged when i receive it I am trying to get a replacement however the system does not allow me to do that the replacement option is grayed out and there has no way to contact the seller,88,107
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,no it is not top of the line but it is sufficient for emptying your pocket at the end of the day and sorting it out for you this is not a commercial coin sorter just a gadget to sort coins without sorting them yourself i like it and get comments from my wife all the time,56,108
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought this for a gift i did open the box and see that only 3 coin wrappers were enclosed i bought a bag of coin wrappers at the dollar tree,31,109
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it is a money sorter how much can you really say about it so far it is sorted things correctly and it has not broken,22,110
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,my wife enjoys this since it makes wrapping coins very easy all pocket change goes into a collection dish to be wrapped daily,23,111
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,the unit itself is ok have had one for many years 10 in fact they have changed no auto on / off no spring return on coin tubes packaging needs to be addressed no protection for top and bottom of box resulting in slight crack on unit does not effect performance,49,112
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,very satisfied with my purchase and was very satisfied with the time it took to receive the coin wrapper sorter,20,113
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i have hunted for this product for over 3 months i have purchased others and took it back eventually i got this one from amazon i had it before and now i have another one this is the one to get,41,114
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,although we carefully followed the instructions to pour in just a few coins at a time in the 2nd batch of 5 coins the machine gagged on a dime and became inextricably jammed disappointing since we once had a similar sorter that worked well for a long time,48,115
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,purchased thisto replace an old one which ceased to function this one was overpriced but available it arrived on time but it was in many pieces as it had not been packed properly the return policy was excellent and i received a refund very quickly i decided not to replace the bank,54,116
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,nerver did work got this for my husband how embarasingg to have him so very excited but then to not have it work he was so disappointed,27,117
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this was defective did not have switch it was bought and sent as a gift they did not keep the box or invoice,21,118
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i really like theof the money mill bank but after using it a few times i noticed a crack in the plastic all the way down one side and another one starting at the top where the lid fits if it did not break i would be very happy with it,53,119
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i am a waitress and i use a coin sorter everyday this is by far the best one i have used for the price just remember the slower you insert the coins you will prevent jamming i do not care if you buy the most expensive one they will jam if you throw in to much coin for the machine to handle do not hesitate to by this machine it works wonderful,70,120
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,bought this one to replace similiar one that i had used for many years but had quit working this one seems to be about same quality only complaint is that this one is not automatic so it does not start when coins are dropped in it has to be manually turned on if i had read ad carefully i would have known this when i ordered it but it is not a big problem this one will do fine,78,121
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this coin sorter sucks keeps jamming and does not sort properly spent more time unjamming it than it would have taken to sort by hand threw the device in the trash,30,122
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,just like it says as long as you do not drop more than 8 to 10 coins in at a time it works flawlessly paper coin tubes drop into the machines tubes nicely and it is relatively easy to see when it is full if you read the directions in sorting about 85 of random coins and jammed about 5 times mostly user error also known as impatient girlfriend but overall job well done one thing i will mention that is important if you do not notice when one coin tube is filled and keep loading coins they will all pill up in the chute and you will suddenly have a major problem then when you take the over-filled tube out you have coins falling down the chute and going everywhere again easy to avoid but you do have to pay attention a little overall good price and good purchase for the casual coin sorter,148,123
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i received andifferent from i ordered it was similar however i returned it and received a total refund,20,124
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this gadget is worth it is weight in coins all you do is drop the coins in the top turn on the motor and stand back while all the coins are sorted and dropped into cylinders ready to be packed into rolls,41,125
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it is very cheaply made and you have to put the rolls over the change after the money is sorted which can be difficult at times likely the wiring will be bad,31,126
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,i bought this coin sorter for my dad about 5 years ago he loves it it is probably one of the best presents I have ever given him he has been using it on a near daily basis ever since i got it for him and he has never had a problem it does great sorting out his pocket change,56,127
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this bank is very useful i have not experienced a coin jam it even has a switch if there is a jam and the coins will continue on to it is destiny the coin wrappers are so handy and makes it quite convenient when taking the coins to the bank this is a very good product,54,128
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,product is not made well at all battery cover can not have any weight on it or it will not work we have to put a small folded piece of paper under it on one side so that there is no pressure on battery cover then it will work what a pain,51,129
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this keeps jamming and does not sort properly too many coins end up in the wrong cylinder do not waste your money on this thing,23,130
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought my bank at a drug store about 6 years ago i had it sitting on a bookshelf to dump pocket change into everyday after work i never used it for mass sorting probably 2 dollars change at most i think over the years I have only used two sets of batteries i had to toss it last week and i am here to buy a second one i like another reviewer dropped it onto my tile floor and it did not recover well but i do take all of the blame the only piece that ended up broken seem to be the most important the rotator to send the coins down the sorting ramp but the motor still worked well,121,131
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i bought this money mill bank for my husband to help organize his change he used it for about a week but from the beginning the motor would get stuck on when nothing was in the bank sometimes it would shut off if we shook it but other times we had to take out the batteries to get it to stop running then my seven-year-old nephew played with it for a few hours repeatedly putting coins in sorting them all then dumping them and putting them all back through and it stopped working completely it would probably have been more worthwhile for us to get a slightly more expensive model that would be more durable,114,132
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,i had a lexmark 1120 and another one from the 1200 series i thought i would upgrade since those two served me well the fact is adown and work with all the features it promises severly disappointing it is designed to scan only one pages at a time i wished they advetised that so if i want to scan 14 individual pages i have to wait for every page to upload before i can do anything with the document this was not the case with the previous lexmark printer i couls scan more than one document at at a time i this case simpler is definatley better,110,0
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,just got my printer took about 30 minutes to set up just loaded the software and set up the printer then plugged it it it searched for my network and all i had to do was enter the network key no fuss no muss worked wirelessly first time print scan fax all wirelessly i love it,56,1
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,horrific every time i come home to visit my parents i spend half of the time trying to set up or re-set up this piece of junk the user guide is absolutely no help i was not surprised to see many other users having the same issues have never had this much trouble with my brother or canon products maybe you should look for an alternative there,67,2
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,if you want something to print do not buy this if you need something to drive you crazy and take up desk space it may be for you it works when it wants to and 9 times out of ten will not print something you really need printed even when the cables are directly connected to your pc the wireless is a joke and it uses up ink like crazy i will never purchase another lexmark printer and will be happy when i can throw this printer in the trash,88,3
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,I am using the all in one as we speak and figured I had warn the world why they should not buy this piece of garbage the good wireless prints double sided all in one decent printer the bad this is my third lexmark x6570 my company contracts with them so until they run out of these they keep sending me more of them the problem with this printer is simple poor design it swallows ink i do not even pay for my ink and I am complaining about how much ink this thing uses i have the settings on draft and it still goes through ink like no other now the ink i can live with because the prints are actually decent but the scanner and fax unreal anyone who has given this printer a good rating has not used the fax for more than a page these things jam everytime i thought mine was defective but after 3 it is the design trust me on this one your money is better spent elsewhere i have only owned lexmarks printers and this one is by far the worst,181,4
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,i thought this would be a great machine sadly the automatic paper feeder often jams and the ink yield is very very low i printed two tax returns and the cartridge is out of ink,35,5
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,i purchased one of these from walmart because it was cheap and had scanning and wireless built in what they fail to tell you is that the reason the printer is so cheap is because it will suck the rest of your money in ink cost this thing uses more ink than any printer I have ever seen no exaggeration i replaced both myand photo cartridges at the same time with brand new ones after printing 6 pages of business cards which btw would not print straight on the lexmark but printed perfectly on my mono hp laserjet the photo cartridge was empty 6 pages that is all you get folks nothing cheap about this printer except for the construction my only other complaint is the lack of driver support lexmark does not support linux / unix systems their recent linux driver sdk is a joke if you want good printing stick with hp they are the only ones I have found that can print well support everything and last forever,166,6
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,i bought the product because it is wireless and i can print from my living room to my home office however half the time i get problems communicating with the printer it tells me to unplug the printer and restart only 1 of the time does that work then i have to reboot my pc to get it to work other frustrating things is in the middle of a print job it will lose the wireless connection reboot again it has to be the worst printer i have ever owned for reliability just do not go there,97,7
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic product it performs perfectly and if some would simply read the manual and follow the menu you would realize that all supposed shortcomings are fixable you can change the number of rings till it picks up you can disable autoanswer you can tell it to scan after dialing so it runs like a normal fax machine great product you will not find anything from hp for this price with these features love the duplex printing module,79,8
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,in answer to all of you who own apple computers both my imac and macbook are on my wireless network the printer works flawlessly with both i have not had one bit of trouble with the lexmark wireless x6570 printer working on all of my computers both apple and pcs the software set up was easy on all of my computers you only have to hard wire the first computer on your network and the rest set up wireless i am not a technical person but i had no trouble setting up the printer no matter where i am in the house i can print out anything that i want to and go later to the office to retrieve the copies i am very happy with this printer which i have had for over a year i will not buy anything but lexmark printers,144,9
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,we have had the printer about a month now and it is been great I have used the fax scanner and printer functions including dual sided printing and it works like a champ i had problems with my previous hp printer the wireless has been a great feature too the only problem I have had was a slight glitch installing the software on one computer but the problem was with the previous printer uninstall program the program hp did not uninstall all of the driver information and i had to manually change the port settings on the computer the other 2 computers on my wireless loaded the software just fine also currently the place i buy printer ink does not have generic replacement inks for this printer,123,10
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,the lexmark x6570 all in one is everthing i was looking for quality all the way,16,11
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,even although the documentation says the printer supports macintosh it does not at least in wireless mode there is a problem with the software and lexmark told me outright that mac was not supported printer worked ok for a while but the cartridge life is very short and the cartridges themselves are expensive finally while trying to put a new cartridge in this morning the printer decided to align itself while i had the door open and it shattered one of the cartridge bays against the side printer is now useless junk,90,12
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,so far the only complaint i have is that to turn the power off when you shut down your computer you have to unplug the printer from the wall i have never owned a printer that when you push the power button does not turn it off do not know where lexmark is going with thisbut it lacks any logical sense to me,64,13
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,this is a nice printer loaded with features the fax capability over our normal phone lines works great this could be improved by making the number of rings befor the fax pick up user selectable wireless printing is great the scan function is somewhat troublesome in that it sometimes locks up but this may be an operator problem,58,14
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,this printer is sold at a great price and generally works fine however lexmark gives this printer away to stick it to you on the ink i used to replace the ink after about a month of use when it started warning me and then stopped printing then i found out how to bi-pass the warning and so far it has been three months with the same usage and even although the indicator says that my ink is empty my printout are as good as when the new cartridge was put into use this is very misleading and one could even say that lexmark is stealing a significant amount of unused ink from it is users,115,15
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,the printer has been great the duplex and auto feeder is a nice feature with no problems so far my two complaints however are the software that came with the printer trying to scan documents has not been easy with the software not giving much in the way of options the other complaint is that the wireless drops off and will not reconnect with my computer so i just keep it pluged in with the usb,76,16
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,overall this printer works well it does drop the wi-fi connection after extended period of non-use but i can deal with that the print quality is fair my biggest complaint which is leading me to get rid of this printer is that it drinks ink at an alarming rate from an economical stand-point the initial price is great but the ink costs are killing me this printer is as good as gone for me,74,17
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,the wireless setup worked like a charm i was printing from my wireless laptop to my wireless printer in no time but the honeymoon did not last long the printer cartridges ran out in no time i thought maybe the ones that came with the unit were not as full of ink as the ones that I had get from the store so i did not get to alarmed well i found out that the cartidges from the store were just like the ones from the printer box very short on ink intially if you did not know better you would think that there was something wrong with the ink cartridges but there has nothing wrong other than the typical manufacter ink scam except even worse if you print to any degree at all do not buy this printer,133,18
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,i find this a good printer but it does not explain the different functions associated with the printer also the troubleshooting information is no help at all other than that it is an ok printer,34,19
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,I have had this for about 4 months now used lightly but regularly mostly black and white love it i held off on buying a printer for a while because they are often more trouble than they are worth but this one went well above expectations everything works as expected although i have not used the faxing wireless secured is flawless and a great feature if you move your laptop within the house copying and scanning work great for my needs personal my favorite feature automatic double-sided printing hard to find feature and i have yet to see another company offer it at this price what a paper saver now i do not feel as bad when printing you have to change it is settings in xp in order to print both sides by default also i set the default to draft quality printing by default which saves on ink i have not had to replace the cartridges yet and the quality is fine for personal use the only con I have found is that the automatic paper feed has not fed in the paper in the couple of times that I have tried,190,20
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,these liquid chalk markers do not erase completely off the chalkboard therefore leaving a ghost shadow of the previous design would not recommend,23,0
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i got these markers to work on slate cheese trays and they are fantastic they are easy to write with in spite of being a broad tip and the add a bit of fun to the cheese tray the only drawer back is the white is very difficult to remove from the cheese trays so I have given up using that for a bit ofon the buffet table try these markers,71,1
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,not what i wanted they do not write on black dry erase boards,13,2
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,these markers write well but do not erase i do not suggest buying them,14,3
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,loved the bright colors very pleased for outcome will reorder as needed,12,4
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,nice colors but what has the point of chalkarkers if they can not be used in place of chalk they do not erase at all,23,5
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,these markers were awesome to begin with after about 2 weeks i noticed that a few of them were not writing as clearly as they should now after a month there are only 3 - 4 markers which actually work,39,6
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,it takes a lot of shaking to get these pens started but once done they work great used both on ideapaint and glass surfaces they write well erase easily and provide a nice compliment to dry-erase markers,37,7
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,alll pens arrived dry as a bone i would like replacements if this is ever read i have not had time to address this but the ink had dried out by the time they arrived,35,8
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,i ordered this for a menu sign specifically for the white was going to use the other colors for accents and i opened the box to find my 8 pack was only a 7 pack and the white was missing seeing as how that is the one i needed i will be sending this back now i have to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for them to receive it before i get refunded,76,9
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,most pens did not work dry only one did beware of this product it is cheap enough that i did not bother returning it,22,10
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,maybe I am the idiot for not reading the directions for using chalk but apparently chalk on a chalkboard is designed to be permanent love what you write or throw away your chalkboard you would think amazon would be more careful when selling a product,43,11
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,great markers however you need to know how to spart them so they work they do require quite a bit of shaking priming until the tip of the marker starts displaying someonce primed they work really well great vibrants colors which can be easily wiped off from the board,51,12
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,the first time they were used they worked well i followed all the diretions on how to keep them and they did not wrk consitantly would never buy them again,30,13
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,delivered on time great product liquid chalk is easy to use chiselexcellent only complaint is that it is too pricey,22,14
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,these are so awesome i just love drawing with them the ink comes out so smoothly and the colors look sharp and pretty can not say enough good about them,29,15
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,these work great they do not run the chisel tip gives you a nicer end to work with they last a long time great for my menu boards,27,16
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,out of the 8 markers only 2 work well i followed the instructions on all of them but i only get half of a line or after i press tip i get a glob of paint will write for money back,41,17
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,chalk is as advertised it works bright colors what more can you possibly say about liquid chalk one two three,20,18
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,we use these for menu-writing and they show up really bright and beautiful with a crispthey do not however erase from chalkboard paint they will come off reasonably well from the a-frame easel more shiny surface but are mostly permanent on the paint that said i will continue to use them and repaint because their finish is so bright,61,19
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,only disappointment is that not all colors show up on black i do not know if that was mentioned when i bought them or not,24,20
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,after numerous shaking and pressing i thought i iucked out and go the dud set but no it just takes a wee while or rather a long while to depress the ink the first time as soon as the liquid was flowing it all went well took a few efforts to get it looking the way i wanted but i am happy cleans of glass and mirrors easily too plus it looks great,73,21
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,these ruined our chalkboard we had used the chalkboard with regular chalk so it was not new it had been seasoned with chalk already and the special cleaner that is really a rip-off do not buy these unless you are writing a permanent message,43,22
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,these are nice colors and work well but tend to dry up really fast i felt like i wasted money on these,22,23
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,love the bright colors on my business chalkboard that i painted to display my pricing i have been able to succesfully remove by using a magic eraser as i do run monthly specials i need to change the message so far have been able to do that,47,24
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,the markers work great and will purchase them again i recommend them to whom ever would like nice smooth writing markers thanks,22,25
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,i love these chalk markers the bright colors are much more vibrant than chalk my customers notice my black board immediately,21,26
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,they do not last as long but there are diffrent colors and i am happy with them i had no problems with them not working like other reviews have stated,29,27
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,we use these markers at work for our special signs so twice a day every day they work well and write well for a while some of my coworkers press the tips too hard and ruin the tips but if you are gentle they are work really well we use black and green chalk boards if there are ghost shadows then we just wipe with rubbing alcohol and voila good as new I had recommend these but there are cheaper ones out there that work / last just as long,85,28
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,i had to use a mr clean magic eraser o get the marker off of the chalk board thewas great but not worth the time to clean the board they would be excellent if you wanted your words to stay up for some time,46,29
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i do menu boards for a couple of restaurants in town and these markers are great for permanent marker on a chalkboard with an authentic chalk look the marker tips wear down pretty quickly which was annoying a positive is that the colors are crisp bright and opaque you can clean this marker off after you make a mistake if you act quickly i keep a spray bottle and paper towels beside me while i work if you wait too long if you realize you have made a mistake a while later you can get the marker off but there has usually a ghost line where the chalk marker used to be after a few weeks of these chalkboards hanging it is almost impossible to get the marker off,126,30
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,bought these for use on some fabulous chalk boards that were made for a lobby these boards were made using chalk board paint the markers worked and looked beautiful until it was time to erase wet erase and it did not come off yikes do not purchase if you are planning to use them on something painted with chalk board paint period,61,31
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,liquid chalk is hard to get out to work with i have to keep pressing the tip down to get it to come out,24,32
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,works as advertized my wife loves to write with them we use them on our led board and they look outstanding thanks,22,33
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,greatbut the markers do not work as advertised it takes much more than a few seconds of pressing to get the ink flowing one marker arrived with a damaged tip another one is an almost translucentuseless on a black surface a third marker did not work even after many minutes of pressing when you can get the markers working the results are great not worth the effort in my opinion and not a kid-friendly product,79,34
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i love these for use in the classroom very fun and bright to use on the word wall i was disappointed when i used them on chalkboard paint but that is my own fault they are made for nonporous surfaces i am still using them on the chalkboard paint even although they can be a bit difficult to scrub off they are fabulous on smooth surfaces they do dry out with time if not used I have had mine for 2 months and had to work a bit to get the ink flowing again in a couple the tips do fray if used on a rough surface some colors white blue leave more ghosting than others overall i give these a thumbs up,124,35
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,we purchased this product to use on our office chalk boards and ended up ruining the boards after one use with the pens beautiful colors but beware,27,36

Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,thought the product itself looked nice but the adhesive holding it together is already separating on day one no way to contact seller except for returningwould be willing to keep it for a discounted cost can glue it myself,40,1
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,a beautiful leather-looking desk pad it was beautifully packed and shipped very well the pad is sturdy and reversible for long life on my desk which is glossy and slippery i needed to purchase some velcro to prevent the pad from sliding when i moved my laptop this is a purchase you will love,54,2

Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,I have had the pad for roughly 18 months and it is still quite functional i have not had any major problems as i gently use for my keyboard and mouse no mouse pad needed i really like the size on how easy it is to keep clean a simple wipe does the trick another thing i like about it is that it at least in my case is resilient to scratches scuffs and dents however the glue and stitching it poor is some areas especially when the humidity is high that being said it serves it is purpose very nicely,101,5
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,cheaply built filled with cardboard and split at the seams right away glued it back together and serves the purpose but way over priced,24,6
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,product is nice but the shipping packaging allowed one corner to get smashed up fortunately that corned can be hidden under my desktop speaker,24,7
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,for the price this is pretty much what i was expecting it does not look feel or smell like anything more than coated cardboard but serves the purpose just fine,29,8
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,matte black and great oversized option for a desk only complaint was it came bent on one corner i think due to packaging being not the best,27,9
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,the desk pad de-laminated size and surface were nice but the fact that fell apart would certainly prevent me from purchasing thisagain i returned theand purchased something different,32,10

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,more than half of these pens do not write,9,3
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,i like the colors that are included the coverage of theis good i wish there were a couple more yellows only one and a few more glitter pens i ordered this set in part so i could use the container as a storage container the plastic was more flimsy than i anticipated and after less than 20 uses the lid tore / broke this would not however prevent me from re-ordering this gel pen set again,77,4

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,half of the pens in this pack do not work at all very disappointed,14,9
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,these are great pens so far I have used them almost every day and so far no complaints the only thing which is probably true for all pens when they are new is for me anyway is to give them a little tap on something lightly a few times to get the ink down and the ink starts to flow out nice and even the container has a variety of different kinds of ink from glitter to florescent to metallic and pastel to name a few i love the glitter pens since they do not get clogged with the glitter as almost every glitter pen I have purchased in the past 5 years so i would honestly recommend these pens to anyone actually I have even recommended them to family members and even purchased some for my niece who just started college and she too says she loves them i really hope this helps,149,10
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,after reading the reviews i tried out all the pens as soon as i got them barely any of them worked not only that but there was this nasty orange coating the inside top of the canister I am returning it the day i get it because it is just unusable just save your money this product is not worth your time,59,11
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,this brand does not work well for some reason some of the pens worked okay others just did not write i have some gelly roll brand pens that work much much better i bought these because the price was so much better but the quality was lacking,45,12
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,the gel pens came in a timely manner they were all that i could hope for in a pen they write very smoothly-no skipping at all the colors were vibrant and just as was claimed there were metallic neon and regular my favorite are the metallic-but they all look pretty and special when drawing or writing with them thank you very much patti kojis,64,13

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,i love gel pens and was excited to see this canister available you can only imagine my frustration that over time i continued to discover pens that did not work ink dried out the customer service was so disappointing when i contacted the vendor i was told that i should have contacted them right away however i did not know which pens worked or did not because i did not try all 48 at once which i did not think was reasonable i will not use this vendor or recommend them due to the poor service,92,17

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,we run a photo booth company and need metallic gel pens very frequently the company decided to go with a different brand of pens because the ones we normally purchase do not all work on black paper these american craft gel pens are not great at all they do not show up on black paper nor white paper that well most of the pens had exploded already in the canister when we received them and most did not work at all we are going to use about 35 of them while the rest are just going to sit i was expecting something good for the price that it was labeled for please do not waste your time on thislike another reviewer said only buy if you have money to blow,132,20
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,this was a joke from the beginning it took eleven days for this to get to me and when i received it the box fromit was packed in was in great shape after opening the box the plastic container these pens were in was broken the bottom was falling out a number of the pens were without the tops they had come off a number of the pens were dried out and more of them the ink had leaked out of the back of the pen all over others i would not waste my money i do not know whether this is the fault of american crafts although i have received faulty material from them before or the company that sold these i do not ever have this experience on amazon and do not expect to have it again,142,21

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,when i was in junior high gel pens were definitly one of the fads going around i had recently been in a doodling mood and got the sudden urge to draw on myself with gel pens i know childish but still fun and they do not stain your skin like markers or normal pens so hunting for my gel pens i did and not too long after I had begun i found them but only 5 of them worked i knew somewhere still had to be selling these things so amazon i checked out and sure enough gel pens i bought the 48 pack of american crafts gel pen canister and absolutely love them for the past few days I have just been doodling away very happy with this product i have yet to try out every single pen andbut the ones I have tried so far are great,148,36
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,the pens were very cheaply made and when i went to write with them the ink either did not come out or looked streaky i also had 3 of the samefor about 4 or 5 colors,38,37
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,i was psyched to get these my friend had an old batch of these and the colors were great but when it came the pens look full but they will not write no matter how much i shake them or store them upside down they just will not write I am returning them and spending the money on sakura gel pens instead do not bother with these although the colors are great when they work my particular canister did not write,76,38
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,47 out of 48 pens worked some of them i had to scribble with a few seconds for the ink to flow and some of them start writing a bit scratchy but after a few seconds of writing the ink flow comes out smooth fast shipping too,47,39
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,i ordered these for christmas and they were packaged poorly they opened in shipment and went all over the box when i tried to get them replaced i was told that i would have to re-order very bad business now i will not have the gel pens for christmas very upsetting amazon should not sponsor sites they can not support,56,40

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,many of the pens quit working within the first few minutes of using them the glitter may be getting clogged up in some but even the metallic ones are refusing to flow i could not get them to write once again no matter how or what i tried all the old techniques to get the ink to flow with ballpoint pens when i was in school failed this assortment is proving to be a real dud nearly 25 of these pens do not work after the first use i always recap my pens they really should not dry out i can clearly see the volume of ink is in the inner tube frustrating to say the least do not buy unless you have got money to blow,125,42

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,this is a greati love to work on mandalas and thisdoes do the trick for what i love doing the variety of colors is great the only problems i had with thisis the packaging of the pens is really flimsy before you receive thisi highly recommend that you buy a holder that will stand them upright when they are not in use the pens will onlyif you lie them on their sides i learned the hard way my bad rolling on the floor laughing like any product treat this product with care when you receive it i still need to go out and get something to hold them properly they are in a plastic bin away from my kids right now do not be lazy like me,135,44
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,i purchaed these pens hoping they were glitter pens only 3 or 4 out of the whole batch were glitter onewhich i really liked was a shade of brown and it was empty i want a pen that has glitter and these did not,46,45
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,i expected the pens to have glitter to accent my art work instead these pens are just basic gel pens not happy at all,24,46
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,we need two phones for our 40 unit motel that covers half a block in town by putting the base at the center of the property these pones are able to reach into every corner of most every room we had been using vtech phones but they did not have the ability to lock the keyboard since we have to carry these in our pockets this set has been aimprovement only feature they do not have is a speaker phone which is nice at times but gladly give up that feature for the key lock feature,97,0
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,this phone is easy to assemble and works very well it does have an unusual ring tone which is scaring my cats,22,1
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,i have had these phones for about 6 months now and could not be happier they work very well and i am not sure why anyone would buy a more expensive phone the only thing i would probably change is the ringer they are all kind of annoying other than that the battery life has been more than enough as has the range it is a good deal,68,2
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,the phone was at a good price point especially for having 3 handsets very easy to install set up and use the only two features i wish it had that it does not have are the following speakerphone either on the base or the handsets i wish the display would light up at night hard to see who is calling or who you are dialing at night other than that the sound quality is good and the range is good also,82,3
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,excellent I am very happy with this the only thing is that the keyboard and the screen does not light up,20,4
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,very nice phone it was more than i excepted,9,5
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,the caller i d does not light up can not see who has calling,11,6
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,what bugs me most about this phone is that the screen does not illuminate making it very hard to see who has calling it does not make any sense the ring tones are also very harsh when on a call it is often very hard to hear the person on the other end even with the volume set to the highest level if it was not such a pain in the ass to send this back and get something different i would,77,7
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,1.0,negative,after 3 days one of the headsets stopped working it was just off not showing any signs of charging i am returning this and looking for a more reliable phone,30,8
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,sound quality is very low i also expected two phones and only received one that is probably my fault for not reading description but i would not recommend this product,30,9
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,bought the phone for my mom less than a week out of the box and not functioning properly looks like a run around to return it sigh,26,10
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,the sound quality is not great and it has no speaker phone feature,13,11
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,it is a simple phone once you get used to it as it has a few slight quirks but you quickly overcome them after a couple uses this phone is overall straight forward and does exactly what it was designed to do conversations are clear and the display screen is easy to read these do not drop calls nor do they get any interference from my wifi network the only thing i wish it had was an option for back lighting even if it was a feature you manually turned on or off it would be nice to have at night in dim lighting in any case i have learned to get over it and really like these straight forward phones i especially recommend these for a business setting since they are not illuminated they perform well with a long range and have long battery life,146,12
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,these phones are lightweight simple to operate and low-cost they work quite well at distances outside our apt and this is good when i am walking around the muted ringer options are very good as the sound of the phone is not irritating to me overall a good product for the price,52,13
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,everything perfect the proctudo everything was specified in the general descriptions came to venezuela in perfect condition without problem i hope to continue doing business with you thanks,28,14

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,well i have never owned a home hence never had a lawn to uphold just bought our first house and the back yard is huge-we worried like crazy over all the dandelions that were sproutng up everywhere this spring a helpful neighbor recommeneded this product and we are amazed at how well it worked we sprayed about 12 hours before it rained i seriously wish i had some before and after shots within just a few days all of the weeds were gone from our yard it was amazing how fast it worked i mow the lawn weekly on the riding mower-i am the one that does all the yard care-i sprayed almost 2 months ago and there are still no weeds also-i can tell exactly where i sprayed because the grass in those spots is so green healthy and grows beautifully this stuff is a no-brainer it kills the weeds and fertilizes the ground so soft lucious grass comes up quick great stuff i intend on buying it in bulk next spring-i love it,175,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,when moving into our new house we did not notice the lawn had not been kept up very well for most of the summer the yard was full of dandelions and crabgrass fortunately this ortho weed-b-gon is effective for killing dandelions and crabgrass i sprayed each weed numerous times and used up one bottle on the entire lawn it is killing the weeds and not the grass except for the crabgrass from the time i sprayed this weed killer on the weeds to the time they started to die was about three days at first the plants looked wilted and then they started turning brown i dug out all the big weeds once they started dying this weed killer is great for when the weeds are still very young it kills them fast and they just sort of disappear into the grass the crabgrass seems to die a bit slower and probably needs more of this weed killer to do the trick I shall be buying another bottle soon the rebecca review,170,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,I have liberally coated weeds in my yard 3 times and they wilted a little but are still alive after 3 treatments a complete waste of money,26,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,this is the only product that works i wish it were safe to be used around dogs knowing that we use it only where the dogs do not go i ordered four at one time and two are already gone,39,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,did not kill crabgrass even after repeated sprays but it did kill some of my bermuda grass on other weeds it was slow to kill or ineffective will not buy again,31,4

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,this product really kills weeds but not the grass it grows in,12,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,lasted two squirts just junk did not work not the original thing,14,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,it works on clover weeds but it did not work on crabgrass on my lawn not buy this any more,20,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,the weed b gon worked great but it took about 7 days to see the full effect on the weeds,20,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,the title pretty much says it all i now have brown patches where i used to have grass and the crabgrass survived,22,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,i used this on my weeds and they did not even blink days later they were still there like i had never sprayed them very disappointing,25,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,my granddaughter loved these stamps i will by another set of these rubber stamps when my gran-daughter birth day thanks,20,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,this version of the product is new to me but it really works on crabgrass one application and the grass was dead in only a few days,27,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,i bought this for spots of crabgrass the crabgrass laughed at me it did nothing at all a waste of time and money,23,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,i bought this using prime as it was cheap but the weeds came back or were not killed immediately like roundup did,22,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,worked well on your standard lawn weeds very handy to take care of those annoying weeds that you got from your neighbors lawn,24,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,this tool does the job okay i kinda wish i was able to actually see it before buying be aware that the inner extention part is flimsy pvc and wobbles about when in use but for the money if you do not need to extend it much it is okay blade fairly sharp,52,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,this product is junk the rope frayed in the very first use and no contact information for seller in less then 5 small trees the rope was tangled and frayed into the cutter making it unusable,35,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,i needed a tree trimmer to trim-off dead branches or prune crossing branches which i could not safely reach i have not used the saw blade i have only used the pruner it telescopes to it is longest length easily and it is easy to lock in place the pruning cut is clean and quick with minimal force it is well made and sturdy it is not heavy so it is easy to maneuver when it is fully extended very good for the price i would buy it again amazon was the seller,92,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,used it once on a single tree fell apart before i was done pruning the long saw blade is thin and flexes a lot making sawing difficult the cutting portion of it snapped in half during use the metal hook broke in two pieces and finally when bringing it back in the collapse / expand locks broke total junk,57,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,the first thing that i noticed was that thetrimmer that i received was labeled as fiskars not a wallace same part number and i suspect that all the different trimmers are made by just a few companies the blade trimmer worked very well cutting branches up to about one and a quarter inches you really have to pull to cut them that big or larger but that is what kind of leverage you get with a 6 lever arm they are all like that the saw blade is pretty flimsy and trying to cut a 3 branch at full extension is nearly impossible the tool locked to full extension easily and held well the unit is lightweight but seems strong enough for home use,124,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,for the price it works great every now and then the rope binds up but I have never used one that did not if you can get the hook over the branch it will slice through it saw blade is a little flimsy but effective did not have any trouble with the blade binding good for home use but not a commercial trimmer,60,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,broke on the first use funny to receive an eight foot package although in the us post,17,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,the recipients were delighted even although they arrived after christmas and they did not know who they were from maybe i should have ordered them earlier and called the company or something to include a merry christmas note saying they were from us i do not think they have used them yet so i do not know how well they work i selected this pruner because i think it is lighter than some others so will not be as tiring when reaching up,79,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,thiswas not available through amazon so i bought it through walmart it is perfect for light pruning particularly when you do not want to use a ladder the light weightlocks tight when extended also allowing you to place the end of theon the ground eliminating the need to always hold it up the pull on the line is easy the blade is sharp enough to easily cut through branches that fit the maximum opening of the jaws i have not used the saw blade and probably will use it infrequently if at all all of my work with thisis around 8 - 10 feet as i trim the branches over my driveway or excess growth in my small wildlife pond light duty yes overall rating for my purposes excellent so far,136,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,whatever happened to fiskars reputation i have one of these i bought a few years ago and it was great this is horrible the blade is flimsy and theis weak it must have been made in china,39,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,it was a lot lighter than the previous one that i owned the handle pulled out of the locking collar for the extention the first time i used it pretty flimsy flexes a lot i would recommend paying more money for a better quality one the old one lasted years without any issues,53,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,it is not the sturdiest thing around but it doe the trick nicely for pruning up around the yard it is more than worth it if it is your livelyhood keep looking,29,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,the fiskars works great it is length allows me to prune my neighbors orange tree and now that i am having fresh orange juice every day i feel much healthier,29,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,looks great and that is where it stops the cast iron on the clipper broke within the first ten minutes of use the saw blade is flimsy and by the end of the first tree it was bent and dull i am very disappointed with the quality i went down to ace hardware and rented a remmington electricsaw and it was awesome my fiskarssaw went to the dump with my tree trimmings if you need to trim roses from a distance this might work for you anything else is out of it is league,96,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,works alright but the saw is a little weak and flexes a lot makes it more work to get the job done,22,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,today was my first try in using this and it actually worked okay for small branches only but i do not expect it to last very long the pruner blade is plastic did not see that in the description it was not noted the saw is actually metal but took some effort and was not very sturdy i already had to tighten the screws and i doubt the rope will last long either glad it was on sale,75,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,first thing after unpacking the thing the pruning head was wobbly on the handle as if it did not fit it does not really the saw is pretty bad so it is a bit of fight to saw off any reasonably sized branch after a few uses the hook snapped it is made out of really cheap metal you expect that in a fight between the metal hook and a branch the metal hook should win but not so with this pruner overall a waste of money do not buy i had a bit better expectations of fiskars i will try the corona pruner next so far all the corona products i got seemed to work as expected,115,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,we bought this last winter and were only able to use it on small branches the the cutting blade was always jamming and then the pull rope broke as someone else mentioned the long saw blade is thin and flexes a lot making sawing difficult do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more for a tree pruner that will last,62,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,based on the price a good value cons the saw blade is thin theis fairly flexible pros the saw blade may be thin and thea little flexible but i cut through a overhead 3 white ash limb about 10 with quickness and ease theadjusts nicely and securely the lopper worked surprisingly well i cut through several white ash limbs up to an inch in diameter on the first pull i was impressed,78,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,the pruning saw is ok the rope is too long and there is no place to store the excess rope so it is constantly getting in the way when making cuts very annoying the bigger issue is that it was supposed to ship within 48 hours and it took over two weeks to arrive i did not receive any type of delayed shipping notification i am sure there are better products with more reliable shipping available,76,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,great set of pruners to saw back branches it is worth the price would recommend this product to anyone i took the chance and got my moneys worth for sure,29,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,compared with the corona version of this i used to have the fiskars is next to useless the cutter chews the branches and the saw bends,26,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,i have a fence line that is lined with small trees and i needed something to prune the tops and high branches this pruner did the job and did it well i had read some negative reviews on this product but the truth is this is a 32 tree pruner you are not going to be able to take it out with you everyday to make a living or to cut down a 5 diameter limb but if you need something a couple times a year just to keep your property looking good it is worth every penny of the 32 the only reason i did not give it five stars is because of the lock on the extension clamp the clamp works great but you need a screw driver or pocket knife to pull the lock lever over a raised notch to loosen the clamp i just do not like having to have a tool to operate another tool other than that it works great,162,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,works great and meets my needs perfectly great price and good quality replaces an old pruner will not hesitate to use seller in future,24,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,items arrived over half were already broken the welds are very weak they are just very poor quality i would not recommend at all,24,0

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,very useful but two of these cages had broken unattached pieces,12,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i loved how tall and sturdy this seems to be i also like that i can bend the bottom legs to fit into the potting soil i do not know how well it will handle a strong wind i will update my review when there is a strong wind here,50,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great price usually 7 - 10 a piece at home depot these are just as good quality if not better than anywhere else,21,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,perfect little cages about 35 feet small but work great giving support to plants while small and can probably double cage later with bigger cages if you would like I am satisfied,32,5

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very weak compared to the ones that are coated the coated ones may be an entirely different brand i am unsure,21,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are far to flimsy to support a tomatoe plant,10,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great buy cheaper than anywhere else I have found and just as good quality,13,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are not strong or sturdy enough to support a full grown tomato plant i had to stake them to keep them from falling over,24,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,flimsy we will see how they hold up on the plus side the delivery was fast,15,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they were exactly as i expected and i have used them in my garden in retrospect i wish i purchased asset that were a bit taller,26,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,my tomatoes are all over the ground because these cages broke yes the tomato plants snapped the welds on them do not be pulled in by the low price get the slightly more expensive ones at your local landscape place these are junk,42,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i only needed a few cages for smaller cherry tomato plants so this seemed like a good deal the plants i have used with this only 3 so far have snapped the welds and caused the whole cage to fall over i ended up having to stake my plants anyways better off spending the extra money to get sturdy cage,60,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,bends easily goes into dirt easily good value,8,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,flimsy got better ones at wal-mart for cheaper and twice the quality guess these get the job done in soft soil,21,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,mine arrived great n no broken pieces they are lil but work,11,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i purchased several of these for my summer vegetable garden a few of them showed up with the welds broken and a couple of more bent however you pay for what you get we all want something from nothing at this price these were probably made by some eight year old in their backyard behind their house in china i have no problem with that the price was very good and i am extremely happy with this product i will order again next year,84,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i ordered a box of 10 and only 1 was in the box the cage is very flimsy and was bent in several place do not waste your money,28,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,product okay only received 8 cages instead of the advertised 10,11,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,came in great condition it is sturdy enough for all my plants however i wish i had ordered a taller one than normal my plants are thriving and growing so tall i should probably have given it five stars as i did read the dimensions before buying just wish i had ordered a taller group,55,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,what can i say they are tomato plant cages they work as expected,13,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very thin wire small circles expecting wider circles may not hold my large tomato plants and hold up to the winds sweeping through,23,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are not sturdy try spending more money on something that will hold up to the weight and height of the plants as these do not work best for mine,30,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,low quality product some of the welds were coming apart when i took them out of the packaging,18,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these are a little fragile but once you are aware of that and handle accordingly they seem to be just fine,20,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,when you think of a normal vegetable garden plant cage you get this i was iffy about ordering them from all the rough reviews but I am very happy i did yes they are on the smaller side but they are working just fine at this point my plants are outgrowing them per se but it is definitely also helping keep them up and not sitting in the dirt which is what i wanted anyway,72,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,ordered three sets a few came with a broken weld but otherwise great for the price,16,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,I have had these before and found them to work well I had recommend them,13,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i know that these break easily but 6 of the twenty that i purchased were broken in the box did not want the hassle of returning them so i fixed them myself with my little mig welder,36,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,some arrived damaged like others said but overall still pretty good,11,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i ordered this pack of ten and received only 9 of them of the nine i received 3 of them arrived bent and two of them had broken joints not happy with this purchase at all and not worth the trouble to return / exchange them my recommendation is shop elsewhere,49,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,flimsy but they do what i need them too,9,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,the cages are great however only received 9 of 10 cages,11,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,only 9 of the 10 cages arrived and 2 broke when taking them out of the box leaves only 7 usable and doubtful if they will last long have not gotten a response regarding the missing cage,35,36

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the pieces are not welded together well and 3 of the 40 i ordered had spots that are not welded at all,20,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,excellent cages for the price I have had them over a year and they have held up well they are on the smaller side so if you were looking for the large super heavy duty ones these are not it it was hard to argue with less than 3 a cage especially when i needed enough to for 20 tomatoes the only reason i knocked off a star is the quality of the welds while they have held so far they seem much more likely to break than my coated ones,90,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,cheap badly made avoid these and spend a little more on better quality i wish i had,17,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for i guess two of the cages had broken top rings that came taped together really that was the manufacturers fix and the ones that actually are intact are welded together pretty poorly i doubt they will last one season,44,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,very poor quality 1/2 of the order needed to be modified on site to deal with broken tack weld s home site by house actually was a dollar cheaper each also,31,48

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these were exactly as i expected them to be none of them were broken when they arrived which was a plus they are a thin wire and i broke a weld when i was cleaning up the garden area this fall but that was my fault i used these on my tomatoes and they worked really well i think they will last for many years with good care you certainly can not beat the price i needed about 15 cages and this fit my budget perfectly,85,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,was only 7 tomatoe cages i just want my other 3 tomatoe cages,13,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are awful can barely get them to go into the ground for not bending this way and that just super cheap and not worth the month once i finally got them staked they did work but will probably throw them away at the end of the season and get something better for next year disappointed,56,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,trust the negative reviews the welds are weak the galvanized metal will disintegrate under the slightest pressure,17,57

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are the flimsy little thin gauge ones i could have bought these cheaper from wal-mart,16,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,there is a saying that you get what you pay for and in this case that is exactly true these are cheap plant support cages i ordered two packages when the price was lower than normal i am glad i paid less than the average I have seen because the build quality was suspect at best several had poor welds or breaks in the wire one package had the three vertical supports secured at odd places leaving a hugeon one side of the cage i would not recommend these after one season I have had to trash 3 out of 20,101,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i did not read the label correctly so these are a bit shorter than i had thought but so far so good in my garden they have been working fine for my green beans and cucumbers as well as tomatoes if i make a larger garden next year i will be ordering more,52,61

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,product is sturdy i was pretty aggressive with them while trying to get them around some juvenile plants that should have already been caged i will order more in the future,31,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,tomato cages do good until the tomatoes get big enough to bear tomatoes and then the whole cage and plant just falls to the ground i had to end up driving a stake in the ground and fasten the cage to it so it and the tomato plant would finally stand up,52,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,final sale really out of the 10 4 was broken and there was no way to return the items,19,69

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy a few of them broke as i was trying to push them into the ground they will do for small things such as peppers or eggplant but for tomatoes i would recommend something larger and more sturdy,41,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,inexpensive they work just fine put them in my garden this year all but one hopefully they will hold up no updates mean no change might have to add to this at the end of the gardening season,38,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,after reading reviews about broken welds i was fearful that these trellises would arrive damaged but i am a yankee cheap and i do not need a heavy-gage vine-holder to support potted padron peppers and cherry tomatoes so i ordered the inexpensive 10-pack in spite of all the reviews warning that i should not package arrived in two days and i just inspected all 10 not a single damagedall welds intact thanks,74,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,initially constructed of good gauge wire ok the welds on every one of the bottom rings arrived either with one two or all welds broken functionally useless i could understand if one or two welds came loose in my handling and inserting them into the ground but these arrived broken as if there was no quality control what so ever on the upside the price was ok but have found better quality locally at about the same price and i have had my hands on these i bought two packs of ten of panacea 89723 plant supports sight unseen worst transaction that i ever made on amazon,107,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these were very cheap and part of them were already untacked at the welded spots guess i got what i paid for,22,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,some of the cages were bent upon arrival but it was not worth complaining about since they are wire and easily bent back in shape they are perfect for my tomato plants and will buy more in the future if i need to,41,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good quality sturdy tomato cages can not beat the price,9,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these are a great deal compared to what sells locally all of the spot welds held securely i have no complaints,21,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,this supported my tomatoes nicely until my plants outgrew them i now use this on smaller plants,17,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good inexpensive tomato cage looks like I shall get a few years use out of them,15,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i bought 3 packs of ten not one arrived cage perfect every one was bent and the metal is so pliable that trying to stick the cage in the ground causes more bending some of the cages had bad joints that had come loose i destroyed one of the 3 boxes when opening it so i can only return 2 of them i will count the one pack of ten as a lesson learned,74,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,worst quality of anything i have ever purchased on amazon i had to bend half the cages into shape there were a dozen broken welds among the cages and there were two that were so mangled i could not even use them despite my best effort i felt like i opened a whole box full of the ones that were rejected after a pile was picked through at home depot very disappointed,71,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i bought these tomato cages last year i am reusing them again this year and they are holding up well i liked how much cheaper it is then cages in the hardware store the tomatoes like the cage as well the box it comes in is gigantic my dog kept barking at it shipping was fast and theis sturdy,61,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these reviews for 5 stars is way over zealous i purchased 4 boxes 40 total 5 had broken welds or completely disconnected hoops very poor quality control coming from this manufacture the metal is flimsy and mine had a very distinct awful smell as a cherry on top i have to say if tomatoes season was not out i would have returned all 40 and gone local,66,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,there has were pretty cheap so i was not expecting much however they would often bend when putting them into the ground what was the worse was when they fell over when the tomato plants were full,35,114
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these are excellent stakes for plants like bell peppers jalapenos and more they are definitely too small for tomatoes although,19,115
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are already rusty at the joints like they have been sitting outside for a year or two found some feathers on them guess they will do the job but i wonder how long they will last very large package so i hate to ship it back,44,116
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,decent price for what you get some of the welds broke while inserting into the ground but they still served their purpose good for small-med pepper plants,27,117
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i would not recommend using these for tomato plants they work ok for pepper plants although some of the welds were very poor quality you get what you pay for with thisi likely would not by this again,39,118
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would these were the cheapest things i ever bought they are definitely not for tomato plants could not hold up a small roma variety plant garbage,32,119
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,only recieved 5 of the 10 i bought and paid for i would love to have the other 5 since I am making grapevine trees could it be possible to get them,31,120
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the cages started out well doing their job cherry tomatoes were ok but cages bent to the ground with weight of beefsteak tomatoes I shall figure out what to do next spring,31,121
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these tomato cage were very weak and flimsy some of the rings were off when the cages arrived and some fell off before i could stake the cage in the ground,31,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,several of these had welds that had already come loose also they are smaller than the standard tomato cage but i guess that is on me for not reading size closely but the lack of good welding is urksome,38,123
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,good cage but too small for tomatos better for peppers and eggplants,12,124
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i did not get 10 of them every poor quality broken and welding is very week i would not use for plants i am using for christmas trees so i am sure they will only work one year and let us see if they will make it thru a minnesota winter storm i doubt it but let us see,57,125
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great in the garden especially for my tomato plants,9,126
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are only okay tomato supports a couple of the welds or solders or however the metal is attached to itself came apart right out of the box some did not seem like they were ever really attached there are enough in the pack that you will get a couple of ok cages but if you want something that will last for more than one season look elsewhere,65,127
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i wish i got them when i planted but even using them a bit after was not a problem sturdy and did not rust,23,128
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,hard to find in the summer but these did the trick very stable plants,14,129
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy and do not hold up very well the only way that they function is if you bundle the together in groups,24,130
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,tomatos have not escaped as of yet cage seems to be working,12,131
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,nice product but i only recieved 9 out of the 10 products i ordered,14,132
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,arrived quickly exactly what i needed at the home depot there has only bee the large tomato cages this is exactly what i needed for my peppers and I am even using it to support my watermelon plants so they have somewhere for the vines to grab on to,48,133
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very small and some came with broken spokes i would not recommend these for large tomato plants but only smaller varieties make sure to check the measurements before ordering these they are not the large ones you see at the stores,43,134
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i am sorry to say i have to revise my review below all 4 of the supports continued to bend under the weight of my beefsteak tomato plants despite being tied together at the top my cherry tomato plants did not bend the cages but probably did not need the supports anyway a few of the wires broke it is possible i did not have enough soil in my raised bed to support the buried wires i will try again next spring after i straighten out the spokes and use framing wire to hold broken wires together they did the trick i found it helpful to 1 make sure soil is deep enough to cover legs to the first circle for strong base 2 tie together upper circles of other tomato plants with string to provide more sturdy support i found that without doing these two things the supports actually bent forward on my raised garden bed,155,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are a value but the cages themselves can not support much i grew 5 different types of tomato plants and the cherry tomatoes got out of control since they grow like a vine it caused each of the cages to tip i had to rebend the legs in order to support the wieght for peppers and small tomato plants they work fine just secure them well or use a steak to help keep one end up from tipping,79,136
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these said heavy duty they are not very thin and not well built at all tacks where they should be welded have either broken off or were never there to begin with,32,137
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,quick delivery a couple were either missing welds or they had broken but they did the job,17,138
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,where can you get ten of these for this price yea no where they cam in a few days yea one was a little busted in a few spots were the welds were not the best but i would definitely get them again,42,139

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great for my potted dwarf tomato and pepper plants,9,141
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,fell apart easily they were the size i was looking for,12,142
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,economical small to medium sized tomato cage we use them for tomatoes and peppers and they work well,18,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,arrived quickly was exactly what i wanted ok price could not find the small sized cages at local stores worked out well,21,144

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,only a 4 because one was broken but the rest were great and also a great deal,17,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i put these on my tomato plants a little late in the gardening game so it was a little more difficult to get the cages around the bigger plants i ended up having to bend the bottom wires out but it still works well to support my plants,48,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they still look perfect a few months later very happy with quality,12,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,stackable for easy storage but made super-duper cheap welds in multiple places came loose in the box before i even had the chance to use them,26,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very cheaply made when you goto push these in the ground be careful they snap easy very cheaply made found better deals at home depot lowes and menards,28,151

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,nice and sturdy i got them for small tomato plants,10,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the soldering of the metal vegetable cages is very poor already 4 of them have come apart and I am sure that the rest will give me problems because they are very thin and it will be difficult to support mature plants with vegetables on them,45,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,does not even deserve a single star these are too small for tomato plants and more than half of them arrived broken should have just spent a little extra and bought some from local hardware store would not recommend these to anyone,41,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,were a little small but we used them and will continue to use them for years,16,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,if the product was not defected it is what i expected unfortunately a handful of the welds were broken i have many old versions of a similar product that are rusting away and the welds are still intact kind of pathetic that these show up broken out of the box,50,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,easily broken but you get what you pay for not the best if you have small kids or dogs running wild but now that the garden fencing is up the cages stand a chance,34,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these work as described some of the welds on them are a bit shady and look like they can snap at a moments notice but so far they have held up for the past few months,36,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,this is the lowest quality product i have ever bought on amazon 2 of the cages were not joined properly the others were super flimsy,25,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the cages arrived not connected in several areas they should have been soldered at the joints instead we had to tape them together would not recommend and will not purchase again,31,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,it is what it is supposed to be,8,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,totally useless flimsy circle forms were partially broken off vertical forms,11,163

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good plant cages i am using them for my tomatoes very happy,12,165
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,as others have mentioned these are very cheaply made cages they are the perfect size for peppers smaller than your traditional tomato cages but 5 of my 10 had at least one weld broken with 2 having the whole bottom ring falling off when pushing them into even moderately hard soil they are so thin they bend right over after this season they are headed for the trash,65,166
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,pretty flimsy but i guess you get what you pay for they were also all bent and some were broken when they arrived,23,167
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,better than the ones at the big box with great amazon convenience,12,168
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,good cage and a good price but take note that these are smaller than the normal size you get at a retail garden dept not for large tomato plants but good for smaller tomato plants and peppers,37,169
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,came in perfect shape very good purchase i recommend this product,13,170
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they arrived in good condition and I have had no problems with them they are lightweight as advertised so not for healthy tomatoes but great for peppers or beans I am using them for cucumbers and hope they can handle the weight,40,171
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,they got bent in shipping i just bent them back and they work,13,172

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i purchased these cages on july 20th 2014 and used them to stake my container tomato plants positives well made large study but easy to bend and adjust weather resistant negatives expensive these cages saw very heavy use and elemental exposure in my garden over the summer they all worked well and all 10 are still in perfect condition sitting outside and awaiting this years garden excellent purchase the only downfall is the price point these are great for individuals who are for whatever reason unable to procure tomato cages from their local garden supplier,95,176
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,works great i have left them outside for a year and it has shown no signs of wear rust these are very sturdy,23,177
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,not even an entire season in and several of the joints on these have snapped they are useable at the moment but if they have begun to fail already i do not imagine they will be staying in the garden for many seasons more keep looking for other cages maybe you will find something that is a better long-term investment than these,57,178
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,quick shipping and great price will add more comments to this review after I have used it,16,179
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,I am writing this after a long summer having used all ten of these in my garden they worked perfectly held up to a bummer crop of super tall super heavy tomatoes very pleased will absolutely buy them again,38,180
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,sad i purchased these this year as my tomatoes bore heavy fruit and these cheaply constructed cages could not handle them every single cage warped and bent under the weight of the tomatoes early girl sweet millions yellow john and brandywine varieties i not only would not recommend these flimsy things i consider them detrimental to any gardener,57,181
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,working well for my tomato plants although not high quality by any means,13,182
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected my tomatoes are really large and the cages are holding up great,16,183
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,I am a novice gardener but i felt that this cage worked fine for my needs went into the ground easily and sturdy enough for all the plants i used them for i am using them with roma tomatoes jalapenos and red bell peppers,43,184
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy I had tried my best pushing these cages through the earth and they all bent i bought over 10 of these and am very disappointed if your soil is very lightweight then these might work for you i will not buy these again too cheaply made,49,185
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are very short and pretty flimsy compared to most cages but they seem to be doing the job edited april 28 2015 we had a very windy day late in the growing season and almost all of these cages blew over i lost a lot of tomatoes and several whole plants save your money and buy bigger better quality cages,61,186
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i initially got these for tomatoes being a first-time tomato grower at the time i really did not know any better thinking these small cages will be enough for tomato very soon my tomatoes outgrew the cage and the plants started to bend the cages now i only use these to support smaller plants like peppers and basils so the winds do not knock these plants down i do not advise getting these cages for tomatoes but great product and cheap price to support smaller plants,84,187
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very weak soder joints thin metal not worth the money had to replace already one month later found better for less,21,188
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,larger then i was expecting but then again i ordered it from work without a tape measure handy my plants are small right now so i tied them to one of the legs but later these will be good i expect them to last forever too,46,189
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these worked great for my tomato plants they are not a very thick wire but they will get the job done if you are rough they will break so use them carefully the price is right,36,190
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great for my tomatoes and peppers and at a great price too my tomato plants are not big enough to have much use of these yet but my pepper plants did great when a storm him and it was super windy can not stress enough that the price for these is wonderful i could not find these cheaper anywhere else,58,191
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,great price when starting a garden we did not know how things would turn out so we bought these which worked great on the peppers and small tomatoes but when the beefsteak plant took of it was overwhelmed by the plant if your planting larger tomatoes have some faith they will get big and get a large cage because this will not support the large fruit,65,192
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,not well made at all solder joints dont hold up these cages collapsed under the weight of my tomato plants,20,193
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,before getting them i did not expect high because of the low price when i got them they are totally more than what i expected even nicer than the ones from stores my tomatos are growing very good on them,39,194
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,as the title says i feel this was a really good product for my use i planted gladiolus and they became unruly i ordered this very quickly and think it works my flowers are upright and were able to look normal in terms of tomatoes however i really do not know if this cage would hold up really big tomato plants i have a few this year that are monsters so all in all it is a very nice lightweight and basic cage,81,195
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,10 cages for 21 with shipping the same cages are 350 per at home depot and i have to spend 3 gallons of gasoline to get to home depot the quality is ok and will last a few seasons best for smaller plants does the job,46,196
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,cheap price under 23 and cheap product at least half broken very flimsy i should have paid more for better quality cages i would not recommend this set to anyone,28,197
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these tomatoe cages are flimsy and poor quality only 9 or the 10 were in the package four of the 9 were bent i would not recommend these tomatoe cages and will not purchase them again,36,198
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,sturdy and a great size for our jalapeno and bell pepper plants kind of small for tomatoes although unless you grow them in a pot,25,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these cages are not really appropriate for tomatoes i use them for hard-to-stake perennials as stated above they are much cheaper online than i can get locally go figure,31,200
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,the photos are extremely misleading they take 3 aaa batteries not solar powered like the photo shows and are smaller then the photo shows about maybe 8 in tall by 5 in wide the are very top heavy so they tip over easily and have no overflow for the flowers also they are made of very thin plastic not too sturdy,59,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,fun and excellent i am not sure why everyone says they go through batteries i have had my pot 1 year and just replaced the batteries for the first time i turn it in almost every evening through the summer / fall while out on my porch i added clear aquarium glass rocks to the bottom of my pot to give the base weight in the breeze and it has never tipped nor does it interfere with theactually it gives some pretty dynamics to the colors i love this pot and would definitely recommend it for some fun lighting,99,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,i gave this gift as a birthday present both myself and the recipient were very pleased with the product she loves gardening and more and i had to install batteries before giving the gift so i got to see how it worked really great you may want to consider putting a small already-potted plant within this pot but thechanges were so beautiful would make a nice addition to anyones garden area or to be used inside have not heard any complaints from who i gave it to and that was in july it is november now so i think it is safe to say everything is working just fine,107,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,this is a lovely addition to your home if you like lots ofit is not solar so it is best used indoors prettyespecailly for kids rooms instapark tm flower powerchanging led plant pot,40,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,i used these as centerpieces for a big company party they looked great all doing their own thing at their own time everyone wanted to take one home the batteries lasted through the whole party we had a few outside at night in breezy conditions and the bases are heavy enough that not one tipped over i now have one on my desk at work,65,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,love the look and glow it gives just not a lot of room for dirt,15,5

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,the pot is a lot smaller than it appears i can not place my plants in the pot as it is too shallow also the led has already come a part from one of the pots so i do not expect for it to last much longer especially if it gets wet,50,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,we love it at the moment we are using it as a night light it works just fine thank you,20,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,although i should have realized that this would be best viewed at night i have had many comments on the plant pot even when it was not turned on i enjoy it more at dusk and later but the pot is even pretty in daylight,44,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,this was a perfect little pot for the price it is very small although it will fit something like a gerbera daisy i really like it and i would recommend it,31,13

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,my sister wanted a light changing flower pot i should have returned this one it is small and top heavy when you plant a small plant it is easy to overturn when watering the water flows over the edges very messy i would not recommend this,46,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,1.0,negative,this flower pot was a big disappointment very cheap-looking and feeling it is not deep enough to even consider a real flower pot if all that was not bad enough the light barely works you turn it on and have to manipulate it to actually come on and once you move it it goes right back off i was very disappointed with this product however the company instapark were very kind friendly and receptive to my issues they responded immediately to my complaint and i did receive a full refund i would purchase from them again but just not this product,100,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,not what it seemed poor quality can only see one lightwhen it changesit fades out one of the batteries will not stay snapped in very disappointed,30,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,1.0,negative,my fault i thought it was solar and it is regular battery which will not last long and have to be turned off and on i would rather have had solar,30,18

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,the flower pots look great and decorate our entire door steps withchanging lights we just put them so we are not sure how long the battery will last to conserve one must switch off the lights every morning it would have been nice if they had come up with a light sensor that switched off automatically during the day otherwise they work as advertised,66,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,this product is made of very cheap plastic and does not even include a set of batteries for the first time use i do not think it would hold anything heavier than a single marble i gave it 2 stars because theis cool but the execution was poor,48,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,product is very pretty i will not know how good it is on batterys as they are for gifts battery life is a big thing to me,27,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,came pretty quick it is cute wish i would have gotten the clear one although then the colors would be more impressive,20,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,1.0,negative,not what i thought it would be to small very soft plastic also need three triple aaa batterys it should have been wired so it could be hooked up to a outside timer,32,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,changes colors kinda cool goint to put poinsetta in it for the holidays word word word word word word word word word word word word word,25,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,this is cute but obviously cheap and there are no drainage holes my husband had to drill holes in the bottom of ours for water drainage this is purely a vanity pot not for practical use it is pretty but my plants do not like it,45,27

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,i was expecting a white plastic flower pot that changed colors the three that i received are bright purple unlit and no where does it give you the choice of choosing ai thought maybe they had sent the wrongbut the picture on the box matches the box that i received cute if you want purple,59,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is an easy way to measure the rainfall in your locality one or two minutes is all it takes to set up the easy-to-read gauge,28,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand consists of three thin pieces of light gauge metal connected by small rubber connectors and the rain gauge itself is connected to the stand by a small rubber connector and after assembling the pieces the result is wobbly leaning rain gauge that is barely robust enough to stand being stuck into the ground i selected the product because of the price and the old adage that you get what you paid for certainly is true in this case my recommendation pay more for a stronger and more robust rain gauge,93,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the black pieces do not stay together well to make a nice sturdy base and the plastic water holder cracked within just a few days of using it,27,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,I am not one to write negative reviews but this flimsy gauge is garbage if you filled the tube with quarters it still would not be worth the 13 plus the decorative holder is cheap plastic so cheap it is bent out of shape and barely holds the tube upright it certainly does not hold it straight i would have sent this back but i ordered it back in january and only opened it today you have been warned,74,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cute but super super super cheap flimsy plastic plastic posts would not fit tightly flopped all over gauge barely sets into the holder for the price i really expected better looked like metal which shows me i need to read the descriptions more closely this seriously looks like it could have come out of a quarter machine I am keeping it because it is more of a hassle to return but if you are thinking of purchasing it because it is cute move on and just get one of the more utilitarian ones,89,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i foolishly thought the frame was wrought iron it is just cps cheap plastic s it does not stand up straight wobbles like mad the tube is fine although it would be nice if the markings were legible from a bit of a distance,42,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,gave this as a gift and she loved it she could not wait to put it in her garden,18,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i love this rain gauge i know it is plastic and a lot of people complained about this rain gauge it is top heavy when you use all the extensions so i only used one and it stands good enough my other one was glass but during the freeze it broke this one should withstand our rough weather,58,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,threw all my boxes away it rained and it did not have any water i looked and rain guage was broken,20,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is ok the post is not as sturdy as i would have liked,12,9

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the gauge is thin plastic so make sure you take out the water guage before it freezes easy to take out and dump the water out,26,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,do not buy this rain gauge i purchased it in september and today i was checking the amount of rain and saw that it was cracked from top to bottom it was a waste of money,36,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is a nice rain gauge with a sectionallong enough for most gardens i did not use all of the sections because i was placing it on a 14 diameter pot time will tell if the markings hold up to our texas sun but the tube is plastic so maybe will not shatter or crack if rain water freezes like my glass one did,65,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,nicely made looks good the rod is made in 3 pieces and about 3 foot long,16,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,pressed fit forthat is not tight at all wobbles all over the place in a little wind,19,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to read and the stand is good,8,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,it does the job but just barely funny amount markings in 8th of an inch plastic stake does not stand firm,20,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,gauge part is very clear and nice it is why i purchased it the holder is plastic and thepart is too flexible it droops to one side with 3 of rain anyway I shall use a metal stake to strengthen it still gave it 4 stars because for the price it is still worth it,54,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,good value for simple plastic rain gauge metal stand adjustable height,12,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the plastic holder is so weak the gage cup is always on a 45 degree angle,16,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made plastic post barely stands up,8,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i know this was a reasonable price but too cheaply made will not hold up back it goes,18,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,great product i will build a better stand,8,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheap when it is in the ground it bends over especially after rain i would not recommend this,19,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the holder is not very strong when the vial gets full the bracket bends i ended up throwing it away,19,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i bought it as a gift i only gave it a 4 because i did not use it,17,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,great now since the tube is plastic it will not break as easily as others that have glass,17,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,first use measured rain but could not withstand wind cheaply made will not stand up now,15,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,plastic cup holder does not remain up right with heat and rain in gauge i love the style it just needs metal cup holder that will not bend in the heat of summer sun,34,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is all plastic but has accurate markings,8,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it was pretty flimsy would not reccommend it,8,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,kind of flimsy but should have expected that for the price that i paid,14,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,works of course catches rain water but but the stand that mimics a wrought iron stand is in fact very flimsy plastic there are three sections of plastic rods that you just force into the next section to assemble the stand we had three inches of rain overnight and it started to bend due to the weight of the water i shortened it by one section and that helped but i do not think this will last,76,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,rusted with in a day and very flimsy comes in 3 pieces and easily comes apart when you try to move it,22,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand is a bit flimsy the corned part broke off when a squirrel tried to sit on it i now have the measure type stuck into a planter that works as an alternative,34,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is junk it is not capable of standing straight up,11,37
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is a good thing to use and have,8,38
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,theis a little flimsy but otherwise it works fine,11,39
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,due the summer weather the plastic hold is deforming and really hard to keep the gauge straight,17,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,works as expected measures same as my other gauges the stand is a bit flexible but does not seem to affect accuracy,21,41
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i like the design but the way that the sections of thedevice go together leaves it being somewhat unstable thus you will need to put it somewhere that it is not going to get bumped much as this can because the sections to disconnect easy greentape would probably correct the problem but does detract a little from the appearance,62,42
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,works fine easy to read and looks good,8,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i wanted something to put outside to catch the rain but have been fearful of the brace that the gauge fits into since it is plastic and not metal,29,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i should have read the reviews or the description but the photo fooled me the gauge itself is very well made and solid the holder and the 3 pieceis the most ridiculously flimsy thing i have ever seen in my life if you do not mind making your own holder the gauge is nice,68,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,pretty well made good for the price i would order it again,12,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the plastic container will not break like a glass one,9,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very flimsy and really not worth the money bad purchase,10,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,love thiscaptures rainfall accurately easy install do not expect thisto display news report of rainfall but actual rainfall for residencel,24,49
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this gauge works great with out breaking the bank easily pushed it into the ground and it is working great catching rain water,22,50
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,when it filled to 3 it would bend over and spill the water too flimsy,15,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,first rain stake bent under weight of 2 inch returning,10,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,very flimsy for the price not sure if it will last long outdoors,13,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,kinda cheesy but for the price it is functional and unbreakable i put it in my glass tube which was always breaking holder and it measures the rain not sure if the plastic holder would hold up but the measuring tube is molded out of some pretty robust styrene so it should last much longer than glass,56,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i happen to have a piece of rebar available and i wire tied it to the rebar theis weak and wobbly and the wind can easily knock it over the top portion is all plastic and when the wind blows really hard it comes loose it is tricky to get the gauge in the cradle to where the male on the gauge to fit in the female plug at the bottom of the holder in my opinion it looks nice and for me it is in with irises and looks nice you can not see the rebar for something that can be visible by others however for practical use if you only use one section of thewith the gauge it may just work but I had be skeptical that in mind if you have a wooden dowel dark inor a piece of rebar to attach it to it works well,154,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i purchased this rain gauge after my glass gauge broke i wanted a plastic version that was sturdy yet pretty this is exactly what i got i have already dropped this gauge a couple times and it still looks perfect so this design is very sturdy i was am a impressed and recommend to anyone needing a sturdy yet decorative rain gauge,62,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,was not impressed it is plastic the gauge weighs down the holder,13,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i bought this for my friend she is very happy with it,12,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the holder is not quite the quality i would have preferred but works well and looks good the graduated cylinder is very good and easy to read i just went out and read 3 1/4 of rain last night,39,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i will have to come up with another stand good deal at 3 dollars rain vessel nice stand not able to use outdoors too flimsey,25,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it is plastic and the wind blows the guage out of the holder it is a real disappoint,18,61
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,looks nice very lightweight hope it will last for at least the whole summer,14,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,works pretty good having trouble getting it to stand upright in our garden keeps leaning over just have to find a way to secure it is all,27,63
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,oh my gosh it brought me so much good luck happy liquid sunshine and rainbows yes rainbows the week after we bought this we had record rainfall here in socal i mean like a lot of rain is this a coincidence surely not buy this rain gauge make it rain it is like magic i tell you,53,64
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was happy to find an inexpensive rain gauge but in this case the adage you get what you pay for seems to apply the black holder is very flimsy plastic and it is hard to get standing up straight and stable in the ground within a month the plastic gauge tube had cracked so now it is worthless as it will not hold water i would not buy this product again,69,65
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,should have known given the price will not stay upright plastic frame wavers in the wind,15,66
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made had to drill holes deeper and glue stand together,12,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand that comes with this is hilarious it is just three pieces of metal that sit inside each other a breeze would take it out,25,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,cheap plastic probably will not make it through first storm,10,69
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the stand is a little flimsy but the quality of the measuring cup and holder are nice,17,70
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,very good rain gage works good and looks very nice in the garden,13,71
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very nice to have in your yard or garden the leg extenders to not fit snugly and it does not stand completely straight out of the ground however you can lift the gauge out it is holder without disturbing the setup,40,72
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,love this rain gauge replaced two other rain gauges that i bought with this one one gauge was glass and it froze the other one was not tough enough to handle a hail storm but this rain gauge is perfect big enough and tough enough,43,73
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it only rains once a year here in the pacific northwest from october to may haha our kids are obsessed with all things weather related and were so excited to get this rain gauge set up it is a very simple design with easy enough to read markings on it in inches and mm our older ones get to empty it in order to start recording rainfall for a new day we homeschool a couple of our kids and they keep daily journals including a section on the days weather their favorite part of their journal entries is donning their raincoats and rainboot for recording the rainfall they call the gauge the test tube which is sort of what it looks like this has held up well to daily testing / emptying and has already proved itself to be fun and utilitarian,139,74
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,does it all well and yet it is very simple,10,75
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very nice being able to able to extend or shorten the height is an added bonus,16,76
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,great for the money works well it is plastic and the black holder is delicate but functional,17,77
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is the second purchase for thisthis is for a friend i love mine and is very easy to read,22,78
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it does what it is supposed to do a little on the cheaper side but for the money does a good job,22,79
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,great my mom loved it holds a considerable amount of rain water,12,80
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,if you are looking for simple functionality this is it the gauge is supported by the top so you can see all the way to the bottom of the gauge the container and mount are plastic although,37,81
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,holder is flimsy probably will not last long outside,8,82
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,grossly inaccurate i noticed heavy rains did not seem to measure up with this gauge 1fluid ounce equals 1805 cubic inches according to this gauge 1 oz 1 inch of rain,31,83
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,cute and it catches rain i hear now if it would only rain so i can see it in action,20,84
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,cracked in less than a year rendering it useless,9,85
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,nice little rain gauge with an iffy sort of stand it does what it is supposed to do but requires viewing at an particular angle,24,86
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i ordered 2 of these and one broke i contacted the company and they replaced it quick great service the unit comes in pieces the reservoir is plastic the other components are metal not fancy or indestructible but a great value for the price it does what it is supposed to,50,87
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to install and read i needed a rain gauge that did not need to be posted to a wall or fence and this works perfectly for us,27,88
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the plastic tube broke in the first freeze if you live where there is winter do not buy this,19,89
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is a very cheaply made product do not let the picture fool you the plastic parts barely fit or do not fit together at all after 20 minutes of trying to attach the main holder to the plastic rods i gave up,42,90
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we finally got some rain so now i can tell you this little gauge works fine it is rather small so you might want to find a spot close by,30,91
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,luster1646 rapitest spiral metal rain gauge with stake this looked nice enough so i thought i would try it out well sadly this is just not that great one main issue is the stake it is on should really be one single piece to make it last longer however it is not one piece but you have to assemble it and hope that it will fit together mine took a bit of work to get it to fit together right this should not be the case with a newas a result it actually did not even stay up the other day in a bit of wind and rain so i would say maybe not the best one to use there are better ones out there it did make it during a couple rains before this last one and seems accurate just did not last in the last wind we had it got knocked over where it connects together on the stake and cracked maybe if it had fit right to begin with would not have happened or better yet if the stake was a single piece not something i would suggest to anyone to get,199,92
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,thisis a little bit flimsy it looks great from a far but when you get a better look is not quite so good it becomes apparent that it is flimsy and a little bit on the cheap side so i would suggest that you look elsewhere for a rain gauge,52,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,nice quality does not look like it will fall apart or break in a few months,16,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,a sturdy and accurate rain gauge tall enough post to keep out of brush or weeds,16,95
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,basic rain gauge the post is not super thick or sturdy in our sandy soil it immediately tilted to the side it was hard to get it situated to stay upright kids enjoy tracking rainfall if you want something to last may want to spend a bit more for something sturdier but if monitoring rainfall will be a passing interest the price is right for this model,67,96
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this looks nice but is not stable enough the spike is three seperate metal pieces that fit together but they fit together loosely so the whole thing is unstable and wobbly the rain catch does not sit flat and is pushed a bit to the side by the metal curly i have tried to bend to get it straight but it just will not get level,66,97
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i received this rapitest spiral metal rain gauge for an honest review heres my take on it attractive polystyrene cylinder holds up to five inches of rainfall and is scaled for both inches and centimeters shatter and crack resistant a spiral circles the tube and adds to the look a metal adjustable stake holds the tube up to a height of 36 inches i have mine in a large oak barrel planter on my backso is safe from being knocked over i think however that placed in the ground at the 36-inch height it might be vulnerable to being knocked over it is rather cheaply made and the tube sections are somewhat wobbly but it does the job and looks nice in my planter despite the fragility it is attractive and accurate enough for my needs,138,98
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is basically garbage the cylinder is made out of plastic but the holder is so crooked that the cylinder will not stand straight so you would not get an accurate measure of your rain fall all the metal parts are cheap and I shall made if you want / need a rain gauge i advise you to look at other brands this one is pure garbage not recommended,66,99
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is very cheaply made in fact my husband was carrying to the door to put it outside and the wire that holds the gauge on the stake broke before he even got out the door needless to say it was not welded on properly or saudered but was cheaply made it is worthless now my husband was disappointed as a storm is coming tomorrow and he wanted to measure the rainfall,70,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,one if the most important times of the year for roses is the fall it is easy to forget water needs especially if you live in an area with a dry autumn i really like the gauge itself it is easy to read the stake however is a real weak link it comes in 3 pieces which fit poorly together i bagged 2 of them and just went with a short stake if you use all 3 pieces it is not very stable otherwise this worked out well for my needs,91,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the main reason i like luster1646 rain gauge is the design the spiral design makes it unnoticeable in the garden i find it very attractive to place the rain gauge under the bush however i suggest to store the rain gauge indoor during winter,46,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this is fine for the price the container is plastic which is both good and bad in my northern garden it is less likely to be damaged by unexpected frosts or damage from forgetting to take it in before winter some of my plastic oes do crack or turn cloudy the stake is fine but not as sturdy as i would like it looks decent in the garden,68,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this one comes with 3 equal-length rods that allows for placement at different heights by placing one on top of the other i was not sure if plastic or glass would be what i wanted until i accidentally hit the measuring cup with my hedge trimmer and it flew away in several pieces that when i realized i wanted plastic otherwise I had have to hunt for all the glass shards,69,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,not worth the money at all it is all plastic and i could not get the post to fit in the opening no matter how hard i tried i ended up tossing it and saving just the cylinder for an extra to go with the new rain gauge i ended up ordering,50,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the first thing i noticed was the flimsiness of the carton that this product came in the bottom literally fell out of the carton as soon as i removed it from the shipping box if the bottom had been as hard to open as the top it would have held the contents inside the next thing i noticed was the flimsiness of the metal connector rods yes they were easy to insert one into the other and they were just as easy to fall out i placed the unit into a large garden container and when i went to pull it out the bottom connector remained well inside the soil so i glued everything together now at least it will not fall apart the top is nice the spiral that holds the gauge is nice looking the gauge will fall out if the unit is tilted so place it firmly in the ground i have yet to see what the wind will do to the gauge it is supposed to rain tomorrow to be continued ok update 2017 it collects the rain assiduously and has held up remarkably well in contrast to an older rain gauge plastic that totally fell apart,200,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the rod to fit into the base that you can see in this picture did not fit into the base of the rain gage the rod was too large in diameter even after i tried reaming the hole in the connector to make the hole larger it did not fit securely i havetaped it to try to keep it together for now,63,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,we had an old yellowed rain gauge sitting in the yard since we moved in it was hard to read the bottom was a plastic spike that really was not solid enough to keep the gauge upright this one looks great and it has a metal base that you can extend to make it sit up higher husband loves this easy to read looks like really expensive glass and wrought iron,69,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we have always had a rain gauge and appreciate being able to see up close and personal the amount sturdy but the fittings do not hold tightly the whole thing rattles and moves and as a result does not stand straight even although none of them are 100 accurate the odds go up when the instrument remains vertical the markings are small and without anycontrast or a floater of some sort difficult to see it looks nice and if you are just interested in a decorative accent it is a grand addition to the yard we have a lacrosse technology 705 - 109 rain gauge that is far superior it is accurate clearly visible measures up to 6 against 5 with this one and is durable definitely not a recommended purchase,132,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,exactly what i was hoping for in looks and functionality the rod that fits into the bottom however was much bigger than the hole that it is supposed to fit into i used a drill to make the hole bigger and finally got it big enough for the rod to fit into it weird but other than that it is all good,61,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is possibly the most ridiculously terrible product i have ever purchased on amazon so terrible that I am actually taking time to write the review as it shipped i could not assemble thisthe hole in the decorative holder was too small for the stake so i had to drill it out going up 1/64 at a time until finally i could get the stake in and then it was too loose so i had to wrap it in masking tape seriously for the time i spent cursing at this thing trying to get it together i could have made my own rain gauge do not buy it also as everyone else has noted it is cheap plastic but at least that part was expected,124,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is beautiful very well made and durable i love the fact that i do not have to drill into a fence or something like you do with some gauges we have had over 12 inches of rain in the past two weeks so this will come in handy to collect my own data and not have to rely on the weather report for my measurements i think i will put it away during the cold weather months so that it will not freeze and crack,85,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,as soon as we got this rain gauge we assembled it and put it outdoors since we were getting the outside edges of a tropical storm it is a bit wobbly as you assemble it and we dropped from about a 6 foot high level the gauge itself it did not break it has worked well for the storm i have had rain gauges that were glass break in very cold weather so my hope for a polystyrene one is better i am a weather watcher and call in reports so a gauge that has inches and millimeters helps,98,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is sturdy and easy to install seems to be very accurate,12,114
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheap flimsy plastic design product was defective returning,10,115
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the post connections were very loose and made the rain gauge support very unstable,14,116
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,assembly required the rain gauge did not fit on the plastic poles included without having to shave down theand even after doing so it was an I shall fit it was still difficult to get the gauge actually the device that holds the gauge i clarify on to the post the poles are not sturdy and tend tono matter how far you push them into the earth / dirt once a rain storm finally came along the gauge blew off the plasticrendering it useless rinse and repeat this rain gauge worked once only when the rain was not heavy and the wind was minimal do not waste your money,111,117
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,looks nice but very low quality hope it make it through the fall with out breaking,16,118
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the stake was too wide for the gauge to fit in i had to drill a hole big enough and superglue the stake to fit into the gauge do not buy this product buy one of the other ones,38,119
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,not what i was hoping for not sturdy and can never seem to get it straight so it properly collects the rain if you want something very basic heres yourjust not for me,35,120
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,it is cute but not well made put it together and it is not very sturdy seems to measure accurately although,19,121
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,lost one star because the holder could be sturdier but the container is very sturdy and thick slightly green-tinted clear plastic i i have a small container garden on my 3rd floor balcony and it should help me know when and how much to water especially the largest planter which behaves more like a garden bed i installed it on the balcony railing using three velcro plant test secure it to the railing the only other thing i would suggest is larger numbers so that i could read them from inside my apartment,93,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,looks like a nice device but as soon as i went to plug it into my yard the spiral broke away from the metal bottom not nearly rugged enough for use in the yard,34,123
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,first i had to tape the extensions together because they were so loose then i could not get to stand straight the glass keeps falling out,25,124
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed when it was received to find out that the stand was made of plastic and not metal also i had sand down the ends of the rods in order to get them to fit together if i was able to see it beforehand i would have purchased it the holder is of cheap quality,58,125
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is the easiest to use of any rain gauge i have ever had for the price you can not beat it,21,126

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the base is not terribly sturdy but it functions as i want it to,14,130
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the pieces did not fit together well so it was always crooked and it is also rusty after being outside just a short time accuracy nope the guage would not sit in there straight i would return it but it is rusty and my 5 pound dogs tail brushed up against it and it fell apart,55,131
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product the stand is cheep plastic not worth the price,14,132
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very nice for the price it is not fancy support is plastic rather than metal but it looks great in the garden and is of course functional happy with the purchase,30,133
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,nice rain gauge a little hard to read out a window and across myprice is great,18,134
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is very cute in the garden and the opening at the top is very large other people have mentioned that the stake does not stay together very well we had to be careful putting it in the ground but we had a huge rain with very high winds this weekend that blew over many trees around us but this rain gauge did not blow over and measured very accurately,72,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,patrs of stand do not fit tightly together resulting in tilted stand rain amounts not accurate when bent,18,136
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,was received on time and in good condition thank you,11,137
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,cheap cheap cheap plastic material blows in the wind if it has water in it looks good from a distance,20,138
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,purchased to replace the old broken rain gauge we had works good at catching the rain,16,139
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,using the extension rods that came with thisdid not work very well using just one has worked better,18,140
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i live on the big island of hawaii and we have shallow dirt and lots of rock we are an active volcanic island and thiswas hard to push into the ground a metal attachment near the base that you couldon to would make it way easier to put it in securely to more difficult ground types,60,141
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this rain gauge has a small opening at the top it says it measures 5 but holds the same amount of water as one that measures 2 the post pieces can not be put together because they do not fit inside of each other at either end the point on the bottom of the water holder does not fit into the hole in the yoke nothing fits together,66,142
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,sections do not stay together making the stake unsteady had to hold it together to get it in the ground did not use all 3 sections because i thought it might blow over will not return only because of the cost to return it,42,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,shockingly cheap as others have reported not just that it is 100 plastic but the black part is thin flimsy and has burrs on it from where it was injection-molded heres why i bought it although i was forewarned by the reviews i needed the measuring tube for my other rain gauge which is lovely but whose glass tube broke followed shortly by the replacement glass tube I am now using this gauges plastic tube in my original gauge i threw away the black part so i can not report on whether it is even strong enough to stand upright i see that this tube will likely break soon too but this entire flimsy rain gauge cost less than half what my previous replacement tube cost and that one broke in a few weeks mystified that it is so difficult to buy a rain gauge that is attractive not overpriced and reasonably sturdy,147,144
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,measures well but not stay together all the time,9,145
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we stuck the rain gauge into the lawn between mowings so it got weekly handling three months after purchase the wire coil held to the base by a small weld snapped loose and could not be reattached we were already dissatisfied because the inch markings are not in the usual tenths but eighths,53,146
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the material this was made of appeared lower quality it is not a substantial product the lawn service broke it it may have broken anyway if it was made of a better material but i feel it was not the best quality in any account,44,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,now we just need some rain to measure nice looking rain gauge but it is untested so far in so,21,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is real nice however the holder is somewhat flimsy plastic made to look like iron mine sticks outta the ground about 2 feet,23,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is nice that it is plastic rather than glass it looks good and is functional,16,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk it will not go together and if you manage to get the poles together it wobbles and they fall apart i am so disgusted with this i just threw it away i can not be bothered returning it the packing was terrible on thisnot the amazon packaging i would not recommend this to anyone,61,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i purchased to replace broken vile in iron gauge holder fit perfectly the vile is easy to read I am giving 4 stars because the holder is thin plastic and i do not think the holder would last more than 2 years in my strong southwestern sun it would be easy to mount on a fence or woodenbecause i only wanted the vile i think it is well worth the cost,71,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is what i wanted and is perfect with it is rods to make it higher or lower to the ground,20,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,listen to the other reviews this is of very poor quality i would laugh if i picked it up at the store to examine it metal is made of cheap thin pot metal and the clear plastic tube flops around because it is too small a fit talk about false advertisement total junk,51,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it was easy to install and it is big enough to see from our kitchen window,16,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,made of flemsy plastic would not recommend this product,9,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,very nice attractive rain gauge it is made of plastic but it seems to be holding up really well and it looks nice in the garden,25,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,looks nice and does the job just remember that it is all plastic,12,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,looks nicer than just your average rain gauge,8,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i like how the tube can be easily removed for reading the measurement and emptying without disturbing the spike in the ground the measurements seem accurate roughly matched with wunderground would not mind one without the inches on it mm is all i need,43,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,fun rain gauge looks great in a flower bed,9,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,rickety poor construction should be more solidly built theis made from 3 pieces they barely fit together since this is outside i do not see how it can withstand a strong wind i have not used it yet just put it together i want to return it please send information so i may return this product,63,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,nice rain gauge it has easily read numbers in american measurements,11,163

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,will not stay together very cheaply made wind blows it over it is all plastic,13,166
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,cheaply made but would have kept if it was not cracked,10,167
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,was broken when it arrived very poor workmanship,9,168
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to stick in the ground in an open area for accuracy easy to read,15,169
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,gauge works fine the stake is a little flimsy but for the price i enjoy knowing how much rain my front yard is getting more of a recreational gee-whizthan anything for my household i imagine if you are looking for more accurate purposes you might want to go buy an expensive unit,53,170
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,for the price it is great when the first one arrived cracked they were very responsive and replaced it quickly,19,171
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i bought this rain gauge for my husband as a surprise gift he is having so much fun keeping track of this crazy el nino rainfall the perfect gift for him,31,172
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,I have bought 3 different rain gauges and this was the cheapest and by far the best i have two young children who love checking the rainfall levels when it rains the first one i bought was part of a thermometer and rain gauge set the thermometer was at the bottom and the rain gauge sat on top the problem was that the rain gauge was made out of glass my 7 year old picked it up to look at the rainfall totals accidentally dropped it and it was ruined within the first week the luster1640 rainfall gauge is made out of plastic this is much more kid friendly the second rain gauge i tried was super cute but totally unusable frog decorative rain gauge the frog would not stand up and just tipped over every time we tried to collect rain although it was really cute it was completely useless in collecting rain the lusteris perfect it sticks firmly into the ground is easy to read is made of plastic and still looks nice to have in the garden my favorite rain gauge yet and the best price as well,196,173
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the guage has come in very handy with all the rain we have had i like the way there is a small plastic nub on the bottom which fits into the stand to hold the measuring cup,37,174
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,did not know this was a solar light also cool,10,175
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,like others have written photos look nice but are very deceiving the gauge is made of flimsy plastic and poorly crafted for some reason i assumed the product was metal at this price point it should have been i have come to rely on amazon prime to weed out such obviously inferior products but perhaps they have not found this one yet a 199 price on this would have been appropriate the buyer then would know it was a one season throw-away,83,176
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,it is big and easy to read the bottom of the collector has a detent so it fits into the holder securely however this is the problem because the collector can not freely align via gravity the unit has to be installed perfectly vertically to be effective because the frame is plastic it is almost impossible to align it perfectly vertically i would not buy again and i do not recommend this design if i can find a holder that grabs the collector at the oversized lip i think i can still use the collector tube,95,177
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,dog ate it within a week of me putting it in the garden should have known as he ate the one before this one too but it worked well until then,31,178
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,good rain gauge it is easy to read and comes with a stand to make sure it catches the rain the only thing i would say is that the stand is a bit wobbly but it is fine so far if necessary we will attach a dowl rod to it for further support the price is inexpensive and i would say it is a good buy i would recommend this to a friend,74,179
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i wanted a rain gauge so that i could see how much rain fell in my neighborhood i live in a city where actual rainfall can be 50 over or under what the weather folks say has fallen unfortunately since i purchased it it is only rained once but i do not think it is the fault of the gauge itself it is easy to read and empty and is pretty unbreakable,68,180
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,thiswas pretty light the 3 piece plastic stand was weak and shaky i would rather have paid more for a more substantial piece of equipment,27,181
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,just what we needed and great service too,8,182
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,simply put thisis cheaply put together the measuring cup itself is plastic but of a good size and the markings are very legible the decorative metal housing pad and connecting rods stink they do not fit together well thus making the entire aparatus warbly and unstable terrible,49,183
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,arrvd on time and well pkd put it out in the yd just in time for a torrential downpour 25,20,184

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,we dont typically get much rain here but a huge storm that came although ths week-end allowed us to record actual rainfall,22,186
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i think it was very low quality when i put it in the yard the hold was too wiping to hold up the cup kind of hard to measure the rain when it leans over so far the black part is very cheap plastic,44,187
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i love it it was delivered fast great price and looks beautiful in my garden,15,188
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it looked cute for a while and worked okay but after less than a year it cracked so all rain leaks out before we can read it,28,189
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the glass container and holder are very attractive however the poles to put in the soil that attached together do not fit tightly and in fact provide a very unsteady holder poorly made for it is intended purpose,37,190
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it is junk shaft bends with even a lite wind,10,191
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,section broke off when my husband took it out of the box very cheaply made,16,192
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i really like this rainfall gauge i set it up in the yard where i can see it from the window to check the rain fall,26,193
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for one month in the sun and the plastic was shot,16,194
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i have this rain gauge and it works well easy mount just do not try to use the screws that come with it as the heads strip easily catches rain and easy to read from five feet away nice low cost only drawback is the limited capacity measures up to 5,51,195
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,wow this came to me just before the fall rains and it works great it seems very accurate fits well in my garden quick shipping,25,196
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we mounted this on ourit looks great and it right on the reading of how much rain we get,21,197
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we have not received any rain since i purchased this i am sure it will work just fine i like the size it is bigger than a standard size rain gauge and the opening is larger measurements are easy to see,42,198
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this has a real flimsy plasticwhich holds the guage you push this into the dirt for it to stand up it fell over the first time it rained as it got full i think that speaks for itself,40,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this gauge comes with a stake that permits the gauge to be higher than ground level stopping splash filling of the gauge for the young weather person it permits gathering of weather info in a simple and accurate form and at a fair price,44,200
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product did not even last one rain storm the plastic holding the rain gauge is very flimsy so when the gauge is full the whole thing easily tips over,29,201
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,not all the parts were in the package the measurments on the side were wrong i want over them with a magic marker to see the correct measurment i would not order from this company again,36,202
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very pretty seemed accurate cracked after a bad snowstorm and all that is left is the post do not really want to buy a new one,24,203
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this product is simple inexpensive and even although it is entirely constructed out of plastic it looks elegant it is easily read and accurately records the rainfall amounts as long as you put it in the proper areas this product does not have any directions for the proper placement and the proper way to read it if you need help the following sites may come in handy copy and paste them into your browser 1 for proper placing go to [ ] 2 for the proper way to read the rain gauge go to [ ],94,204
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,why did not i read the reviews before i bought this or perhaps i could have noticed that it is not metal and glass more like dollar store products and only holds 15 inches of rain i would have to go out in the rain to empty it it is in the trash,50,205
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is a very good rain guage the numbers are large enough so it is very easy to read it is a good price too,25,206
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i think this rain guage is really made cheaply theis very flimsy i have another rain guage and they never measure the same this one measures about 1/2 of what the other one does although i do not know which one is correct,44,207
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,all plastic the gauge itself cracked after the first year and i hesitate to try and replace it with another as it only measures 1 1/2 in of rain when first ordered thewas missing but the company did send me a whole new gauge includingwhich was nice still it is cheaply made,55,208
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very poor qualitypieces will not hold together and everything is very thin and lightweight it would never stay up in oklahoma winds,23,209
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i attempted to return it when i received it because it was so cheaply made and was told just to keep it and they would refund my money never had anything like that happen before anyway saved shipping it back which i appreciate,42,210
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this product replaced the rain gauge portion of an elaborate hi-tech back porch weather station it works great clear large numbering is easy to see from kitchen window and as i take my dogs right past it several times a day it is an easy thing to reach out and empty when needed,52,211
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,very satisfied with the product looked all over for a good foot brush cute will look good on our patio,20,212
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i guess i should have looked closer at the description as i was disappointed that the black part was made of cheap plastic and the container also very thin and lightweight this is a design flaw as when the gauge has any water it does not stand up well,48,213
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this was broken when i received it it is made of cheap thin plastic material i figure i get what i paid for was not worth the trouble to return trashed it,32,214

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,stands up in the dirt easily and is not difficult to read from a distance plastic tube removes easily for outing out water,23,216
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,luckily the plastic gauge cup matches one on a gauge i already have so i can use it there when the rest of this thing craps out the multi-piece stake is a joke will not stay together falling apart at the least touch or gust of wind fortunately the one-piece raises the gauge enough to get it up in the open if you pay more than 3 for this you are getting hoodwinked,73,217
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this rain gauge is cheaply made of plastic and only measures 1 1/2 not even worth the money and shipping not recommended,22,218
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we use it to get a generalof rainfall not an accurate scientific measurement pros measures rainfall nice flourish on the holder consis flimsy and tends to bend gauge dropped once on a stone from about 3 and cracked i glued the gauge and still use it but i will replace it when i get around to it,61,219
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was looking to replace a cheap rain gauge that i had for years this one is cheap but does not do the job and is not worth the few bucks it costs the holder is so flimsy that the rain catcher has a slight tilt the catcher is much too wide so that it fills up to the top with a good rainfall a near accurate reading is impossible my son knew i was looking for one and bought me one as a surprise his gauge will read an inch whereas the lustera few feet away is almost overflowing,102,220
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,weak plastic and does not hold up well in a rain storm needs to be of a heavier gauge post to hold it upright i had to reinforce it with glue not your best choice for a rain gauge luster1640 rainfall gauge,47,221
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very flimsy and the plastic gauge only measures up to 1 and a half inches,15,222
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,more cheaply made then i thought it would be the stake bends when put in the ground,17,223
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product was much cheaper and more flimsy than i expected disappointed but i guess i should have known since i did not pay much for it it just looked alot nicer online than it really was once i got it,40,224
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was a bit surprised at how weak the support stick is for the rain gauge even with no rain in it it does not stand straight it just waves in the wind as soon as rain hits it it pretty much bends to the ground it also only holds 15 inches of rain believe it or not it rains more here than that every now and then and i can not measure it heck i could not measure it anyway because as soon as the rain starts to fill it it bends over and loses most of the water yes this is a cheap product but save your money and purchase something of quality,112,225
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,poor quality and bad design describe this rain gauge in the picture it looks great but in actuality it is flimsy and frustrating the spindly little post that sticks in the ground has the strength of gumby every time it gets more than a half inch of rain in it it tips over i should not have assumed this was made of glass and metal but i can warn future buyers i wonder if this originally came from the dollar tree,81,226
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product was recently purchased and recently returned the numbers on the gauge did not equate to any accurate measures in inches or meters there were numbers and line measurements but they made no sense at all maybe you are supposed to guess the rainfall amounts if you are an accurate guesser then this is the gauge for you i was embarrassed to have given it as a gift,69,227
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,well what can you say it is cheap built cheap looks cheap perfors cheap call your local weather,17,228
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,when i first got this gauge i was confused the tube was huge but the highest demarcation was only 15 inches i had another gauge that was of similar size but that ones highest marking was 5 inches i was ready to presume that the lustergauge was incorrectly marked however before i registered a complaint i decided to check with my neighbor who happens to be a meteorologist he explained that the gauge was correctly marked the lustergauge has flanges that angle out and because of the angle out edges it collects more rain than the gauges that have straight edges on the tube so even if it strikes you as being out of kilter it will be accurate if you believe a meteorologist,127,229
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this rain gauge is a nice looking lawn ornament but the stand is so skinny that it does not make it that sturdy a strong wind would bend it,28,230
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,one note it measures only 15 of rain our old one measured up to 2 around here that is significant,19,231
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,what a wonderful guage and looks great in the flower bed easy to read dump the water great price too,19,232
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is just a simple rain guage so not sure how glowing of a review one can give it is a little hard to get back in the holder but works fine and is actually kind of pretty to look at the tube is plastic not glass like i expected but seems durable enough would recommend,56,233
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the gauges are a terrific buy sturdy enough to sink into the ground attractive and inexpensive,16,234
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the lusterrainfall gauge is wonderful this gauge is easy to read and stays where you put it the best on the market,24,235
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this is the first rain gauge i have ever owned and i find it fun to observe how much rain we received although it is made of plastic I am wondering how it will hold up to the outdoor elements and if you will be able to read the gauge when the desired location is in the open and it gets alot of sunshine i wonder if the plastic cup will become hard to read in time the stake is alittle flimsy but i have mine pushed in the ground pretty deep so it is not as tall as on windy days it tends to move with the wind i did not realize how much rain an inch is til i seen the gauge i was alittle disappointed that it only registers 15 inches i guess that is alot of rain and you can dump it out and add to the amount of rainfall you keep getting I have made sure to bring it inside when it is calling for freezing temperatures at night but i like it for my first one and for the price it is made for an interesting conversation piece i think it blends well with the landscape and looks nice,197,236
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the product was exactly what it was represented as shipping was fast andarrived in good shape,18,237
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is the biggest piece of crap i have ever bought it looked really nice in the picture but when you get it there has all kinds of spots on it where you can see where they were attached to other pieces i could have bought this at the dollar store and got a better made product also i can not get it together it is very simple just connect them but it is so cheaply made that it will not stay together even with tape surrounding the connector joints they will not stay there has not enough room in the joints for the rods to sit somehow I am going to have to drill bigger holes so they will stay I am very unhappy with this product,119,238
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,5.0,positive,fairly easy to put together the battery was a little bit of a pain to reach i ended up taking it out so i had room to work addedand oil and she started right up first try the instructions where easy to understand it also came with a quick setup guide that had everything you need to do for those who do not like reading the manual,68,0

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,1.0,negative,generator is unusable air filter box and cover are both broken in my opinion this is not something that happened in shipping as it is up on top of the motor and completely covered by the top plastic cover i can only assume this was smashed and then assembly finished do not waste your time just go to the store and purchase,61,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,1.0,negative,customer reviews are for other customers to make informed decisions this product does not work it does not generate electricity it does not even start the generac xg10000e i bought online only to avoid sales tax was doa nobody wants to carry a brand new 300lbs generator around to get it fixed i do not either apparently many of you will receive a generator that will not start and when this happens the only thing you can do is to file a formal dispute with your credit card company nobody else will be of any help unless you are willing to spend days and dollars trying to fix a brand new product,124,5

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,4.0,positive,the handle broke almost immediately and it is not exactly something that is easy to take in for service besides i use it as a whole house backup so i am not moving it too much the directions to get started were horrible so use your common sense and connect the battery before trying to start it they did not tell me that or otherwise hid that part but it fires up every time and i am glad i bought it,82,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,5.0,positive,i just set up this generator similar to other reviewers experience it would not turn over for me on it is first start luckily i had already read reviews on other sites i think the generac site which provided some useful advice you need to fill thetank more than halfway full for it is first start after having repeated problems with 4 gallons in i added another 3 gallons ofand it started right up i can not yet comment on it is performance and reliability I shall update my review if i encounter problems but on paper and based on other reviews this generator should be great,106,10

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,the hide-a-key thermometer works as expected it was easy to mount on the wall beside my door and provides real easy access to a key one thing i do wonder about is whether it is too obvious a place for a key i would think that any decent burglar would know all about popular key hiding places but i view the thing as basically a convenient place to put a key outside for my own use a better place in any event than just hanging it on a nail beside the door burglars will get in if they want to key or no key,102,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,you slide the cover and there are 2 spots for keys it is lightweight and easy to hang up i started using it right away well worth the price,31,3

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,had to cut the hooks because they were too fat to hold key kind of cheaply put together but does the job of discretely hiding keys outside,27,16

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this is a great concept andthe problem is that it is too obvious i did not realize the product would be so thick that you cold tell it is also flimsy even attaching the back with the two screws i believe a strong enough wind would simply blow the cover right off we are not returning it since we have a keypad to get into our garage we will simply place our spare key s in this product and then dump it into a junk box for safe keeping,86,28

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,the plastic compartment is too large so the thermometer looks like a compartment and looks fake also the thermometer was not even close to accurate the worst part was that somehow even although it is white the direct sunlight seems to have made the plastic very brittle and when i really needed to use it less than one year later as i carefully slid the compartment open all the connecting grooves snapped inward and it no longer closed correctly it is now in the trash without even one successful usage,89,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,worked and looked ok however plastic is very thin and after a few key retrievals it started breaking apart i guess it became more brittle with exposure out doors northern side out of light but colder,36,33

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,very cheap and does not hide the key well it seems like it would fall apart if you look at it the wrong way,24,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,there has no way someone would believe this is only a thermometer it is super thick and bulky the bottom does not close completely which would allow things to get in spiders bugs water and more or out the top seam does not match up either the thermometer is inaccurate and is poorly painted on i would not recommend this product,57,63

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,this has been the perfect little hiding spot for a spare key i never liked the looks of the fake rocks they always look too plastic this blends well and looks like it is been there for ages it is easy for even my youngest to slide open and perfect for when my teenager forgets his keys it is even saved my husband and i a time or two easy to screw in nails or screws not included and hides two keys safely inside the thermometer has been surprisingly accurate given the wonky weather we have been experiencing in new york lately laughing out loud would definitely purchase this again it was a great deal for the price too,113,82

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,while this product claims to have a concealed and secure key compartment it is actually not secured in any way i own a similar product that utilizes a combination to open the hidden compartment to open this secret compartment you simply slide the cover up,45,91

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,i find this hard to slide open and I am a little concerned it will break with too much use but the temperature seems to be pretty accurate and it is a nice way to make the spare key a little harder for an unauthorized visitor to find for the price i found this more practicable than a hide a key rock and certainly better than the prior method of under the doormat,71,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,i love this product it is very conspicuous no body can guess it hides a key,15,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,does not really work good but would never know it held keys,11,95

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,who would ever think to look in an inexpensive looking thermometer for a hidden key i hope no one as described hopefully i do not have to update,27,126
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,the product works well and was what i expected delivery was timely but both came with the thermometers unglued i had to re-glue both of them no big deal but you might want to check them before shipping thanks and i will not hesitate to order from you again,48,127
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,i prefer to be prepared so that when i am in an emergency I am not even more stressed and panicked so i go ahead and buy little things like this here and there eventually adding it all up to a sufficiently awesome kit for whatever I am prepping for this particular product I have found is great quality and will be useful for when i or someone close to me will need spare keys,72,128

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,not happy at all it does not read the real temp so can not use it how obvious is it when it reads 65 all the time but it is 20 out,30,131
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,if you need something to tell the temperature this is not so bad but it comes with no mounting hardware and is made of fairly cheap plastic also as a hide-a-key the seam is very obvious and i think I shall just use it as a thermometer,45,132
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,i wanted something so that my daughter could hide a key at her house the picture was a bit deceiving when i opened the package the glue on the thermometer had failed and it fell out i think i can glue it back together but the unit is so thick it is almost a give away that it is meant to hide something inside,62,133
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i purchased this after my boyfriend and i kept locking ourselves out of our house and having to call someone with a spare to let us back in my boyfriend chose this hide a key because it looked inconspicuous when it arrived i was not too happy with the materials granted this is a pretty cheap price for a hide a key it is made out of very cheap plastic and it looks inconspicuous from afar but if someone were really looking to break into my house i feel like they could tell this was a hide a key and would be able to just let themselves in because of this i am reluctant to but my spare in here but the thermometer works,122,134
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,an inexpensive way to guarantee that you never lock yourself out everyone sees it but nobody suspects that there is a key inside,23,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,this may be the worst thing i have ever purchased the glass thermometer fell out of the plastic housing as soon as i opened the package do not waste your time with this trash,33,136
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,these were flimsy and the thermometer falls out even after regluing i would not recommend these i bought 2 to any family or friends,25,137
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,very very cheaply made if you are going to use this put it somewhere half hidden cuz it is a deep box for a key or 2 and stands out like a sore thumb you will need to take the whole thing off the wall to open the box so do not secure it for good anywhere screws or nails are not included and the holes are huge and do not depend on the thermometer it is been stuck at 75f since arriving when it is been in the mid-40s here,84,138
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,the thermometer part of it removed or broken therefore it did not look like a working thermometer it seemed to be cheaply made,23,139
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,i would recommend this to anyone who wanted a hide-a-key very nice and had no problem installing it thank you,21,140
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,sometimes my kitchen door locks by itself and i needed a place to hide my key in the garage great to hide my key in the garage,27,141
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,i went to put it up and the glass part fell out before i even had a chance to hang it cheap and case too thick to look like a regular thermometer,32,142
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,unfortunately i never got to use thisas it came damaged and leaking mercury fluid the numbers on the thermometer were smeared and unreadable it was ordered as a gift but i just threw it in the trash upon opening it i can not comment on customer service since i never notified them so it may have been just one of those flukes that sometimes happen,68,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,i did receive the paper bowls but not the thermometer hide-a-key i do not believe they were coming from the same place so it is unlikely that they were in the same box,31,144
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,can not even tell it is hiding a key the temperature measurement is accurate and it looks nice the only issue would be that it is a bit difficult to open without taking it completely off the wall it is not drilled to the wall so it is not that big of a deal,49,145
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this came and the glass came right out also it does not register the temperature it stays at the same the last three days so if someone looks at it there going to wonder if it is real or not i did not send it back because it would cost me to ship back the same price i paid for it,58,146
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,after so many bad reviews you would think they fix it nope different day some s came broken went right in the trash dont buy anything from stalwart,27,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i was really excited about this hide-a-key because it is also a thermometer which is less obvious but upon receiving it i am not happy the glass thermometer piece was broken off of theinstead of going through the hassle of returning it i will just super glue it back on and there is not a lot of room for keys inside thewhich i was not excited about i had to take them off the key rings to make them fit i love thebut would not buy this product again,95,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,thermometer does not even attach to the plastic unit i hope nobody actually buys this for the thermometer and not just to hide a house key,25,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,very deceptive type storage for an outdoor key blends in well with our paintand trim easy to place in an inconspicuous place,24,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,made very cheap i had to take the thermomator part back onto the box and for a hidden key compartment it is blantly obvious that there is something stored in it they could and should have went with about half the size compartment on the back plus if the sun hits on it right you can see a dark something in the back of the thermometor when just one key is hanging inside of it save your money or buy the hidden key rock,84,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,we had one similar to this for many years and it broke we could not find another one and was thrilled when we found this one it works so much better for us than a pet rock,36,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,now i can get into my cousins storage unit if i forget my key so much easier than returning home,20,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this looked like a goodwhen i was looking around for a hiding place for a spare key but upon arrival and inspecting the product i saw where the two key holders that are hidden in the product were both broken and unable to hold a key i was not sure if it had shipped from the factory like this or was damaged during shipping so i chalked this up as a loss and have used something else,78,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this is a good product in theory hangs on my back porch and is very utilitarian i needed to retrieve the key one day was unable to get it off of the hook inside and ultimately snapped the hook off the face also is hard to move up and down if you purchase this I had advise to put your key on a small ring first to avoid destroying your purchase,70,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,very handy device for a moderately adisabled person it allows easy entry for assistance when it is required a good companion piece for an alert system novel product,28,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,two stars because it will serve it is function the product is the lowest quality you can imagine the thermometer piece has glue oozed out all over it the box has scratches all over it and does not look like it will withstand outdoor use for long worth maybe 199 without shipping,51,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,when i received this in the mail i was completely disappointed first off the glass thermometer part had come unglued to i had to fix that right away second it is so big and bulky that it is so obvious it is made for hiding something inside i had to set it up against the door frame so it was not as noticeable,62,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,works great and very handy well made to last cold minnesota weather and very usefull too wow neatlove it,21,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,when i got thermometer the little red part that shows the temp was not in proper and it broke when it fell on the floor so i did not even get to use it i think they need to find a better way to keep it in not just glue,48,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,this product is made from a hard plastic which appears easily broken the shipper send product by usps standard delivery i arrived with a portion broken off the case which attaches to the outside wall i guess i could use it to hide a key ok but am concerned about bugs and more getting into it and building a nest notified the seller of the problem and they authorized me to return it but i would have to pay for the return not what i expected from an amazon vendor edit the shipper frank has offered to play for the shipping to return the broken product but I am going to see if i can just glue the broken piece back into place it is not like it should be that difficult for me to do would sure save time,137,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i thought it was a real thermometer but it is not it needs to be made a bit more obvious and perhaps not call in a thermometer hide a key,30,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,thisis a little thick for hiding a single key but it does have room for two there are two hooks behind the cover upper and lower spots but if they were not a deep it would have made a slimmer profile and looked more realistic,47,163
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,do not bother this is the cheapest looking thermometer ever not only that it broke in my hand when i picked it up out of the shipping box,27,164

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,I am satisfied with this purchase it is true that the screen is hard to read from an angle but i do not find that too inconvenient it has a forecast feature that i do not understand where is it getting that information from the manual does not say anyhow it tells the time temperature and humidity which is why i bought it,60,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,i liked the design and style of this product it is also very comfortable to see time and temperature at the same time,22,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,made in china unit was missing terminals for batteries to connect had to make terminals out of aluminum foil did not want the hassel of taking back to the post office and returning after buiding terminals got unit to work why can not we make a clock in the united states,48,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,plus side it displays the temperature and humidity down side horrible documentation and as other reviewers have said the screen is awful hardly visible except at very specific angles it reminds me of my powerbook 520c from 1994 display technology has come a long way since then but nobody told la crosse also there are little emoticons on the display but it only ever looks like and i have nowhat that means,75,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,5.0,positive,a nice and fair priced product i especially like the illumination feature so you can easily read it when the lighting is low seems to be very accurate and responds quickly / well to temperature changes,34,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,i wanted a cheap digital humidity gauge for my condo this one works well but has a major flaw the display is only visible from a certain angle above the unit i can not read it on my desk sitting down but if i stand up i can see the numbers i bought two one to mount on the wall but if i did that i would not be able to read it at all anything would be better i know this is a low cost unit but really this is the worst I have seen for viewing angles,96,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,can i give it zero stars my needs are simple and i do not even care if it is hard to read but this thing simply does not work it sounds the little beep when batteries are inserted but then does not respond when you press the mode / set thingie or any of the other buttons for that matter I am not an idiot with electronic devices so i assume that it is defective the websites support consists of an email form to contact the company and the manufacturer wants a 5 postage fee for returning it i can probably get a refund from the retailer but this is turning into a lot of work,109,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,whether or not this product provides accurate climate data is academic because you generally have to be an acrobat to read it you must be situated at the precise vertical angle from the display or the screen appears totally blank however since the expense to return it exceeded the price of thewe just use it for a paperweight guess this purchase confirms the old adage about getting what you pay for,73,7

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,after owning it a few months the volume stopped working also i was hoping i could still see the time in the dark without the full light displayed which is really bright no dim light so i have to reach over and feel around then pick it up off the floor after i knock it down and figure out where the light button is I am in the market for a new clock,72,10

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,4.0,positive,pros 1 has a hanging loop 2 reads temperature accurately enough room temp within 1 degree boiling water within 4 degrees 3 highest temperature is reached fast and according to specs in 15 to 20 seconds 4 has stainless steel tynes 5 auto feature works cons 1 backlit light does not remain on will require a flashlight to see temperature when cooking at barbecue 2 auto feature is too difficult to use because backlight is off fork does not beep and backlight does not flash when target temp is reached instead you must look for a tiny arrow to flash comment this is a state-of-the-art device unfortunately the autofeature does not work as stated in the directions rendering it useless in spite of this the fork serves my needs being sure fish and poultry have cooked to a safe temp i do not need the auto features therefore i give the fork a 4/5 because backlit light does not remain onand because beep feature does not work,167,2

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,1.0,negative,this is supposed to provide quick readout of meat temperature you will burn you hand off if you stick the fork into the meat while on the grill it takes a long time to get a read out when the read out finally reaches the temperature it is not acccurate it would be great if what you want is to grill meat until it is a dried out piece of leather,71,10

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,i use this for a rainforest reptile habitat it works great and makes feeding easier i like that my reptiles go right up to it after i place it in the tank and i can watch them feed more easily if you buy this make sure you clean it the next day i am sure this has nothing to do with the design of the product but i have found that one or two crickets will die inside each feeding,80,0
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this another great exo-terra product very well made and functional it is surprisingly heavy and thick and very durable safe for my chameleon or any reptile perfect for supplement coating and feeding crickets,32,1
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i really like theof this but i purchase 35 small crickets for my beardie and dumped them in and i could not close the bottom lid fast enough and oops like 15 got free not cool,37,2
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,my bearded dragon only went to this twice i have better chance to just toss 5 to 10 crickets in for him to chase around looks nice in the terrarium although,31,3
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,does not fit together snugly to keep crickets in,9,4
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my beardie loves it it comes in his tank and he knows what has gon na go down,16,5
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,total junk the pieces barely fit together and the plug will not stay in i have to tape it closed my bearded dragon immediately tried to walk onto the rock in which all of the pieces came crumbling down and crickets were everywhere i would try to return it but i doubt they shall take it back after I have used it once you couldsomething much better,65,6
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,our bd loves this feeder i only give it 4 stars because it is pretty hard to get the crickets in the rock and keep them in there before closing the rock everytime I have tried at least one or two crickets would escape until we bought another product called lees kricket keeper the kricket keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out you can get a lot of crickets at once we now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock then we place the rock in the terranium unplug the hole and our bd will basically sit in front of the opening and grabs each cricket as soon as it approaches the opening,132,7
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i like thebehind this feeder it feels substantial it looks good but it has significant flaws the stopper does not fit and requires modification to make it useful probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store but the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed this may not matter too much with smaller lizards but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you are a dragon just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process so while refrigerated crickets are easy tointo an opened cricket rock warmed up crickets are even easier to get out if you are a dragon by kicking the rock open add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I shall be a customer for life otherwise buy with caution,180,8
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,1 the little cork to lock in the crickets was way to loose 2 the crickets felt it was their safe place and stayed in instead of crawling out to be eaten alive,34,9
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,very bad quality does not work and is complete garbage it is most certainly not worth the money,18,10
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,great way to coat the crickets with calcium and it looks good in my water dragons home,17,11
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,it is very hard to cover crickets with calcium powder every morning somehow to be sure our baby bearded dragon gets his essential nutrients so we use this rock to do it we sprinkle a small amount of calcium powder inside the rock every morning we place 3 - 5 large / small crickets inside covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container after turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner they get fully coated with the calcium the crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder the goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for it is future meal to pop out it makes for a very happy and healthy dragon at play with his / her food baby bearded dragon also likes to climb on the rock and rest a bit good purchase arrived on time and a very hard sturdy design,172,12
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,works good if you want a lazy dragon ours would sit and wait for each cricket and snatch them right out of the hole we have a baby and he loves chasing them now that we quit using this,39,13
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,worked like a charm and made our hungry hungry geckos happy by giving them all the live hunting food they needed while we were gone now if i can just get the mister automated they will be set,38,14
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,got this because i was going out of town and did not have any one to feed my bearded dragon i put crickets calcium food and a girl water in the rock and with the darkness the crickets stayed in and would of course come out for the bearded to eat bc when i got home there were no crickets dead or alive in the cage and my beardie was not hungry or malnourished,73,15
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the piece to close hole keeps falling out,8,16
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,if you are like me and not a fan of having crickets around your house this is a bit complicated to get them into without them jumping out before you can cover them but it does what i need it too and i use a 2nd person to help me fill it and close it quickly,56,17
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i purchased thisthinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder usually i purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes but for whatever reason they started dying quicker the very first time i used this to powder the crickets my beardies were so happy it was like a buffet the only issue is getting the crickets in and not wasting them the crickets were jumping out as i was putting them in the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage and when i opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside although i had only put in a few at a time i guess for someone more experienced with thisit could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets i would not recommend it at all,168,18
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,got this for my chameleon it works great to coat the crickets in the calcium dust but the little plug falls out way too easy so we do not really use it we just block it with a finger when we shake to coat the crickets and it works out fine,50,19
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,captain for hole broke a little piece but waited due to lost shipment for too long to return works just fine lizard enjoys hunting crickets that come out,28,20
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,put 12 fresh pin head crickets in added calcium and shook plug fits horribly and does not hold them in nor do i think it would hold the dragon out from getting in in my opinion it is made upside down as you have to keep the lid which has the logo trademark and writing facing upwards on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out anyways put all 12 in let a few escape he ate and then i put plug back in went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews waste of money and time to us,119,21
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my bearded dragon loves hunting the crickets out of this it has gotten him way more active then he has been in the past and let us me cut back on the amount of supplament powder i use since i can save it in the rock,45,22
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this rock looks so natural in my frogs habitat i have a rock fountain and added moss i do not use the cricket powder i use cricket drink to bellymy crickets but i can tap several into this rock and put it in the tank pull the plug and let the hunt begin,54,23
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i bought this on a whim and i have to say i am pretty pleased with this purchase it gets the crickets perfectly dusted and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out my dragon sucks at hunting so this was ideal for him if i dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them but some days i would not have time to individually feed him until he was done now he sits by this rock when he has hungry and makes sure he gets every single one also helps with me not wasting as much calcium / multivitamin dust as i was before,108,24
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the bottom part does not even fit properly vitamins and crickets easily escape and create a mess if you try to shake it not sure if mine was defective or if they are all this bad,35,25
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,plug was too loose and at the angle it would not stay in,13,26
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this thing is genius i got it with very little expectations and got so much more it is made of great heavy material which is perfect for a heavy monitor that likes to ransack his cage and thebehind it is amazing really helps during feeding times,47,27
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,first off you will need a cricket funnel scoop rainbowmealworms has them for 750 linked below scoop them up in the scoop add vitamin powder to the cricket feeder dump crickets inside and then close shake to coat them if you have finicky eaters this works like a charm the exo terra cricket feeder stimulates the natural hunting / feeding instincts as i sit here typing this i am watching my three female breeder bearded dragon sit patiently picking off crickets one by one [ ],83,28
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,would have given it 5 stars but the little plug does not fit anywhere close to snugly if you have this problem the quick fix is a small rubber band wrapped around the plug and then it snugs on pretty good so the good nice way to feed your pet usually the crickets come out one by one and give the pet some time to breath b / t crickets,67,29
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,it does take either 2 people or to refrigerate the crickets first so you do not have crickets jumping out everywhere i read the reviews first so i have not made that mistake my beardie is really enjoying this and it made adding calcium powder easier,44,30
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this is a pretty cool product my bearded dragon anxiously awaits the crickets and attacks as they come out of the rock,22,31
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,awesome exo cricket feeder it is durable has a lid to the top and an exit spot with a cork like cover makes for a lazy lizard to get their crickets laughing out loud,32,32
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my leopard geckos love this and i love that it promotes natural hunting habits with my animals,17,33
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,hard to use theis good but it almost impossible to get the crickets in without them getting everywhere,20,34
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,terrible product good luck getting the lid on before the crickets are hopping all over your house it serves as a hidey hole for crickets to escape being eaten this product is poorly designed,34,35
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,this is totally worthless first the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder when you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free second how do you get the crickets into the feeder every time i tried the crickets just climbed out it took some time to get even a few to stay in long enough to close the lid bottom the few i got into the feeder never came out unless you think this would make a good ornament for your tank do not buy it,108,36
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,greatbut you have to get use to putting crickets in at first,14,37
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,it is very difficult to get live crickets into this rock i lose about 1/2 each time which i consider a waste you can not pour them into the rock without them jumping out all over the house the ones you do get into the rock come right out once you remove the plug either mine is defective which i doubt or this is just not a good,68,38
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,received quickly and brand new as described tried to use it to keep crickets for my frog for a couple days and they all ran out within 5 minutes it was a waste,33,39
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,this thing sucks I have tried so many ways to make it work but every time i try to use it crickets always escape my beardie just climbs on it if i wanted a rock for him i would have gotten one from the backyard and tossed it in the oven,49,40
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,thislooks more natural than typical feeders but not very practical and takes up valuable floor space crickets easily escape while filling more than just a few at a time some users have recommended putting crickets in the freezer for a few minutes to make them a little slower but why should i have to go through extra steps just to use this easy-to-use feeding rock crickets also tend to use this as a hiding spot and not come out when they are not running for their lives trying to escape before you get it closed it makes a good decoration but that is about it,105,41
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,do not even bother buying this unless you feel as if you have money to waste absolute waste of money not even worth the 1 worth of crickets i used this with,31,42
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,horrible to get crickets into does not fit tight and it is just not worth the time and money would not recommend,20,43
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this product is very creative it is just alittle hard to get the crickets in and the lid closed before they are all over the house my secret is to do it in the kitchen sink so when a few do get away they can be caught more quickly,49,44
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,although this is a very very sturdy product and it is as shown it is very heavy but this biggest problem is the taste of it my dogs would not put it in their mouth they would run away every time i got the toy out so i started smelling it and it has a plastic / rubber smell to it and taste yes i tried it if my dogs can put it in their mouth then i want to know what is in it i have kept them because they are just too cute maybe someday i can get a picture but that is about all i will be able to do with them i am sorry because i really wanted them and thought that my dogs would have funhumunga tongue large for medium large xlarge dogs,138,0
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my dog absolutely loves this tongue she literally wore her other one down to a little nub and i could not find one at any stores i found this and was so excited i ordered it and had it within a few days my dog puts it in her mouth and runs around with it she sleeps with it and takes it everywhere she looks so funny worth every penny,69,1
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my scottish terrier loves these toys this is the 4th and 5th ones we have bought and duff plays with them just about every night,25,2
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the rubber feels relatively durable and this is a great toy for photo opportunities however within less than 5 minutes my boxer / hound started chipping away from the tip of the tongue he is pretty hard on toys although my other two dogs probably would have savored it for a few days before focus turned to destroying it,57,3
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,my shepard mix had the ball section of the toy ripped apart in less than 5 minutes it is advertised as durable but it is not do not buy if your dog chews at all if possible i would give it 0 stars,43,4
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this dog toy has packaging that warns that it is not to be chewed with good advice because the rubber merely crumbles apart even in my hands no small choking hazzard and a lousy toy that the dog is not even supposed to play with,44,5
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for my daughters dogs they treated it like any chew toy we did not get the results that were shown in the photo their little mouths do not fit around the ball portion of the tongue if you are purchasing this for photos do not bother huge disappointment,51,6
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,great fun for pet and family and better than all stimulates people to play more often with your pet fantastic,20,7
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i have two small dogs and both love this toy it always gets laughs from on-lookers but it does not float if you plan on using it near water,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,new puppy is quite the chewing machine she enjoyed this toy a lot and it has lasted quite a long time about a quarter of it is missing but still loved by my dog she does not tend to pick it up by the ball part although so the silliness quotient is lessened,52,9
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,very pleased and so is our dog it is strong enough for him as he is an active chewer,19,10
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for our 60 lb lab mix and although he has enjoying playing with what has left of it it is only taken him about 15 minutes to get it to this point shredded to pieces by my estimate having paid around 15 for the thing this is a 60 / hour toy as you would need four of them to last a full hour as an aside I am a little annoyed at the fancy boutique pet shop that sold it to me it is one thing if i picked it up at kmart or some other discount store where i would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that i was buying a piece of crap but in this case i think it is incumbent upon the owner / operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had to be candid about just how delicate thisis I had be much more inclined to patronize his business if he had done so,165,11
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a cute toy but was not lab tested until yesterday and did not survive as it has a rip in it so it will be going back in the toy box too bad it did not last longer so that we could get a cute picture also picture shows 2 and you only get one,56,12
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it is very cute and funny but my bulldog chewed it up right away thank goodness he did not eat the pieces he chewed off,25,13
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it appears to be a tough toy but it is not great for a photo opportunity,15,14
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the ball that the dog has to put in it is mouth is way too big and makes the whole thing way too heavy dog just chews on the ends,28,15
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,we gave this to our puppy who is about 17 lbs he does not hold the ball in his mouth because it is too heavy for him but the long tongue is great for distracting him from chewing on the furniture he is satisfied to sit and chew on this for a long time,53,16
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,i have 3 large labs and they were not interested at all too heavy and hard my dogs did not like it,23,17
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this is my dogs favorite toy very sturdy i wish all the other toys this sturdy they last a long time,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this works great as a fetch toy and it sure does bring a smile to your face when they run around with the large tongue sticking out of their mouth it works great for games such as tug-o-war or fetch but you do have to keep an eye on them if your dog is a chewer i have a boxer / mastiff mix and he is a very powerful chewer i was not paying much attention and he chewed the end of the tongue off in less than 60 seconds so it does not hold up in any way against a chewer so i moved it to an outside toy we have already had many hours of fun with fetch and tug-o-war i totally recommend this product although it was chewed a bit i am very happy with my purchase and plan on buying the smaller size for my small dog the seller also has great customer service so that is just a huge plus if your debating on if you should buy this let me make the decision for you buy it,178,19
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a great toy both our terriers play tug of war with it and love it will buy again,20,20
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i got a bigger kick out of this than the dog did i think the ball part is a little big not really sturdy enough for my pit bull not to destroy either,33,21
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,great toy but i really should have ordered a smaller size i own a corgi which is a big dog in a small body and need to always order big dog toys because she tends to use or abuse them in a big dog way and even although the larger toy might be a bit hard to carry in her mouth i still am satisfied with the purchase,67,22
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this is a very tempting buy but do not bother our 60 lb black lab had it in pieces within 3 minutes we then closely read the packaging and it said it is a fetching toy not a chew toy it is a tongue are you serious not a chew toy stick w kongs very sturdy and durable oh and avoid the mustaches too from this company they are thinner and likely the same poor quality rubber,73,23
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,what a piece of crap this is i have 2 6 mon old kittens one sniffed it and walk away and has never returned to it the other nicky tried to scracth it and it just swung around and smacked her in the face to wit she bit it and walked away made very poorly and cheapjust a piece of crappy rug glued to a piece of cardboard i should have gone where i always do [ ] or even walmart,78,0
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,the carpet on this is really short and the strip overall is too narrow i tried hanging it on several doorknobs and even anchoring it on the floor to no avail,31,1
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,it is somewhat pricey considering shipment anyway my can does not use it as intended she likes it when flat on the floor,23,2
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i tried it in several locations on the floor on the door and in their faces i rubbed it with catnip and tried to charm them with treats and they still looked at me like i was smoking crack what exactly do want us to do with that thing mom my girls will play with pretty much anything except this thing i went over to petco about week later and bought a super-cheapie carpet-covered 2 stand clawing post with a feather toy and the girls said now that is what we are talkin bout mom in my opinion do not waste your money,100,3
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cat loves her scratching pad and it was the best 5 I have ever invested chooch is not much of a scratcher she does like the side of my bed and the antique chenille sofa in my living room but she has a stretch scratcher and this scratching pad is right up her ally she would not touch it when it was hanging from a doorknob but she has very happy with it on the floor after she scratches on it she loves to sit on it as if to keep anybody else in the house from claiming it,97,4
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,are you kidding me cats will definitely use this thing to scratch their claws on so get one and save your sofa if only for a little while,27,5
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,cats pulled the looped rope off pretty fast ended up mounting it to door way they always clawed on still claw at it but not damaging my door frame now,30,6
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,both of my cats love this scratcher i believe they are both drawn to the scent that is infused in the scratcher i hung it on my bed post where they both like to scratch now they scratch the scratcher instead of my bed great product very inexpensive as well,50,7
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,for what ever reason my cats refuse to use this a carpet sample on a stiff plastic backing is all this is,22,8
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i knew it would be small and cheap but it is literally something you can buy at my local dollar store it is a bit thicker than cardstock with felting on it it hangs on the door knob but because it is so light the cat can not gain purchase on it to scratch it it is essentially like my cat trying to scratch a hotel do not disturb sign total waste of 750 pay double and buy something substantial this is total cheap crap,84,9
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,thisis exactly as described and fits well over a door handle however my cat shows zero interest in it even when i put it on the floor for easy access,33,10
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,disappointing cats are not interested at all sort of flimsy,10,11
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,greatjust can not get the cat to think so,10,12
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i purchased 5 of these and hung them around on the doors where my cats tended to scratch my cats push them aside and scratch on the door anyway,29,13
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,smaller then i expected but the cats are happy so far i will update as to how long it actually lasts in the future,24,14
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cat definitely do not like this one they prefer the ones where i can add the catnip this one is cheap but the cats will ignore it i use it on the floor in front of the litter box now,40,15
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,not really satisfied my cat does not like it does not seem too much like a scratch pad not long enough when hanging on door but fair price thank you,28,16
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,great product cats seem to prefer it on the floor rather than hanging from the door although,17,17
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats seriously are obsessed with this they always dig i have two unclawed cats at it and my third with claws with flip it all over and roll on it and claw into it too I am thinking about buying another one as they really just love it that much,50,18
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i hung it up and my cats ignored it i put it on the floor and they liked it,19,19
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cats do not even use this i sprayed some catnip mist to try to get them interested and they just go lick it and walk away maybe it is just my cats i do not know but i feel i wasted my money,42,20
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,i placed this directly next to the couch that the cats like to scratch most of the time they are willing to attack this instead it is not intensive scratch therapy but it is only 2 and not nearly as messy as cardboard scratch pads in the same general price range i have one on a doorknob and another one just lying on the floor two of the cats prefer the one on the floor the other one enjoys reaching up to attack the one on the door it has been six months now and the scratch pads are both still in perfect condition despite being used regularly you would never know that they are used this is the perfectif 1 your cats scratch your couch and 2 you have 33 in your cart and need a 2for free shipping,142,21
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats love this they finally stopped scratching my wall,10,22
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,wanted to break the habit of cats scratching at the door frame i hung these off of a couple of doorknobs lo and behold my cats ignore these tried rubbing catnip on the pads no luck good thing they are cheap,40,23
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,brought for my boyfriend cat have not gotten a chance to hang it looks like a good buy I shall let you know when they visit,24,24
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,this is very thin and my cat hardly pays any attention to it but it does look nice hanging on my door I am going to spray catnip on it hopefully she will use it more great for the price especially as an add on,43,25
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,protect your doors our cat was shredding the weatherstripping on the front door in her attempt to get our notice to let her in now she scratches on this pad and it makes enough noise that we know she is out there and can let her in it has prevented further damage i highly recommend it as it is flat and we can swing it to the side to close the door solved our problem,75,26
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,huh the cats completely ignore it maybe they should make scratching pads out of nice leather as that seems to be much preferred in my house to these cheapo pads oh well at least those little beasties have not discovered the woodwork and i wanted a new sofa anyway,48,27
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats have not used this even although i have multiple hanging at different locations and different heights throughout my house they would much rather use other scratchers i have,26,28
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats had no interest in it whatsoever i even tried spraying it with catnip spray very cheaply made but that is why the price was so cheap i can not hold that against them it may work for someone else but our cats were way more interested in the actual carpet and never looked twice at this scratch pad back to the drawing board,64,29
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,this was the most stupid cat scatcher made,8,30
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i should have known that hanging something lightweight would because it to swing around on the door handle when the cat tries to use it so i attached it to the carpet using velco she likes it and uses it now,41,31
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,for 250 what do you expect it is not the best scratch pad i ever saw but it can go anywhere hang it lay it down attach it to another surface and it does not make a mess like cardboard scratch pads it is obviously made from the scraps left over from indoor-outdoor carpeting but like i said it is well worth the money paid the only thing is some kitties might not prefer the carpet suface but that my friends is something you have to find out yourself overall aok,85,32
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,my cats ignored it hanging on the door and i think it was too short for them to get too once i put it on the floor they use it now,31,33
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,our cat quail was not interested in this i should not have bought it when i could have just attached a cord to a free carpet sample i do not hate it maybe other cats would like this style and it is very inexpensive i just do not like it because it did not work out for us,54,34

Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,nice scratcher for kitties who enjoy vertical surfaces for claw maintenance our new addition finally decided he liked the horizontal cardboard better which rendered this one superfluous wow do you know how long I have been waiting to call something superfluous,40,38
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,i used this on a door to the third floor in the home that i never leave open but the cats will let me know also when they want to go up there by scratching and i had taught them to touch the door knob when they want up there sounds crazy,52,39
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my cat went to right to the scratch pad just as soon as i hung it up she tried to use it an her paw nails got stuck in the carpet material she has tried it a few times and can not use it i turned it over to the back side and she will kind of use that overall pretty disappointed,61,40
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,pros inexpensive unobtrusive cons basically carpet on cardboard flimsy cat does not like it if you cat is obsessed with carpet then i guess this product is for you if you cat is into scratching the furniture thiswill not distract him for that i sprayed tons of catnip on it and my cat looks at me like i am nuts and on drugs spend more money and get a better cat scratch pad,75,41
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,well my cat loves to scratch things but this was definitely a waste of money he has never touched it sucks,20,42

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,this backseat barrier kept my dogs from coming up front for about one hour until they figured out that they could just easily jump right over the top of it this might work for a very little dog or a car with an extremely low ceiling or a dog that does not have much desire to make it is way into the front seat but I am not sure why you would need this in the first place if your dog was not constantly trying to jump into the front while you are driving i thought this was going to be the answer to all of my dog transporting problems but it is just a waste of money,114,0
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,while the main portion of the barrier is well made it is too short and flimsy to keep my border collies and golden retreiver from jumping on top and over it the upper netting will not stay in an upright position partially because the two stabilizer bars holding it up broke the stitching holding them in place so they are now useless get the outward hound version for less than ten bucks and save some money,74,1
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we bought this product because our dog kept jumping into the front seat the product is a little flimsy and she can still jump over it but it is helping us train her to stay in the back it also keeps her safely contained when we have to slam on the breaks overall it is a good product but possibly a little over priced,64,2
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,this is a durable product that even works for big doges it is somewhat complicated to install and the top round wood rod keeps coming out so i removed it the barrier still works fine 100 effective but a little difficult,42,3

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this kurgo does not work with all vehicles,8,6
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my two goldens jumped this in a heartbeat back to drawing board this actually hindered getting them back into the back seat as they did not have as much enthusiasm going back to their seat,34,7
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,it was okay did not love how it fit in my car could not seem to get it secure enough now matter how much i tightened the straps,26,8
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this is very difficult to get attached to the seats it is flimsy so the dogs just went around it with some serious rigging you could probably get this to work or if your dogs are not very adament about sitting on your lap essentially you get what you pay for,49,9
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,a little complicated to get set up but i installed along with the seat cover and dog bridge works great to keep dogs in the back seat which is critical since we foster rescues,35,10
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,worst thing every the dogs can just pull it down and run over it,14,11
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,52 lb springer spaniel plowed over it guess he really wants to ride shotgun he also did not like looking thru the mesh one we tightened his back seat harness and he could see out the front window clearly he was a happier dog concept is terrific but not for us,51,12
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my dog had already put a hole in the mesh part of it ther than that it is a great investment if it were taller it would be better,29,13
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,lasted about 20 minutes then my dog chewed through the side straps and was back in the front seat,19,14

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my very athletic dog has managed to get around the barrier so not all that useful,16,18
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,for small or medium size vehicles bought for our 2016 ram mega cab and does not fit received product quickly but did not try to install until planning our next trip with our pets needless to say it was a few days after the return period expired reading the reviews and description sounded like it would fit wrong also noted that once installed and tight it prohibits the passenger from putting the seat back in case they want to sleep or rest would not recommend for large trucks if installed elastic bungee chords might help lowering the backrest,96,19
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,unfortunately this did not work with our very spoiled labs,10,20
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,not a perfect match for my car volvo but has enough straps and connectors that i was able to make it work anyway seems sturdy definitely deters my dog from clambering up front while I am driving,36,21
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,strap tore pretty quickly i am going to look into alternative options,12,22
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is the second type of backseat barrier that i have purchased and the only that i would recommend the construction is very sturdy particularly if you insert the optional metal bar and should hold back most dogs,38,23
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,quality made product my dog climbed over it in less than 5min,12,24
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,the rod that goes across the top for stability is too short could not get it together and,17,25

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,put this in my suburu outback it did fit nice but it did not hold up at all to the dogs hanging on it easily jumped over and they chewed thru the bottom connection cords it was money thrown out the window took about 10 minutes for my 25 lb cocker spaniel to destroy it,55,27
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,not for everyone but it works for me i have 10 dogs most are trained to stay in the back two will get in the back and immediately run through to the front this prevents them from doing that could they jump over could they destroy it yes to both but my dogs just are not motivated to do that this is doing exactly what i needed it to do it all depends onl your dogs,75,28
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this was made nicely but it did not fit my car very well also i wasted a lot of time because there had been a design change that was not reflected in the instructions in the box or on the web,41,29
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift to my husband and he is very pleased with it,15,30

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,difficult to install not all of the items described in the instructions are actually on the unit that said once it is installed it is the only device i have found that keeps my 80 lb dog off my lap while i am driving,44,33

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,yes my dog can jump over the top no i do not let him but for the price this can save a never ending car struggle if you are working to train you dog to stay in the back seat,40,35
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,excellent mother is so glad keeping her dog in the backseat,11,36
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,the only way to secure it up higher in an suv or any car is to remove the headrest to get the barrier to secure the straps do not have a buckle to remove and snap in to head rest my head rests are not designed to be removed therefore the barrier can not sit high up my dogs are still jumping over the barrier and sitting up front very disapointed,69,37
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,even tho it says it is for our car the dogs who are small medium size goes right over the top of it does not work at all,24,38

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i always have my dogs with me in the car and am very pleased with this barrier it is super easy to install unlike other barriers i have used in the past and because of it is fabric design it is silent I have had the more elaborate barrier that had bars but that one tended to always come loose and then would rub on the seat or jiggle noisily none of my dogs have jumped over the barrier and they seem content with the see-through design at the top so they can look out the front window i do have a golden retriever german shepherd and a springer spaniel the barrier may not deter a dog that is determined to ride shotgun however we also foster dogs and i bring the fosters along to the dog park the two foster dogs that we have had since i purchased the kurgo did not attempt to jump over it either,157,40
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we really love this pet barrier we have had several others in the past and this is by far the best the last one was metal and looked like a cage or the back of a police car it was hard to install and take out and would not stay in place we just returned from a trip from florida to virginia and back and the kurgo worked perfectly it is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers the price is less then any other we have bought and is really worth the it the kurgo arrived even earlier then we were expecting overall you will love it and you we highly recommend it,131,41
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,while it does the trick it is a little too high it blocks my vision a bit when i am backing up well made however and worth it,28,42
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,I am sure it would have been fine if it were complete i did not even get a receipt invoice in the box very surprising had to go out and purchase a bar barrier at the last minute,35,43
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we definitely need this pet barrier our dogs jump back and forth all the time this seemed to help but only 3 days after installation one of the dogs tunneled through and broke a strap straps need to be stronger otherwise it is a good investment,46,44
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,works well however very difficult to install the directions are not very clear it should install in a few minutes however because of the lack of direction it takes awhile,30,45
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this does not work in our suv it does not stay up in the postion needed to keep our big dog in the back it does keep groceries from rolling forward,31,46

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we needed something to contain our new 1yr 8mo old 67 lb rescue puppy i searched the web to find something reasonably priced that would fit in our lincoln navigator our car has the 7 seat option and we often use them all i found it easy to install and high enough to keep our big boy in the back we also ordered the solvit 62316 waterproof suv cargo liner could not be happier with prime shipping,75,51
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we have a golden retriever / aussie shepherd mix she is just about ocd about going back and forth from the front to the back seats when driving our murano suvs the kurgo has been installed pretty easily and does a good job of keeping her in the back while the car is in motion if i park and leave her in the car in appropriate weather she will get to the front seat by squeezing between the doorpost and the front drivers seat no problem the only thing i wish was different is that there was more of the see-through mesh instead of the black nylon canvas blocking hers and our view between the seats,114,52
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the barrier gets the job done for our 9 month old golden retriever it keeps her in the back seat and much less of a distraction while driving both traveling and local driving has become much more enjoyable for all of us we can still see her and give her a pat now and then she loves to ride with her chin resting on the top of the barrier however according to my husband it is not very easy to install and remove and takes some time so ours remains in my car all the time which I am not very excited about,102,53
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,my dog jumped right over the top we have a very active shelty did not use till we went on a trip too late to return,25,54
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,let me add my voice to those who say that these things are worthless it took my three month old puppy less time to run over this barrier than it took me to install it what a ripoff,38,55
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i first tried this product on our pickup however the seats were too high and the barrier did not stop our dog for a second then i installed it in our suv and it is working well it is a little confusing to install but taking the directionsbyworked ok and it took me about 45 minutes all in all i think it is a good product and does help keep the dog in the back seat,79,56
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting this to stay in place my dog jumped right over it it may have worked better on a vehicle with larger seats,28,57
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,19,58
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,subaru forrester with sunroof when the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down they like to take turns leaning on the center console and would slide forward when stopping she sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the giant and he tries to escape to the front not good nor safe the metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof they would hit the glass of sunroof those seem to be semi-permanent whether that is because take up to much room to store or to hard to install and remove i do not know all do not buy decision makers for me when i discovered kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs it does easy to install and remove even folds and slides back into storage bag easily dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we are all riding safer we are happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot,162,59
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this product is not only difficult to install it also does not work my lab jumped over it with no problem it just makes it harder to get him back in the back seat,33,60
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,we take our terrier everywhere in our grand cherokee when we leave him in the car to job or eat he hops in the front seat he is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose this device was difficult to attach it took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts biggest problem however was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car it worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving,104,61
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i received the backseat pet barrier and could not figure out how to install it finally figured it out and it works pretty good on the expensive side but nice product,31,62

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i put this behind the front seats in my xtended cab pickup truck my standard poodle just climbed right over it since then the material is tearing where the metal stays are poking through might work for a small dog but not mine,43,64
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the kurgo backseat pet barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound very enthusiastic portuguese water dog out of the front seat this was critical to me because my car a saab has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as i was driving a rather unnerving experience as soon as she saw the barrier my dog did not even try to wiggle through it sent a clear message and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet the barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat while simultaneously barring access to the front seat one caveat the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror so I am planning to remove it it unfastens easily this product is a great value and will probably last a very long time owing to it is sturdy construction and strong materials I have owned it for about a month and could not be happier,182,65
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my girlfriend was able to install it in no time and it works great although her dog does not like it,20,66
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i have a 100 lb lab mix who likes to play co-pilot while i drive and cuddle he likes standing between my seats which is dangerous for me and him and we have bumped heads too many times so I have been shopping for a barrier i have a 4 door sedan and therefore i can not install one of those big metal barriers which are very unattractive my only complaint is the installation it was a pain and difficult to understand and I am not sure if it is installed correctly instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat other then that it is not as tall as i had expected / hoped my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive but at least he has contained to the back seat,145,67
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,they walk under it often sometimes it is just a path from point a to b but the use it for grooming too they also use carpet floor part to stretch and scratch claws one of my two cats also likes to drag a blanket around the room and tries to go thru arch with it which usually results in it being dragged across room too or arch unsnapping it is not too hard to snap back into place tho,78,0
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,with cats it is hit or miss with a lot of items this one was a hit my cat loves to rub her face on the outside of the arch and she often claws at the mat I have had this for five years now and it still looks like new highly recommended,51,1

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,easy to assemble this thing has lasted forever my cat uses it daily to purr against scratch at the carpet pad and just generally play around with in my only complaint is it took my cat about 5 minutes to pull the ball off the string but that was an easy fix if this arch groomer ever dies i will most surely buy another for her,67,13
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,looks exactly like the picture the only issue is that my cat will not use it at all,17,14
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,we are a multiple cat household all of them will use it and some in different ways they also like stretching their claws on the base or on the edges of the base they seem to enjoy using it as a door or laying under the arch simplewith great results,53,15
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,not very sturdy especially if you have a big cat,10,16

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,this arch groomer is flimsy and lightweight moves around too much for the cats to even really brush themselves my cats do not like to lay on the groomer as the photo shows but instead circle around it this groomer just does not work for them and they stopped using it after one night,53,78
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cats love this from the moment i bought it my 2 cats have been all over it they love to lay on it scratch the carpet part and rub their heads against the arch they also love to bat at the yellow ball for the price it was a great investment and makes my 2 kitties very happy,59,79
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the yellow toy was destroyed in less than 30 seconds but the cats still play with the string it took both cats a while to start using this for it is intended purpose but they both like it you need a little muscle to assemble it,45,80

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat did not like it or use it so gave it to a neighbor so i tried the one with the actual arched brush on it and that one was a hit with my cat he uses that one everyday,41,89

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,one of my cats played with it for about 2 days then mangaged to tear the yellow ball off so now they do not play anymore maybe more consideration for a stronger attachment of the ball to the groomer would have made me give this more stars,46,116

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,we got this for our two cats ages 6 and 7 who love being brushed we thought this might give them another option when we are busy we have had it for about a week now and neither one has shown an interest in it it is big enough for our 17 pound cat to fit through and well enough made it has rubber nibs on the inside and outside of the arch to rub against but so far no activity we are still hopeful that in time one of them will give it a try if not I shall give it to a friend who has little kitties they will play with anything,108,129
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,the cats liked it for the first 90 seconds then they ripped the ball at the top of it and totally forgot about this what a waste of money,29,130

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,i put it out for my cat and she smelled it a few times and then would have nothing to do with it i kept it for quite a while and then requested a refund and the company was very nice and refunded my purchase it may just be my cat i do not know but you know how they say cats are finicky she may be,66,137
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the cats treat this like they do everything else with fascination at first and then only occasionally give it a once over the ball came off almost immediately when the cats played with it which i expected no ball on string ever lasts long with cats they do like the plastic bristles and so it was worth the purchase,59,138
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,neither of my two cats will pay this any attention and even if i coax them to rub on it for a couple seconds it only picks up 1 or 2 hairs,32,139
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat loved the puffball to death very quickly i do find that the groomer slides some but she does play with it and enjoys it,26,140
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat has not figured it out yet he sleeps on it but that is it and it serves as an arch for a three year old boys to drive under,29,141

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,and they have all played with it but they do not seem to be prompted to actually use it for rubbing on and scratching themselves but they have only had them for a few days too,34,144
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cats must be flaky or something but all 3 of them hate this and so do the outside cats i dunno why,22,145
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,this is easy to assemble however the yellow ball had to be retied out for the way for assembly my cat likes to rub on things and he is slowly warming up to this product,35,146
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,the carpet that arrived with this product is not the same as in the picture in fact it is very different one piece had an elk on it also the texture is different than it appears in the picture the ball is a big hit although,46,147
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,it is just as it looks but my cats ignored it completely after a moment of curiosity my cats are two and three year olds it might work with kittens,30,148
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat found this toy mildly interested and occasionally still returns to it I have shown her how to scratch on the plastic parts but to her this is just a mat to scratch on the ball that was included broke off after a few months of rough play from my gatita,51,149
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,i have no clue how cats knew what to do with this thing but i guess they are smarter than i expect them to be both of my cats use this religiously they groom themselves and rub and play with the toy and even sleep in the middle of it at first when it arrived it looked thin and flimsy but after i assembled it i had no problems with it and it keeps the shape and form without breaking or unlocking cats love the carpeted bottom they love scratching it too,95,150
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat does not go anywhere near this thing and i have had it for a few months now it is smaller than i thought too so that may be why she does not use it,34,151
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cat does not like to be brushed but does like carpet and hanging balls so i thought this would be a win however she has never used it and does not show signs that she will,35,152

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i have purchased other types of harnesses for my mini lop but this was first one that my bun castiel will allow us to put on him he finally got to experience going outside this summer and he has so much fun running around sampling grass clovers and dandelions and binkying to his hearts content the harness is a smidge tight for him but that is probably due to him spoiled and overweight a touch,74,112

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,just giving some advice i went to my local pet store petsmart the other day and i was asking a 101 questions then i asked if those hardest things are good for little piggies apparently the back bones that the guinea pigs have are not fit for guinea pigs hence why they also do not have running wheels like most other little animals even although on the package it says for guinea pigs the store clerk said that just to get the harnests to sell because if you have ever noticed the little hunch guinea pigs have in their back then yeah you can see those harnests are not for them,107,126
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,the ring to hook the leash to came right off it says ok for a cat but our cat barely fit the harness would not recommend for anything other than a small rabbit if that,33,127

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,we have a small rabbit and thought this harness would be good for him if your rabbit is not used to being put into a harness it will take some time for the animal to get used it it the first time we tried to get it on him he is 10 months old it took an hour the second time was better also since our rabbit is not used to it he does not respond obediently when we redirect him in time i hope it will be fun for the whole family,90,134

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this was for a smaller rabbit but she easily slips out of it the velcro is on the bottom of the harness which to me is a poor design i think the over all product was not thought out well it would be easier to put on and take off if the opening / velcro were on the top or bottom,58,142

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,bought this for a guinea pig i would not recommend it it has a picture of a ferret and guinea pig on the leash but it is definitely more designed for a ferret guinea pigs have very thick short almost non-existent necks and this harness does not really accommodate that our guinea pigs front feet are always getting stuck he slips out of it if that happens it does seem to be made of quality material and my kids keep trying it on the pig because they love theof it it is easy to put on and velcros right into place it does work also it just does not quite fit the guinea pig physique,116,159

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,not even the same thing was sent to my house it is so small it is basically useless i regret every penny i spent on this,24,165
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,thiswas useless if a small rat could not fit nor a large rat i do not understand how a ferret would fit either sad to say this was a bad investment my rats were able to slip right out of the harness i really do not know what small pet this could work for but i would say definitely not a rat and probably not a ferret either,67,166
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,good quality and all but only fits my smaller rat the bigger rat which is not even all that big to begin with is too chubby for the belly strap,29,167

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,the mediumdoes not fit on my guinea pig although he is a larger guinea if i were to make him wear it it would squeeze his neck and chest for an average or larger guinea i would recommend a bigger size,42,172
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we got black and it fit our two month old dwarf bunny perfect,13,173
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,after trying a few types of leashes we finally found one that works well with our bunny he is safe in the leash and does not bite through it not that he loves being on a leash he does not but at least he gets to go outside and eat some grass this way,52,174
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,you got to be kidding there is no proper way to actually mount this thing on a rabbit where it actually stays on the rabbit darts and your left holding a harness and leash,33,175
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,it fit my rabbit but my rabbit would get away and slipped of it not worth it you can come up with something better in your own house,28,176
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,fits the little cat well but i did sew in a little elastic around the neck,16,177
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,this is a piece of crap you get what you pay for,12,178
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,product seems well made but i can not really test it because it is impossible to get it on a rat i have four rats ranging from incredibly squirmy too very very docile none of which i could successfully get the harness on so they could walk in it i would not recommend it for rats unless they are very well trained from an early age,64,179
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,bought it and my guinea pig can not use it he slipped right out,13,180

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this leash is not rabbit sized this harness is for a ferret rat or guinea pig i do not have any of these animals so i wish i knew it was that small,33,182
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,the large barely fit my small bunnies think dutch or smaller like polish or dutch anything bigger will not fit this is made for small animals like guinea pig ferret or rat,32,183
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,material is the key it is breathable and stretchy great quality given rabbit liked to try and sneak out was not big fan of thei got red but love the material,32,184
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,my dwarf rabbit fit in this and the material was good because he could not slide out it worked well until he grew out of it this product is good for tiny rabbits,32,185
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,the stitching on theundid itself when i opened it and the leash was in five little peices that were not attatched,22,186
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought for my granddaughters rabbit fit great she has a lion hair rabbit the girls like taking it outside of his cage and letting him roam in the grass,30,187
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,seller delivered as promised the manufacturer is skimping on quality i have purchased a number of these vests to help with kitten and cat training and the tabs that go around the body of the animal were always soft so as not to irritate that is not the case with the extra large size the tabs are too short and the velcro is very stiff and is squared off and will irritate the animal as it moves i am going to see if i can fix this as the soft mesh material is wonderful I am glad i did not buy more returning it would have been a hassle too bad,110,188
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,says colors may vary but came in lime green which is the theme of his cage so that made me happy it looks like comfy material and like it will be comfy for my ferret,34,189
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i bought this for my 5 month old dutch thinking the large would fit but it did not i can not get it tight enough for him he slips right out I am going to be getting a smaller one although it was great did not bother with the leash although,47,190
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,well like with any small pet this is a struggle to put on and i still have not put it on yet haha working on it and i can not wait to take out my little bunnies in them i got a red one in the mail and it is perfect for both genders so far it is nice and the material is very breathable good product,65,191
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i sent it back the next day it was not the right size orthe company did not give you a optionalchoice so i received whateverthey sent which was red on a girl puppy preference would have been pink,41,192
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we have 2 pet rabbits and they each have afits well stays-on good velcro and snaps my 5-year-old puts it on the rabbit by herself,27,193
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i have a dwarf rabbit and unlike the other reviews that say this harness does not fit their small pet because it is too small mine does not fit my bunny because it is slightly too big i know one day he will grow into it so i do not regret this purchase,47,194
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,please send me another one and please message me my rabbit is 1 year old i need a bigger leach,20,195
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i have 3 rabbits and am hoping to get 2 rats i bought this at petsmart and my bunnies can just wiggle out if i do get rats I am hoping that they can not just wiggle out the way that my bunnies can the leash is really short so neither can go very far also it can easily be chewed through if you were not paying attention which you should be then the pet could knaw through it and run away,78,196
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,my daughter needed a harness for her rabbit this one fit perfectly she got a red one the rabbit loves it and they walk every day,26,197
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,would have given this a 5 star but do not think the size description is accurate we have 7 guinea pigs ranging in size from small to large and this harness is perfect only for the smaller ones who are now 3 months old there is a little growing room but not much,53,198
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,this is just too cute and the quality is really great for something so small i got it for my sister she says it was great,26,199
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,works for are piggy wonderfully fits great and even although i ordered it in red it came in blue but blue is what we originally wanted to it worked out,30,200
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i purchased a large but could not even use it because it was too small i also did not like how you could not pick theyou wanted,28,201
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,fits my bunny but she always finds a way to get out of it mine came in pink and she looks absolutely adorable in it very fast shipping,28,202
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i liked this harness because a have an extremely small russian blue cat however i hav never had a bunny so i would not know if they pull it only has one real buckle so if moonshadow or any other cat wanted to break away from this harness it would really be quite simple i really do like this harness but i recommend getting a stirdy collar even one from the store and sewing the buckle to where the strap around the belly goes-just to be safe,87,203
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i actually purchased this harness for a 2 lb toy schnauzer no other harness would fit this little guy i purchased thisin the hopes it would work and it does fits perfectly and does not obstruct the dogs limbs,41,204
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i bought this pet harness in the medium size for a holland lop rabbit the harness measurements are listed as 6 - 8 neck and 10 - 11 waist the actual neck measurement on this harness is 7 including 1 1/2 overlap for fastening there is no way i would put an adjusted 5 1/2 neck opening around an animal with a 6 or greater neck the waist opening 9 is also smaller than stated although i could stretch it almost to 10 again too tight for the stated waist size i have used a similar harness for our holland lop escape artist rabbit if the harness was the size i needed i would be very happy with this new one i purchased it is not the size i wasto believe so my other child has a new leash for the stuffed animals not a total loss,143,205
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,perfect size for my rat and the leash was a multi purpose just long enough to walk my chihuahua too it fit him perfectly and i was able to walk him just fine with it,35,206
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,was sent what i was promised it was quick and easy i appreciate the quick shipment even although i did pay for it,23,207
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,perfect fit simple design just what i needed although we do not use it much it is a nice thing to have,21,208
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this is way small my bunny is between medium and large and neither fit him well he hates it and thrashes when i put it on if it fit better it would be worth it but oh well,38,209
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this product was advertised for a large small pet unfortunately it will not fit my rabbit who is large was not as advertised,22,210
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,pretty nice construction and so far it is the most comfortable harness I have seen on the market for rabbits this extra-large size fits my 6 lb mini-holland lop pretty well i got the large size as well to try it out but it was 1 too short on all the closures it is still a bit tight so i would not get this for an animal any larger than 6 lb also fyi my lop is a breed with a short torso so i find the harness pooches annoyingly in the back where the shoulder gathers my bunny still seems pretty comfortable although,98,211
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i have a 6 lb mini holland lop and this was about 1 too small for the neck and the torso closures there should be enough room to slide 2 fingers in easily i tried the xl size and that fit ok although if your animal is larger than 6 lbs it is likely they will be too big seems comfortable good materials and construction,63,212
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,theof this product is great my daughter would love to take her rats outside for a change of scenery however no matter how many times we adjusted them each of rats would shift backwards out of the harness within seconds rats just do not have the mass in their shoulders or large enough arms to hold the harness in place i have a friend who successfully uses this harness on a rabbit but for us they are useless i do not recommend this product for pet rats,88,213
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i bought this for my english lop and it seemed a little small at first i took him outside into the grass and he ran under a parked car i tried to pull him out but he would not move he kept on struggling and moving backwards and he finally slipped out of the harness and ran away luckily i brought his cage with me and caught him,67,214
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i would have given 5 stars but it is way to small i do not know how they can say it is a large quality and comfort looks great i have a 5 lb kitten and it would not fit,36,215
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,what animal wants their neck yanked on this is a much more comfortable way of taking your bunny out for play and exercising he / she will not get their neck yanked on and for a bunny who does not like leashes maybe this will help theattaches on the back part of thewhich is much better than on a neck,60,216
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we were very pleased with our walkloved thegreen also all around a great product we would buy thisagain if we had a nother guinea pig,30,217
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i love this it is very nice and it will not choke the bunny it is easy just to click and hold and let the bunnys explore my bunny had no problem with it and he acted like it was not even on i also like the bell on it just in case i ever drop the lease that i can find him hopefully that will not be the case of me loosing him,70,218
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i love thebut the way this thing is designed puts the front of the harness around the animals neck in order for them to not slip out it needs to be a little tighter too felt like i was choking my animal i would not recommend this design,49,219
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,the company that shipped the product was professional and cared a lot about customer service the product itself was well made and it did it is job well enough my problem is with how it was designed the product is supposedly designed to fit both ferrets and rabbits but i found it to fit my rabbit very uncomfortably i had the adjustable neck strap as tight as i could get it while i had the adjustable torso strap as loose as i could have it it was still too tight around my rabbits torso and loose enough around her neck that she was able to squeeze out of it a little at one point i think it leans a little towards fitting ferrets rather than a rabbit i thought that the adjustable strap would make it possible for my rabbit to grow into a little bit but she completely grew out of it in a week because of how tight the torso strap was to begin with if you have a ferret it is probably a great fit with rabbits i suggest waiting until they reach their full maturity before getting one,191,220
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,it probably fits a larger small pet but not a hamster who just wriggles right out of it unfortunately for us we own a hamster and not a different animal too bad,32,221
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,bought 2 of these my rabbits are kind of big rabbit got out of it right away and almost ran off,21,222
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,even although thesays it would fit my size rabbit it was way too small my rabbit could not move around in it when i tried to return it has gotten lost in the mail and i have not been refunded for the purchase,45,223
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i think this might fit a teacup chihuahua but it might even be too small for that tiny dog it looks like it was made for a doll a very small doll i returned it,35,224
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,you have to make sure you train your pet into liking it / being able to use it my guineapig kept walking out of it until i spent enough time usually 2 minute intervals with it on and me petting him then taking it off for 5 minutes then putting it back on for 2 minutes and more until he learned to keep it on and now we walk around campus having fun on his leash,73,225
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i tried it with my hamster he could just slip out of it it was a great thought but do not try it on any kind of hamster,27,226
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,my cat goes from fourteen to twenty pounds her and elizabeth taylor however this would not fit her at her most svelt let alone during her managed to get other people to give me treats and xtra food times more appropriate for a tubby kitten perhaps not adult cat like a maine coon or just hefty normal cat,56,227
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,one of the plastic clips broke while i was taking it off the cardboard could not even use it not worth even the time and effort to return,27,228
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,thewas awesome but the fact that they sent the wrong size of harness makes me mad i have three rabbits and a small does not fit them i needed a medium,32,229
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought this for a small female lionhead rabbit who has always naturally been very slender she has small for an adult female even her dewlap is smaller than a typical female rabbit i went to the petstore and looked at the large size it is too small for a rabbit unless you have a very small breed even the xl would be too tight on a larger breed if you want one for a larger / heavier rabbit i recommend looking elsewhere or simply sew on more velcro to the straps it works great and still keeps them secure for my rabbit although this is a great harness the material seems strong and has a little stretch in it for comfort i was worried about the neckline but she did not have a problem with it it did not constrict her the slip around strap on the neckline gives me added security she hopped around quite happily the leash is short although just pick up a longer one at the petstore or the dollar store i can not imagine her being able to slip out of this harness i could not beat the price or the quality very happy,191,230
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,definitely not for small pets my daughter was incredibly disappointed when she could not walk her pets it just went to waste,21,231
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i got thisand leash for my mini-lop rabbit he is average size for a mini-lop about 6lbs and had to get the extra-large the large probably would have fit him but it seemed a little snug it is somewhat adjustable if you have a large breed you may want to consider buying it in person at a store for easy return if it does not fit it does run very small but it is a very nice harness fairly easy to put on and he seems comfortable in it he has never managed to escape from it but is a very calm bunny and does not seem to mind wearing it the leash is not that long but i feel like that gives me more control of the rabbit although do not expect to be able to walk a bunny like you would a dog ours is a darker royal blue very niceoverall a nice harness if you can get the right size,163,232
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i have little chihuahuas and it looks cute on them good for a triple coat chi as it does not mess up it is fur,23,233
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i thought that thewas a good fit for my bunny i have a mini rex which is like a medium sized rabbit so it is good that it is adjustable and it seems to be comfy for him theis stretchy so that keeps him from choking when he hops to fast for me to keep up it is easy to get on he does not struggle too much and he really likes to go outside i got it because i wanted him to be able to go out but i do not have the money or the time to build a rabbit run also everyone goes nuts when they see me walking my rabbit because he has so adorable well worth it,120,234
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,we bought this for our young guinea pig and after several attempts we gave up because it just does not fit the reviews for rabbits seems to be ok but it definitely does not work on g-pigs,35,235
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i hate thisbig rip off we tried to get this stupid harness on the hampster for an hour but it never holds the hampster in,28,236
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,when i first got the leash i tried it on my bunny she did not like the leash at first and was struggling to get it on her but i managed to get it on her the leash is not that good but you can hook a different one on it i got a bluewhich is a light pretty blue i have not tryed to walk her outside cuz i recommend that u get the bunny used to the leash so she will not slip outthe shipping was very fast too u,91,237
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i was a 2 lb rabbit and this harness was way too small for him i think it is intended for a ferret or a slimmer animal nothing with a round middle it will not ever fit,36,238
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,a harness is great when i want to givea little more freedom than just his pen he does fight me to put it on although,27,239
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,although it is difficult to getto wear his harness it does fit and i feel safer when he is outside of his pen,25,240
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,mislead the size and the fit and became too difficult to return to we kept it even although it did not fit,20,241
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i have a juvenile dwarf rabbit seven weeks old when i got him and less than 2 pounds this harness was still much too small it says it can be used for rabbits but i think it would only fit rats small gerbils and ferrets,45,242
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,did not fit my pet rat and one of them is pretty big they just slip out of it so completely pointless and not what i thought it was,28,243
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,we puchased these for our 3 guinea pigs and they are awful the leashes do not fit on the animal we tried in vain for 45 minutes to get these to work and the guinea pig simply puts it is front paws through the front of the velcro and slips right out we woud have returned these products the three we purchased but the kids were so excited thinking they would work that they tore the packaging do not waste your money these should not even be sold,88,244
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,fits my rabbit nicely i love to take him on a walk with this my only complaint is that the leash is way too short and the bell fell off very quickly,32,245
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,safe harness for a small chihuahua came with leash and is nice would buy for another dog and wish i had,21,246
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,very well made i would like it a size smaller for my purpose although i wanted it for my chipmunk but he is too small for it and slipped right out other than size i believe it well made and well designed,42,247
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,mine came in black which is perfect because my bunny is a boy and also has black fur c he is a lion head rabbit and it fits perfectly,29,248
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,my guinea pig is less than one year old and this harness was still too small for him the neck is too tight and even once i expanded it with velcro the waist was too tight anyway he looks ridiculous in it and does not like it one bit I am sure it works fine for ferrets but do not buy it for a guinea pig both you and your cavy will be disappointed,71,249
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i liked it over all but there was some things that could change i did not like that they did not have a clip for the belly it came off all the time but it fit good the leash could be longer so they could run more,47,250
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought this for a lizard but it is too big just yet when my tegu gets a bit bigger I shall get a lot of use from it very high quality very sturdy harness i did a lot of tugging and what not mydaughter uses it right now for her rat at her mothers house and she says it is very secure so i probably have to order another one the only downside is that i can not pick my own,82,251
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,this scratching post is useless unless you modify it like i did my cat would not touch it i ordered sisal rope and some catnip spray i wrapped the sisal rope around the entire cat tree and secured the rope with a hot glue gun here and there then i sprayed the rope with a very strong catnip spray and now my cat loves it cats are naturally attracted to sisal rope and i hated of theof wasting my money since the cat was not using it prior to adding rope another bad thing is that this scratching post is very lightweight if you use it in the upright position when the cat scratches it will fall right over so i only use mine in the laying down position so unless plan on modifying this do not waste your money,139,0
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,i bought this about a month ago my cat uses it sometimes but not as much as her cardboard scratcher i will occasionally put a little catnip on it to generate more interest although i have observed her rubbing on it at random times without me adding catnip she does likes it also i think it does better laying on the side rather than standing up,66,1
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,the scratching post broke off of the stand when my cat used it,13,2
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,my cats completely ignore this scratching post in fact they scratch the chair right next to it and behind it,20,3
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,fabulous scratching post my cat loves it subtle and attractive,10,4
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,not good quality at all the post would not even fit in the base,13,5
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,the cats love it as someone else mentioned it will not stand up on it is own if a cat is scratching it it is too lightweight for that and will tip over but my cats love it and we just keep it tipped over they stand on it lay on it or over it and hide things under it they wrestle with it and scratch their chins on the edges of the bottom piece they love it and laying flat there is no problem with them scratching the heck out of it so it may not appear to be as sturdy as a wooden stand up post but if you are creative actually the cats tipped it the way they wanted it and just tip it on it is side it works great i would buy another the carpet is a very tight knit indoor-outdoor type carpet and does not fray like the stand up rug posts my cats do not like the sisal rope scratchers so we are left with the rug posts that fray and they destroy or something like this,181,6
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,i stand it upright with the feet tucked under the chair the cats over the years shredded we then reupholstered in microfiber and weight the feet under there with a couple of dumbells happy cat safe chair happy me,39,7
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,these are pretty much the only scratching post my cat will use i should have never introduced her to it originally they sold these at petco but now i can only find them on amazon they are great and last forever,41,8
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,good price if your cats like it my cat and kittens do not find this scratch-post amusing we got this one as opposed to the big jungle-gym types because we thought it would be more appropriate for the older cat but no one likes it standing up nor lying down they prefer the rugs over this maybe I shall try the jungle-gym,61,9
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,our cat loves the one we purchased for her four years ago buy you can imagine the condition it was in after that amount of time we could not find it in our local stores amazon had a fair price and it was delivered promptly,45,10
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,this post is great for cats who like to scratch the carpet or furniture with the heavy upholstered weave it is not for all i have sisal rope post that cost 75 the best quality made and my cat barely touches it he loves this one it is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch i love the raised curvedas i prop it beneath a chair and it is the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4s to scratch my cat is 17 lbs mostly muscle and has not encountered any issues pulling it out of place when it is secure in that fashion,128,11
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,i got this for my cat a few months ago and he will not even look at it I have tryed showing him what it is and put his paws on it and still nothing I have have nt tried the cat nip stuff but hes never had it so I am not sure if that would help any i would not buy it again,59,12
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,a very nice cat scratching post that was reasonably priced and rather attractive for a piece of carpet on a stick the compact size make it ideal for an apartment and it is nice that it can either stand up or lay down it is a bit wobbly when standing up although my cat loves having it tipped over so she can chase her toys around it,66,13
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,we have a dog that always wants to chew on the bottom of the bed post we tried several different things but were forced shut the dog out of the room until we found this product it works great and has given the dog full run of the house again,50,0
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,most effective product i have found i used it on an outdoor tree that one of my dogs was found of eating i have both a large lab and a small aust cattle dog both were curious at first but neither were found of the smell and left the tree alone product is also effective at repelling humans i gaged nearly each time i applied it i did not try the product indoors thus i do not know what lingering influence it would have on people largest downside i see is the need to reapply occasionally i reapplied to my outdoor plants once every 10 days,107,1
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,cleared my sinuses right out taste and smell does tend to linger seems to deter my cat pretty well suggest using in well-ventilated environment,24,2
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,the reviews are right this does not really work my puppies did not like the taste however they still licked on it they would just shake their heads after they lick it then lick on it again i would not buy it again,40,3
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,i used this for my puppy that was teething and biting everything that was in sight i used this spray and saw results immediately she had stopped chewing furniture rugs plants shoes even my other dog ha very harsh smell but be careful you can actually taste it which is very bitter soapy taste to it blargh otherwise it worked well for my pooch,64,4
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,we have got a young lab that will chew on anything and was pulling up / chewing up our neighbors solar yard and walkway lights i sprayed this all over the new ones i bought to replace the damaged ones the dog left them alone for about 3 weeks then i found one back at our place but not chewed up i sprayed it reset it and resprayed all of the other ones again this does seem to work,77,5
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,awesome stuff it stopped my puppy from chewing on the molding around the floor knawing off our paint and huge chips of wood our wooden chairs and anything else we did not want her destroying i also recommend telling them no that is not your toy and then giving them one of they are toys that they are allowed to chew on and say chew on your toy to help redirect that behavior it is natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on but this spray really helps to let them know what they can not touch it is really powerful stuff definitely hold your breath when spraying it a mask would probably be better because if you breathe it in while it is airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes horrible,142,6
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,not only did it not deter my puppy he actually likes to lick it this was no help to me,20,7
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,spraying this on things actually attracted our dog she was obsessed with licking it in fact even more than before sigh,21,8
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,when i sprayed it i tasted the bitter in the air i think it had more I shall affect on me than it did my pet it did not deter the chewing i used it unsparingly and repeatedly to no avail,40,9
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it was a waste of money for my puppy he seemed to like the taste it would actually attract him wherever i sprayed it,24,10
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,this was ineffective in preventing my dog from chewing things i ended up buying cinnamon oil food grade which finally did the trick,23,11
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,alright so i tried this on two of my pets a shih tzu and a miniature pig i mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and i wanted to discourage it before it became a problem well this stuff arrived and i figured i should test how good it is or rather how bad it tastes both pets generally take anything from my hand that i offer and then spit it out if they do not like it so for my test i tried a plain old scrap of paper sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu he ate it and then asked for more then did this with the pig as well same result they both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was i going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff i repeated the process once more to be sure i then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean needless to say i decided not to spray it on my carpet since both of my pets seemed to love the taste,201,12
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it does not work as well as other products my dog does not seem to mind the taste when you spray it on things the fine mist goes in the air and you breathe it in and you can taste it it is horrible it also has an awful smell to it,49,13
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,these are perfect for my little girl and she uses them on cold days they stay on unlike many others we have tried,23,0
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,once your dog gets used to these boots they are very helpful to the pup like the double strap still slips but does not get cold,25,1
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,i bought these for my pooch he has an eleven pound shihtzu the extra small boots were loose around his paws and he was very uncomfortable wearing them he has rubbber boots that fit more snuggly and has no problem wearing those the velcro strap also does not do much and they came off just wearing them in the house the only good thing was i was able to return them for a full refund with no questions,76,2
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,my dogs front paws are larger than the other two i specifically measured and bought the right size size seems just a bit bigger so the straps can not be tightened enough it started to flap out during the walk and i was shocked to see the he got a bleeding blister from his old wounds it would have been better it fit and stayed on in one place but it goest flap flap flap i may need to come up with anto some how tighten it you may want to buy a smaller size because of above price is too steep for me to just try and throw away was looking forward to it hmm 2 stars,119,3
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,much better than other boots I have bought stay on and durable,11,4

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,it took a while to figure out how to get them to stay on but once i did they have my 19 year old shih tzu even occasionally run on the slippery wood floors,34,6
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they stayed on my pups feet for a few blocks and then they slipped right off my dog is about 10 lbs,22,7
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,can not get my dog to wear them he keeps trying to shake off his feet i have a chihuahua and he has picky about every thing,25,8
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these seem to be made well but the sizes are really big for being extra small did not fit on the dog very well so i have not really used them much,30,9
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,simply did not stay on the paws of my pug not sure if it is a breed-specific problem but were useless to me also do not look very durable,26,10
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,just as described but my miniature long haired dashaund was able to shake them off in a few seconds no matter how i put them on might work better on a less hairy breed or a dog more tolerant of things on them he likes clothes but was not digging the shoes,53,11
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,velcro ties do not adjust and fit properly on my dogs paws i thought these were water proof but did not meet up with my expectations a bit disappointed constantly have to check to make sure boots are on dogs paws while walking in the snow occasionally slipping off paws,51,12
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these fall off of my dogs feet no matter how tight i get them,14,13
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,dog was able to undo and remove instantly,8,14
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,they do not stay on when it snows or on rough terrain no matter how tight i make them,18,15
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the boots are not waterproof and do not stay on purchased them for our 18 pound pug they are a little large the problem we have is they will not stay on because the velcro is stiff and is not elastic at all our other dog boots from fashion pet are the same except they have elastic with the velcro at the ends and they stay on the elastic does not hold up although the other problem with ultra paws is they have a large foam pad stitched on the inside back of the boot which serves no purpose and actually made the boot not stay on at all removed the pad with a seam ripper and we now have a 30 chance of returning with them on,126,16
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,well made but my beagle would not wear them,9,17
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the quality seemed good but they were too big and i had to send them back it is hard to know how to order them online,25,18

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,easy to put on and my dog does not object to them,11,20
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,completely failed to stay on and have turned into an occasional chew toy,13,21
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,quick delivery delayed a little bit by a massive blizzard boots are good although we may have benefitted from a size smaller because they do fall off if they are not on tightly very easy to out in and take off which is huge when you have a squirmy dog who constantly wants to go out,55,22
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i got x small my 10 shihtzu fits great in them velcro closure makes it easy to put on and tighten up his paws are a little lost in the boot we need them for the cold temps so he can withstand the snow while going out to do his business,52,23
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,got these for my 25ish pound miniature schnauzer who loves snow but is having issues with snow andballs forming between her toes when i take her snow shoeing these work better than i thought they would if you take the time to make sure they are on tight they stay on very well it was pretty funny watching her try them on for the first time have your phone ready to make the video once she hit the snow however she got it and off she went just like a puppy again,94,24
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,although the sizing was a bit off slightly large despite closely following the instructions and measuring twice these dog boots were exactly as described unfortunately the dog was less than impressed with them was afraid he would do more damage to his hips trying to get rid of them than simply walking without them it was worth a shot and I had bet the effectiveness heavily depends upon the dogs personality not docking the review for that just one star off because of the sizing issue,83,25
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,unfortunately I have had an extremely hard time keeping these on my pups feet they fall off within a few minutes of a walk,23,26
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,does not fit my dog and a full refund does not cover shipping cost,12,27
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they looked nice but even small or xsmall was to big from my dog so i returned them before my dog would have broken a leg,26,28
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,reasonable product but the x-small were huge on my 75 lb chi-weenie,12,29
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these boots were way bigger than advertised it seems like someone could actually design boots to work on dogs but nothing I have seen is designed well the only upshot was is that my dogs spent more time trying to get them off which distracting them from digging more holes in the yard but it only took five minutes for them to get them off,64,30
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the boots are really nicer than expected however my dog hates them and tries to pull them off,18,31
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the price was great and the shipping really quick i do recommend this seller for that reason the booties work most of the time on our elderly dachshund keeps him from slipping on our hardwood floors however they do tend to slip off because they are not formed to fit a dogs leg outside they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top i think these would work much better and stay on longer if there they were shaped to fit the bend of a dogs leg where the ankle is i think i might bend them and put a stitch there to give them a boot shape instead of mitten shape they really do help although and it is so funny watching them get used to walking in them,132,32
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the xs were way too big for 4 lb yorkie they looked like ridiculous hotpads on her paws she could not walk in them the bootie hotpads fell off immediately come in a package of 4,34,33
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they do not stay on during short walk,8,34
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,boots kept falling of my old dogs paws may have been due to the wy he walks,17,35
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my dog is older and has been dragging his back paws for awhile now it makes it difficult for him to walk on the hardwood and vinyl floors in our house these boots work great and he does not mind wearing them i highly recommend them,45,36
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,the ultra paws worked great for my pappilion in the snow and freezing rain the velcour kept them on snug and they were easy to put on and take,29,37
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,purchased these after returning another product and these are great my pomeranian was having trouble going outside in our cold ohio winters and these kept her feet warm and she was able to be out longer they stay on well as long as you make them tight would recommend if you live in a cold winter state,58,38
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,durable very waterproof and easy to put on and take off for doggy would definetly reccommend these for others,20,39

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,i was skeptical when ordering what seemed like such a small size for my medium size dog when the boots arrived they fit perfect follow the sizing guidelines and you will not be disappointed,33,41
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,once he got used to them on his paws he loved it walked 1/2 mile in 6 in of snow with no problem,22,42
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i bought these for my puggle pug beagle mix she is very hot / cold sensitive and this winter we have been having has really taken a toll on her when we go out to do her business she literally shivers and holds her paws up off the ground we live in the midwest and it has not been above 20 here for over 30 days now after getting used to these going outside is not as painful for her now she can scamper all around without having to lift her paws while she stands the only complaint i have is the measuring system these were an x-small and i measured as the instructions said to but they are still quite large on her so just be sure to note that they do run a little bit bigger than what you would expect the xx small would have fit better but these will certainly do other than that no complaints with the product,157,43
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,these boots are durable warm keep her feet dry and most importantly stay on her feet definitely a must have,20,44
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,i followed the sizing guidelines and believe it or not my 70 pound german shepherd required x small boots they are the correct width and they fit snugly over her paws but they are far too short and they do not go up past her wrist so they frequently slip off the top material is easily penetrated by her claws and they are coming apart after just a few days,69,45
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,we live in minnesota and have many sub-zero days when it was impossible for our bichon to stay outside more than 30 seconds with these boots she does not mind the cold at all they allow us to go for walks even on the coldest days she was cooperative about using them right from the start and i can get all four on in 30 seconds just make sure you pull the fastener really tightly and they will not come off,79,46

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,we hit 40f yesterday and even although our shih tzu is not crazy about wearing them ultra paws save his feet but i do not like wearing mittens either on most walks 1 block round trip or less he usually throws one or two off so i have to keep my eyes on the road but the ultra paws have made it possible to take those winter walks and pee on all his favorite snow banks one nice touch i noticed was a pad sewn into the inside on the upper part where the velcro wraps around the leg it makes it a bit more comfortable for him when i wrap those velcros around his ankle one of the straps was split and i had to use another strip of velcro in order to use the boot,136,48
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i tried several brands and they would come off when my dog was in a full run these stay on in long distances the tred could be a little thicker and they make the paws sweat but other than that they are golden,43,49

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i have a toy french poodle four years old and his name is chunky roberto around twelve pounds usually in winter he was getting his paws and fur wet and i decided to give this product a try is a plus to make sure about the size triple check i got the xs and worked perfect make sure you tight enough so when your pet run the will not come off still working with chunky to put it on he does not like it and i understand is not his nature but once outside he walks and run as nothing first time shoes for my dog it was not bad good for after rain and snow not very wet paws,121,53
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,i have a 13 lb cavalier king charles-poodle mix i ordered the x-small boots her paws measured 1 1/2 the boots looked a little bulky when i first saw them but once i got them on and tightened both straps they seemed to fit well having 2 straps to secure them makes a huge difference there is also foam on the front and the back to help secure the boot around the leg as others have mentioned these are not great for snow more than a couple inches deep i let my dog run through the snow which is about 6 deep and she did get some snow on her legs right above the boots however the boots were tight enough to prevent snow getting inside leaving her paws completely dry we will definitely be using this when we go on walks in the winter,144,54

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,do not let the name fool you these are not meals but an odd assortment of snacks some of these products were good but others just had a strange taste in the name of extra protein the taste is not worth how much you are paying for these,47,18

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,this is definitely not meant to be your standard snack it is a health food and should be expected to taste like one personally I have enjoyed a lot of the flavors they offer some of them leave a funny taste in your mouth but the same could be said for protein shakes these snacks are tasty healthy and at a reasonable price so i will be happily buying them again,70,41
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,a real waste of my money boring very little flavor,10,42
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,this product is going to help me out so much i bought the box just to use the individual treats as snacks while at work but after reading the insert i am going to order again and begin the program i can not stand ultra sweet or super salty snacks so i avoid chips cookies crackers and more when i searched for healthy snacks and saw that these were not your average junk food i bought them to try out i will say that the odd texture on some is not surprising considering they are gluten free other than that i have nothing but good words for the flavors when you create the meals by adding fresh fruits and vegetables yogurt and the other suggested products you will save yourself calories control your portions and ultimately feel better,134,43
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,i loved a few of the flavors and some did not care for as much it is great for me to throw in my bag for a healthy snack that is high protein,31,44

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,if i was smarter I had leave a bad review so they stay in stock and reduce price,17,47
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,after reading some bad reviews I am confident about leaving mine because i do not want them to stop producing those it is true not every single taste can be your favorite but it is so personal what i loved my husband did not and other way around but theof crunchy snack that is full of proteins not fat and sugar and does not cost 5 per ounce I am not on any sort of diet but i am on the run and for me one of those bags plus an apple is a perfect lunch option advice get this box try what has inside and then buy only flavors you like amazon sells them individually in packs of 6 ps I am lactose intolerant for last 9 years and because of those i can enjoy flavors like mac and cheese pizza or cheddar sticks again,144,48
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,every single 1 of these pack are absolutely delicious i did not buy it for the weight loss benefit although that is a definite advantage i was looking for a gluten free something that tasted like real food and i certainly did find it,42,49

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,bought these in the hopes of having something nutritious around for the family to snack on but this company has not been at all successful in getting pea protein to taste decent the snacks do fill you up and are better for you than potato chips or something so we we are able to get through about half the box but the rest we just had to dump as we could not get past the taste,74,51
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,my husband and kids hated these i was okay with them until halfway through the bag it started tasting gummy,19,52
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,useful when i forget to eat but some of the flavors are a bit weird of course i do not ever buy regular snack foods with bbq and other flavors never liked them i wish i could hand pick what goes in the box the cookie and cinnamon and parmesan flavors are my favs cheeses without extra flavorings stuck in are my other favorites being a gastric bypass patient and celiac these are very useful,74,53
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,bought these for my gluten free wife and she loves them,11,54
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,greatgreat packaging great nutritional content best case description this product tastes like flavored cardboard yuck can not imagine looking forward to this snack,24,55
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,i was surprised to see low stars i thought they were great but I have been gluten free for over 6 years for the cost convenience nutrition and being girlfriend i think they deserve 5 stars,35,56
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,most of the items tasted stale to me i have had better gluten free products i did like the chili and one other,23,57
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,this is a great way to determine what flavors you like best i love the cereals and the cheese flavored items some of the other flavors are not my favorite but even my 8 year old nephew who is very picky ate the cereal without complaint this is a much more nutritious option that most cereals or chips out there i also love the portion control because of the small bags i have to make myself only eat one but these are perfect for the office or school lunch bag,90,58
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,these were for my college aged daughter to take to her classes and be able to eat a quick snack in between classes keep her energy up and be able to slide into her back pack easily before leaving home she tries to eat healthy due to an autoimmune disease so products that are made more naturally are a must for her so glad there are products like this out there to choose from,75,59
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,if you have had any kind of wls this is perfect seriously,12,60
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,i did not realize this was part of a diet program it seems to be some sort of lose weight in a few weeks thing and that said it might be fine for it is intended purpose but i just wanted a high protein snack to replace the chips and cookies i love but do not need i wanted to like them i tried and they are not flavorless like some reviews said they have plenty of flavor but the flavor is awful truly and if you can get past the awful flavor you have to deal with the chalky gritty texture i give them two stars for a greatbut they failed in every other way sorry kays naturals,126,61
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,filled me up better than your average snack i keep these in my classroom cupboard for days when i do not have time for lunch the high protein content leaves me feeling much fuller than your typical snack if people have not eaten gluten free foods before then the texture might seem odd but i liked all the ones i have tried so far the flavors are not as powerful as snacks you are used to but i find typical flavored snacks to be overly flavored so again i liked them i have tried about 5 of the items so far,99,62
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,nasty tasteless ugh I shall never buy this again,8,63
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,my husband needed protein on the go and this fit the bill as others have described some bags are amazing and others are not if i could give 35 stars i would because it sucks to spend the money and have 75 be great but it is as described so 4 will do,53,64

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,if someone complains about the flavor of these snacks they have ridiculous expectations these are low calorie high protein snacks and some of the best i have ever tried,29,66
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,they all taste pretty good having celiac disease it is frustrating finding gluten free snacks that taste good and are not made solely of corn the price is pretty reasonable as well am going to buy again definitely,37,67
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,i know the dates on the packages states they are not expired but many of them tastes very old like they have been in a cabinet for 1000 years i understand the bland taste but many tasted old veggie puffs and mac n cheese puffs along with the cereal were good but the rest are gross threw out many of them,61,68
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,taste is okay kind of expensive but works,8,69

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,greatbut some of the packages are not so pleasant tasting,11,77

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,I am a vertical sleeve gastrectomy gastric surgery patient and I am always looking for good sources of protein and kays natures has a lot of products that really suit my needs i would highly recommend the assortment so you can find the products that meet your taste requirements i could not live without the puffs and cookie bites i love the portability and the portion control not to mention the flavor so so much better than a lot of protein products that just taste like compressed cardboard all these products have a good texture and flavor this assortment will save you money in the long run instead of having to buy a case of something you do not know if you are going to like you can try it in the assortment i can almost guarantee there will be something you love and want to purchase a case of,145,80

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,these are tasty pretty filling and only 3 weight watchers smart points,12,87
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,these were ok but not great some were so hard i could not eat them i was hoping for sweet snacks but these were not,24,88
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,1.0,negative,this product had a horrible chemical taste i had to throw it out,13,0
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,4.0,positive,i bought these in a weak moment telling myself i would only eat 3 half the serving each day turns out i can not do it they are so good i had eaten all 6 of them before i knew it bam 420 calories 10 g of saturated fat and 18 g of fat in total i really can not figure out how hostess can cram that many calories into these little donuts i mean they are really dry inside so it does not seem possible they could have so much fat i have to believe it surely hostess would not label them to say they have way more calories than they actually do so like the muddy buddy snacks that did not taste all that great i am currently handing them out to the trick-or-treaters the younger children are not selecting these but the bigger ones age 7 and up are there are only a couple of packs left and i will be glad when this temptation is out of my house for taste i would give them 5 stars but i had to remove one because nutritionally they do not earn even one star,187,1
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,5.0,positive,i enjoy an occasional donut now and again and when i got these from amazon they were the absolute freshest donuts I have ever sank my teeth into oh my god soooo good want and so ordered,35,2
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,5.0,positive,i order these online because they are not available locally where i live and these are by far my favorite hostess snack i have tried competitors crunch donuts and i have not found any that i remotely like for me this is the snack donut that i can not live without it is not just me the whole family love these donuts if you want to bribe me with something then look no further if you are a fan of any of the competitors crunch snack donuts and you have not given the hostess crunch donuts a shot i highly recommend that you give them a try,102,3
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,2.0,negative,i actually love these crunch donettes unfortunately the ones i received were not fresh,14,4
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,5.0,positive,these things are perfect if you love the taste of toasted coconut you will like these not the healthiest of foods but as a once in awhile treat it can not be beat,32,5
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,1.0,negative,the donettes was not fresh very very dry crumble when eating,11,6
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,2.0,negative,they arrived here stale and did not taste very good they should not have been sold to me they need replaced it is the right thing to do,27,7
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,5.0,positive,ok these were good not great because it is just packaged donuts but i have lost my privileges of ever buying this many again shoot i ate two packages a day sitting at my computer ack one package seemed to be going on to the stale side but it was the last one and i was not letting that stop me be warned if you live alone buying these in bulk may be dangerous,73,8
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,2.0,negative,i got these donuts at astation i mistakenly picked these up instead of the crumb ones holy smackeral they were so sweet it made my eyes water it is like they were rolled in granulated sugar and a few coconut bits at 10 carbs per donette i will not be buying these again for those with a super sweet tooth these are probably for you,65,9
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,1.0,negative,taste better from the grocery store these arrived dried out,10,10
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,1.0,negative,they were very stale got a refund and tossed them in the trash,13,11
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,2.0,negative,when the title says 6 count pack of 10 it does not mean you get 6 boxes with 10 packages in each but rather 1 box with 10 packages with 6 donettes each so instead of getting 360 donettes 6 boxes x 10 packages / box x 6 per package you really only get 60 donettes 1 x 10 x 6 the box actually says 10 6 packs thus most people would think 6 count pack of 10 would mean 6 boxes,81,12
Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,5.0,positive,freeze them and have them with coffee in the morning a few at a time it is heavenly only place i know of you can get them in semi bulk best flavor imho,33,13

Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,4.0,positive,odd smell out of the box the flavor is good these are great if you want something as fast as a cup noodle product without the crazy amount of sodium,30,2
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,4.0,positive,should be called garlic garlic garlic noodles i like garlic but not printing the word on something with this much garlic is irresponsible,23,3
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,5.0,positive,love the way this tastes good flavor and does not have as much salt as regular ramen noodles do,18,4
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,2.0,negative,to each their own i did not enjoy the flavor i did not taste soy or ginger,15,5
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,4.0,positive,because of the way my new work schedule is i typically eat lunch at my desk however if i get super busy i sometimes am so distracted that i do not realize I am hungry or by the time i do it is almost time to go home so about a 1/3 of my packed lunches were going to waste these are nice alternatives i can keep them in my desk drawer and eat them when the mood strikes it tastes fine and will tide me over is it a super filling 5 star gourmet meal no but it is not meant to be the ingredient list is better than a cup-o-noodles and while anything like this has a lot of sodium they are not complete calorie bombs i will order these again,129,6
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,2.0,negative,i know these little cup-o-noodle-things are always sodium but man this was a salt bomb may try one without the seasoning packet or just half but the first one was so unappetizing I am not in a rush to do 2 disappointing,41,7
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,4.0,positive,good for a noodle cup vegetarian yay,8,8
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,2.0,negative,it tastes weird and you have to watch it when you use the microwave or it will boil over,19,9

Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,5.0,positive,yummy easy to make a quick light meal in a cup,11,11
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,1.0,negative,this is so far divorced from the concept of asian noodles as to be a joke does not taste like ginger and has an overbearing chewy grain flavor that ruin the palate these would taste good only to someone who has never had any kind of east asian-style noodles in their life and it is abundantly clear that the manufacturer has not a clue what they are making,64,12
Prime_Pantry,B00T4GE296,1.0,negative,these are so wrong in so many ways truly disgusting from the mealy noodles to the bland broth they got absolutely nothing right with these soy ginger noodles i know it says it is all natural but there is nothing natural tasting about these noodles and not even a heavy dose of sriracha could help me choke them down,58,13

Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,2.0,negative,stained the carpet and really did not last that long,9,2
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,4.0,positive,my black lab loves the treat ball these fit in he loves the liver treat as well but i gave 4stars just because it is labeled as everlasting and anything he can devour in 5mins does not quite qualify he has a much harder time getting the smaller treats out from the inside than these,53,3
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,2.0,negative,i have two issues with these treats my dog is not supercanine nor is he a voracious chewer but he got through one of these in a few hours i realise it was supposed to be in a holder of some sort but i did not realise this at the time the second issue is that he snuck away to gobble it up in a separate room which happened to be carpeted the combination of his copious slobber and this treat creates an unappealing brown foam / goo which went into the carpet i see another reviewer has said this too,98,4
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,4.0,positive,these are made to insert into a special ball which i have but do not use because they are so hard to insert l still like them for two reasons my dog loves them and they last longer than anything except maybe a yak chew keeps her in chewing nirvana for hours,51,5
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,1.0,negative,while they did last a while my dog actually broke out one of his front teeth resulting in a 400 vet bill as the other half had to be surgically extracted,31,6
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,2.0,negative,soooo this is some pretty false advertising because my dogs ate this thing in 15 minutes cool,17,7

Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,1.0,negative,my dog loves these but after purchasing i have two problems with these first and most concerning these are made in china secondly my standard poodle gets the treats out and eats them within 30 minutes i will not be buying in the future simply because they are not made in the united states but may reconsider if they ever move manufacturing back to the states,65,10
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,5.0,positive,long lasting and my dogs love the peanut butter flavor,10,11
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,2.0,negative,everlasting is sooo not true had to take them away after 3 minutes my large dog got hers more than half consumed in that time my smaller dog ate more than a quarter it in that same amount of time,40,12
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,1.0,negative,my dog loves this but he kept vomiting the next day after he had it took him to the vet after the 3rd time and found out they were recalled,30,13
Prime_Pantry,B010UNNURQ,4.0,positive,4 stars because my dog loved it but it was not as long lasting as i would have hoped lasted only a short car ride,25,14

Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,2.0,negative,watery broth overaged beef taste will not purchase again even my 18-year-old son does not like it so disappointing to think we cold find a good gluten free option for the cupboard going to donate the rest of the cans to the food bank maybe we are just picky,48,5
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,got this for my boyfriend one of his favorites by progresso never disappoints,13,6
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,this is not a pack of 4 as the description reads i only received 1 individual can 5 for one can is absolutely ridiculous,24,7
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,good soup would recommend and buy again i prefer most of the progresso soups over campbells except for the basic add water chicken noodle when I am not feeling well reminds me of my childhood and how uncomplicated life seemed back then,41,8
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,2.0,negative,normally i buy another brand but decided to go with these guys in a recent order in short after pouring it into a bowl just before heating it up it just seemed like a watered down bowl of nothing just very cheap looking definitely not the rich and hearty experience i was expecting from the labeling did not even waste my time heating it up just ended up just pouring it down the garbage disposal,74,9
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,i only received 1 can it was supposed to be a pack of 4 can,15,10
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,surprisingly good for a soup this cheap has whole onions and everything plus it is quite filling you will not be hungry afterwards,22,11
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,really good soup for those cold days or the days when cooking is out of the question will order again as my local store does not carry this flavor,29,12
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,this was not for my liking but i put some over some mashed potatoes minus a little liquid for my neighbor along with a salad and she loved it good ratio of broth to veggies to meat i just do not like so much salt other than that it is good,53,13
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,good mix with dinty moore and you can add some extra stuff if you want to cook some more ingredients with it,22,14
Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,very weird taste like you wanted a grill taste so you added an artificial flavor that is supposed to imitate a grill taste or something but came out all wrong i threw away the whole can after trying just a bite,41,15
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,1.0,negative,inedible taste mushy and very very spicy gave me upset stomach,11,0
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,cooked noodles safe to eat from your shelf you betcha weird sauce that does not have a great texture you betcha I had give it 5 out of 5 for convenience but these are just gross I am saving them for the apocalypse to eat before the cat food,46,1

Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,5.0,positive,quick convenient and tasty for on the go or just a late night snack these are great,17,3
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,2.0,negative,so i was able to try this product for free thanks to prego but i really was not feeling the roasted tomato and vegetable penne there was waayyy to much sauce in it in my opinion but either then that the way u heat for one minute and grab and go is what makes it so fun to make for your family and friends,63,4
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,1.0,negative,my son would not even try them said they looked gross,10,5
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,2.0,negative,thanks to prego i received this meal for free i had high hopes for it as i love prego however i was disappointed i was shocked at the calorie content at first the packaging was great very simple one minute in one minute sit grab at the cool spots and tear open the package was sturdy to eat from and i was surprised that it was clear at the bottom now on to the flavor and texture it was thick but the noodles seemed to be cooked just right however there was just to much tomato paste flavor and acid that was overpowering the heartburn after was horrible although they are handy and quick to make in a pinch,119,6
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,if you are expecting something fancy you should look elsewhere this food is almost as one would expect it similar in noodle and sauce texture to that of chef boyardee or spaghetti-os however the sauce does not taste quite similar outside of the slightly sweet which seems to have become the norm even with the jarred sauce as far as satiation it does a fairly decent job for a couple hours but should be eaten with something else as well lest hunger strike again quickly i do plan on purchasing more of these in the future one of the best parts is that you do not need to empty it onto another container you can eat it right out of the package which is helpful as someone who works at his desk most of the day,133,7
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,5.0,positive,wonderful sauce perfectly done macaroni ready fast just nuke add a salad meal in minutes,15,8
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,5.0,positive,the person who came up is amazing this is great for a couple reasons 1 it is only 60 second to heat 2 you can eat it out of the bag so you do not need to also bring a bowl to work 3 you can keep it in your bag until you need it no need to put in freezer / fridge ect 4 it also tastes good too awesome,67,9
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,1.0,negative,this one has potential it did not have the chalky texture like the creamy penne did some lemon pepper made it seem edible until i was finished chewing two bites and it took what feels like forever to get the horrible plastic after taste out of my mouth,47,10
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,it is definitely not homemade obvi i mixed a pouch of the italian sausage and rotini and the garden vegetable ziti that made the experience a little better also it balanced out the sweet and the spice of the two pouches i can not remember which but one was overly sweet and the other was a bit spicy overall i liked these as a quick dinner and will be buying them again,70,11
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,1.0,negative,this is way too spicy for us taste was not great either like camp food i expected twigs just not what was expected have purchased other brands much better and more tasty,31,12
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,really good stuff if you are needing to grab something fast and you are not in the mood for a sandwich this is great it is a couple of steps up from chef-b road the pasta is not mushy there is plenty for a full adult meal my husband and i both liked it,52,13
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,5.0,positive,we like these fast and yummy meals healthy ingredients will buy again,12,14
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,2.0,negative,definitely not buying again i get the fact that it is a ready meal and so it will be full of salt but there was so much that i could not finish the pouch and was sick to my stomach gave the rest of the meals to my boyfriend good thing he likes salt,53,15
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,took me a while to like the taste of this one it turned out alright in the end quick meals,20,16
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,4.0,positive,great taste high in carb and sodium but a great alternative when you are short on time,17,17
Prime_Pantry,B016UBA2A0,2.0,negative,nobody in the family seems to like them the only way they have been edible is to completely wash off the sauce and add our own i do not know what it is too rich in a bad way too canned tasting there is something that is just not great about them my 18 month old does not even like them and he eats pretty much whatever you put in front of him,69,18
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,5.0,positive,oh this is sooooo yummy I shall keep buying here until i can find it locally i noticed lorissas has finally shown up in one of my local stores but not this flavor learn from my mistake although after my first taste of this the cats found the bag and cleaned out the rest keep it put up,57,0

Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,5.0,positive,very good to carry in your car or purse to snack on when your blood sugar level falls,18,3
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,1.0,negative,opened bag and jerky turned moldy within a week not satisfied will not purchase again,15,4
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,4.0,positive,it is pretty tasty but i prefer the other proteins under this product line i do not know what it is but and i know it sounds insane but chicken jerky tastes like dried up over cooked chicken yeah i know it is but the other stuff does not taste like overcooked beef and pork regardless this stuff is yummy I had easily eat t but would rather the other lorissas proteins,66,5
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,1.0,negative,sorry do not enjoy this product at all,9,6
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,4.0,positive,greatglad i tried but flavorings not as compelling / addictive a bit chewy but it is jerky right felt like it was legit meat and not like grocery store brands will try other flavors,33,7
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,2.0,negative,this stuff is horrible the reviews on here must be astroturf looks like cubes of transluscent jelly tastes like preservative piles of lawn fertilizer I am giving 2 stars because it did not give me salmonella which suprised me based on it is looks also the packaging was quite nice,47,8
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,5.0,positive,best chicken jerky I have ever had soft and chewy excellent flavor perfect for healthy snacking on the go or sitting on the couch,23,9
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,2.0,negative,not my favorite flavor but for others it might be good,11,10
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,1.0,negative,horrible taste taste like smoke will not buy again enver had chicken jerky but pork and this is much worse,20,11
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,4.0,positive,it is a decent pack of flavor if you look at the image of the chicken add the slightly rubber feeling of all dried jerkys then imagine a swish of soy sauce and a hint of garlic added in then you pretty much have this down the packet says it is made with sea salt but I shall be honest I have eaten sea salt for the last 5 years and know it is taste well and i can not taste it in this product i give it a robust 6/10 in flavor it could benefit from some other elements added in a bit bland i give the packaging display a 9/10 it is a bit standard but it works great there has even a cute little window in the back for you to view the product i guess they sell this in stores elsewhere in the country but i sure have not seen it the bag seal is a firm 10/10 with no leaks and lastly the freedom rating on this is a magnificent 10 10 for this product being proudly made in the united states and containing no added nitrates no antibiotics no msg no growth hormones and no preservatives,196,12
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,2.0,negative,i should have known better chicken does not make very good jerky only one member of the household was a fan of this the dog,25,13
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,4.0,positive,tasty but expensive the bag is very small my son devoured it it like 10 minutes,16,14
Prime_Pantry,B019XQIH06,1.0,negative,i understand that everyone is pallet is quite different but i love ginger and eat it everyday because of the flavor and anti inflammatory effects i eat it fresh in ground powdered form drink it in tea and in almost everything i consume and this was just horrible,47,15
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,very tasty smoked salmon it is just a very small piece for nearly 6,13,0

Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,not bad at all but still very fishy needs more seasoning,11,5
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,2.0,negative,super small amounts flavor was a little off for us I shall buy from our local store next time,18,6
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,i have ordered alaska smokehouse smoked salmon fillet twice the last time i ordered two packages i love salmon but grow more hesitant to eat my relatives from the highly toxic ocean i like this salmon i can make two small meals with each package bagels and cream cheese it is obvious that the alaska smokehouse takes pride in their product and packaging the inner vacuum foil pack is sturdy and easy to open the colors and the design of the cardboard package are pleasing to the eye,88,7
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,it is tastes good and is a easy way to get salmon in your diet however the fillet is a bit overpriced for the small portion,25,8
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,came in box with dry goods was not refrigerated when i went to open the package to use at the smell was so bad we had to throw it out I have had smoked salmon many times before and it is never smelled as bad as what i got,48,9
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,most delicious experience yet delightful it is expensive but a perfect appetizer will reorder for sure,15,10
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,old salmon makes for smelly tough fish overpriced not good,10,11
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,this product should have tasted like lox it is more like dried fish,13,12
Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,2.0,negative,had a strong fishy smell not smoke smoky flavor and had a very congealed / wet texture very low quality product at least compared to the smoked salmon I am accustomed to,29,13
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I have used the software for years and highly recommend it to our customers for the price it is untouchable it is easy to use installs quickly and does a great job of teaching the language in question i can not understand why anyone would actually pay ten times as much for one of the other brands that at best is marginally better and at worst is largely the same richard bangs co-founder mountain travel sobek host and producer for the pbs series adventures with purpose,82,0
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was the senior buyer for the whole language and education software category at best buy for 5 years in that time the instant immersion brand consistently outsold all competitors we never got any complaints product returns and it was far and away the best selling product in our language assortment in my opinion it is a really great product it sounds to me like the other reviewers above have either a not actually used the software or b have ulterior motives and are associated with one of the instant immersion competitors that sells for ten times the cost we assorted numerous other language titles but none of them had the sell through needed to stay in our assortment,118,1
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,there is no way you could learn any useful spanish from this cd it is not worth it i would not pay a dime for this horrible product do not waste your money,31,2
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,if you want to learn straight vocabulary then this is your product however if you wish to learn how to speak spanish then do not waste your time or money it does not teach you how to construct sentences it basically teaches you random vocabulary and in the later lessons uses huge sentences in which you will only be able to pick up on the random vocabulary words to guess what they are talking about in short this will leave you in the dark on the bright side i now know how to say kangaroo in spanish,93,3
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i have been trying to learn spanish for years most of the products were simply too boring for me to stick with it this product has a ton of content for the money there are 6 different software programs on 6 discs the only complaint i have is that you need to swap discs for each level good and bad in addition to the software there is an audio cd as well as a dvd that you can play on a dvd player and an extra game i have not figured out the game yet but it is an adventure game that you need to navigate in spanish there is no manual so it is not easy to figure out the software programs have gameshows trivia and many photos of items that you need to identify in spanish overall i give this product 5 stars because of the value you simply get a lot for the money,156,4
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this product leaves you to educate yourself the first cd level 1 disk 1 has a word list an easy game a more difficult game and some other material there is no suggestion as to how you are to use these materials or proceed through the lessons it is a stretch to call them lessons since that suggests some degree of organization i give this product one star because you can not post a rating of zero,78,5
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this product leaves you to educate yourself the first cd level 1 disk 1 has a word list an easy game a more difficult game and some other material there is no suggestion as to how you are to use these materials or proceed through the lessons it is a stretch to call them lessons since that suggests some degree of organization i give this product one star because you can not post a rating of zero,78,6

Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this would not even be worth a dollar you will not be able to learn spanish with this invest in rosetta stone instead do not waste your money with this cheap knock off what you will learn might be a few simple vocabulary words and some terms or sentences but you can learn those for free from free programs or apps or even from dora the explorer on tv you would learn more from exposure to telemundo than you will from this do not buy it,83,8
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,seems like the program itself is ok but i was looking for something to use while commuting the cds are not compatible,22,9
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,great price point easy to use kid friendly reviewed by teachers and it was recommended used by all ages jr high hs and adult,24,10
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i like the fact that i can sit in my living room with earbuds in my ears in the middle of a group doing their own thing and learn repeating over and over spanish i like how vocab is in a male voice and then a female voice switching with each click i get to hear the pitch differences which have been so helpful i am happy that info is delivered incrementally and you can go anywhere you want basic to difficult and back again you can even wear it while you sleep and learn it subliminally if you like or learn it in your car using the mp3 disc it is very versatile,114,11
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,works great arrived quickly and my wife is well on her way to speaking spanish much cheaper than rosetta stone,20,12
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,great quick and easy way to learn spanish on the fly does not concentrate on the reading of a language,20,13
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,maybe it is me and I am just not capable of learning a foreign language as an adult funny i did not have this hard a time with high school german i just can not seem to learn from these spanish software programs this is the third I have tried for me i have had the best luck with repetitive audio programs i can listen to in the car or while running in my ipod maybe it is just that as an adult i do not have the time to sit and do a program and get nothing else done,96,14
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this set has been around a long time and always a great way to supplement other spanish language courses worth the investment,22,15
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my seventh grade homeschooled daughter has been using this product to learn spanish it is easy enough to set up that she was able to do it all on her own we would purchased rosetta stone at a much higher price but she likes this one better,46,16
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought it for our niece in law and she has not said not one negative word about the software to us we guess she loves it,29,17
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i brought this product to help in college but it was a waist of time because it only teach you the basic for example 1 to 20 this product does not help you at all the software looks cheap and the games are boring and pointless do not buy unless you just want to know random greetings and numbers,58,18
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students it is as good as other systems that cost you much more i think that spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years and this system gives you a good start,49,19
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i purchased instant immersion instead of rosetta stone which way more expensive i started to like it until i found out that there is no written material no book no pdf nothing most would agree 99 of any class I have taken had / required a book this one does not but it needs one I am sending my instant immersion back,57,20
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i took spanish in high school and college so i know and understand what some may consider to be a lot but i am far from fluent i would say i can talk with a child and even then i am not fluent this program did not help me in my goal to become fluent it did help me increase my vocabulary but as far as becoming a spanish speaker this program did not help i also found some errors with the translations an example is the english speaker said i am from a town and on the screen it said i am from a town called madrid like i said i know some spanish but this program has not helped me to become fluent when i read the reviews it was as good as rosetta stone but the tech support was not there i find this not to be true i have gotten the test demo from then and thought it to be more helpful,166,21
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,thank you for sending it on time but the box was destroyed when it arrived because whoever packed it wrapped it in a paper grocery bag really maybe next time put your merchandise in something a little sturdier so when it arrives to your client we do not get damaged goods just a thought i have not been able to start learning spanish because for some reason the disks will not play in my computer or dvd player even although the box clearly states that it is compatible so I am not thrilled but it did arrive on time beat up as it was,101,22
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,it is kind of a fun program my boys 3 and 5 love computer games and to them this is something of a game the vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of here are some words now you repeat them now you answer which is which that seems to work pretty well i have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet so i can not say anything there at this time one factor that i really like is that the program has two spanish speakers so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words we will keep using this and i hope to come back and update this review when i have gotten to the grammar lessons,123,23
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,wasted 600 dollar rosetta stone does not work level 1 works but once the words became anything longer than 6 letters it is basically useless and only frustrates you my mom is from spain and is completely fluent and the voice recognition kept on saying she was not saying it right and later she had one of her spanish friends try it and it did the same do not waste you money if you do i will sell you mine,74,24
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i bought this product for my daughter who is struggling in spanish in college after one week she understood and spoke spanish better than she had after two years in high school her test grades improved and her conversation grade improved the teacher noted her improvement instant immersion spanish 12 and 3,52,25
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,we purchased this product to give us a basic introduction to spanish right off the bat none of the disks would work with a mac i tried three different macs and encountered the same frustration the disks simply will not mount i can not review the effectiveness of the language lessons because we could only open the workbook do not waste your time we will be retuning this product to the store / manufaturer,71,26
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you do not need to spend hundreds of dollars on the other people who spend so much on advertising their product this one is the real deal easy to use ipod / iphone friendly my husband is already speaking a lot of spanish after a month it is truly incredible he is ready for his trips to several spanish speaking countries,58,27
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this program is definitely a good investment to learn basic spanish or just brush up it costs far less than comparable programs like rosetta stone i wish there was more vocabulary in it but i have learned a lot and am able to make and understand basic conversation my favorite part is that i can put it on my ipod and take it with me wherever i go,68,28
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i do not see someone learning the language there is very little actual instruction it provides very limited practice and relies heavily on oral input without accompanying written word brief lessons are followed by a game approach basic guessing results in high scores not worth the money I shall try rosetta stone instead,51,29
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,I have tried several times to give this set a fair shake but i just do not like it it feels sort of like a cut-budget rosetta stone software i do not feel as although I am learning anything the lessons are disjointed and sometimes confusing and there seem to be way more discs than there should be a language program like this can not be taking up that much memory all in all if i needed to really learn spanish I had go looking elsewhere for an effective product,84,30
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my children and i are using this to learn spanish we love to compete with each other on the quizzes on the dvd we have not been able to use the computer discs although because our cd drive broke but we are learning a lot from the dvd however the girls accent is thick and a little hard to understand at times but since they put the words on the screen you can figure out how to say it,79,31
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,have not yet begun in earnest looks very adaquate for what i was looking for the games make it less onerous,21,32
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and i am running on win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program not my machine it slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the cd the product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace some disks require installing programs such as flash and quick time i do not like programs that use because flash contains spy-ware tracking that you have to go to the adobe website to disable some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format if i had demoed instant immersion first i never would have bought it,130,33
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you get out what you put in this system let us you learn words and phrases then match them to pictures and audio with games it would be great for a child to use i had found it necessary to communicate with spanish people who refuse to learn our language i had put it off long enough and now use the system for relaxation after a long day at work this is the first type of system i have used and for the price you simply can not beat it do not waste your money on a more expensive system before trying this one,101,34
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i can not stress enough how absolutely terrible this software is it freezes my computer within 15 minutes of putting it in a help box constantly comes up saying that there is a timing error the quality is bare minimum do not waste you are money on it,45,35
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,save your money just save it and spend on rosetta stone if you really want to learn spanish thanks this is tourist stuff too simple,25,36
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,I have used rosetta stone and I have used this immersion program and this one just can not compare it is repetitive to the point of annoying the graphics are awful and it does not have the intuitive learning progression the rosetta programs have definitely a poor choice,45,37
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I am very pleased I am getting better with my spanish all the time it seems much easier then any other program I have tried,22,38
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,first time user of this product gives a good introduction to the language plus it s fun for the price would recommend to anyone,22,39
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have use rosetta stone and i think this is very similar definitely try it the price is better than most other programs,23,40
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,thank you it was everything you said it was I am glad i decided to purchase this such great service thank you again will purchase from this site again,28,41
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my son purchased this program he is an emt and wanted to learn spanish to help his patients he said he loves the program you can not beat the price it repeats words back to you so you get the correct pronunciation my son-in-law is spanish speaking and bought the spanish to english program his english noticeably improved when he started using the program it is like anything else you have to keep doing it i would definitely recommend this product,79,42
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was pleased when god led me to this product i had wanted to purchase the rosetta stone software but found it too expensive then god showed me this software in a catalogue although i have only used disk one of this program i can say that it is a fun way to learn a language the pictures make learning the the vocabulary easier i took spanish while i was in school now more than ten years later I am using this as mostly a review i like instant immersion and would recommend it because it is fun and you can not lose at 3500,102,43
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this is a great product it is very user friendly and lots of fun i think it is well worth the cost i have recommended this product to my friends and co-workers,31,44
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,disc is damaged has loud humming noise that is very distracting while trying to learn shipping and packaging was however quick and efficient,22,45
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i got this program so i could keep my fluency at about the same level over summer break i was really hoping for a basic program that would simply teach you spanish and allow you to listen to spanish conversations and try to interpret them but this product is clearly aimed at elementary school children it is laden with a heavy graphical interface i would not get this program if you were serious about learning spanish i just could not use it because it is so ridiculous it does not even make sense it might just be better to get rosetta stone but rs costs like 500 dollars you pay for what you get i guess it also never really immerses you in spanish even if you were to ignore the interface it is still a very poor learning experience maybe if you want you child to try and learn spanish this program would be good but from my experience nothing works better than traditional classes and actual conversations with spanish peoples,169,46
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,upon starting the software learning regimen i found it easy to navigate and fun to learn for all the negativity written about this software I had have to say those people are out of there minds what you learn is spain spanish for what you get compared to the price it is a no brainer for those of us who did not learn rudimentary spanish in school this is a great product i come from a spanish background never learning the language i did not have the discipline to learn until now you really need to converse with other spanish speaking people to get it to sink in practice makes perfect i am already thinking in spanish overall I had say it is worth the investment where else can you learn so much for so little wonderful product that is highly recommended,137,47
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought immersion spanish a few weeks ago and when i uploaded the first cd to my computer it was just that-instant it has a male spanish speaker and a female spanish speaker who pronounced the words each in different ways to give a clear understanding of how to pronunce the words it has a clock like list of lessons firstwords food colors phrases countries shopping time numbers and body on cd 1 you click on the topic you want to practice after you practice you can click on a word practice session or an easy or hard game session it has a speaking practice where you can speak and listen to how you pronounce the words it also has a dictionary you can print when I am done with level 1 i will progress to levels 2 and 3 of the other cds i think it is easy and to the point great,154,48
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i found instant immersion to be ok i mean it is no rosetta stone but of course rosetta stone costs hundreds of dollars so this is a great value for what you get i find that it is probably most helpful as a supplement for a beginning spanish class if it is been a couple of years since your last class and your basic spanish is rusty like me or if you just want to learn a few conversational phrases for a trip or to be able to communicate on a very basic level way more interesting than just having a book or a cassette i would hardly call it immersion however unless they sent several spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program which they do not by the way it is nice that it works on both pc and mac i do not see that a lot with software especially when it is fairly inexpensive,153,49
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i started with disc 1 which reviewed vocabulary i really enjoyed playing the easy and advanced games at the end of the program however i had major problems with disc 2 after returning the product to the store and getting the same program i thought it was my computer i opened disc 2 on another computer although i could open the program i had trouble exiting the program and saving my scores disc 2 contains vocabulary to memorize but without the easy and advanced games at the end i found disc 2 to be very boring although disc 1 was fun and easy to use i do not recommend buying this product,113,50
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,there are a whole bunch of comparisons between this product and rosetta stone already but I shall throw my two cents in I have got both and found this product cheap in every sense of that word rosetta stone was definitely the better product of the two and was more what I had call immersion instant immersion is not immersion it is mostly memorization more so than rosetta stone this is not a product you could really learn the language from I had say it is best use is for a student in a low level spanish class to get a little more practice also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp for instance azul becomes athththul or azcar becomes ah-ffffu-cah overall this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other spanish class you almost certainly will not learn spanish from it at least alone then again it would be hard to learn it solely from rosetta stone so at least this is cheaper,173,51
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,in this audio you can hear the lady swallow breath and even hear the spit in her mouth it is disgusting on all levels I am surprised they could not delete these sounds when doing the final edititing all i can hear is her taking deep breaths and swallowing very thick spit either the lady is dehydrated or is diabetic ew,60,52
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i picked this product as a less expensive alternative to the allegedly more robust language software offered by rosetta stone since i had studied spanish years ago i thought this package might help me restore my former skill with the vocabulary which always seemed to be my weak point admittedly i failed to remember that since this is a cd-rom it runs from the dvd and i was not expecting the program to run as slowly as it did but my bigger problem was the interface the lack of instructions even rudimentary ones and the blurred accents of the native voices that i was supposed to mimic it is possible that this product might be appealing to small children since it uses cartoonish characters for me after several hours of frustration i decided i would have to try another approach,138,53
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my daughter chose the rosetta stone-more bells and whistles but instant immersion spanish is plenty for me as i try to learn spanish i am glad i bought it enjoy the ipod program while on my daily walks and look forward to pursuing at my own pace on my computer without feeling intimated in a class room setting and much cheaper too i also have been very pleased each time i use amazoncom-i checked other sites and this was best price and service,82,54
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i got this to help me pass my spanish college class i love it ],15,55
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,disclaimer i am reviewing a copy i received for free through the vine program this is a good program and is worth the selling price i think you can read the other reviews comparing it to rosetta stones and other vendors spanish language programs this is a little cheaper but still does quite well at least in the limited time we have spent with it we have not gotten too far along yet,73,56
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i have used rosetta stone and this product i agree that neither are quite what they promise which is an easy way to learn a language for someone to compare this favorably to rs is highly suspicious to me after multiple failed attempts to get this product to work on my mac i went to a pc laptop to actually check it out this product compares to rosetta stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak this is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list perhaps that is worth the money but do not confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from rosetta stone my problem with rs is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary so in that sense this would be a nice complement to rs the audio cds included in this are actual lessons thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing it is really not comparable to rs at all and any comparison is incredibly unfair they should take those claims off of their packaging I shall be demanding a refund for the mac incompatibility but otherwise would make use of the money back guarantee save yourself the hassle,199,57
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like it but it seems more like a game than a real teaching tool the cd roms do not break down the language like i would have liked them to they teach you the names for colors or objects but do not put it into a sentence for you and I have learned that spanish speaking is backwards so that does not really help speak the language the cd for the ipod is wonderful although it really breaks down why the language is the way it is that 1 cd is worth the price of the whole hope this helped,97,58
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought it because i need some basic spanish for a trip i found it useful to have different methods of learning audio ipod sentences common phrases matching games guessing games and a video i think i got enough of what i need to travel to mexico i was comfortable enough to understand the key words from what people were saying i did use the tech support site and found my answer in their onlinei even asked a question and got an email response in about 3 hours that contained useful stuff but also had links to the exact answer pdf document for my needs i am glad i did not spend the money on more expensive products that would sit on the shelf when the trip was done,132,59
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this progress takes a lot of time to work through but it is very helpful to develop conversational skills it covers travel questions and answers shopping and day to day activities it builds one lesson to the next which is also helpful if you follow through the program you can learn converstaional spanish a person will not get fluent in a this language with this program but it is helpful if you are unable to enroll in college courses it also is good to use between breaks if you are taking a college course it funtions well on the computer and i had no software issues with this program,108,60
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,takes a bit for slower computers to kick up the cd-rom drive I had suggest loading this on you hd if possible seems ok on computer with faster processor and cd-rom / dvd drive the first disks take a little fishing around with unlabeled tabs but this could be intentional to get your mind into another space fun and easy to useincludes flash card type games lots of repetition of vocabulary and as much on pronunciation as you would like covers general travel conversation including medical emergencies and business a great start for starting to learn a new language can not beat the price would suggest for students who are considering or will be taking spanish in high school and/or college it is good to familiarize yourself with the language sentence structure and more before jumping in and this is at your own pace is not mexican spanish but castillian spanish good to use if you are going to take a trip as the basics are very helpful even if shopping great way to start learning spanish and you will find there is much cross-over to mexican spanish italian potugese and more on your own if you go onto learn more languages,193,61
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,well worth the money disc includes many spanish words and phrases and let us you listen as well as see the words in print it allows you to take quizes and receive a score you can record the words in your own voice after listening to the words on the disc you will have to have a headset to do this,60,62
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i do not think there has much i can add to the other reviewers here there has lots of vocab but not a lot of grammar the option to listen to vocab lists on an mp3 player is nice and convenient and let us me review while driving the flash cards are good reinforcement I am not finished with the whole set yet but even when i get there I am certainly not going to be fluent that is impossible but i think this would be a great companion to a spanish class i do not think there is enough grammar to be a stand-alone course although I had like to see more grammar lessons bottom line if you are trying to learn spanish go ahead and give this a try at this cost you do not have much to lose,127,63
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i purchased rosetta stone spanish level 1 and completed it i was ready to purchase level 2 but it cost so much i wanted to try spanish immersion immersion is much simpler and is not comparable to rosetta stone it is good for learning nouns but no way could you learn the language for example in rosetta stone you say a word or phrase and if your pronunciation is good enough it accepts it at first i thought i pronounced words good enough but rosetta stone made me keep saying them till i got it correct in immersion you pronounce a word it records it you play it back and rate your own pronunciation,114,64
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like this langauge learning system much better than other ones I have tried such as fluenz i have not tried rosetta stone too expensive likes colorful clickable graphics menu system excellent organization colors numbers foods phrases and more both male and female speech examples for all games are fun and easy to learn some games show how the word is spelled as well as spoken works with apple products including ipod and iphone professionally done dislikes there is one bad recording for hola on the dvd did not automatically run upon putting in the disk have windows vista had to manually begin install am i actually learning the language yes at least the basics overall this company is on the right track,120,65
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have wanted to learn spanish as a second language for years i have used tapes cds and software but i always found them boring and i did not stick with them what is different about instant immersion spanish is the fun you have while learning the language while the approach used in this software is similar to other more expensive programs it is less of an investment than if you bought one of the high priced programs and still comparable in quality for someone beginning to learn spanish instant immersion spanish is fun and effective it would rate this program a high value for the price,106,66
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,without a knowledge of spanish i was able to skip all of the work to the end and get 90 - 100 on all the quizzes if answers are multiple choice then the correct choice is always much too obvious this makes it impossible to get good feedback on whether or not I am actually learning anything i found myself making flashcards of the material and doing it myself there is a satisfaction guarantee from the publisher on this product and i will be sending it back free spanish flashcard software and literature i found on the internet was much more productive,99,67
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,you know if you think you want to learn a language but are not sure then instant immersion is a great place to start it does not cost a lot and it gives you in miniature what the big boys rosetta and tellmemore give you will not feel swamped likely and you will get a feel for what software language learning is like i sampled the spanish version and i am asssuming the other languages offered are similar remember too one learning source will not deliver fluency it is a long slog instant immersion is a good way to start,97,68
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i bought this package thinking it was similar to rosetta stone i liked rosetta stone but do not believe it is comprehensive or rigorous enough to teach the basics of a language not worth the price it is a great introduction to pronunciation of simple everyday words it would be great for a junior high school student taking the language in school with a text but no way does it teach grammar it is a good supplement this software package was similar in that it did not teach any grammar and had no structured lessons in how to form sentences the only two disks i found useful were the first two which introduced many common words the rest of the disks were just haphazard phrases which might be good for intuitive learning but it was by no means in depth enough to learn the basics if you are a tourist trying to just get by for a few weeks this might be useful but if you really want to learn a language take a college course i would not mind if i had paid under 30 for this but i feel it is overpriced at 49,190,69
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this software is for the very beginners even the level 3 disc 2 does not fligh very highyou are not able to watch conversationnal videos like you do in other brands on the market in the same range of price i tried to play the cd oskar lake and could notit sounds very complicated i went to their website nothing helpful,61,70
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,the title on the instant immersion box asks why does rosetta stone cost so much more it is because rosetta stone is so much better than the instant spanish immersion program i am a spanish and esl teacher i have used both programs rosetta stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face you will be fluent in any language after using rosetta stone however this instant spanish immersion program does not use immersion it teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other you can quickly progress through the cds without learning any grammar how can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences well after you waist 4000 on this product and try rosetta stone you will find out what i am talking about level 1 in rosetta stone will teach you more about the spanish language than a few cds in this cheep program why do i need 3 cds to teach me the numbers 1 through 20 that is rediculous not even my four year old is interested in the program [ ],193,71
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i chose instant immersion spanish for introductory level spanish for my high school daughters they are in the process of working through it and enjoy it as a consumer the things you should know about this are the following it is easy to use there is not much guidance about how to use it but not much would be necessary since you are being immersed it is the same as if you were simply left in a spanish-speaking country and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the cds from level to level it does keep track of your progress as you learn thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at spanish for the price it is an excellent program to read a review of this curriculum and nine other spanish programs available this year see this site [ ] we use this product on an ibook but it can be run on windows as well,162,72
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this product is as good as the expensive and well-known brand why pay more,14,73
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,dvd did not work or play what a bummer i guess i get what i paid for,17,74
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,very bad if your trying to learn how to speak spanish do not buy this,15,75
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,work as described great product for the price recommend,9,76
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i got suckered there is nothing on the cds they are blank,12,77
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,this cd rom set is a joke if you really want to learn the russian language the first cd just teaches you some random words the second cd does not teach you anything it is set up like a game show where they ask you questions that are entirely in russian then you have to guess the answer this is not for beginners if you want to learn russian i suggest getting books and tapes,73,0
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,i found this product easy to understand and use it was organized as a game playing experience that made learning fun i wanted the english version but it also supported 50 other languages so if you were french it spoke to you in your native language and taught you russian have purchased several other products and i have found this one the best introduction to russian and the easiest to use it is fun,73,1
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i bought this thinking hey it is ten bucks what have i got to lose well the answer to that question is ten bucks if you are broke and want to learn russian save your money for food and get a library card pass on this I had only give it one star but I shall give it two because it is so cheap and you could learn something from this if you put forth serious effort but you would be better off buying the penguin russian course instead for almost the same price,88,2
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a very good program for people who are just starting to learn the russian language this program gives students a few basic words and phrases that will help a student get introduced to the language it is worth the money in my opinion however the program is geared toward a younger age group and does not go very deep into the russian language overall this program would be a good way to start,75,3
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a program that will help you learn russian through games it is purpose is to teach you mainly through listening the purpose is not to teach you how to read or write or even put together full sentences cd 2 is definitely great if you want to improve your listening but have nothing to listen to the cd is all in russian and teaches you to get used to it the first cd is fun because you can play their games or even make up your own using the games they give you before spending 100s of dollars on grammar books and such pay for this program if you can not grasp this simple vocab maybe russian is not for you,123,4
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,before you can learn any language you have to know the names of things that is the key this cd-set understands that and challenges you in a game-show fashion to play along with the game and gain points in order to progress to advance to the next level after all you can not learn to conjugate verbs or understand the gender value mostly foreign to native english speakers attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before it is a very complicated thing russian and ukrainian if it came in a pill everyone could take one too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective huh but this one is just the right speed slow and simple sure it could have utilized more sophisticated graphics but remember when you are a kid in a language you have to be treated like one and being a kid again is actually quite fun,166,5
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,if you want to learn to speak russian this cd will not help you very much it does help you learn some random words and gives you a feel for russian but that is about it however the cds format does allow you to learn numbers time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor if you feel you are weak in numbers time and dates then it is worth the cost to learn them i found that I am very fast at numbers as a result of this course by itself the course does not do much but for the specific area of numbers and time i can not think of a better way to learn it is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language it is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games,154,6
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,i bought this to learn russian as it says it is easy inexpensive and a fast way to learn do not be fooled it mostly teaches you words not sentances or conversations believe me it is the worse the first cd teaches you colors numbers time the alphabet and so on but it does not help with actually communicating with the people although i agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words and three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words but to learn the actually language i find that it is impossible to this is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it is basic words again do not be fooled spend the extra ten bucks and get the rosetta stone russian explorer it has more programs and conversational teachings i recommend that better than this product,154,7
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,my biggest beef with this product is the speakers do not always enunciate which made attempting to repeat what they said a struggle,23,8
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,my husband is fluent in russian and absolutely loves this cd it is cheap and great quality he teaches our son with this cd,24,9
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,nice simple easy to use program i like it a lot better than rossetta stone,15,10
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,received cds that do not work in cd players nuts piece of junk do not get it what a rip off,20,11
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,good program for learning another language I have used the german ones and my wife is currently learning spanish with the same system,22,12
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,bought this several years ago to learn russian the cost around 10 was great but the product is very lacking in helping you to do anything in learning or speaking the language if you are going to spend your money on any product to learn a foreign language go with rosetta stone or pimsleur even a college textbook will help you learn more do not waste your money on this,66,13
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,there was not a clear voice doing the talking and so when we got to russian nothing was pronounced the way we thought and we could not be understood at all,29,14
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,first of all do not but this if you are a beginner looking for an introduction to the basics russian language this product is only meant for learning words and phrases through repetition and memorization that constitutes the first cd the second on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous it is basically a game that you have no way of winning or even doing well at unless you are relatively schooled in russian the one thing that this product did come in handy with was helping me to at least hear spoken russian from native speakers while i worked my way thorough nicholas j browns the new penguin russian course which you should redirect your search engine to right now if you are looking to this product to help you actually learn russian language it is the best of the best all in all buy this if all you want is to memorize words / phrases or if you need the aid of hearing a native speaker while attempting to self-instruct yourself through the basics of the russian language either way you will only receive any use from the first of the two cds,186,15
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i liked the combination of repetition of words and games to reinforce learning although the male and females pronunciations were difficult to hear at times also the program stopped running in the middle of the lessons i have windows xp and have not been able to figure out the problem rendering the cds useless to me if anyone knows what the problem is and how to fix it i would like to know,73,16
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my oldest daughter loves dora and took to this game immediately she loves to sit on my lap and play and our father-daughter time is often spent on the computer she can not get enough the 3 levels offer a nice change for children that are getting bored with the game some puzzles she plays at level 1 where some puzzles she plays at level 3 the game is very educational and fun and it follows the same format as the cartoon does she will turn 3 soon and she still loves it I had also recommend doras backpack adventure they make a trip to the library little people discovery airport winnie the pooh where pooh gathers all the friends for eyores birthday party and mickey mouse where mickey and minnie stop off at goofysstation daiseys diner,137,0
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this for my daughter who loves dora but what a mistake she has our old computer which is not a powerhouse but this game is a total memory hog and i had to delete every other game in the computer to install it and it still will not work well so unless your child has a top of the line computer not recommended,64,1
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,this game really kept my daughter s attention she enjoyed the games and learned the activities i am really glad that i purchased this i have ordered others as well,30,2
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,my daughter is 4 and loves dora the game is short and not interesting her also it is seems there are a few glitches in the game trying to get the stars into backpack is nerve racking you do not actually click on the stars but just to the outside of it it becomes a pain do not waste you money,58,3
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,if you child likes to play on the computer and likes dora this is a great game for them my son just turned 3 and loves to play this game after playing each individual game with him he was able to play on his own the different levels are a great feature most of the games deal with number recognition so the lower the level the less numbers it deals with there are also some print-outs tobut not many to choose from,84,4
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,santa left this game for my 5 year old daughter she loves anything dora including this fun game,19,5
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my niece is going to love this game there are a lot of challenging yet reasonable games for the kids to play i am looking forward to her playing it,30,6
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,my son is 3 and a half he has mastered many games like jumpstart preschool and more this game is way to difficult for him there are numbers moving on the wall so he not only has to identify the numbers but try to click on them as they move past i would highly not recommend this game for younger kids under the age of 5,65,7
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,our four-year-old daughter loves dora the explorer so we were delighted to see the release of lost city adventure the reviews so far have been raves from the little one and from us the animation music and sound are first rate but more importantly the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler this program stacks up well against the knowledge adventure titles like reader rabbit skills such as sequencingmatching memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments plus there are three difficulty levels so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level you can adjust accordingly the program works great using the classic environment on our macintosh g4 laptop and g3 desktop computers have fun,123,8
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,i have a 3 year old and after a week she is already bored with this game for 20 there should be more to do it constantly repeats itself and has no real direction very limited number of activities available and really no variety i would not recommend this game at all i am currently reading reviews to find something much more interesting,63,9
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,i thought it was very good it should be for older children although,13,10
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this product because it specifically stated that is is supported mac os x 101x and above turns out that there is a problem with the mouse tracking on os x 102 that makes the game unusable i went to the companys website for a patch only to find out there is not one and there will not be one their solution is to install it in 0s 9 and boot into os 9 to play it i checked for os x support specifically to avoid such nonsense i am very disappointment in this product as a result and would recommend looking elsewhere for both windows and mac if a company such as this can not properly fix their bugs 15 wasted and one very unhappy toddler,126,11
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my 28 month old loved it from the start the graphics are wonderful just like on tv easy to install and ran great on my computer i highly recommend it,30,12
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,the game is outdated and does not work on my daughters new laptop i have tried every trick to make it work complete waste of money i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because i should have known better,40,13

Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,this game is ok and my 3-year-old son plays it from time to time he loves dora and diego so i thought this would be a great hit but it has been pretty disappointing there are two game tracks with 3 levels of difficulty my son completed both tracks in about 30 minutes it is pretty repetitive after that even at higher skill levels he gets pretty bored with the long-winded videos in between the actual games i took off an extra star for requiring that the cd be in the computer when he plays the software it is 2011 now get with the program you require me to register the program any way so use a license number like every other software company,123,16
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this game for my daughter when i tried to install it to my computer the security program ms security essentail warned that it detected a malware so i scanned this game by the other security program tred-micro office scan it also detected same malware finally i threw it away,49,17
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,the following review by isabella 6 years i am a not a big dora fan but my dad got i for me any way because win i was 4 i loved dora but now i am not a b ig dora fan it is a good game parental comment yes she loved the early age oriented dora pc game when she was younger the challenge is appropriate not overwhelming and the outcome also brings on the pride of accomplishment doras stories always have a wholesome moral attached to the characters involvement good graphics easy to follow age appropriate logic level for 4 - 5 year olds,106,18
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,we bought the product for a laptop that goes on exteded trips out of reach of the internet after discovering that the upgrade had no internal help files we downgraded to version 2004 since the databases are not downward conpatable all of our computers that use microsoft money now must use the 2004 version for us this purchase was a big mistake,62,0

Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,just like the major competitor this product is very easy to use and upgrade is a bit slow when first starting up but then the details and reports provided are very helpful have not generated an invoice yet but did try a demo one and i think this product is worth the price,53,4
Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,overall good upgrade was looking to be able to have sub categories and this upgrade does not allow that,19,5
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i spoke to microsoft tech people before purchasing thisand was advised that it would do all that i wanted it to do for my company when i received it the program did none of the functions that i was quie specific about i was very very disappointed additionally the program is complex too busy and the only user guide needs to be downloaded totally worthless program i rate it a 5 i did however voice my dissatisfaction to amazon and they have stood by their customer for which i am very appreciative of,94,6

Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i had the regular money product and bought the small business addition to manage receivables invoices and more regarding invoices you can create a very basic awful template using the new template editor it is not something you would want to use unless you are a child selling lemonade hey microsoft why not use microsoft word for invoicing templates duh it is only your own product oh and if that is not bad enough when you want to send an invoice by email it does not use the invoice template you have created instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers also remember those customer accounts you created in money well the invoice does not pull in the customer information that is right you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information again for invoices terrible product yes it manages accounts but no better or worse than other versions of money if you are using this to manage bank accounts fine otherwise unless stay away shameful,175,17
Software,B0009KLGPO,2.0,negative,it is more difficult to use than quickbook in a practical sense when i tried to enter a simple expenseit took a while to look for the right pull down to get in when i downloaded my sear credit card history money2006 put expense items into credit column it messed up my balance sheet i always could not get right answer from microsoft support for money2006 although their tech support people are polite,74,18
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,i have been using ms money for small business since i started a one person psychology practice after having been an owner of a large group practice where we used quickbooks i never liked qb i thought it was too complicated to get started and now if i want to use the online banking i have to pay 15 a month to my bank and an extra 200 for a one person payroll i found ms money for small business very easy to set up no charge for online banking with my bank and one year free payroll that costs 10 a month after one year seems to me that using ms money for sb is a non brainer and using qb is an expensive and complicate proposition,128,19
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,the dvd installed the map software on the computer with the usual intuitive mac interface the first time i ran map install it prompted me to download an updated version which i did this took 20 minutes i had the 2 gb micro sd card in the gps when selecting maps to upload the interface told me how many gb they would take up and how much room i would have remaining i selected washington and oregon and clicked install the upload to the gps took about an hour the maps look great and the device just works with them without any frustration or complication i tried using the map manager software and also found it intuitive to make and upload waypoints have no fear mac users,127,0
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i first saw this map source described in the amazon description of the nuvi 265wt which i purchased the sample map display shown is what you see when using the pc software not what you see on the gps unit the cd contains cartographic data which the pc software is able to display that information does not seem to be transfered to the sd card or the gps is not capable of displaying it that was dissapointing but I am otherwise satisfied with the product i had a magellan meridian before which would only display elevation lines the garmin with topo produces a similar appearing display with perhaps more detail as to water features streams lakes and more when using the topo maps I have found that the 2-d formats provide a more readable display since the maps are essentially flat the elevation lines in the 3-d view are more distracting than meaningful,149,1
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,after checking the many reviews on various websites i decided to go for it and am glad i did to those out there who are trying to decide whether to go with the micro sd or cd make it the cd the bonus base camp software is pretty nice even although i have not completely figured it out yet I am hiking a lot of trails I have previously hiked over the fourth of july weekend so I shall see how it all pans out compared to my green trails,86,2
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,way too difficult figuring out how to use the product I have essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment,23,3
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this did not work well for thr rogue river trail in oregon not accurate andus down the wrong areas,20,4
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,topography is fine do not expect much about trail information,9,5
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,nice to have but using it slows down my garmin way too much so i hardly turn it on recommend getting the chip instead,24,6
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,as promised simplesimple review good stuff,8,7
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i this does notup comes with antiquated software that is maddening and takes hours dozens of hours to download then is followed three times before i finally gave up with a statement that there was a problem and gives inexplicable impossible to follow instructions i am going to try to talk with garmin but have little hope for it and undoubtedly try to return it to amazon by the way i asked my brother-in-law who is a cartographer and clever with computer software to try to make it work he could not,94,8
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,when i read the product information provided i did not understand this required a very expensive gps for it to have any use at all in searching for a gps that would work with topo i found limited options mostly obsolete low ratings and extraordinarily high price tags it will probably never come off the shelf until we decide to trash it this was a regrettable purchase,66,9
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,one of the few things i bought that i thought was a waste of money,15,10
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this to anyone i bought it thinking it was up to date while loading it i see 2008 in several areas so despite the major hassle of downloading and transferring it I am most disgusted that it is 6 years outdated,43,11
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i found some issues with basecamp loading this map but once it worked it is fantastic very happy with the dvds,21,12
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it does everything you need it for it is kind of annoying that it can hold all of the usgs maps for the whole us on the device at one time especially with all the advancements in data storage on small micro sd cards in this day and age but if you can over look this and the obviously exorbitant cost for something you can basically get for free on your smartphone and this software is only good for what 4 or 5 states it is just quite disappointing to me i bought this a couple years ago for about 100 so hopefully in the last 2 years the price has come down and the storage capacity on the devices has gone up if not i would never she shall out more than 30 or 40 for this software it is just not worth it when you can get all this info for free on a stinking phone,154,13
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the garmin topo is out of date the trail locations inaccurate but it is the only game in town for topo maps better than nothing but not by much,29,14
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,once downloaded i was extremely happy with this map especially compared to the default map that came with my garmin etrex 20 the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it was difficult to download to my gps due to needing an update even before doing so it was brand new and already needed an update being a computer user not a computer guru made this process a lot more difficult and lengthy than i was prepared for and it was frustrating that said once downloaded the map itself is awesome and all I had hoped for however it would be nice if it covered more states considering the price,113,15
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i was hiking in oregon a couple weeks ago and suddenly came to a trail detour the sign said closed for restoration so i followed that for a while but then wondered if i was going to miss a connecting trail to get back to the car so i took a gamble and went cross country to get back on the gps-shown trail i eventually found that i was on an abandoned trail that looked like it had not been used in years which eventually took me to the main trail still in use bottom line the maps got me where i wanted to be but the maps could be several years old and some trails me be wrong like this one there is no update service for this product so if you submit changes who knows how you find out if changes were made so I am happy with the maps but be careful things may not be correct,161,16
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i have no complaints with the maps they are great they have all of the details one needs to complete an outdoor adventure however base camp is not user friendly making it difficult to learn how to get the maps on your device and i do not like the way that the maps are divided into sections i would like them to allow customers to pick the states they want and need and make their own bundle,76,17
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,we use the topos for backpacking hiking mountain biking and offroading i finally upgraded after about 10 years i should of done it sooner we never get lost,28,18
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this is pretty much a necessity if you want to do more than just follow roads with the gps or even if you do just want to follow the roads definitely buy the dvd although and you can share it with multiple units,43,19
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i think how you can interface with google earth is cool the software they give you for maps is basic but putting all of your tracks and way points on google earth is sweet install on to my gps was easy and uncomplicated,43,20
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,worthless i could have taken my family out to an expensive restaurant and gotten more satisfaction than this provided to me,21,21
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i got the topo maps set to use on my gemin vista hcx and the performance is very disappointing the contour line are dark brown over a yellow background the unpaved roads all show up as a dashed line and it is a far cry from the look you would expect from a topo map i spent almost two hours with their tech support to try and tweak the settings to no avail,73,22
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,it took a while to download to my gps about 10 hours very detailed and i have not begun to explore all of it never tried the 100k so i can not compare,31,23
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i was able to route with this and the trail names actually help out alot i do not like how garmin makes you spend more money on a gps that you already spent way too much for,36,24
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,as advertised items were shipped quickly and packed properly i would buy them again or would suggest to others their purchase,21,25
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,all the detail i expected and more some of the roads are a bit dated as in they are not navigable anymore otherwise excellent in my clunky gps unit,28,26
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,says on the packaging has township and range and section data but there is no way to get the section lines onto the map in base camp or on the device so it was less than useless for me there is no way to use this software to help locate section corners it simply will not do it,57,27
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just purchased this product and first time that i used it received message that the map was out of date and needed updating,23,28
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,ideal map for the garmin gps once i was lost but now i am found although the map works very well with the device and is complete in detail if the device goe out you will need a paper map lest ye be lost again i have loaded the map onto the garmin 450 gps and into basecamp program and the two work very well together,66,29
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i got the package and attempted to upthe maps to my rino 610 no maps showed up on the rino 610 i attempted 3 more times each time it took one hour to upload no maps were uploaded i went to utube and found out that you need to unlock the maps the code is on a little two inch by two inch yellow paper i could not find the yellow sheet with the code i went to garmin tech support no phone number on their web site so i filed out the form and got the email reply from them it stated 3 days to reply to my tech support request i was going to copy and paste the email but garmin does not what people to copy the emails there were no instructions or written statements about unlocking the maps in the packaging and no instructions or cd with the rino 610 i am returning both products i will never buy another garmin product again i love amazon however,173,30
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,my dvd player does not work so I shall be using a friends pc to get the topo on my gps i must have read through the summery of this too quick or it was cut short because i would never order a dvd i just hope this conveniently scratchable disk does not require gigs just to make my gps work garmins nice n all but it has the market by the delicate bits it is sad i have no choice it did work perfectly after installation,83,31
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,these maps are pretty good but because of the file size it was impossible to get all of the map data onto the memory card that goes into the gps i had to delete some of the areas that i did not think I had be travelling to in order to get the rest of the maps to fit on the memory card i know this is not a big deal but they should find a way to make the maps fit on a memory card and before you think well just a bigger memory card i was using the largest memory card supported by the gps unit which is the case with most gpss you are limited to the maximum memory card capacity as set by the manufacturer other than that like i said great maps with good detail,137,32
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,disappointed with the lack of trail info buy this only if all you need is topo info because their is very little to no trail maps at all,28,34
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,expensive program but worth every penny when you are back country unfortunately their are not many options available for the garmin at the moment,24,35
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,it was a good product just lacked in a couple of trails which was not too surprising seeing that they are snowshoe and xc ski trials in the winter and roads and mt bike trails in the summer,37,36
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this is one of those products that you have to sit down and play with becuase the instructions are not great and transferring the maps over to a device is not very streight forward the other reviews about these issues were spot on,43,37
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,I have used the mapsource 100k series since 2002 and purchased the 24k series when i purchased my new gpsmap 62s the 24k series is outstanding well worth the investment i do not know if this is a 24k mapsource feature or a gpsmap 62s feature but i wsa surprised to discover that i can plan a route to a street address by road i did not expect to be able to find a street address with with 24 topo map i wish i would have tried a street address before i installed the 24k series then I had know if it was the gpsmap 62s or the 24k mapsource that provided the capability the maps were great to have while hunting,118,38
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it can not be installed on other then c drive somewhat accurate but expect divergence with reality and 24k map so do not make you are life depend on it this piece is not updatable as is every map from garmin garmins software both mapsource and basecamp is quite low quality and usability it is slow and ugly if you care do not expect much support from garmin if you can use google map if you have to use garmin set you expectation to extremely low level i did but i am still annoyed i just do not understand how free google can be so-o-o much faster more accurate and convenient and why on the earth i should plan and verify my trips on google maps,124,39
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the very first track that i tried to mapped out i found is incomplete and incorrect therefore i can only imagine the accuracy of this topo is suspicious unfortunately garmin has a stranglehold not only on the navigation instrument but also with the proprietary software and of course the maps software that you have to own you can not use any other mapping software / product with the garmin gps for the 12995 plus tax shipping and handling i think i have a reasonable expectation the garmin topo would be accurate it is not my other complaint with the topo software is there are no instructions on use i guess the topo engineers expect new users to be intuitive or just learn by trial and error it is sad garmin can not provide easy to use instructions in plain english,136,40
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i feel like i just got ripped off with this product it would be great if topo 24k worked but with no manual and email support that does not seem to go anywhere i have nothing I have been holding on the 800 support line for almost a hour and starting to feel ripped off this is just too expensive of a product to have no documentation 1st it does not want to install on any other drive then c so have a lot of space available just to install it 3 gigs 2nd once i enlarged the boot drive so that the software wouldi tried to use it again with no manual and no help there has little one can do with it unless your into a treasure hunt i think i got some maps on the oregon 450 t but I am not really sure to delete the files the program says find the file you want to delete then delete it what file what has the name of it where is it located oh i guess one just deletes files randomly until the correct one goes away which ever that file is,191,41
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,auto routing yes universal single use mapping trails great except garmin chose brown elevation lines and brown city roads in parts of san francisco distinguishing streets from a high fill of elevation lines is not that feasible as far as preparing to write to a micro sd card a core 2 duo 6300 took 6 hours to prepare a single 8 min write quad core 9550 more than 4 hours more than twice the estimated displayed also firmware update for etrex and 60csx allowing a 4 gig card not quite enough capacity for ca na or wa 24k i made a special card part city navigator nt part topo 24k city navigator nt disables elevation lines when active california is two map files on nt from map hit menu select setup map check or uncheck nt map for your city needs topo 24k is a separate map file for a zillion usgs quad maps by the way even the older city navigator maps cover some roads in death vally that require experienced 4wd operators stripped butte valley road,178,42
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i bought a gpsmap 60csx and the western us topo 24k maps to use for hikes in and around northern california i specifically bought the 24k map version because it has routable trails the problem is that the map is missing a lot of trails for example in mt tam steep ravine is not included around santa cruz all of the trails that make up the skyline to the sea trail are missing these are major heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the gps unit for hikers i have heard that the 100k version includes all of these trails albeit with less contour information I am really pissed at garmin and will probably be returning these maps,126,43
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i diligently read all the reviews before purchasing and thought i could handle the technology the directions are not clear to me to be honest I have spent only about 30 minutes trying to figure it out but I am already frustrated it is apparent i will need extra help to transfer data from this to my garmin will add more to this post if / when i can actually use the maps,68,44
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this really has a lot more to it the the regular topo map from garmin on the regular garmin us topo maps i got everything from the rockie west on a 2 gb card with the 24k topo i had to use 4 gb card for just the 4 states and i had to leave off the bottom of california below la off to get it to fit i put it in a rino 530 the only down side is it take about two to three minutes longer to start up,89,45
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just got into the geo caching and thought that this would be a handy map for me since i live in ca and do a lot of traveling in the western states havnt had the opportunity to use it yet since i am new to using a gps but hope to use it in a few months,57,46
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i have put this into my garmin and it is a real treat on those rides where i am utterly lost i mountainbike and often wander from the regular trails exploring what may be an even greater challenge or a bunch more fun this program has allowed me to accurately find a safe and easy route and gets me home,60,47
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this was my first mapping software purchase so i was not really sure what to expect and ended up disppointed i purchased this as an upgrade to the map that came with my oregon 400 t i feel like the software is second rate I am also disappointed with the map itself some trails i thought for sure would be on there are missing and the trail lines are so faint they are hard to see anyway not worth the money,78,48
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,great product easy to use but does not run on serial gps like the etrex trexlegend serial version,18,49
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,I have purchased the 60csx i love the unit but have many complaints about the mapsource that came with my kit first off the pacific crest trail 2000 that runs from canada to mexico which is to hikers like interstate 5 is to commuters is only listed as trail this is unbelievable also in washington state near shelton there is a campground known as brown creek it shows this as being in the national park it is not it is in the national forest this is a big deal if you are a hunter it is illegal to hunt in the park but not in the forest i have found many areas where the olympic national park is listed inaccurately if there is a better mapping software compatible that is accurate i would love to know about it,137,50
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i must say this is a major improvment over the 100k map i use this in a nuvi 650 and a etrex vista hcx do not expect trails and such because that is not in this topo however streets and navigation is on units like the nuvi even on the vista the contours are such that i can use them for bushwacking if necessary i compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision that one had no streets whatsoever in my area i would recommend it if you can afford the price i got an amazon discount with a coupon so in conclusion much better than the 100k great map for garmins if the price is ok for you,125,51
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,not sure what i can say about topo maps specifically other than you are going to need them if you spend any time in the back country whether you are hiking or backpacking or just bumming around in the woods the maps are clear and easy to read on my garmin hcx legend they are not cheap but what can you do sure you can look around online for free compatible download-able maps from online sources but i found i could not always get the coverage i needed from free maps simply put if you are going to be using your gpsr for anything outdoorsy on the ground in the western states of washington oregon california or nevada just suck it up and get these 24k topo maps not the 50k1 or 100k1 get the standard of the realm 24k1 topo maps then learn to actually read a topo map if you do not know how garmin provides two free to download guides for using a gpsr one specifically covers using your gpsr in conjunction with a paper topo map these are both good resources and are worth reading especially if you are unfamiliar with the wealth of information a good topo map provides get them here [ ],204,52
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,based on what I have seen so far garmin 24k topo falls very short i only base that on looking for two trails in the olympic mountains both trails are in gaia gps but neither are in the 24k very disappointed i just spent that much money for something that does not have two very popular trails i think garmin could have done much better,63,53
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,it is almost unusable it took many tries to get past data errors before it would install,17,54
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i ordered this back in march of 2015 but did not try to install it until i got a new computer that took awhile now i have tried to install it on two different computers and i keep getting an error code 2502 i down loaded base camp hoping this would solve the problem it did not i tried to install an update for net but that did not resolve it either 8900 bucks and i can not get the damned thing to work on my new windows 10 systems is there a fix,90,55
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,in arizona around the big lake area in the white mountains i found several forest road numbers that are incorrect even in the city of tucson the map has alvernon way not crossing the rillito river there is a very nice bridge at the river all of these mistakes are in a small area but i know these places how can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know that is unless you do not mind being lost in the forest i contacted garmin and their response was to carry back-up navagational maps so i guess they do not trust their own maps buy national geographic state topos in my experience they have never been wrong,115,0
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i purchased this for my garmin vista hcx and the two make an unbeatable combo i can be on a trail in the mountains and request a route home the route will state something like this go north to forest trail 122 4 miles turn right on forest trail 122 go to farm road co123 12 miles turn right on i25 43 miles arrive at home 123 miles 65 hours the miles listed are the trail miles and not straight line distance when i have passed a national forest sign that says jones park 17 miles and checked the distance on my gps it matches exactly the find feature is good as well want to know if there are any hot springs in your hiking area do a find on hot spring and the nearest one will be listed and you can plot a route to it as shown above overall a very good product that i highly recommend,160,1
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,this product is not very user friendly and took us hours to figure out how to use,17,2
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it for all intents and purposes useless it did not show topographic lines and was very difficult to find a particular place i returned it,25,3
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,although these maps lack a lot of the detail of 24k topo maps they are easy toand use i use an oregon 600,25,4
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,not very good coverage for arizona disappointed in the detail around quartzsite arizona,13,5
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,a definiteup for my gps really helps in navigating in the back country however it is a bit pricey,21,6
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,if you use your gps off road at all it is must have information it makes getting out and about safer and more entertaining your gps unit will need to have memory available for storage shop smart,36,7
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the disc comes with no directions the basecamp program that comes with it is seriously out of date after spending hours w tech support we got everything figured out and i was able to do what i needed,37,8
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,topo maps are missing a lot of information shame on you garmin people depend on the accuracy of the maps that you sell,23,9
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this is the defacto standard map for the serious hiker backpacker mountain biker or off road enthusiest the mapsonto your pc hard drive to work with mapsource theya little slow on my machine when you zoom in or out but i attribute this to the small memory in my laptop,54,10
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,ok i felt i had to post this review because of the other review i also had trouble getting it up and running the problem is not with the maps it is with the software that reads the maps i spent some time with garmin tech support free and very helpful the problem is these old discs have a much older version of basecamp on them to make this work you need to go to garmins website and get current basecamp also free install it before you install the maps one other thing the big difference between these and the garmin 100k topo is that these have routable trails and roads as well as lots more detail this is what you need for adventure planning,125,11
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the maps have great detail they are easy to download to my gps or print out fairly easy to figure out by using the help button,25,12
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,I am very disappointed with this expensive high resolution map i use my garmin 62stc for hiking but there are very few trails on here including the well established well maintained trails prior to this i used the neo treks app with my iphone which had many trails on very inexpensive maps the garmin gps outperforms the iphone but these maps are a big disappointment,65,13
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the quality of the displays was expecting the map would look very much like a usgs map instead it seems like a kid with a pen sort of traced the contours more important the shading for open areas against timber is missing so parks and meadows can not be differentiated from forest,55,14
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it will notinto the computer when i try tothe program it will not run even when i try to do it manually,25,15
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,works great with my new garmin oregon 450 glad i ordered this against getting the 100k version which other reviewers have said is about useless I am happy with this,29,16
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the instructions with dvd are minimal and do not work nowhere on the packaging or the dvd does it tell you how much memory is required and that you might need to add an sd card to increase storage capacity the manual for my device is minimal in content poorly written and indexed the online help people at garmin online support contact you once a day i am now on day three trying toa garmin map onto a garmin device,81,17
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,hike and atv in the south west find this to be helpful make sure you downthe up dates,20,18
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,very difficult toon my toshiba lap top then once i got it loaded i went on line to see what program supported the program non was showmen i tried adding it to a couple of programs none will support it feel like i invested money that i can not use,51,19
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,great topo maps but lack trail and road detail below the level of paved roads the maps do not even have fire roads let alone established trails in regional parks the iphone with google maps provides better detail and is much simpler to use there are apps for smart phones that will record routes without having to mark way points besides maps on a smart phone are free and are undated automatically basically the garmin maps and gps off-road devices are dated and difficult to use i have spent many hours and hundreds of dollars on a garmin gps sd card and maps only find they make and interesting paper weight save your money and put it into a good smart phone,121,20
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good maps not exactly a usgs topo but still good with the contours and on the ground identifiers the files are big being over 3 gb however you better have a big micro sd chip in your garmin or other gps,41,21
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the 24k topographic map is functional and works fine the hiking trails indicated on the map are not at all accurate on the several hikes i done since purchasing none are correct the indicated path varies from the actual trails by sometimes more than half a mile not a good thing if you are in deep woods if you want accurate trails for hiking buy something else,67,22
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,unable to make version work that was installed on memory card internal memory version works well although does not appear the same on gps as on pc,27,23
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,this dvd does not open on my macintosh i do not know why or where to find out why there is no manual the garmin website is full of hundreds of products and no good information,35,24
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i think the map is good far more accurate than the default map which comes installed on the gps unit in order to use it on my montana gps i had to copy the data to a memory card i truly dislike the micro sd card it is very small and hard to handle drop it on a backpacking trip and you will never find it,66,25
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the first map i ever got for a trail gps garmin gpsmap 60csx segments are easily loaded to the gps from the pc on which the map is loaded i did not find the colors of the map as hard to make out as some reviewers have said the map does not have as many labelled features as I had like i was using it hiking in the escalante-grand staircase natl monument i found things on google earth for example that are not on the map but these are easily downloaded to the gps if one remembers to do it before leaving home i also found walking on an established trail that the gps tracked me about 100 feet off to the side of it was this a fault of the gps or the map i do not know room for improvement yes adequate to get you where you want to go certainly,148,26
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good price it is a complete set very fast safe delivery have not used it for a couple of years,20,27
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed to find that this was the old version of the product next time i will buy from a retailer so i view the product and make sure it the current version tjm,36,28
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought a new garmin gps for hiking and thought i would order a download from garmin covering all the southwest i am new to the gps world and did not know that this did not include hiking trails so needless to say i wasted my money do not order this if you are wanting detailed hiking trails bob,59,29
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,purchased these maps for a hike in the area of the holly cross wilderness in colorado the maps were quite good except that the trails were either missing or sometimes incorrect i used the maps in my e-trex 20 gps and i was pleased with many options that the gps provided the problem is that even the paper maps often have incorrect trails it is not clear to me whether this is garmins fault or usgs fault in any event even with incorrect trail and a gps you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go i used amazon credit card offer to purchase the maps so for me it was 40 which seems to be reasonable i am not sure i would be that content with the product had i spend in excess of 100 which is the cost of the maps on garmins web page,160,30
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,purchased these topo-maps for off-road exploring in our jeep and loaded on a [ new ] garmin 2595 the 2595 has more than adequate memory capacity for both street and topo maps no chip required thou i have read many folks douse their topo-maps on a micro sd so far I am very pleased the maps accurately depict 90 of the secondary primitive and mining-roads as-well-as geographical features and sites in the area of az where we live have not so-far used them outside of a 150 - 200 square-miles of home-base but in our case for our purposes well worth the price,100,31
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,have been using the maps in northern az getting ready for elk hunt works great in the thick timber great buy,20,32
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,these maps are decent although you can get free topo maps i found out that are pretty much as good the only issue i have yet to discover these maps should support the 3d view on the oregon 450 I shall know in about 6 weeks if that is accurate or not free maps do not have that support,59,34
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,i have used garmins map for about a month and find it very useful while the national forest roads are not all numbered they are shown as are the major hiking trails through the superstition wilderness the maps are great for planning hikes knowing the length and elevaton change of any route considered it is also great to see where we have hiked and know what we are facing before we leave the maps work great on my legend hcx we will be getting additional maps for other areas that we spend time in,90,35
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i found this map easily loaded on my computer and then i just downloaded a portion of the map the area i use on my garmin and it works great,28,36
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this map works great for sure the cool thing is you canon as may cards as you would like for various gpss,24,37
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,the maps work very well with my garmin nuvi showing me features that i am interested in to 4wheel on it goes very nicely with the other map programs i have i installed it and one phone call to garmin was all it took to correct one little mistake i made all i had to due was restart the program to make it work,64,38
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,garmin mapsource topo us 24k is a definite improvement over it is 100k series but unfortunately is incompatible with gps 60cs it works great on my pc but on the gps 60cs the contour lines completely fill the screen obscuring the map i upgraded my garmin 60cs with the latest firmware update but the contour lines still obscure the map i am very unsatisfied with garmins topo series of maps,69,39
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,these garmin maps are a total waste of time poor resolution and detail no poi labels not much to like go to above the timber at [ ] and get the real deal,32,40
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought garmin topo southwest easy to install other than that the product is way over priced for what you get I have been using the old delorme topo 30 garmin just does not compare i hunt in southwest colorado roads are miss labeled or just are just not shown continental divide not shown major trails ie continental divide trail rainbow trail colorado trail not shown a lot of garbage that an outdoorsman does not need who needs to know where shopping centers or an atm are when hunting or as garmin puts it on the trail the reason for the purchase was to put a copy on my etrex legend hcx and i wanted to print maps from my pc well i tried printing a map to an hp laserjet printer and it printed the navteq logo over the map i tried to a second printer an hp inkjet same thing after an hour on hold with technical support the technician told me garmin is aware of the problem and i should do a print screen well the same thing printed i logged into my amazon account and sent it back,189,41
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is safe to say that most gps units are not made to be as user friendly as possible and this software is no different however it is not that difficult to use and will help you get a lot more out of your gps having said that it is ridiculous that you have to pay so much to get these maps i got the southwest maps because that is where i live and do most of my hiking but I am taking a trip to backpack in montana soon and it just is not worth it to buy the separate map dvd for that trip if these things were cheaper i would have amazons price is much better than most others but still very high compared to maps for gps units from other manufacturers i guess it is cheaper than buying lots of paper maps but you have to do that anyway because you are crazy if you rely only on your gps when you are in a place where navigation is a serious concern,167,42
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is a map the detail is good for me i did notice that some dirt roads were not accurate when compared with your tracks but that has not been a problem,31,43
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,as with most garmin products this is an excellent map program much more details than the older programs it does take a while to install on your hard drive but who cares,32,44
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,great product very fas shipping i would buy it again if necessary,12,45
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i purchased this software to be able to research and print maps for backcountry exploration by jeep and hiking i routinely use usgs blm and other topo maps but i purchased this to be able to customize and print maps from anywhere in the southwest it is impossible to print maps because the software will put a huge navteq logo across the page when it prints garmin has no solutions this software is garbage and a total waste of money,80,46
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,perfect for what i want very detailed and easy to use,11,47
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,has good features hard to use need to watch youtube videos to help figure it out,16,48
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,very disappointed the map has less detail than the 100k topo map that was pre-installed on my montana garmin should be ashamed,22,49
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,the other reviewer does not seem to like this product maybe it is his computer but I am also using a macbook running snow leopard and i love this software it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per song but that is exactly how long they say it should take this program fixed my 3000 song library really fast and there has only like 50 or so songs that do not have the correct album art but it is way better than before and worth the money if your still unsure about this program there is a trial you can get at their webstite that will clean 100 songs i recommend it,104,2
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,i used it for two windows xp computers one one it worked fine with 2 gb ram and on the other it locked up several times 1 gb ram i suspect you might have issues if you do not have at least 2 gb overall i am very pleased with it i cleaned up a library of over 5000 songs with a high degree of accuracy although a handful of songs were overwritten with titles in foreign alphabets nothings perfect but i feel like i got a lot of value out of it,92,3
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not purchase tuneup does not work do not waist your money not worth it company does not care no product support likely to be going out of business soon,30,4
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this program works great does what it says it will do and is easy to use i would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean up their music library it does what itunes will not do,37,5
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product delivers as advertised it does a good job of straightening out tags and filling in all the information to test it first i took 5 songs and changed the tags incorrectly tune-up corrected all of them successfully my only complaint is that it is a little slower than i would like but i have a 9000 song library this is definitely worth the 40 lifetime price,70,6
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this product some time ago and wanted to come on here to warn others against buying this software not only does it incorrectly tag many songs it takes a tremendous time to do so and freezes constantly i have used the program on two different computers including a macbook pro and it has frozen on both it may do an acceptable job of identifying fairly well-known rock songs but good luck if your collection includes hip hop electronic or certain older songs even common rock such as the rolling stones steer clear of this product it will save you a lot of hassle,105,7
Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i actually bought the software in a store and upon installation it promptly downloaded an update this update simply does not recognize my activation code that came with the store software but acts like a free trial version and cheerfully let us me know that i have run out of my free service so i go to the website convinced that this certainly must be a mistake but it is not the new service works as annual or lifetime service for additional fee that is it became a webservice instead of a standalone application but they forgot to notify vendors about this who still sell it as the latter and this makes it a plane rip off the software seems to be a greatbut even when it worked it appeared buggy freezy pathetic you can achieve more by doing everything manually than relying on this piece of s tware,149,10
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,be careful of getting a lifetime membership with tune up because your activation code will only work once or twice i sold my old computer and got a new one and even tech support can not solve my issue of transferring the activation key to my new computer super lame it is as if they are at the mercy of their own slow / glitchy software,62,11
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,this software no longer works with the latest version of itunes it is simply criminal that it is still being sold,21,14
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,my itunes library was a mess this product tuned it up works awesome just as promised now my library is up to date with album artwork found or corrected i highly recommend this product,34,16
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,tuneup does what I have bought it for it has been able to successfully arrange most of my songs and get the right album artwork and this is not limited to american songs alone I had recommend this to anyone anyday,39,18
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,as a bestselling author of non-fiction investigative books i do not have time to keep my itunes library in any kind of order i took a chance on tune up expecting the worst 24 hours later i opened itunes and found it in astonishing order some album covers were still missing but i found only one error mozart by don giovani instead of don giovani by mozart and this was a minimalist version of tune up bravo sterling seagrave,78,19
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,especially if you have a big messy library with lots of different sources like mine tuneup worked wonders making complete sense of my library and making the de-duplication task insanely easy highly recommended,33,20
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product works very well it does a decent job of cleaning up song titles and other information i had a very large 17 gb itunes library and it is now 999 accurate the only tracks tuneup could not fix i was also unable to fix manually so i think that is pretty good my only complaint is that when it finds album titles and artwork the majority of the time it will offer up greatest hits or other compilation albums rather than the original album on which the track was released,91,21
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,I have been using tuneup for a while now and i have to say i love it it does exactly what it is supposed to do it cleans the track info and album art additionally the concerts feature is great for me because i have a giant library and it is tough to keep track of who is in town and when tuneup is amazing for making your music library more presentable which is great for ios devices because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better they also just sent me a coupon code for friends and family for 40 off at their website for anyone interested in a deal the code is friends40 either way i highly recommend this product,121,22
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,installation works well but keep in mind that unlike the 2009 map that it replaces the 2010 map can not all fit in the internal built in memory of my 260w you will need to decide what to install eg 49 lower states or eastern north americayou have about 5 options the only way around this is to put the rest of the map on an sd card,70,0
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i prefer using the dvd for the update it was an easy process have had a problem with the download process before,22,1
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,there is not a lot to say about map updates for a gps but upgrading my nuvi to the latest maps and points of interet pois was a painless experience i just put the dvd in my mac and then connected the gps to my computer the updates installed and I am set,52,2
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i bought the one time 2011 maps for my garmin 260w gps on dvd and tried to install it after many crashes it finally installed on my gps or so it said when i turned the gps on it said i no longer had any maps rendering my gps into a doorstop i spent hours with garmin support even giving them control my computer so they couldthemselves they failed repeatedly and had me try loading from the temp file as a last resort of course this also failed and now i get to try to contact them again which can take forever just to find someone else there with another badto try of course they will not suggest replacing the dvd as they now have my money and i now have my doorstop i will never buy garmin again,143,3
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i want to update my garmin nuvi 765 t this looked like what i needed after reading the reviews i wanted to make sure i had the most current update i chatted online with amazon and while very helpful they could not verify if this was for 2012 or not on further research i called garmin they gave me the part number for the onetime 2012 update it is 010 - 10989 - 54 and told me the box is blue white and gray the one amazon is selling ends in 03 so it is an earlier version 2009 not the 2012 so buyer beware i love amazoncom but make sure you are getting exactly what you want and do not just go for the deal buy this particularfrom garmin it is about 10 more plus shipping but you will get the most recent update available that is what i am doing,148,4
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i hope if you buy this you wait for it to go on sale or lightning deal i picked it up for 35 bucks for my nuvi 760 for the people that complained that they needed to get an sd card they clearly should have done their homework before buying the upgrade do you expect just any tires to fit on your car just because you have a car seriously of course it is the manufactures problem that they do not have space i think you need about 780 mb of free space say 1 g to be safe to install the full north america map if you do not have an expansion slot you are really sol with this upgrade,115,5
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i got this on the lightning round for 2999 for my older garmin c320i tried to install on my windows 7 pc but windows keep closing the program and it erased the operating system in the gps had to reinstall off of garmin website i then tried on my windows xp pc and it worked great took about a hour to update without any problems,62,6
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,avoid at all costs I have been trying to do this for over 8 hours i am on third attempt locked up two different computers update-installed the disc in my computer waited the download out right before it finished the download it had an error message corrupted data if problem persists contact garmin customer service 3 time it did this i emailed garmin customer service the had me clarify on three different responses which came early morning so i assume customer service is in india i had at least 7 responses and a phone call while i was at work from garmin with no solutions except to retry installing with the disc finally i told him I had just get a magellan or a tomtom he used the old we are an american company and i should reconsider i am very pro american made purchasing but between your customer service probably in india and your product making my gps a useless brick i will shop else where thank you very much,168,7
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have tried to install it for about 5 hours at this point i have tried three computers at first it would crash early on but i was able to bypass the autorun and start the installer manually at this point i was able to get it to download all the updates but it took two hours i have a very fast connection but it was very slow it was within 1 minute of being done when the installer program crashed now when i start over it wants to download from the beginning it is not worth it if i could just return it i would but i have entered my key so i am stuck,116,8
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,my nuvi 200 just did n't have enough room to accomadate the full united states maps so you have to select the next best map to suit your needs easy install tho,30,9
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this was so much easier than the download process from garmin i updated my nuvi 650 with no problems,19,10
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i am one of those who purchased the code sunday may 2 and could not download it it is working fine now i am happy to report and it is updating just fine i docked them a star for the pain yesterday,42,11
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was great roads that i would not come up previously now come up when i enter the address keeping the maps updated ensures new roads are available and the cd was so easy to use i highly recommend it,40,12
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i ordered the 2009 version cancelled it then received the 2010 version in 2 days 2010 version was wrong and i still have to return 2009amazons ordering is constantly wrong,30,13
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read more of the reviews and forums beforehand this has been a time consuming process due to the limited information they provide up front and lengthy customer service wait times tried garmins online help and email help but they continue to provide the same steps after explaining in detail it has not resolved the issue no detailed maps found that support routing,66,14
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have downloaded the garmin update into my unit and find that there has not been any update at all the unit still insists that i need to update it and i do not know what to do please contact me if at all possible with either a new unit or a suggestion as to how to make this work thank you,62,15
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,after spending [ ] to update the maps on my garmin nuvi 265 t i now have a gps which takes 5 minutes to turn andup the maps and it is completely silent no sound i checked the volume settings and it is at 80 t no soun bud comes out of the unit try getting support from garmin every time i call i am put on hold with an estimated wait time of at least 30 minutes who has time for that i think i will just go out and buy a tom tom which is what i should have done in the first place instead of updating something 3 years old,113,16
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,easy to use and invaluable provided the updates i needed and did not lock me into anything more than a one-time upgrade as i might get a new gps sometime soon,30,17
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i needed to update my streetpilot c550 since it was several years old i read in other reviews of some horrors with some of the updates i will have to say i had no problem eventhough it took several hours i am now seeing highways that had not been on my garmin previously the only reason i gave it only four stars is the cost of the update the price is rather steep for a one time use,79,18
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,the ordering shipping and receipt process was excellent i am enjoying the product,13,19
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i purchased the 2010 map update for my garmin gps soon after i installed the update on my gps the touch screen function of the unit froze up and ceased to work the unit will find the satellite start up as normal but will not allow any touch function to operate so the unit is now useless i do not konw if the update is responsible for this malfunction but my gps worked properly prior to the installation,77,20
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i received the updates and installed them on my garmin it definitely made a difference there are streets on there that my old garmin maps did not recognize i am over all very pleased with the updated maps,37,21
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i was hoping that this update would map some areas that were not included when i originally purchased my device did not happen to be fair the service that supplies map data to garmin is not doing their job and my friends bmw does not these areas correctly either it will be a few years before i do another update,60,22
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was a snap to install i had tried updates online but had difficulty even getting my unit registered using the cd is much easier,25,23
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,with the prices of gps units dropping it is tempting to just replace the whole unit as the maps age and need updating at full list price for an update that is exactly what i would have done but at a reasonable discounted price 50 rather than 70 i chose to do the update it was easy and went smoothly my 3 year old garmin gps is now as current maps-wise as new out-of-the-box unit my only wish and what would have made this upgrade 5 stars is that the software would also update the operating system of the nuvi and not just the map data the newer operating systems lock on to satellites much faster than the older ones and the map displays have been somewhat improved as well,130,24
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i reside in a rural area of the southeast the garman 2010 map update gives significantly more detail and is much more reliable than the 2008 version although I am not terribly demanding it has not failed to locate any poi that i have requested,44,25
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,the garmin gps software i purchased works as described several changes have been included i can recommend this procust,19,26
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,the map update is listed as compatible with the nvi 200 series but it turns out that the update files are too big for the 200s internal memory it is possible to do the update but only by adding an sd card in the 200s slot and loading the bulk of the update onto that instead of the internal memory there is no documentation or web resource at garmin that i could find to explain this and the process for doing it is not entirely self-evident,86,27
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,this map update is compatible with the zumo 550 i use for motorcycle touring the installation was easy although it took well over an hour unattended to complete i get these map updates every year and find them to be worth the price the update also installed a new version of mapsource the desktop application that allows creating routes that can be downloaded to the gps it is compatible with the existing data files so you will not lose access to routes you may have already created in prior versions an important tip this will only update one garmin unit keyed to the units serial number shortly after installing this map my garmin had to be replaced because i accidentally damaged the touchscreen a quick call to garmin after i received my replacement unit had them reassign this map update to the new units serial number so i couldit into the new gps good service from garmin,157,28
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i do not know how many streets changed in the two years since i owned my nuvi 350 but not enough to warrant a new set of maps costing 60 to 70 for a product costing 199 but what really is upsetting is that i have two nuvi 350s one for my brother and they will not let me update both nuvis with one dvd this reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes they stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations with lots more happy customers for their efforts garmin should have allowed me to use my 60 map update on both nuvis or made it cheap enough i would not feel so ripped off now i am just ticked off next time I shall try tom-tom or wait for a decent iphone app,153,29
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have received my garmin 2010 map updates on a timely basis and am satisfied with the product,18,30
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,update would notinto my street pilot 7200 without tec help after tec help the 7200 did not perform as well as before the update many of the secondary roads were missing that came with the original program i would not recommend this update,45,31
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,unfortunately i made a bad mistake this was not a garmin map it was just an update for the people who has a garmin with a older version of the map as i rated this a very good map and the price was somehow good,45,32
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,bear in mind folks this cd will update only one garmin unit if you have 2 or more i have 3 one in each of 2 cars and 1 in my motor home you will have to buy 2 or more,42,33
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this product updated my nuvi 650 with no glitches whatsoever the dvd installs to the computer first and then installs the updates to the gps the entire process took about 2 1/2 hours all i had to do was enter the key number on the inside of the dvd sleeve i did not have to go to the garmin site as i have seen others say they did there is now streets showing that did not show on my 2008 version,78,34
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the garmin numaps 2010 america one-time update we moved to a new city and were using our gps to locate stores for shopping the old maps led us to a fabric store and many others that were no longer there we were told by neighboring stores that a particular store had not been there for 10 years we thought the upgrade would solve the problem the first thing we did when we got the upgrade was look to see that this missing store had been eliminated it is still listed on the upgrade as are several other stores that have been closed for 3 years or more i do not really see any difference in the upgrade and i consider it wasted money,126,35
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,upgraded my garmin with no hassle device boot up first time and everything seemed to be working perfectly good job garmin updated 3/26/2012 do not buy the one time upgrade anymore one can get the life time map update for a little more for the life time of the gps it is a worthwhile investment happy driving,56,36
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i must not have looked at it very hard but i was expecting a more up-to-date cd instead of 2011 update is there anything i can do to get a more up-to-date cd for my garmin nuvi,37,37
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,did not include some map updates made between 2007 and 2009 what a joke i want my money back,19,38
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,thanks for the article works great thanks for sending vyu u harto po old gt km u lo re u,20,39
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have an old garmin unit and i did not want to pay for a lifetime map update since I shall be purchasing a new unit in a year or so and all the new units come with lifetime updates while i was waiting to purchase the new unit this one time update seemed like a greatthe microsd card works great i plugged it into my unit and the new maps were included i will use this for a year or so and then buy my new unit great deal,90,40
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,was just what i needed to update my garmin save me from buying a new one now i need a new battery,22,41
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,microsoft mappoint is good for two types of users those who need a super gps and those who need to create maps to go with their presentations and analysis with a gps puck not included ms mappoint becomes a great gps for salesmen delivery men and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner most gps devices fail in this regard they work great from point a to b and could include a detour but forget about going to ten locations it would be great if ms had a self-contained gps device not a laptop which could be programed with the information generated from mappoint by using a pc as the user interface it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen as for the maps it generates we are currently analysing a coal mine and our pitch book was much more comprehensive as a result of using mappoint over copying and pasting googlemaps and the like,169,0
Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,i have been using this program for the past few weeks and am very satisfied with it the software installed and ran without problems on my windows 7 ultimate machine i was dissapointed that the usual irritating microsft activation technology was used if the user just wants a mapping program then microsoft streets and trips 2010 is a cheaper and more practical way to go the programs interface is extremely similar to streets and trips 2010 mappoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in the capability for interface with excel is provided and seemed to work well,112,1
Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,a great piece of software for using a map as a reference user needs a good background in excell or they can be lost,24,2
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,was used and did notcorrectly told by microsoft it wa obsolete so the do not support it an go to forrum for help bad registry keys had to send it back,34,3
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,old version not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies,29,4
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this product i can not find 40 percent of the existing addresses I have entered google map finds them even mss own bing maps finds them but not mappoint 2010 I am sorry i bought it,38,5
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i got this product mainly to import maps into word documents the interface works seamlessly the maps are gorgeous and with a high level of detail perfect for a multitude of applications including illustrations for flyers maps diaries blogs or journals,41,6
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i recently purchased mappoint 2010 through amazon so the price was already better than buying it directly from microsoft or at any office supply stores i am finding it to be very useful for my business we have to generate a lot of maps for our clients and mappoint is better than alternative mapping software from the standpoint of clarity of the maps and boundary definitions we do not need the wayfinding function so having that is of no value we use the territory function to highlight market areas by county or zip code that works okay but is a little cumbersome i also find transferring a map to word or powerpoint documents to be more difficult that it should be smartdraw is easier and it is not even a microsoft product,131,7
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,it is marginally ok for mapping addresses and mapping simple fields but you can not do more advanced functions such as exporting business names addresses and more for this i had to write custom code and extract into excel it has ended up being of little value from a business standpoint absolutely do not buy thinking it can be used as a cheap gis tool,63,8
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i liked the microsoft mappoint 2010 software it was easy to install and works well with vista the software is also easy to navigate and fun to use however it may not be for everyone it seems to have features you may not even use if you just need it to go from point a to b but if you need it for work related purposes or even to map out an itinerary with stops then look no further and the price may even be worth it,87,9
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,i will give it to microsoft when it comes to mappoint it has always been a breeze to setup relatively simple to use and very effective at what it does that being said there has not enough new content in mappoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software unless you absolutely need the new features the improvements on mappoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor pushpin management has been overhauled and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from map settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation also you are now able to import export gpx files making for easier data sharing if you need new features like these then by all means i would recommend purchasing mappoint 2010 if this is your first purchase of mappoint take advantage of the free trial download online and also compare mappoints features to those of the cheaper microsoft streets and trips 2010 personally that is what i use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs,182,10
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,I have had this program for a while now and i can confirm that it is not that good however it is better than streets and trips it has the same abilities but is also suited to add info to microsoft office applications i can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily but if you just want a street guide go with s and t what worries me considerably is that microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application bing maps this application is only available direct from microsoft and the cost varies with the number of seats you license that makes me wonder how long mappoint will be available and whether bing maps will be a better program in addition other map companies like google may already have similar applications or be about to release them i suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you will buy,159,11
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,first if you plan to sync and use this software in conjunction with a gps device you would better have the garmin brand preferably the latest one moreover if you business extends into canada this software will not be of much use for someone who wishes to put together say a national sales presentation or wishes to analyze data by geographic localities mappoint might be just the ticket given the number of options available for businesses today however this software seems overpriced a bit outdated even irrelevant and limited for most purposes other reviewers have rightly pointed out some of it is other shortcomings and limitations on the other hand if your business needs the specific capabilities that this particular program offers you will not find a better alternative what it does do it does relatively well if not easily,138,12
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,mappoint does not recognize some major streets in the community in which i am plotting data technical support was not able to help product not worth my time and effort if it does not work properly,33,13
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i have previous versions of microsoft streets and trips and have used it numerous times for maps and vacation plannning as well as it is gps capabilities microsoft map point is basically the big brother of ms streets and trips however it adds the ability to download maps to a gps device which is definitely a nice add-on and something i wish streets and trips could do and it adds the ability to import or link contact location data from ms outlook and display it custom maps beyond that i can not see where it really adds enough features to be worth the much higher price they charge for map point as opposed to streets and trips but it does run well and does all the functions it is supposed to do so if you really need to easily link and map your outlook customer data then this is the way to go,152,14
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,sometimes the position of the location flag is not very accurate and the data must be pristine as the software can not deal with post office box numbers that are on the same line as the addresses garbage in garbage out sometimes it gets confused if county road is abbreviated as cr or c r or even county road so clean up the data in excel before importing it into map point but for what i paid for the software i am satisfied,82,15
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,there has almost no configuration and to be perfectly frank the resulting maps look like crap the icons are of very poor image quality even if you manage to import a custom one because the pixel range is so darn small and again almost no configurability i feel sorry for everyone including myself stuck using this horribly designed software,61,16
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,been using this product for 3 years total and 2 years on multi user after learning curve we depend on it totally i had to call tech support twice when we converted to multi user but we caused all our problem highly recommend for mac users besides what else is available that can beat it and stay in the nac world,62,0
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,although quickbooks is not geared to handling books for outside salesmen it can be accomodated to give you access to information that you need i have not found another product that can do this running our home based small business it is important to keep records on commissions to sub-reps and income from multiple businesses that we represent quickbooks does this,60,1
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,constant crashing longtimes reports that will not run can not tag line items in purchase orders to a job it is a terrible product and i only use it because i have to,32,2
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am not an accountant so i do not use all the capability of the program for what i need it works fine my complaint is every new version of mac os has required me to buy a complete new version of quickbooks i started out years ago with a windows version paid full price then switched to mac bought another version at full price then when we went to snow leopard had to buy another new version and the same with lion so i have over the course of 5 years purchased the program 4 times this is crazy i could see some reduced upgrade price being fair but re-buying the whole program is just not right because of this i can not recommend this product to someone who is looking for an accounting program,134,3
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have had an awful time with qb mac since my purchase i wish i could return it and go back to qb for windows i have had constant technical issues and no one in technical support can help i think there are great things about the program if only they worked correctly i am incredibly disappointed and if it was not for the brand new mac computer i would go back to using qb for windows in a heartbeat,79,4
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quick books for windows for 20 years and just made the switch 6 months ago to a mac all my data converged into qb for mac flawlessly it is very easy and user friendly,37,5
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for mac really sucks for inventory you can not upload from excel unless you save as a txt file then change to an iff file while on desk top even then some feild are missing,35,6
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,qb has been great for my trucking business this accounting software has really helped keep my business organized little square for mac has been a huge help for any accounting questions i have i would recommend it to anyone trying to keep track of their money,46,7
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,disappointed in intuit they claim that you can make copies for windows users ie accountants but it does not work well when you call tech support they tell you not to do it so how if i am a mac user and my accountant is a pc user am i supposed to give him my account to reconcile also it does not share the same features as qb for windows like alias,72,8
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quick books is a great program but the invoicing module desperately needs to be more flexible and robust i can not format invoices in a way that really works for me or add the text i need to,37,9
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,moving from windows to mac qb was easy and wish i had done it sooner well worth the purchase for the four varied companies for which i keep books,29,10
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we have been waiting for intuit to give mac the full set of features and qb 2011 was the first one that did while it is nice to use it on my mac it has all the same problems as regular qb it crashes once a day if not more we have had a hard time with several of the features it will kick me out for no reason if there is another user unfortunately for us the switching cost of going to another accounting software would be to great but if i was a first time buyer i would tell you to look long and hard at your choices as this may not be the best one,118,11
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love this version of quickbooks better yet because i purchased it on amazon when my hard drive crashed last year all i had to do was log on and re-download the software such an easy recovery the interface is clean and simple I have had a few problems with printing checks it does not recognize they have printed and freezes up my print queue but other than that it is been really easy to use and switch from pc,76,12
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,compared to qb for windows this falls flat too many annoying bugs accounts are slow to update and overall this is just tedious to use wish i stayed with the windows version that version is fantastic,37,13
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this program is not user-friendly at all I am a contractor and purchased this program after it was referred to me by a sub-contractor that i have become friends with I am admittedly not a great business man i do not have a business degree of any kind and i struggle to keep up with my paperwork which is why i purchased this program it is difficult to say the least if you have used previous quickbooks programs and are familiar with it all then maybe it will work better for you but i was previously using quicken 2000 and this is ten times more complicated that being said if you are more business savvy than i am which I am guessing most of you are then this program ight be for you because it really does do everything except payroll payroll costs more a lot more,143,14
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,there are some extremely annoying quirks in this mac version of quickbooks entries rearrange themselves in the ledgers according to check or transaction numbers rather than date which is not the same system as used by my bank on their statements so reconciling is a pain i prefer single-line entries only the ledger keeps flipping back to double-line entries almost on it is own also the backup process presumably designed to improve upon the previous or pc version is actually not an improvement at all as it is no longer simple to save only the 3 most recent backups rather than the whole slew this version of quickbooks is clumsy and not well thought through by the programmers needs workquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],126,15
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,we have a very small business but the same processes need to happen as in a large company quickbooks allows me do everything we need related to our finances without having to hire another staff person,36,16
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,after using quick books for 15 years the switch from pc to mac versions has been awful screens are confusing many reports are missing time to learn the new program was a lot longer than i expected as a regular user i am abandoning the mac version and going back to pc very disappointed intuit should take this off the market until they can get it right,68,17
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product lacks the conveniences contained in intuits qb for windows every customization is a battle it seems i have used qb for mac 2011 for nearly a year now and am ready to get another pc and go back to the productivity and speed i used to enjoy i can not stand the payroll section of qb for mac or the payroll support staff and the price for payroll support,70,18
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i wish i would have known that i would need to pay extra for support i wish i would have know that when reconciling accounts the mac version does not have the same features as the windows version ie unable to sort data by dollar amount unable to obtain a reconcilement discrepancy report,53,19
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,love my new mac but the intuit software quicken and quick books does not compare with the microsoft versions i have been a quicken user for my personal account since their inception but i am greatly disappointed in the mac product i assume that this is due to not selling as many mac versions and therefore less time and money were spent on developing it there are extra steps necessary in the mac products more so in quicken than in quickbooks the reconcile is also an example of an inferior product,91,20
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,I have been using qb99 with windows and got a mac in jan and wanted to get the current version with some help from my qb consultant we converted to qb for mac i love it all my old numbers imported flawlessly and now I am much better organized,47,21
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i think i like the quickbooks for mac much better than windows very easy to use and not hard at all to transfer from windows to mac did not lose anything in the transfer,33,22
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is the first business accounting software I have personally used in a long time i picked up the software quickly and find it easy to use and generally user friendly no problems getting it to do what i need in my construction business but I am disappointed the mac version is not as full featured as the pc version based on comments from my accountant i feel like I am using a 5 year old version of the pc software it works fine just has limitations i know the pc version does not have I am also disappointed the quickbooks payroll for mac defaults to adobe for printing and viewing files macs preview works just fine in quickbooks why does not it also work with quickbooks payroll for mac,123,23
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks on the mac is super easy i was familiar with qb on a pc so perhaps had an easier time getting started with it on the mac it is user-friendly for all the purposes i need to use it i definitely recommend it,43,24
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,my business depends on invoices being correct and this program always has the wrong date on the invoice most of the time i do not notice it until it is too late email invoice it is quite embarrassing to be sending things to customer that are wrong i have asked your technical team to help and that was useless i never had a problem when i used quickbooks with my pc your mac version falls way short of what it could be almost forgot another thing when your program un dates the financial institution information it does absolutely nothing except stay in a non-responsive mode i have to force quit since it never does anything except prevent me from using the program i would never have used this mac quickbooks if i would have known it had this many problems actually there are more but for now those are the only things that come to mind after using this software for about 4 months dr locke,163,25
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,with no ability to create an accountants file it makes for a lot of extra work my accountant writes out changes by hand and then i input everything the windows version has this option why not mac,37,26
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i find it harder to use for budgeting purposes than quicken was i was using quicken on my pc and am considering returning to it,25,27
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have used quickbooks for windows for over 10 years and was very satisfied with is performance and reliability quick books for mac has not been as good it seems clumsy and is not as easy to use,38,28
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac 2011 omits many functions that can be found on the pc version the lack of inventory tracking is a big one why would such a seemingly easy and very needed basic function not be in the mac version,41,29
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i really love the qb upgrade from pc to mac and the smooth ease to transfer all my files into the new format further it is really easy to use,30,30
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,if you only use a mac and you are brand new to quickbooks you should have no problem with this product i have heard horror stories about quickbooks for mac but if you do not know any other way it is just fine i have a very small business new business that i needed quickbooks for and i did not want to do the whole parallels thing so i decided just to give quickbooks for mac a shot as i mentioned earlier knowing no other way is key because you will not be comparing it to quickbooks for windows and you will find that all your needs are being met I have been completely satisfied,110,31
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is great but it has a couple of drawbacks that are really annoying when i customize a report and save it the report column widths are not saved so each time i run the report i have to adjust the column widths also when entering a transaction in the register if the payee exists the details from the last transaction will automatically be copied to the current transaction if there is no detail to the transaction being entered that is no split it is not intuitive to go into the check itself to check that the memo line has not been overwritten by a detail memo line transferred from a previous transaction the result incorrect memos on checks if these are dumb user errors I had really like to know how to fix them,135,32
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used qb for a very long time way before intuit made a version for the mac i have been a recent convert from the pc roughly 2 years it all came about because i had a series of viruses and window errors that drove me to the point of despair along came one of my good friends and colleagues with a gift of my very first mac a macbook i went from total despair to why the heck did not i do this years ago anyway i am know 100 mac luckily intuit has understood that migration from pcs to macs is an ongoing phenomena which will not slow down i started using qb for mac as soon as it came out it makes bookkeeping sooo easy neat and quick i should know i am an accountant by trade cpa I have used heavy duty systems and other light versions qb mac is hands down the best now if intuit made it is turbo tax software in mac then they would be hitting a home run i can not wait to see that happen have fun using qb for mac yucagreengo,188,33
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,I have used quickbooks on various pcs for many years and loved the performance my boss decided to purchase a macbook as my replacement computer last year which meant converting my pc quickbooks file to a mac version i had noof all the limitations I had encounter as a result of this conversion and I am extremely frustrated by some very important functions that i simply can not do at all such as sending out an accountants copy for tax preparation so that I am able to continue to work in quickbooks until the accountant returns his revised copy to be integrated back into my file I have been quite disappointed and i sincerely hope that the mac version will soon be as good as the pc version,124,34
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am a small business owner that went from qb2009 for pc to qb2011 for mac and although i am not a professional in keeping books i can manage quite well the mac version is lacking in a few areas like price levels and the ability to change some categories of items but overall it is well designed and easy to navigate,62,35
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,after reading several of the reviews prior to purchasing quickbooks 2011 for mac it is better than we expected our old version of quickbooks ran on a pc that was full of gliches delays and slow downs it had so many bugs just because it was installed on a pc in all honesty there are some annoying gliches for example sometimes if you click on invoices of checkbook you get pay sales tax or some other innappropriate response over all the ease and speed at which we can now work is well worth the few issues that come up here and there if you own a mac but are an avid quickbooks user we do recommend this product for home and small business use we maintain 2 businesses plus our personal financials with this program and are pleased with it,140,36
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been a quickbooks user for over 20 years but always owned a pc recently a client bought a mac computer and he purchased quickbooks mac what a nightmare would not recommend it to anyone not user friendly and like i said i have years of experience with quickbooks the payroll online only is a complete pain in the butt and you never feel in control i hate this program and hope i can talk my client into changing back to a pc i do not even like giving it a 1 star rating but it will not let me leave it blank,102,37
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,what a relief i get by using quickbooks it keeps me straight on tracking all of my expenses my invoicing and banking matters reports are easy to run and can be customized easily it makes my tax prep so much easier too love it,45,38
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,works but 1 journal entries can not scroll forward and backward to see prior entries quickly as was possible on other windows version 2 chart of accounts not so user friendly to find out how to for example create or edit new accounts and more 4 stars needs some work for ease of use with payroll i tried to get payroll installed by calling intruit and quickbooks and it took 2 - 3 hours then even although i ordered it and gave my cc they did not install it it will be a long time before i waste that much more of my time on the chance that it might not get done again workarounds for 1 person companies are difficult and it would be nicer if allowed to workaround easier for one person for payroll without signing up since it is usually not worth it for one person companies to sign up for payrollquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],158,39
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,many many features from the pc version of quickbooks seem to be missing the help menu is also very weak,20,40
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty,20,41
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if it had the same features as the quickbooks for windows does then it would be a great product i hope that quickbooks for mac can catch up with the features available with quickbooks for windows,36,42
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,reports are tedious in the mac version of qb along with many other tasks as well was hoping the 2011 mac version would solve many of these problems but alas it did not best to stay with windows when using quickbooks,41,43
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there have been numerous problems with this version since it is inception we have had to carry intuit / quickbooks helps since we loaded it on earlier this year problems with financial statements and having to rebuild data have slowed our progress as an entity i had thought that this would be good for our mac shop but not at this point we even had to have the data rebuilt outside the organization quickbooks which was not easily implemented formatting compilation research backups you name it we have had problems,87,44
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love my new mac however quickbooks is really not mac compatible it takes so much longer to do everything i hate it you can not do multiple payments at one time the payment screen closes after each payment you can not right click on an invoice to receive payments,48,45
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i really do not the on-line payroll very difficult to set up also no way to print an invoice for part of an estimate i would like to see a way to do that and to do payroll from the desktop like other quickbooks programs if i had known all the problems i would not have changed i wish they would make the contractor editions in a mac version,68,46

Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the quickbooks for mac is far away from the capabilities of the quickbooks for pc they haven a long way of improvements to go regretfully if you have a mac there is nothing else than using the qb for mac the worst part is the payroll service,47,49
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i can not believe that my only option to understand this program is to take a class I have spend so many hours trying to figure out this stupid software i work in a tech company and have to deal with new software every day but I have never seen such a terrible product in my life what a waste of time and money,61,50
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if have used qb for windows and are desperate to use qb for your mac hold your nose and make the purchase but be aware that the mac version is far inferior to the windows version and if you purchase a couple weeks before a new version is released you are stuck so be careful to check if a new version is coming out soon customer service is an adversarial experience the qb rep first denies that the problem is with the system and accordingly you must pay for the advice if you persist and prevail the qb rep grudgingly helps ideally they take control over your computer and do it themselves because their oral instructions are awful and they fight with you as you try to explain the problem most importantly back up qb before calling for service so they do not delete your files if you ever wonder where bangalore institute of technology dropouts go to get jobs call qb customer service,165,51

Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched to an imac several years ago i ran quickbooks on windows for many years and just this last year switched to the mac version it is good but it could utilize the unique mac features much better it acts a lot like a converted windows version instead of a stand alone mac version it would be awesome if they could make an iphone app that would allow expenses to be entered on the go that would then wirelessly be entered on my office computer i must say that intuit is doing a much better job on the mac software than before i ran an emulator on my mac to run the windows version for quite a while because the mac version was not up to snuff now it is much better and so i switched,134,62

Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for six years the first five were on a windows pc i have reported my problems to apple but the discrepancies are still there they are not huge but they are annoying my biggest problem is when I am writing a check click on an account and run the mouse over the account it does not show what is underneath the main account word like the sub category i might write a check with numerous accounts so it is really annoying the same thing happens in the bank register when you click on the account then run the mouse over it it needs to show what is underneath but it does not it is hard to check for mistakes so you have to do it all over again if there is doubt,135,74
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i constantly have to re-enter data because of the frequent error messages i get from quickbooks and it often makes odd demands refusing to save what i just entered so i have to close the program and start all over again it is a maddening program and i wish I had stuck with the accounting system i set up myself in filemakerpro,60,75

Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am looking to open a new business in the coming months and i have not done any research on accounting software just assuming i will be buying quickbooks for mac i am so happy i spent the time going through these reviews on amazon i have a mac and my business partner has a pc we were going to upgrade her to a mac so that we could have compatible os for software purposes such as quickbooks however i am now thinking that we will keep her pc and try to find a different accounting program i was amazed at the reviews left on this site the common issues for all of the reviewers strongly suggests that intuit needs to get it is act together thanks for all of the posts,130,83
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for mac for several months i have no prior quickbooks experience i found it easy to use and very helpful it seems virtually impossible to mess up things can easily be added deleted and moved it has been very useful being able to track my business progress via quickbook i do not know what i would have done without it my only complaint is the fact there is not a mobile phone app for mac users it is kind of crazy to have an iphone app available for windows users but not mac users really i hope this will be corrected soon having a mobile app that syncs with my computer would quickbooks really rock,119,84
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if you are transferring from windows to mac do not get parallels and use the windows version the mac version is not compatible with payroll so you have to sign up for their version which used to cost us 189 / year and now cost us 65 / month anytime you type a t in the check field it automatically puts in to print the autofill does not work as good as the windows versions windows info does not translate correctly at random times so you have to download it back to windows and then back to mac because rebuilding the data does not correct it if you are a setting up a new company or first time user it is ok but like i said at the beginning the windows version is better,129,85
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is my firstinto quickbooks after being a long time quicken for windows user the church treasurer and i were trained on quickbooks together he was trained on the windows version while i was on the mac version they mirror each other relatively closely and if you know one you can certainly manage the other the only area of great disappointed was related to online banking the mac version does not have the capability to make online payments through your online banking system through quickbooks for mac this is a great feature with the windows product no double entry just key it once into the check register and send it to the bank for payment with quickbooks for mac i have to double key the entry i key it once into the quickbooks checking account register and then again into the online banking system when i download the statements from the bank quickbooks for mac recognizes the entry for the most part and matches them so i do not have to manually do it overall i am very satisfied with that one exception i use it for church accounting with a couple hundred thousand going through each year no issues to this point,204,86
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am finding that the quickbood for macs has a lot of problems that i had never encountered with quickbook for pcs i was debating getting a mac just because i use my computer a lot for quickbooks and the reviews for macs quickbook were bad my daughter decided to get me a mac for xmas and as much as i loved my mac have had many many problems,69,87
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i run the books for our home owners association we switched to quickbooks for mac a year and a half ago it simplifies everything to be able to send monthly reports in just a few seconds and to email invoices saves a lot of time the 2011 updates are more mac-like i especially like the ability to customize reports so they are not as bland looking great program,67,88
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,all in all it works like the qbooks for windows except often whenever i go into an account it asks for a security question which is very annoying,29,89
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product is the worst some of the selections just do not click open for example i can not open one check book register today and the option to place payments called receive payments is simply not responding this happens daily so i am constantly behind soon i will give up and hire a bookkeeper sigh,53,90
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,had qb for pc for 8 years then made the switch to mac there are many glitches within the software frustrating,21,91

Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we use to enjoy quick books multi user addition on our pcs we now use quick books for mac multi user mode it lacks many features that we used on the pc version we are disappointed but continue to use it i hope you keep working on it until you incorporate the features that were available on quick books premier dan endsley owner endmark sales and marketing,67,93
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,full of bugs every time i get an update i think maybe this time they fixed the bugs but alas no very poorly designed integration into the mac os like the title says it gets the job done but very poorly,41,94
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as soon as i bought it i was able to download it which was amazing great program perfect for small business such as ours,24,95
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,a major bug that has cost us lost data and time is the no security question exists error message it keeps popping up when we need to access our bank account intuit please fix it another annoying bug that quickbooks needs to fix is that we are unable to remove a user once created a user can not be removed it became annoying when the list of old users got longer and longer we are still trying to figure out how to network quickbooks between two macs apparently the data can not be stored on a server the data must be stored on one of our computers that means if that computer is not on i can not access my quickbooks data from my laptop and if i store the data on my laptop if i take the laptop out of the office my bookkeeper has no access to the data either i think that is stupid,154,96
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,previous user on pc thought it would be easy transition it works but has some flaws my invoices occasionally put the previous days date on the first invoice of the day annoying,32,97
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i upgraded as the 2010 version would not work with lion i noticed very little difference from qb mac 10 if you liked qb 10 you will like this one also it is a good program yes i know it is not qb windows but it functions well is stable and is simple to navigate if you or your accountant are used to qb windows if there are functionality changes I am not missing them considering that intuit has a disgraceful record of supporting osx this program is a miracle just look at what quicken for mac turned into quicken essentials for mac which is the poorest reviewed program I have ever seen if you have a mac and you need an accounting program this is the one to get,127,98
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i do not know why quickbooks and quicken for mac are so bad compared to the pc version i use both and dread using it on the mac and have used both products for years and really enjoy it on pc,40,99
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I had give it 3 stars if it was not missing functions that the pc version has very buggy three updates so far and they still can not get it fixed the bookkeeper we use and a pro w / quickbooks can not figure how to work with some of the issues,46,100
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i bought an apple imac and wanted to use it with quickbooks mistake more difficult to use than the windows-based version still can not figure out how to get the ledger to show up without repeatedly clicking on the register icon and have it do absolutely nothing the help you get when you call in is completely frustrating i avoid calling even if i have a problem because it is so terrible they speak english but they do not understand what you are saying and they always want to sell you something else they eventually get the issue solved but at a great expense of my time because of the language barrier i used to do my own payroll but will now have to go to a payroll service to get it done and will not use the quickbooks payroll because of it being dis-jointed I am not fond of the company they are irritating,147,101
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have run several quickbooks all for mac i have always liked the products as long as i am the only one working on it and it is on our macs the problem is when you bring in a bookkeeper or accountant and they need to pull data or share data to compress and reformat is frustrating i have had intuit qb for mac specialists helping and still ran into issuestry qb essentials online it is cloud type tech so easier for others to access,83,102
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,great but no app all the apps are for quickbook for windows figure that one out intuit iphone app for windows only,22,103

Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks 2011 for mac is a great software one of the most user friendly accountant softwares of all times and very intuitive few bugs although and restricted on vat countries payments and customizing invoices advisable,35,106
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version of quickbooks is awful it lacks significant functionality of the windows versions there are few if any third-party plug-ins available because intuit has not released a software development kit if you are going to convert to mac plan to add the cost of vmware fusion and windows 7 so you can run quickbooks in windows,57,107
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a church treasurer quickbooks has made my work so much easier all of the necessary reports and records a readily available no matter what my pastor asks for,29,108
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i love my mac my employees love having an all-mac office the only downside is being stuck with qb for mac it is not as robust as qb for pcs also intuit treat mac owners like second class citizens the strong message they send us is want real quickbooks buy a pc there is a real opportunity for someone to develop a qb-like program for macs one that has real customer support and has been developed by someone who does not hate macs i use qb because i do not have time to find an alternative as soon as i do I am gone,100,109
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before i purchased quickbook for mac 2011 and was a bit worried with what others said with the 60 day trial period i figured what do i have to lose i have to say it is very easy to use i spent about an hour navigating the different modules to get a feel for the layout and workflow quickbooks makes it easy to enter new customer bills and invoices I have used a lot of different erps and crms some better and some worse as a small business owner it has saved me a lot of time compared to the spreadsheet accounting i was using it is not perfect but it has increased my productivity and decrease my stress,121,110
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac up to and including version 2011 takes care of the most basic accounting / bookeeping needs but that is about it why does not it just have all of the features and functionality of qb pro for pc it is just that simple let me sort in the reconciliation window by column let me find anon the chart of accounts by typing in an account number sub account number or part of an account title or sub account title just the simple things would be a great start and some of these were available in qb for mac 2007 why are not they in this version also the multiuser version is horrendous very little real network-level configuration going on there it just really does not work well at all after purchase we installed then uninstalled and are back to copying files including spending significant time with intuit support and our mac and qb knowledgeable techs frankly at this rate why bother with a mac version at all and just let us mac folks have a pc in the corner to run qb it be just that much simpler on us all and not provide daily frustration with very simple functions beingthanks,199,111
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love many of the new features but you really need a package that is specific for the food industry restaurants cafes and bakeries especially also this program has tons of bugs ie error messages not printing taking forever to print sometimes and other times is quite efficient this version is much easier but still clumsy in many ways,59,112
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i had to buy the 2011 version of quickbooks for mac because the 2010 version does not work with osx lion i could no longer print or email any invoices with my 2010 version and after reading through several forums i discovered my only solution to be buying yet another almost 200 version of this rudimentary software this does not help my feelings towards a company that seems as slow as a dinosaur to make good products buy this only if you have to hopefully some company will come out with better business software for macs,95,113
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this product is very difficult to use compared to the pc version the most basic tasks like setting the ledger you want to open automatically when you click on the icon are frustrating and confusing the payroll situation is a flat out nightmare stay away,45,114
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have spent more than 60 hours on the phone w intuit trying to sort out all the problems w quickbooks for mac 2011 i hired a tutor to try to help me I have paid her hundreds of dollars and she has not been able to get it to work properly either supposedly the pc version is good but i do not have a pc and do not want one I have even been paying 20 a month to intuit for tech support from them they have not sorted out the problems and i wish I had never bought this horrible horrible software it is a nightmare do not purchase this now is there any good book-keeping program on the market suitable for a small business owner w a mac i can not find one the person or company that actually comes up with a good one is going to make a gazillion dollars,148,115
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quick books for mac is not user friendly when i transferred it over from windows i had to call the support line because it did not work like it said it should then the lady who i could barely understand because she did not speak english well told me that this call would be free but if i had to call anymore after for support i would have to pay for it or i could set up a monthly payment and call anytime i want not cool I have used quickbooks for windows for a few years and it was very user friendly quickbooks for mac almost made me bring my entire mac back to the apple store I am used to it now but still prefer quickbooks for windows I am even considering switching to another finance program,135,116
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you are used to quickbooks pc and are expecting the same experience on your mac do not bother I am sure you can find manny reasons if you do a bit of research online but quickbooks mac is a disaster no good job tracking no good invoicing it takes me 10 times the time it used to to make a progress invoice on this version in other words quickbooks mac is at a kindergarden level compared to the pc version intuit should look at all their false advertizing about the products capabilities and think twice before advertizing this version as comparable to the pc version horrible horrible horrible if there was a way to review thisand give it a negative star reading i would ps quickbooks premier user for 7 years,132,117
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i could wax in excruciating detail suffice it to say if you can not access your company file after loading a few bank registers and all you get from tech support is sales pitches for extended warranty forget it i am not sending a file to india or anywhere for what is obviously some glitch save your time and avoid frustration one star is too much how about a minus 3 stars for the time lost,74,118

Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i am just getting a business started and quickbooks will be able to help with all my reporting needs and accounts and for personal accounts will assist with budget formation and spending habits and allow me to identify tax information great product and good value,45,120
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i do not like this version compared to the pc version i used for years it is not easy to use lots of things that i could do with pc version they do not have for mac i do not like that you can not send letters from this version i do not like the way it creates invoices from my memorized list they are random and not in alphabetical order i do not like that you can not print out time sheets it is just not user friendly my mac is but not the quickbooks for mac,89,121
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit obviously does not want my business as a mac user they consistently produce inferior products for the mac their support is garbage and now in order to run osx lion you have to upgrade to qb 2011 just to make it more painful intuit has priced their upgrade 10 high than the cost of buying a full version of qb 2011 on amazon thanks for showing me you do not want my business intuit,73,122
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the multi-user quickbooks for mac is very slow it takes forever to bring up reports and sometimes locks up window version is much better but quickbooks will not support the windows version via parallels go figure also the payroll feature is a scam they just want you to spend big bucks with them make sure you find other alternatives for your payroll if you are a smaller company basically do not buy if you do not have too i wish i did not,80,123
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I have spent over 3000 in the past year purchasing quickbooks pro for my small one-person business this year and hiring a consultant to set it up it is clunky and clearly not optimized for the mac when i find that the print invoice feature does not work i spend hundreds getting my consultant to consider the question and then ultimately to advise me to use a work-around arrgh,68,124
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,useless no support for multiple currencies and character limits 9 digits means this software is of no use for indonesia waste of money,24,125
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have loved quickbooks on the pc i recently moved to a mac and expected similar sophistication and reliability plus payroll integration on the mac i do not recommend this change and in fact I am moving back to quickbooks on a virtual pc on the mac the mac version is crude compared to the pc version and the lack of payroll is unacceptable given the even cruder and inflexible online service required from intuit if you are going to do payroll I am stunned by the lack of parallel functionality with the pc product,92,126
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this version of quickbooks is not as complete and easy to use as the 2008 pro for windows sales taxes are much more difficult to pay and adjust the windows version has a button to adjust sales tax the mac version you have to create a journal entry when posting bills it is necessary to manually enter the job name on the posting screen even although you have a po with the job name on it i have been very disappointed in the mac version of this program,88,127
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,frustrating product lacking many important and basic features that quickbooks pc has frustrating tech support they are extremely useless,19,128
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,makes invoicing pos searching previous checks and invoices so easy it takes the hard work out of accounting and can easily be converted to and from a pc version great interface you do not have to even really understand accounting to use it yet the features it has makes it such a powerful accounting program if you want it to be enter your checks invoices and receipts and make up accounts on the fly fantastic reporting and searches that are customizable invoices are also customizable to the extent that you can even insert your company logo do your payroll here as well with a link to intuit payroll module it costs an extra 40 / month but the pc version this feature is build into the program for less than 200 you can have this fantastic accounting program working for you you would be crazy not to buy it,147,129
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is very difficult to operate and does not work like in the pc terrible i constantly lose my latest version that i just updated,27,130
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,did any of the geniuses at quickbooks not think to make qb for mac look and function the same as for windows could not have been that difficult to do that way the transition would have been seamless also have terrible trouble that hundreds of cleared transactions download despite already being cleared and none of my downloaded transactions ever match the ones in my ledger i spend hours longer doing work in qb for mac than i ever did in windows this is the only complaint i have ever had regarding anything mac,92,131
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is different from the windows version it has a few bugs that need to be worked out and i wish i had a pc at work so i could use the regular version of quickbooks,38,132
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,while the mac is far superior to any pc in existence qb for mac is fair at best many features we were used to before switching to mac are no longer there it seems like they just patched it to make it work we are looking at other software and will probably change within the next thirty days,58,133
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i am new to quickbooks for mac as i normally use the pc version the mac version is quite different but it still functions very well there are a few things that i would change on the mac version but it still works great,44,134
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,so unhappy with qb mac no one tells you how limited and not user friendly this product is wait a few years maybe they will get the kinks worked out,30,135
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have a new mac book pro and the program still runs very slow it freezes and is slow this version compares very unfavorably with the windows version i will probably not use this software next year i will not change my mac i will rather change my accounting software to something that will work well with macs,58,136
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,overall quickbooks for mac 2011 has done a good job helping me stay on top of my financial records for my small mental health practice i started out with the 2009 version which had better report customization this version makes it harder to modify memorized reports it is easier to start all over again rather than trying to make changes to an existing report my biggest complaint is neither version will automatically download bank transactions like you can in the pc version i use one of the major national banks and you would think quickbooks would have worked it out by now,102,137
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not like the way payroll is handled you can not do it on you own like on a pc,19,138
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,it is terrible it is my understanding that it can not handle a large database and i spend most of my time waiting for it to work,26,139
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,love this quickbooks very easy to use came from pc quickbooks which had more options for data but I am a die hard mac fan pros nice clean easy to use program excellent support cons unable to make an estimate into a purchase order you have to reenter on pc version you can make an estimate into a purchase order and an invoice seems like this would be an easy fix,70,140
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have a mac and had been using quicken home and business running virtually with parallels never liked theof having windows xp on my new mac hello that is why i switched to mac i was a little apprehensive on making the switch to quickbooks for mac after reading tons of reviews i would have to say the switch has been very easy and satisfying do not believe all the knocks from the pcers program is not perfect but has worked great so far for me i own a small residential cleaning and construction company and qb for mac meets all my current needs do not fear try it out for yourself and see and no i do not work for intuit godspeed from cincy,118,141
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit is not my favorite company pc versions go buggy and they keep selling newer versions when one only needed it to work andthis is accounting not rocket science why can not an older program keep running been hoping another company will take over until then i purchased a mac version it works but is clunky has not been fine tuned to run as smoothly as pc need to learn kb shortcuts as many commands are only menu driven interface with address book is a mystery to me as is starting estimates and invoices from some other number that 1 with the growing mac population i suspect intuit plans on selling betteer versions by forcing upgrade purchases,118,142
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,all i heard was negative stuff about qb for mac i have a small business and decided to try it anyway could not be happier it does everything i need and is very easy to learn,35,143
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,when entering items into statement charges it has never aged appropriately on the statements have contacted supported many occasions to no avail seems to have a lot of problems against the windows version i wish i had never switched to mac version,42,144
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,simplifies and monitors your accounting whether or not it is a family based business a small medium enterprise or a large corporation quickbooks is your answer,26,145
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is an under-developed brutal necessity of life a bug filled cesspool intuit has it figured out most accountants use qb so it is become a standard you have to use it or risk a nightmare during tax season with you accountant the mac version of the program is unstable unpredictable glitchy and inflexible it is as if the intuit management decided that the growing market share of osx users was a necessary evil that they wanted to promote in their marketing but spend as few resources as possible developing this program irritates me to death every day,98,146
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this version for my mac thinking that it would be easier to use than the pc version i was seriously wrong as the mac version is not intuitive has far less features than the pc version and in general was a poor choice on my part there is actually a steeper learning curve for the mac version against the pc but it works i will say that the online payroll services are great,75,147
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quicken and quickbooks for many years i have modified the format to match our construction company needs i do not use the icon format at all rather go directly to the pull down screens i am able to keep my accounts balance email invoices and provide our accountant with a file at tax time i am on a mac and was disappointed that i could not use the on line accounting i have a problem ever year importing my accountants changes it would be wonderful to have the accountant access my accounts online to prepare our returns as an established company it is not reasonable to re-enter all my data to be on line i need an import conversion thereby avoiding human entry errors it is a good product i had to take a class on use but once i did using qb is easy and reliable,151,148
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,having been a super user of quickbooks enterprise accountants version and quickbooks pro and recommended the product to many clients i was a bit concerned about switching my day to day computer use to a mac having been a pc all my computer life i was especially concerned about quickbooks the mac version works beautifully and only has a few differences from the pc version that are perfectly easy to deal with ie the bank reconciliation process does not allow for sorting the transactions otherwise excellent job intuit,88,149
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks for mac is working ok after i got through the initial conversion from pc i had an older version on my pc and quickbooks initially did not want to help with the conversion at all telling me to find someone with a new version on their pc to convert it first on the pc side to make it compatible for a mac conversion after a lot of threats phone calls and so on i got them to convert it for free i have used quickbooks since 1996 but do not know if i would go through all of the hassle again it works ok although i liked some of the features of my old pc version better and it is very slow opening and closing but overall been dependable heather gray,130,150
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it is ok but has shortcomings like you can not set up how you want to sort your payables on a permanent basis every time you log in you have to reset them to sort the way you want really annoying,36,151
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am extremely unhappy with all of the misinformation about quickbooks for mac i have bought computer quickbooks 2011 program and now and support only to find out quickbooks does not support payroll which is the most important reason why i changed to mac so my is waisted ihave been a quickbooks customer for years and am gravely unhappy and screwed,62,152

Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have got a mac you have got a small business you need quickbooks for mac you will hate it but it it is the only one that uses basic double entry bookkeeping instead of hiding it all from you if you have ever used it on windows you will hate it even more it obvious intuit considers mac to be a second-rate platform when i can find a real alternative i will get it it in a heartbeat I had write my own but i do not have the time,84,157
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb 2011 is better than previous versions but even 2011 is not as powerful as the 2009 pc version mac is way behind in their programming,26,158
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,the mac has saved me countless hours versus a pc transferring my data over from a pc and using quickbooks on the mac has been wonderful i also love being able to run credit cards with it there are still some small improvements and glitches to be addressed but overall very good sincerely rod,54,159
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks for mac the reports are very well designed and i like the fact that i can choose my favorite reports and memorize reports if you make a mistake it is not the end of the world you can easily change it,43,160
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,the very best accounting application for the mac i have been using it for years probably since version 10 it is the quintessential program for completing the accounting requirements for several different corporations partnerships businesses that are sole-proprieterships and even a large charitable trust non-profit organizations of moderate size should find it more that adequate it is great for bank reconciliation and cutting checks,64,161
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have been using some form of quicken quickbooks for years when i switched to mac i was disappointed that intuit did not offer a version of quicken home and business for mac only pc i had to buy both the pc version and the mac version of quickbooks first to upgrade my home and business data to quikbooks pc and then the pc files could be imported to quickbooks for mac this did not bother me but after running quickbooks on mac for three years i am totally frustrated the program does not operate with anything close to the ease and convenience of the pc version i have purchased every new upgrade and yet nothing has addressed the issues i have with the software it does not memorize entries you have to manually re enter data over and over if you use the deposit function it does not enter this automatically in the register intuit needs to get it together and improve this product,166,162
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not walk run away from this product as great user friendly the pc version of quickbooks is the mac version is diametrically opposed what a headache this is the 4th time i have lost all my work and have to start from scratch qb does not tell you that some of your information does not translate well when crossing over from pc to mac that is where all my headaches started i have nowhat I am going to do now other than go back to qb pc version because frankly i see no hope in redeeming the other,100,163
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,over the years intuit has really improved quickbooks for mac into a full-featured program that allows me to easily send my financial information to my accountant for review he uses windows and we easily transfer data back and forth works great,41,164
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,this software is pretty good and legit there is no way i would do my own payroll without software like this,21,165
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we purchased multi-user quick books for mac this past february we are still inputting so hopefully we can go live with this product in august 2011 we have noticed that the mac version is not at all like the pc version therefore we have had to go around and create more detail so we can use this program so at this moment it has not been very productive how about making quick books for mac like your pc version we do not understand why that can not happen thank you for allowing us the opportunity to review this product hopefully in 6 months we can give you an excellent review,108,166
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched from windows to mac for quickbooks i have had no problems with the transfer process mac version is different you just need to take the time to maneuver around and find how to do certain things such as reports the payroll system is great and affordable i really like it i can also do payroll from my iphone which is an greater plus when I am not in the office at my computer,74,167
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quickbooks 2011 for mac for about two years and it is a great tool for invoicing balance sheets and income statements i especially like the feature that allows you to download my bank statements into the program and reconcile easy to transfer this information to my accountant for tax filing purposes like the program a lot,59,168
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i previously used quickbooks for windows and switched to quickbooks for mac 2011 when i bought a mac the quickbooks for mac is clearly an inferior product than the windows version hopefully as more people buy macs intuit will improve the product,42,169
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been using qb for mac multi user since december 2010 and i think that it is a horrible program it will randomly disconnect it will randomly not save work that i have done i would much rather use qb for pc it is a much better program,49,170
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it does not allow you to change the numbers on the checks you want to print if you make a mistake you have to print on a blank sheet in order to get the proper check number this is just one of the many faults with the qb for mac i love my mac and do not want to have to get a pc just for quick books i would look for another software but unfortunately this is what my accountant uses so I am stuck with this lousy program,87,171
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the mac version is much less versatile than the quickbooks pro version for pc sometimes i feel like I have stepped back 10 years when i use the version on my mac,31,172
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used qb-windows for years i was not crazy about it but i used it i did not like the way you are essentially forced to upgrade every 3 years but it worked ok qb-mac is garbage nothing is easy getting to your home page is difficult reconciling your bank statement will take 3 times as much effort do not waste your money on qb-mac,63,173
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac does not have anything close to the functionality or features of quickbooks for the pc intuit for whatever reason has decided to abandon it is mac users for this product quickbooks for mac is full of bugs and does not do some of the basic things required by accounting software,52,174
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,when i am printing out statements the system crashes a lot i can not enter data as quickly as with my pc so i have to force myself to slow down a bit i have not figured out how to mobileme from my desktop to my laptop and no once at the apple store can help me because they do not know quickbooks other than the about issues i love my mac quickbooks,73,175
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for the mac crashes on a regular basis and must be restarted sometimes with a reboot of the computer payroll is not included so profitability reports are not available amounts in the reconciliation can not be sorted based on amount so it is almost impossible to reconcile once / month many other features available in qb for the pc are missing hope this is resolved in qb 2012,67,176
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have had sooo many issues with mac 2011 do not get it stay with 2010 they have too many issues they need to work on i have sent my file in twice to get repaired i still can not download transactions properly,42,177
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used quick books for pc with great results i made the switch over to mac computers which has been wonderful but the quick books for mac does not work well at all the biggest problem is that it does not interface with online banking and i can not pay bills from within the quick books for mac environment very disappointing overall it is a poor product which is surprising because the pc version is amazing,72,178
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,like all intuit products quickbooks for mac is easy to use and provides a surprisingly full suite of features i am using the payroll service and the merchant bank service in addition to the usual features all are easy to set up work well and are easy to use,49,179
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am used to using quicken for personal accounting so when i opened my business i chose quickbooks 2011 for mac for my accounting software once i got used to the differences between the two programs i have found it easy to use in general the one piece that i find hard to use is the pay bills section it seems that i often am entering the wrong date for the bill payment but that is a minor issue i wish the program had a better way to show payments i have already set up for future payment in my checking account,102,180
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit still has pretty much a monopoly in this space for small business this is aimprovement over the past mac version and now performs considerably better than even the pc version but still a strangely weak package for what you would expect search as always is horrible reporting is pretty much still a joke and they have left out even the few useful features from the pc side we see a very strange and worrisome problem with moving files from the mac to pc versions balance sheet stays the same but phantom bills show up in the vendor center you would think that almost all of this could be cloud based by now but their online offering just is not there yet updated review software is full of bugs,130,181
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i just purchased qb 2011 for mac however when i tried to open by prior mac qb2009 file it would not open i called technical support and they got farther to the password screen but the windows password did not work i had to purchase a service plan and send the file to them to rebuild i do not have it back yet to tell you if that worked if you read other reviews on this site you will see that i am not the only one with this problem i found it deplorable that the qb tech support person acknowledged it is a bug on there end but still makes me pay to rebuild the file and i was told there was no initial technical support so if you are buying this and do have problems be prepared to pay for tech support reputable software companies provide at least 30 days free support and do not charge to repair a known bug shame on you intuit,165,182
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks the versatility and availability thru quickbooks i have developed and train others to use a simple method to track and reconcile items commonly used in the qsr industry such as gift card sales frequent diner discount cards and most commonly used credit cards many if not most corporations do not offer set up and training to new franchisees at the onset quickbooks offers an easily understood readily accessible product to those franchisees who with a small amount of additional training can be off and running their own businesses,91,183
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,very confusing have use quickbooks pro for years on my pc and it worked great this is even difficult to open to bank account ask for password but tells you there is no password hate the program i will be changing,41,184
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick books is justly popular not only will it help you keep the books but it also captures quite a lot of data you will have the info you need for billing for determining the level of profitability of your jobs and for managing contractors as well as employees it is easy to install and easy enough to figure out but you will be more successful if you do not have a background in accounting if you pick up an instruction book the documentation that comes with the program is not nearly enough,88,185
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version is not compatible with the pc version if i do work on my mac and then save it in a windows format for my bookkeeper to use transactions are lost those who use macs should not buy this product,42,186
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,why is the upgrade with instant savings for previous quickbooks users more expensive that a new version you can buy anywhere online is this how intuit intends to reward loyal customers who have been using and paying for the software for the last 15 years give me a break do you think we are all idiots,56,187
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have to be an accountant to understand how to even set up this application there is not even a book written for the mac beside a useless ebook i never used the pc version that people say is better but this mac version needs to be more user friendly I am not an accountant that is why i bought this in the first place so far it has been a waste of money it is supposed to sync with my pos software and my bank online we could accomplish neither,87,188
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you have a bookkeeper who has any of the latest pc versions of quickbooks you will still lose bank reconciliations memorized transactions reportsjust to name a few when you import back and forth between the pc and mac version intuit has been working hard on this issue for more than 4 years but people are still losing a ton of data most times they work with a pc-based bookkeeper for those that want to purchase quickbooks 2011 they are currently having a sale it is 18395 however if you already own a copy of quickbooks they support their past customers with an upgrade discount the price is just 18395,112,189
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i used quickbooks to do the accounting for my wifes business and it always worked like a champ mind you this was many versions ago and it functioned perfectly even then now with the upgrades and enhancements it is even easier to use spend the time toyour data completely and properly and the dividends are immediate highly recommended,59,190
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks just keeps getting better and better i have been a user of intuits initial product quicken and grown along with intuit to my current version of quickbooks for mac 2010 their software development team through quickbooks for mac 2010 has taken the drudgery out of the day-to-day bookkeeping chores and transformed it into a quick and seamless part of the business it is very intuitive everything you have always wanted to know about real estate but were afraid to ask real estate for the rest of us,86,191
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been a quickbooks user for years on the pc but love my mac and it is dependability intuit has finally gotten the mac version on par with the windows version and i use it daily best part is that this is not just a port of the windows version it is a completely mac product and utilizes the osx interface simply wonderful,62,192
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks mac makes running your daily business so easy you can focus on what really matters your own customers,20,193
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a new quickbooks for mac 2011 user who is unfamiliar with business accounting software i find littlesquares online videos helpful and shelly king and the staff there remarkably gracious and thoughtful in response to my questions and needs once I have worked longer with quickbooks i know I shall have more questions and am confident of a helpful rapid response from the team at intuits littlesquare,65,194
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,using quickbooks on my mac adds all the advantages of the best operating system with the number small business accounting program,21,195
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there has no import feature maybe if you had the mac version still running you could do an export if you are lucky but you cannotthe data why do they even call these things versions of the same software,39,196
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is a great application the downside is that you must purchase updates with little or no added value every 2 - 3 years to stay in a position of product support this upgrade should have been valued at about 2995 for current quickbooks users,43,197
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been very disappointed with this product at first i could not even transfer my pc files over to it my husband did an internet search for help and finally ended up calling the company for help they walked him through a very lengthy tedious process of transferring the files i had four companies files that i wanted to two of the transfers worked two did not then when i looked at one of the companies whose transfers worked i found that none of my memorized reports had been saved it looks like i will only be able to use quickbooks on the old pc that i saved if i want to access the information because it certainly is not available to me on the mac,126,198
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,after getting a new mac i was forced to upgrade from quickbooks 2007 to quickbooks 2011 and found that there has no improvement at all i had no choice about the upgrade since the program stopped working due to compatibility issues i am very unhappy with quickbooks and it is product for mac users if you have access to a pc get the pc version,63,199
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,because i am at work i can not get into all the details as i am trying to figure out why my memorized transactions are not automatically entering i worked with the pc version for years and it was very user friendly i was excited to switch to a mac and have had no problems adjusting to mac software for other products such as microsoft office too many quirks in the mac version would not recommend a couple of other examples as why you should not switch to mac version-printed reconciliations do not fit on one page had an it guy from a large corporation we are an agency of and he could not fix no answers from intuit have to relearn several processes was eventually able to figure out some items by posting in intuit community the help in quickbooks is practically useless,142,200
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,two things i will not use it after importing from other software you lose information secondly it is so hard to customize a form for something in that price range you would hope they put more effort into it it looks like the people at quickbooks do not have any mac experts on their payroll they need to see the light mac is transforming the new computing era get used to it quick,69,201
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased mac 2011 with high hopes from pc version it is completely different and missing reports and audit features also you must type in amounts for vendor on invoices items with 2 or more lines disappear on screen but print ok you can not use qb invoice mailing service on mac why bank reconcile is much harder,58,202
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i would not buy into this product i am being forced to buy the new version which i do not want as the old version which was working fine suddenly requires a new registration that does not work in snow leopard the upgrade is 199 when i can buy the full copy for 180 they have got you by the at and they know it,62,203
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 is the worst ever less than 2 hours after installing it it has corrupted the file and support is terrible once i contacted quicken as instructed by the program they told me that can fix the problem they apparently knew about it but they charge between 250 and 750 to do so or you can purchase the support option for 20 month this is black mail pure and simple intuit really dropped the ball on the mac do not bother,81,204
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit claims a 60 day no questions asked refund but no matter what i have tried i can not get my money back now I shall have to go through my credit card company i will never ever by any intuit product again for the rest of my life,48,205
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,after starting a small business with our daughter last year i became the one responsible for the books and i used qb for the first time after some suggestions from our tax accountant i found it to be an extremely useful program as my daughter has a mac i bought a new mac and have switched to the new qb so i can teach her to do her own books and i candown,75,206
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i had used quicken for years but after upgrading my mac quicken data did not successfully make the change was more or less forced to try quickbooks 2011 for mac i am very pleased so far unlike my previous encounters with pc-type applications quickbooks is significantly easier to learn i am not a professional bookkeeper so my use of all the features will probably be limited the features i have used so far have been interesting and surprisingly fun so far so good,83,207
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i purchased the 2011 quickbooks for mac so i can finally get my finances organized there is a bit of learning involved however i feel good about taking control and making paying bills working my budget and filing my taxes easier,41,208
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this for my solo law practice and I am very disappointed i am fairly proficient on the computer but this program is not intuitive despite the brand name and too difficult even for me there has not enough flexibility to make simple accounting records the help menu does not work half the time and when it does it just sends you to random online articles i would be better off just using excel,72,209
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,since upgrading to this qb version my start up time is triple what it was and my computer seems to be much more quirky do not buy it,27,210
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i keep hoping that updates will fix old problems with quickbooks software for the macintosh and they do not i overpaid even at amazon for a really poor product that has a stranglehold on the accounting industry i feel forced to pay for and use this buggy software,47,211
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not purchase this product if you plan to manually enter in your payroll it does not have the capabilities you must purchase intuits online payroll service to use payroll this is not optional read the fine print,37,212
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 multi user mac should not be on the market user sessions connected the server fail to log out properly and no new data can be saved to the company files i paid extra for data services and have sent my files in repeatedly and the returned files preform no better i have been hung up on by tier 2 support and data services tells me it is not their problem customer support will not offer a refund or credit towards converting back to windows not what i wanted to do i signed up to be a beta tested and got no reply i paid for the software and get no support be warned,113,213
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,I have been a quicken user for more than 10 years so i had few problems setting up a non-profit organizations books with this product thumbs up,26,214
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 for mac disc did not work on my machine i had to contact quickbooks to download the web version the disc looked used and scratced it was supposed to be new,33,215
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i had talked to quckbooks about their software for mac and was assured that it was just like the pc version i then found out that it does not have payroll you have to do that online and pay a lot for that service was also very unhappy with amazon because i was told that i could not have a refund so I am stuck with software that i can not use another thing that i was not happy with on intuit was that they use india or some over seas vendor for support i spent over 8 hours on the phone with them just trying to get my files moved from pc to mac and they still could not do it,120,216
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,am returning after all the bad comments on mac quickbooks 2011 stability and support problems along with forced upgrades and planned obsolesence perception that intuit is not committed to mac version of quickbooks and reading too many negative reviews to have a good comfort level with the product,48,217
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,watch out do not let the name deceive you although quickbooks is a wonderful package on the pc this mac version is awful especially considering the price if it were selling for 75 less i would still slam it but at the price offered here and everywhere it is an embarrassment the worst part for me was the difficulty in money account transfers what has the deal here i had software from the 1990s that could do this efficiently the pc version does not have any problem with it,85,218
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i need a replacement for my microsoft money for our family finances but this program is a serious bookkeeping program much too detailed for us so i returned it,29,219
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter and she got it thought it was great only to find out her bank did not support it make sure you contact your bank before you purchase this software we had to reluctantly return it amazons return policy is only 50 on software that has been opened but they honored the quickbooks full refund after i contacted them or at least they said they would-i am waiting to see,75,220
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,with my quicken i was able to keep track of personal and business expenses unfortunately with quickbooks it will only handle the business expenses quicken was very helpful with reminders about bills coming up and it would give me a warning that i could set of 3 to 5 days ahead of time with quickbooks we can only record the business expenses and track them in order to enter a bill i need to go to the vendors and put in the names and mailing addresses and is set up to print checks and more right now I am not sure if i want to go that way the the conversion from the pc quicken 2 the mac quickbooks was not that smooth most of the all of the vendors and payees that i had never came over as vendors they came over as other for now I shall need to be working both systems so i can close out 2010 taxes and hopefully by 2011 will have an alternative to handle the personal to track the utilities and more and when bills are popping up maybe somewhere in i-work,186,221
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am a mac user and I have been using quickbooks for many years and still do unfortunately every time i use quickbooks i have to switch over to pc in bootcamp in canada only the pc version exists there is no mac version even after many years of requests to intuit there is a us mac version why not a canadian one intuit how difficult can it be to add small things like gst pst and hst to the tax lines as a programmer i know it does not take much to do this once i find an alternative that works on the mac that includes payroll we will switch,107,222
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,having been fortunate to be a beta tester for intuit for the last several years i get to see the raw software before it get released on the street intuit does a great job of incorporating any suggestions that the beta testers provide i have been using quickbooks for 10 plus years to manage my commercial properties having used a pc for 8 - 1/2 years before buying a macbook i was reluctant to migrate my qb file over to a mac version of quickbooks for fear of losing data in the transition i had been using vmware to run quickbooks 2010 in a windows environment on macbook until i installed the release version of quockbooks 2011 for the mac the transition worked perfectly and i have had no problems since intuit did a great job with quickbooks 2011 for the mac to capatilize on the unique features of the mac os,150,223
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,all i want is a webconnector for mac to allow 3rd party integration with qb i was told it would be available soon two years ago surprise on the inuit web site they still say it will be available soon in the forums if you are going to release a product for the mac you need to make it at least as strong or close as the pc verison the ui in the demo is better but still lacking however i still think the programmers are approaching the product from a pc and/or engineer point of view the user experience and the lack of full features make this upgrade hardly worthwhile recommendation wait intuit should not be rewarded for this upgrade,119,224
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,tried to convert from qb pro for windows 2009 to qb for mac 2011 failed even with qb tech supports help followed all the steps the mac version would not accept the same password as the pc version after 30 mins on the phone to tech support in india they told me the only way to migrate would be to remove the password and that i could not do that because i was using cc processing so they would need to conference in the cc processing guys to help me remove my password in the transfer my line got dropped went dead do you ever get the feeling that can i transfer you oh sorry the call got dropped is a standard way for some tech support operations to get customers they can not help off the line the tech support person had taken my number but no-one tried to call me back bottom line i am faced with the choice of keeping a 10 year old pc just to run qb getting a new one just to run it or most likely finding a different product that can do my not complex book-keeping on the mac seems that intuits neglect of mac users is real,204,225
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased this product from jon saul do not purchase from him this product does not come with a registration code and has limited uses of 15 times the product is perfect for what my intended use was however i can not use it because it was not complete with registration code,51,226
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i think it worked better than the 2014 version,9,227
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is the standard right so i followed the crowd and upgraded every couple of years despite the they want how much expense the only problem is that the every version is worse it is more confusing does less that is obvious and easy for someone whose skills are not in accounting and the mac version never did want to sync with my bank or credit cards the end result is that i used it as little as possible and thus my small business accounting data was perpetually out of date when i started my new solo company i signed up with freshbooks instead it updates things immediately it stays as simple as i need and the data is up-to-date without a lot of effort see ya quickbooks i will not miss you,130,228
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick and easy software to help small business owners keep track of their expenses while you do not need to have formal accounting training in order to use this program it probably would not hurt to have access to a real accountant if you are completely without experience we thought we were doing a good job our first year until it was tax time and our cpa made us aware of possible problems / issues that needed to be resolved by no means a result of the software having been faulty just improper use / understanding of it is use on our end it took a good couple of weekends for us to get everything straightened out and we did end up hiring an accountant for a few hours just to help give us some guidance and direction moving forward still use quickbooks to date and satisfied with it,141,229
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,poor interface with pc products such that when our office changed over to a pc-system we lost all our accounting,20,230
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,easy to use clean and professional looking invoices i would not be able to run my business without it i recommend this to any small business owner,27,231
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i really like it i have not learned to use everything yet right now I am using it mostly as a ledger this year i promise myself to learn to use all the payroll aspects,33,232

Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i bought this program a couple of months ago and just installed it when i registered the program i was informed that it is no longer supported and that i can get the update by paying for a new program at a discount i bought the program because the description implies that it contains all the common forms needed for the average person first thing i tried to do was a general power of attorney it is not in the program this seems to be the modern standard of conduct for so many businesses today devious and deceptive i wasted my money on this program be sure you read all the descriptions before you buy and find that you have been sucker-punched,124,12
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i have not had the opportunity to examine all of the software in this package deal from quicken i bought this primarily interested in the living trust maker that comes bundled in this package after successfully installing the willmaker premium 2012 software onto my vista machine i put the living trust maker disk in my pc but i did not get the welcome screen that should appear automatically therefore i followed the instructions that were given on the disk and on the nolo quicken web site when you run into this issue apparently i am not the first i wento to start accessories run and entered d autorun but nothing happened i also tried e autorun and f autorun to no avail i went to the nolo quicken support site for further assistance but found none i am just a bit frustrated i guess i will have to see if there is a quicken technical phone number that i can call for further assistance i will come back and revise this review should i have success installing the disk and after i have had the opportunity to use the software,185,13
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i actually purchased the 2012 version of this product from costco and it is a junk i used to have a 2004 version that did a joint living trust for me and thinking it is time for me to update the software after i install the software i found out it only supports a basic living trust for single people not married couple when it detects my old living trust file it told me to go back to 2004 version for any change on living trust can you believe this what kind of company do this i was hoping this new version will give me more feature than my 2004 version but it actually supports less than the old one i am very upset i stick with this software instead of purchasing another cheaper software like willcreator deluxe that let us you create joint living trust i will not buy another single software from this company ever do not waste your money if you are married,166,14
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,i bought this so i could update our wills living wills and power of attorneys so far it looks like it leads you to sites where you can purchase these documents maybe I am just doing this wrong but i still have no new will,45,15

Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,save yourself some money and use this older version of willmaker the laws simply do not change significantly enough to make any difference your will will certainly be valid using this ignore the no longer supported messages from quicken the key thing is legal validity and for that this product works fine,52,22

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the worst product i have ever bought from amazon i do not recommend it to anybody if you have 30 to waste then you will have more fun burning it than spending on instant immersion software the software looks like it was designed 15 years ago and the jerks at instant immersion have not updated it in 15 years do not buy this crap i tried to install it on my mac and the stupid thing does not install like most other softwares the instructions are pathetic i wish the bozos at amazon would not sell this product i hate it and has setback my learning by several months,109,2
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,old software runs very slowly on my new computer although all the specs say it is compatible also it is too repetitive and the graphics are outdated and really pathetic otherwise it is a nice program for beginners i got bored but if you are new to spanish or want to teach your young children it is a great tool,60,3
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the program is supposed to work with vista but does not after many failed attempts to install making sure sound drivers and computer were updated properly working with topics to come up with a solution and resorting to hiring a professional to attempt to install it the program never installed properly excellent visuals but no sound once you pass the opening screen and enter the talk more section also the interactive dvd which i used on my television froze 10 minutes in topics offers a refund but declares it takes 90 days to do so i do not recommend,99,4

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is probably the worst spanish course i have encountered i have tried five so far and the very best is pimsleur the speaker here gives the impression she is speaking to a five-year-old then there are two discs of just rules with little explanation this company should review the way pimsleur does their their teaching and starting you out with actually talking to another person i was so disappointed in this course glad i got it free at the library instead of buying it i always try to check things out first before buying and am grateful for the internet as i can get other reviews,107,6
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i finally got around to trying this product and it is subpar could not understand the man dictating the words which means quality of the dvds is bad i then went to return to sender and i have passed the window of opportunity darn it wasted money,48,7

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is so frustrating i have a macbook air and so i am spoiled and am not used to having programs crash i have not gotten past the third screen to see if the learning program is good or not seriously so aggravating,43,38
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a great way to get started with a new language i use the cd at i go to and from work that keeps the words fresh in my mind the repetition of going through the cd multiple times also helps in retaining conjugation info which is the most difficult for me to retain the lessons on the dvd are very good and allow you to go at your own pace and repeat as needed,76,39

Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,this application requires that my machine have a cd rom dvd drive i have a usb cd rom drive but the application does not install on my laptop it runs directly from the cd rom can you say 1995 i have nohow good an application this is yet but i do know that if a cd rom is required every time i run it that i will not use it so in case publishers have not heard most mainstream laptops do not have built in cd rom drives anymore requiring a drive to install is understandable requiring a drive to run the app is not ok and has not been for several years now,117,45

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this product has been really helpful couple of notes 1 it is spain spanish so be careful with pronunciation and 2 the layout reminds me of old 90s cd-roms it works and it really helps it not flashy and I am okay with that,42,52
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this is awesome if you do not have that much time for studying like all learning cds it takes the commitment of the buyer and i do not have that if you are bent on learning although this is perfect and it does not burn your pockets like other learning materials do,49,53
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,great couple of games to help learning but cumbersome toon a mobile device would recommend more games to aid in learning,23,54
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,as with every other discipline there has no magic pill that being said there is so much to choose from in this package that if you are willing to put the time and effort in it is a great program,38,55

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i had read numerous reviews on this program before i bought it i have had some formal training in the spanish language for work i bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while i am driving to work i have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds i have not utilized the dvds nor the second half however i wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again or this package is great for a person that already has an understanding of the spanish language i think you get a lot of verb conjugation and word usage for the money out of this package and very easy to understand good luck,138,79

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i would put this product up there with rosetta stone and for the price might be even better wish there were more detailed directions on how mto get the most out of the program which is also my complaint with rosetta stone as with both you have to use them consistently for best results,54,83
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,if you are just looking for a tv type game go for it otherwise a waste of money very disappointed get rosetta stone or sign up at the community college,29,84
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,cartoonish and not in a good way i can not imagine learning spanish with this this is a waste of money,20,85
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i was sceptical at first but this package definitely helped me improve my spanish still a long way to go but i feel like i got quite far without struggling the box looked a bit cheesy but I am glad i gave it a try had a little trouble working it out at first but worth sticking with,57,86
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,designed to look like rosetta stone but when you receive it clearly it is not the print in the description is so small that is its difficult to discern this fact i suspect this was purposely done to dupe the unwitting amazon will accept it is return but only after i paid the shipping back do not be fooled,56,87
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,there are separate program levels hours of audio content printable picture dictionaries interactive dvd that plays on tb using remote control average retail price 49 there are 4 dvds spanish levels 1 2 and 3 spanish audio deluxe mp3 spanish interactive dvd a spanish cd-rom game level 1 teaches the essential level 2 teaches more complex phases level 3 teaches you more complex phases to learn the language installation instructions are easy you can program you ipad to teach you,80,88

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,instant immersion presents the spanish language in an easy-to-learn manner the games reinforce the lessons students must achieve a certain number of points before going on to the next level my 10-year-old granddaughter loves it and has caught on quickly she did think it was funny that two of the words taught on level 1 are wine and beer but overall i feel teaches a wide variety of common words and phrases I have never tried rosetta stone but instant immersion is way less expensive the set of levels 1 - 3 cost me 30,92,91
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,instant immersion powered by eurotalk spanish levels 1 2 and 3 did not work very well on my mac desktop the discs were freezing and many files refused to open i used this on my main desktop an imac 24 ghz intel core 2 duo os x version 1082 i would not recommend this software if you are planning to use it on a mac i did not bother to try it on a pc pcs frustrate me enough so i am certain that software can not teach me a language on one,90,92

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this was a really good buy you can not go wrong for what it costs you will not feel like you have wasted your money if you are not a real devoted learner we just wanted something we could use when we have the time and ambition even if we only pick up a few common words and phrases it is still worth it if you are more motivated this will keep you going adios,70,95
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,decent exercises but the vocab is random that is my only gripe because it should follow more set categories like textbooks if you are just looking for a supplementary lesson then this is great and definitely worth the 380 or so you save from rosetta stone,44,96
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,the program is well presented it covers the language subject very well it is easy to use and east to understand,21,97
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this was the first product i bought to learn spanish i did no research and saw the cheap price and went for it i tried it and it has very limited material zero grammer rules just phrases and translation that you memorize maybe ok to learn a few phrases but you can find more just online or youtube if anybody is serious about learning spanish identification buy learning spanish like crazy or fsi and professor jason on youtube and if just a couple phrases is what your looking for any youtube spanish channel or phrase book is better also this is spain spanish an I have been focusing on south american spanish,111,98
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i think this was a great product to use whether you are a child or an adult you need to put your all into this program and you will walk away with your goal achieved,35,99

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the program might be ok but my imac and it did not agree took forever to prepare for operation and then quit suddenly and repeatedly really could not use it,29,103
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i was surprised at the number of interactive dvd s in this set for the price this is a very good buy,22,104
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,a real waste if money there should be some type of manuel to help you with the program i tried to place this in itunes and it would not work this should be very intuitive to use and it is not i hope rosette stone is better,45,105
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this made a great addition to the classes my sister was taking and she was able to ace her test my sons are now listening to this daily i recommend this to everyone I am up next to improve my spanish,40,106

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i just got it and whenever i start the first dvd 1 the programe quite by itself i am really disappointed and i do not recommend it to any one i think i will get rosseta stone,37,108
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,really not very good product nice chart showing how it compares and says even more benefits than rosetta stone but wow this is a very slow non-intriguing software reminds of software from early days of computers worse it seems about two steps ahead of the old cassette learning systems yellow packaging is nice i give credit to their marketing team i hope rosetta is not like this,67,109
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the gift recipient lady likes it very much and is busy at it especially it also seems toto the continental spanish-castillian version,24,110
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i could not wait to recieve this i bypassed my ipod and uploaded it to my amazon cloud this way i can access it anywhere we travel to a spanish speaking country usually every year and I have found this very useful as other reviewers have said it does require that you listen and do the work i do not have any experience with rosetta stone so i can not compare it to that but i can not find any fault with instant immersion spanish,82,111

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have no clue havnet tried it yet bought it for husband for christmas so he can try somthing different while otr trucking,22,116
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,depending on your needs you can begin learning words or phrases immediately the tapes are broken into several categories to help get you started immediately they also incorporate a listening component so that you will learn to say the words accurately,41,117
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,pretty good tutorial but better if you have had some exposure to the language before the games are silly but engaging,20,118
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i my opinion this program is worthless compared to rossetta stone it is a joke the first lessons gave me no help at all,24,119
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,my director of sales is trying to learn to speak spanish and this is an amazing starter tool for her the shipper was fast and the product was great thank you debbie karrer,33,120
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,too much work for me t review the lessons i am not sure how to get into the program i am not that computer savvy,25,121
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this is an unbelievable tool for learning spanish it is easy and fun and way cheaper than rosetta stone i highly recommend it,22,122
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was under the impression this would be similar to the rosetta stone series just at a much more affodable price i was wrong I have only gotten half way through the first disc and it is ok,37,123
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i got this for my son who wanted software for learning spanish i speak spanish fluently as well as english this software is crapware if you want something to help you learn spanish look elsewhere my son after checking it out has never used it further and i do not blame him,51,124
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am learning spanish with this program the choices and different media are very helpful i would recomend using this program,21,125
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it has been said that if you know only one language you do not know that language this wonderful set of learning discs presents a great learning opportunity in an enjoyable format for learning at your own pace in your home if you want learn another language easily this is a great opportunity,52,126
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i was pleasantly impressed with this software i found it to be quite intuitive and easy to follow my kids and i have been able to use this to brush up on our spanish i have not ever tried rosetta stone so i can not speak to the comparison however if you are planning on being able to speak spanish with anyone on a trip with a penpalthis would be a good way to prepare,74,127
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,should be false advertising to compare this to the rosetta stone spanish this has poor audio and the graphics and games are not any better very disappointed,27,128
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have not got to use it yet but is as i expected it to be i have not used it so i can not comment further,24,129
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i purchased this to start learning conversational spanish it is no where near the depth that i was hoping for or that would prove useful in fact most of what i reviewed here i learned in high school spanish 101 it was a good review although w / basics liketravel-related words and more if you need a brief overview of the very very basic words needed to converse then this could work if you are really looking to learn the language then skip it,83,130
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am not a native speaker of spanish so i ordered this and I have played with it once i was able to figure it out i found it to be very simple and easy to use it covers a lot of words and grammar and it offers a way of learning a lot of the basics that for me is very easy it is simple to just click it on play with the software for 20 a day i need a lot more review than many folks so repetition has been necessary for me i like it there are other spanish language packages i do not know how this compares to the others I had give it a b and recommend it to others,122,131
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this was a gift to my grandson he worked with spanish speaking people and wanted to learn conversational spanish i can not evaluate this product,24,132
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am so glad i chose this program to learn spanish i had purchased other programs and had only learned a few words from them the instant immersion spanish proved to be the one that has taught me spanish i feel confident i can carry on some conversations and not feel lost when someone asks me a question in spanish,60,133
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product feels like it was designed for a different era a time when people used to purchase encyclopedias on cd-rom i found the entire program cumbersome and annoying to use in terms of content i feel that there are free alternatives out there that will give you the same benefit this product is not an introduction to the language it is a tool for learning how to ask for the bathroom and how to order a beer you would be better off with a small book or an ios application that performs the same function,96,134
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,hi i did enjoy the cd s but shipping was as much as the product and some of the cd s are not workingthe speaking is wrong at times like no como carne is not how you say i don t eat meatnow is this mexican spanish or spain spanish i don t know what is wrong and what is right i just keep practising i do wish to purchase 4 and 5 but they are so expensive i don t think i will i all i do think your product is good and well packaged thank youmike,90,135
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it seems increasingly important for many individuals to become more familiar with the spanish language after all everyone from the border of mexico down to the tip of south america speaks it there are more spanish speakers in the western hemisphere than english speakers so what is the best way to learn spanish by instant immersion you will learn quickly with the incredible amount of content in this program this is a wonderful course with many different learning methods for you to benefit from if one method does not work try another people learn in different ways so having options in a learning program is very helpful there is always the 6 month guarantee if you do not like the program return it for a refund how can you lose,129,136
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,is this a joke how do i learn from this you are throwing 20 words at me and expect me to learn the no 1 thing in learning a new language is repetition yes that means i should look over the flash cards on my own but i can do that on my own without the software i want the software to help me with this and make it enjoyable how can anyone compare this to rosetta stone you get what you pay for,83,137
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i can not say how bad i found this to be it would not even downfrom the internet the only thing i learned was not to buy anything else from instant immersion,36,138
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,a good low cost alternative to rosetta i downloaded the mp3 audio portion to my smartphone and listen to it back and forth to work i found it helped me more than the computer program in the program both the male and female shake their heads and their lips say yes when you get a right answer but the audio says si would have been so hard to record them actually saying si,73,139
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good learn spanish program it includes a software with six different learning programs on it an mp3 cd i ripped onto my computer then put on my mp3 player a dvd it is more like the second lesson set on the software cd and a game to test you overall it is not bad for a software under 30 if you take full advantage of all the discs i believe you should be very pleased my only complaint would be the case the cds are all stacked upon one another in a plastic case they are also very difficult to get out or at least on my set do not know if everyone is the same so i just grabbed a bunch of empty cd cases i had lying around and put them in there other than the case i do not really have any complaints about this program,148,140
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this software is a joke not only is all the content available on itunes or online for free but the interface and quality is near non-existent i could not run 90 of the program due to getting an error message that my screen resolution was not high enough despite that fact that the resolution on my hd monitor was far in excess of the requirements in addition the mp3 download would notto my iphone an iphone mind you that has zero problems with any other file or software the flashcards worked that is it they were pitiful to say the least terrible art with strange inclusions and omissions i am fairly confident that nobody needs to learn the word for hippopotamus before say book or television or door or house and more not worth 5 let alone 30 if i could give it zero stars i would,140,141
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is quite possibly the worst language program i have ever attempted to use if i could give it zero stars i would i constantly receive error messages despite the fact that i downloaded a patch so it works with my operating system it quits frequently the design is poor it is not worth even 28 no matter how much more expensive rosetta stone is no one should ever dream of substituting this crappy program for that anything is better than this,82,142
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,wow ok i admit that my comparison of online / digital language courses is being compared to rosetta stone but as an educator in general this program is awful they teach you words at random not in word sets verbs are non existent in the beginning phases and the voices and illustrations not photos are boring very elementary in drawing style for 30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you not to learn a language if you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural tested setting online / digitally i would strongly recommend the rosetta stone series i learned more in an hour trial version of rosetta stone than in an excruciating hour of this one this product is very much not recommended for beginners or for anyone who wants to learn spanish or any other language,141,143
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i listen to the lessons in my car wonderful instruction i wish they had a intermediate version worth every penny,20,144
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,designed primarily for beginners despite the claims for intermediate and advanced the talk-back feature does not give you enough time to say what is required and there is no way to adjust this some of the vocabulary is bizzare who needs to know the spanish for zoo animals some of the quiz questions focus on spelling which seems fairly irrelevant to most visitors some quality issues with the cds themselves plus this is european spanish not latin american so lots of lisping involved,83,145
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have been wanting to learn spanish but not sure you should she shall out for rosetta stone this product makes a nice alternative it is not a comprehensive guide to learning the language there has no attempts really to teach grammar or to build a fluency in the language it does however teach a great deal of conversational spanish that you could put to use in real-life situations one thing to note this product teaches spanish with a catalan accent the kind of spanish spoken in spain it is slightly different from the mexican spanish you might be more familiar with,99,146
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,being perceptually impaired learning anything new for me is always a challenge being in the lower income bracket limits my choices of available products to learn from instant immersion accommodates for both without leaving me feeling like i spent too much or overwhelmedinstant immersion spanish levels 1 2 and 3,53,147
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the speaking portion of rosetta stone is overall very good sometimes the feedback to the speaker is frustrating in that it is very picky and arbitrary however i would never use rosetta stone again unless the parent / teacher speaks and writes spanish fluently the student has no chance to learn how to correctly write or speak spanish rosetta stone does not teach grammar they hope the student will learn it through immersion immersion only teaching may work pretty good in very young children but has it is limitations as we age at the very least it would be helpful if they would provide the keys to the worksheets and tests with the answers translated in english,114,148
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i did not find this product easy to use and not very happy with it wishing i had ordered rosetta stone instead you get what you pay for in this case unhappy customer,31,149
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i had a few years of spanish as a teen and speak italian so i got this as a review before going to guatemala for an acupuncture clinical visit it did help me remember spanish but you should know that it focuses on castillan spanish rather than south and central american spanish i am not particularly game oriented but games are used as drills the recording of your own voice really helps in comparing accents at least provided it has the accent that you are going for paired with outreach spanish with audio compact discs the program helped me prepare and at less cost than with the rosetta stone,111,150
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i used to recommend instant immersion to everyone but not any more I have used instant immersion deluxe 20 in the past and it was great much better than rosetta stone at a fraction of the price but this is a completely different product apparently they have bought out eurotalk slapped the instant immersion label on it and discontinued what had been very good language-learning software this is just audio flash cards no grammar no evaluation of your pronunciation although it does let you record yourself and listen to yourself for people who for some reason can not hear their own voices but can hear a speaker on top of that it does not work on windows 7 even although the box says it does i contacted the company and they suggested running in xp compatibility mode furthermore i had contacted the publisher before i bought this product and was assured it was latin american spanish it is not it is cathhhtilian and now the publisher is telling me it is not even available in latin american version which means they lied to me the last time,182,151
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i bought a few different languages from instant immersion much better than the other compnay great visual love the games and the lessons are easy to follow got to have it if enjoy learning a new language you need this for your next adventure in the world,46,152
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this has helped a struggling spanish student tremendously 40 minutes in class a couple of times a week and studying the textbook just was not enough instant immersion was the answer we are very thankful for this software using it for one quarter raised the student 3 grades thank you,49,153
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,was going to purchase rosetta stone so glad i did not spend the money the instant immersion was the way to go after i read the reviews i decided to purchase this program is amazing i have learned more spanish in a week than i ever thought i would do not just think about getting this program just do it this is a fun easy way to learn spanish so glad i found it,73,154
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product does not work on mac osx lion even visited and downloaded patch from support site just does not work sent product back within 20 mins of receiving it,30,155
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,even after downloading a patch available on eurotalkcom the cd will not play correctly on my imac when starting the first exercise i keep receiving an error message super talk error number 13 long integer expected but found something else,40,156
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i ordered instant immersion spanish because it had levels i ii and iii and the promotion compared the product to rosetta stone at a much lower price i thought i could advance quickly to the levels ii and iii with my current knowledge of spanish with this product but it was not for me it does not come anywhere close to rosetta stone which i have seen but have not purchased first it is very basic start to finish and not well done as a language instruction package second the quality of the presentation and organization is very poor and cryptic that is put together cheaply it seems like the videos lessons are out of the 1990s third it does not run smoothly on windows 7 for some reason a little jumpy in the videos yes it is cheap but you get what you pay for in this product and i would not recommend it if you know any spanish at all do not waste your money consider other options which is what i am doing now at an intermediate level,176,157
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my son used this as additional practice while he was taking required language courses over two semesters in college so it was not his only instruction more just a supplement the benefit was worth the investment of time and money he got as in both classes,46,158
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have wanted to learn a foreign this is a great way to start yes true it is not rosetta stone but not everyone can afford it this is a very affordable way to start learning the spanish language try it out it is affordable easy to use and very basic which to me is the way to start learning a new language basic is best you can always move onto a more expensive and extensive program like rosetta stone if you find you enjoy learning spanish and want to continue and become fluent,94,159
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i grew up during a time where french was the primary language taught in schools unfortunately for me spanish is the second language that is needed most in my area of work i once looked up rosetta stone cds but they were soo expensive i nearly cried and promptly forgot about learning espanol i jumped at the chance to learn from these cds and so far so good i love the way the lessons are set up and i love that i can download lessons to listen to on my ipod this is a great way for me to learn spanish while traveling working out or just walking i am loving this language learning program and for the price it can not be beat if you want to learn spanish i would highly recommend instant immersion,135,160
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the interface for this piece of software is really poor the graphics are poor and look like they have not been updated since the 80s the audio is mediocre at best and there is no methodology or pedagogy behind this product if you can learn a language from having words and phrases thrown at you randomly then i suspect this product or any other on the market will do I am sticking to pimsleur and assimil for the time being,78,161
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i can not use the application because it requires higher resolution screen I am using a netbook and the program will not download on a smaller screen so that is kind of disappointing,29,162
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is amateur night for programmers one of their screens seems to have become my default desktop covering all my icons does not show up in task manager and no way to remove it that i can discover even when working between glitches like this it is only so-so and apparently intended for kids only,52,163
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product to anyone it is very childish and i learned nothing i was expecting something a lot more sophisticated not a child level program you are better off buying something else,36,164
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,while the instant immersion people compare their product to rosetta stone this is in a different class and can not really be compared head-to-head however it is so much less expensive that it is a fantastic bargain it does cover the basics and if you are going on a trip in the next few months this is the program I had use it has multiple ways to learn including puzzles and games the production quality is high and there has a lot of material that said there has no grammar manuals or other written reference materials that means that this is focused on spoken spanish if that is what you are interested in then this would be a bargain at twice the price,115,165
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,disk 1 lesson 1 was very good disk 2 does not work in either of my computers i found the web page that mentions there may be a fix for the problem but after trying that the disk still does not work until this is fixed i would not recommend this program,51,166
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,guest reviewer mrs know it all -b well for the money it is a good basic tool to help you learn spanish vocabulary i have worked with rosetta stone language software and do not think this is as structured of courses but for the price who can complain this software teaches you the vocabulary and phrases i did not find the advance conversation lessons to helpful as i think the samples were talking to quickly especially if you are someone just learning the language you need it to be slow some of the games were fun a little hard to figure out sometimes but overall fun i would recommend this product for someone who just wants to learn the basics in a new language and not break the bank doing it,131,167
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,it arrived on time got it for my wife who deals with spanish speakers on the job she has not used it yet,22,168
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is unquestionably the worst software i can remember purchasing in the past 25 years i put my child in front of it with a mic only to discover that it gives you no cues as to when to speak or how to accumulate points are you supposed to speak as soon as theappears and the voice announces the name or when the progress bar appears or after that who knows there is no onscreen guide it is the very model of awful software engineering,87,169
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i purchased this in preparation for a trip to spain in january it is been 30 years since college and high school spanish so i really wanted to refresh my memory and get some basics in before the trip i am having so much fun with the instant immersion spanish i just started and am only at the beginning of level 1 so i can not say how it does in higher levels i love being able to go in and do word practice over and over until i get it and the review games are fun i am anxious to let my 4th 3rd and 2nd grader play along with me also i think they will also really enjoy the games,120,170
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this willon an ipod which makes it easy to use at my age learning a new language is not as easy as it is for a child but this program seems to working it is also far more affordable than the competition give it a try,48,171
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i suck at languages most of the time my english is not all that great and after taking german all throughout grades 8 - 12 i have learned that I am never going to be one of those people that can magically sound like I am speaking another language without sounding like an idiot that being said a family trip was planned for mexico and i did not want to look like a complete tourist while wandering the streets with a dumb look on my face after checking out rosetta stones website i just did not want to invest a weeks salary on learning a new language this product provided me enough to get around without bogging me down with too much information it took me a few times of doing the same exercises but i had figured it would not be an instantaneous fluency i did download the mp3s on my ipod but found myself skipping over most of the lessons and my mind wandering about a minute into listening overall this product helped me out a little bit and the price was right if you really want to become a fluent spanish speaker i do not think this is going to do it unless you are some sort of language magician,203,172
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,contrary to what was advertised the product only included spanish phrases for the ipod and no lecture which are essentially useless by them selves methods of teaching worked well for the pc components but were a little 90s ish,39,173
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i returned this product soon after opening the box the software seems to be a strange and confusing compilation of several different programs packed into one it runs very slowly and freezes up often i could not get the voice recording feature to work and the oscar lake game is outdated and would not run in vista i plan on saving my money and purchasing a more expensive program,69,174
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a decent but not mind-blowing learn-to-speak spanish software package on the positive side it gets you listening to spoken and seeing written spanish the program presents a fairly comprehensive vocabulary that should cover many situations tourists and other new speakers might find them in on the negative side the interface looks decidedly dated and some of the vocabulary might be a bit esoteric for beginners other than that for the price it is a good way to become more familiar with spanish,83,175
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i although it was little to difficult for kids at the young end of the age range advertised it was delived in a timely manner and packaged well but my youngest child was lost on this software however in terms of content it was not as advanced for older kids as i thought it did not teach me anything i did not already know anyway if you are looking for something very basic that comes along with a song that sounds as if only an elevator would be appropriate going down and never stopping,94,176
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,not as user friendly by my expectation but it works,10,177
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,basic spanish could have learned and gotten this from online for free,12,178
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,beats rosetta stone too pricey but this can work,8,179
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is garbage save your money and buy rosetta stone,9,180
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my wife and i have been using this product for a couple of years now we review each time before we travel to a spanish speaking country it will really help getting you through day-to-day when out of the country,40,181
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i used rosetta stone this is nearly as good for the price point,12,182
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was interested in learning to speak the language the program was easy to use but i could not stick with it boring glitchy and hard to figure out the sound difference i could hear i was not saying the words the same but had no guidance to help with the pronunciation difficulties i would not recommend this for someone like me with zero experience with the language,65,183
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,this product works well unlike other reviewers i had no problems with installation or hangduring and a new computer windows 8 16 gig ram user interface is easy and intuitive and the results are acceptable this is not the highest end video processing software but it works well and is fantastic at this price point will outperform any software from 5 years ago at any price having played with various programs for about 15 years i am amazed at how my capability the new software has recommended,87,0
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,the sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned it gets better after a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software you are presented with an intuitive interface there are a good number of resources for help in using it starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration the manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer it was not difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips most of it is just drag and drop cutting is easy moving samples around is also very easy there are a huge number of transitions effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy less is more all of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product the usual capabilities exist adding audio recording voiceovers and so on in spite of this the software is not that cumbersome on system resources importing and exporting is straightforward as well this is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with four stars,189,1
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,purchased downloaded version today which turned out to be 4 executable files installation of all 4 gave back successfully installed messages upon opening pinnacle studio 17 plus software the settings defaulted to searching my hard drive automatically for all potential content to build a library from problem experienced is software has now hung on trying to build this auto library from years upon years thousands of jpegs music files video files pinnacle studio 17 plus is now inoperable and only shows the rotating circle status symbol same behavior after repeated close and restarts am unable to go into settings libraries tabs nada,102,2
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,i use this software to edit a small web series there are few special effects but it does well with small things integrating a car chase and animation in my case this software is a vital tool for clarifying picture andon a budget i run windows 8 enterprise on a lenovo all-in-one and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues which corel always did to me if you have simple projects that do not require a whole lot of special effects this is a good budget program and i definitely recommend it,97,3
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i already had a bad experience with pinnacle studio 17 ultimate and found it too difficult to use it is no good for anyone other than someone who has an expert video editor i decided to give it a 2nd shot with pinnacle studio 17 plus and could not even get the software to install i tried several times restarted my computer and more and the installation would not run i saw others comment that they were able to install the software by doing it in pieces but i would not even know where to begin with that ps my computer does meet all the requirements listed on the box,107,4
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after getting past some install issues with windows 81 i found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I have used in the past such as windows movie maker or imovie the ui was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features frankly i just do not have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink i spent on it,80,5
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i tried again and again to get this software installed on my windows 8 desktop by all normal means and it just was not going to happen the cd just would not run i was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up one-by-one by exploring the disc files i had to install them in bits and even that was not entirely successful i could not get all of this product installed on my computer so i was only able to try out portions of it although what i did get installed does seem to be working the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others,119,6
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,pinnacle studio 17 plus is an easy to use program that is great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software but users do not have to be an expert to get good results it is fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features installation was easy as well and ran with no difficulties although it took about 20 minutes to complete i was most interested in the live screen capture feature but it was a bit difficult to find users are required to look for it in program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it despite that small flaw live screen capture works well most of the time for instance it will capture video from minecraft flawlessly but I have had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games all around pinnacle studio 17 plus does a good job with minimal effort,154,7
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,yes i now have two pinnacle products that i should never have purchased the other one is the studio 17 ultimate what was i thinking the product performed before par and i found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what i wanted it to which is to help me edit photos simple right that is what i thought after the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems i had with studio 17 and being charged to get support i just gave up there are so many other programs out there that are far superior than pinnacle systems i would suggest going to your local best buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person no charge to compare programs to your needs that is what i did after i through this in the garbage along with the studio 17 sorry pinnacle this was my last purchase with you,155,8
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after trying and liking pinnacle studio 17 i was looking forward to giving studio 17 plus a try but there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it as many others have pointed out installation takes hours a process that data mines every media file on your computer with no way to opt out i work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no i do not need to get bogged down in every file i ever processed each time i want to create something new the learning curve is steep on this the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly and as others have noted be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating I shall keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors,180,9
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,compared to adobe premiere elements which costs the same this software blows it away in terms of features and capability i was using premiere elements for years but often got frustrated by the limited number of adjustments that i could me sure premiere elements let me run automatic adjustments with lightingcorrections and scene transitions but when i wanted to get fancy this software became limiting with pinnacle studio i am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than abode more scene transitions and I am able to tweak my videos in ways i never could before so far I am really enjoying this software after 3 weeks I am still discovering more that it can do some people noted the difficult installation i would not call it difficult i would call it time consuming but this i expect with any professional level video editing software these installations are huge especially with all the features macros effects and more that it installs also a strong processor is important when rendering videos i recommend 2 or 4 cores,174,10
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,my video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use it did take a while tobut it is a large software package pros easy layout of basic features lots of options / templates for a quick start and consistent appearance great 2d and 3d rendering quick processing good interface cons snails pace install large software needs a fast processor or you lag a bit more advanced features are a little quirky to use steep learning curve if new to this program good program over all it is a nice platform and highly recommended,105,11
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,this program is overly power hungry and takes 5 to 10 minutes to do the simplest things moreover it takes as long as 12 hours to import / ready even a 15 minute video for editing i do not recommended this program for the average user looking to make a quick home vodeo,51,12
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,found it confusing it kept adding things to the video and there no instruction on how to get rid of them i switch back to the old version of pinacle studio,31,13
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,good to have a 64 bit version of software i have used for years,14,14
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,it is good so far just testing it out to make sure it does not have any hang,18,15
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,i tried to upgrade fro ps2 to use my zoom q2hd but this program would not recognize my device for screen capture no matter what i did i went to nch videopad which works just fine adios pinnacle you were a good old hoss once upon a time,48,16
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,it is a very good program intuitive interface and quite functional truth fulfills it is purpose and reduce my ping more than half without any problems maybe how to select game server could be improved to make it more friendly to the user view and outside it is an excellent program,50,0
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,I am on the east coast florida and had a hard time getting stable connection i get a more stable connection way supperior than before,24,1
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,absolutely love the software always get great results and no problems have seen improvements in ping for nearly all my games although results may vary due to position free free version is great to learn the basics and to see if this works well for you premium premium is great for choosing a specific server you want to join,61,2
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,it did work for me lower mi ping from 150 to 90 - 110 now i can play smoothly,17,3
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,absolutely dreadful my ping only dropped like 10 - 20 ms not worth 10 dollars a month for this,17,4
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,does not work tried in many games did not lower my ping only caused me problems,14,5
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,this is awesome so many games are supported reduced my damn ping thanks for that,15,6
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,I have been using wtfast for a while now and i like the program for 2 reason 1 wide options to get the best results 2 great customer service what else would a person want people who are complaining that they are not getting results probably do not know how to get them but surely they are there i connect to a server in canada with a 330ms and get a 185ms on best days and 200 on bad days but the connection is alwats stable so it is very useful,91,7
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,being from sydney australia my average ping to any us / canada based servers is 300ms wtfast brings my ping down to 220 - 240ms which is a 20 improvement this is significant i primarily play mmorpgs and shooters where every millisecond counts it means the difference between landing that raid saving heal getting that agro skill off or firing that all important crit that just procd or not those that are in the know are fully aware of how and why ping matters and use wtfast i now use it for all gaming including steam and origin based games,96,8
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,great product it decreases my ping i tried the trail a year or two ago and i absolutely enjoyed it my ping was constantly low even lower than y lowest ping while using wtfast this is not a tool where it makes it look like your ping is down it actually does improve it but it might not work for everyone a few have already said that it does not work for them so yea,74,9
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,my isp has routing issues that result in a triple digit ping to servers that are only 190 miles from my home wtfast lowers my ping from 110ms to 18ms on those servers where my isp does not have routing issues i see improvement but only by 12 - 15 percent,49,10
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,love the lowered ping i can say it at least lowered my ping in games by 20 and while some might say that is terrible that 20 can be the difference between me getting something off successfully or not in gaming every little bit counts,44,11
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,hello wtfast is a perfect product in all ways and forms i live in rural canada with fixed wireless internet and my ping usually hovers around a good 250 when I am in a game of league i decided to give wtfast a try and it blew my mind when my ping actually dropped to an average of 210 i decided to give premium a try and now i play league with a decent 180 ping per game it also solved my packet loss problem too thanks so much for creating an amazing product it was worth the money devi,100,12
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,i have not noticed any improvements after using wtfast and i normally play with 110 ping did not work for me but i know some friends that have noticed improvements while using it your mileage will vary,36,13
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,no reason to purchase if you have major isp,9,14
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,double the price and worse service than before,8,15
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,wtfast advanced 1 computer for 1 month [ online code ],12,16
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,did not work for me but i blame isp I am using vpn and i do not have lag spikes,17,17
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i like this program a bunch and it has truly helped me redesign my entire first floor before i start my project this way i have no regrets when we actually start i just wish the terrain and roof lines for vaulted ceilings was not so hard to add or modify but overall great for rooms and additions and decking,59,0
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,the reads all my old files from 3d home architect and works much better with more features,17,1
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,not user friendly did not even work at first because of something with the graphics card and needing to download a different version by the time i got it working our project was almost over and the software was so difficult to use i want my money back,47,2
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,i like it it has a learning curve but works well i am trying to figure out how to make the roof go over the porch but i think it is because i added the porch after i built the house still working on it,45,3
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,does everything you would expect for this price i have trouble getting it to do roofs with add on porches that are a different pitch from the main roof makes great floor plans i have used it for a house remodel and a workshop and am very satisfied,48,4
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,unless you have used this sort of app before plan to put in some time viewing the tutorials and learn how to search the knowledge base when you run into a snag it is a great piece of software for creating a home design I have run into a few snags with some of the features but their resources for resolving them are quite good overall I am happy with the purchase and feel it was well worth the money just to be able to see the design in 3d,86,5
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,this software is not user-friendly at all it is insanely tedious because you have to click back and forth between the different ways to view your plans the tool bars is really confusing to use and i could not even find a function where you could have a grid showing in the background as you created your design i am disappointed in myself for not reading the fine print because after a couple of hours using this software i wanted a refund buyer beware this software is for ridiculously patient people,90,6
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i really like this design program easy enough to use after watching a few videos and not overly expensive,19,7
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,this program is somewhat limited but if you are trying layout a new home or look at how finishes will look then this is a good program i gave it 4 stars because it does not calculate roof lines correctly and the landscaping does not allow for contours,48,8
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,this is not a good program and does not offer functions needed for basic architectural design i have used other programs that offered a ton more in the way of variables for less money i am so mad i fell for the sales video pitch maybe the pro line offers more but i will not take another chance i uninstalled it about 15 minutes after installing what a waste of money but i new immediately it was crap and need the space to buy something else,86,9
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,I have had others this ones is not that great,9,10
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,the software only works on newest computers so it does not work on mine there is apparently no way to return it so I am out 50 save your money and do not buy this software unless your computer is less than 6 months old,43,11
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,this software is awesome i ended up upgrading to the next higher version although as i did not realize until afterwards that you are unable to do sloped terrains for walk out basements and such with the essentials version i wish i would have known this but they give you the ability to upgrade for essentially the same cost as if you bought it up front so no big deal,70,12
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,not the most user friendly version but it is downright cheap compared to others or even newer versions,17,13
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,can not do corner cabinets like with lazy susan i fully expected that it would at least come with the basics for your floor plan ie toilets tubs sinks counterops n flooring needless to say for 63 and change with tax very dissapointed,42,14
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,this product is definitely not user friendly it is only good if you are used to a high tech program this is not for an average user,26,15
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i used this to remodel a house i owned and was very impressed i had tried several other house design software programs both online and over the counter and was very disappointed with them this is the only one i could use without any difficulty at all i was great to be able to give my builder an exact drawing and layout of what i wanted without having to use an architect or sketching something up on paper then when he was done it looked exactly like it did on the computer inside and out it was almost anti-climactic the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because you will probably find out that the standard program is a little lacking and you will need to upgrade for extra of course to a better version still it is well worth the money and a ton cheaper then hiring someone,151,16
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,pretty easy to use if you are familiar with the previous version takes a while to find all the available details not enough patio options so far,27,17
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,hard to use not happy with it but can not return,10,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,with no tax and free shipping it is a bargain certainly will not compete with a 500 mountain bike but it is great for riding around my somewhat hilly neighborhood bike has a good appearance comes shipped in double packaging for protection note the factory installed the handlebars at an incorrect angle nothing in the instructions said to fix it but you figure out pretty quickly that you need to rotate the handlebars for the gear shifters to be in the right position,80,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,first off i was happy when i noticed the dual-boxed shipping that was done to help keep the bike from getting scratched then after pulling the bike out of the box i noticed some nice scrapes on the fork of the bike from where the handle bars were hanging when it was shipped also on further inspection i found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well also after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight i noticed that it was way off basically it wobbles fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if i understand correctly this should not have come like that in my opinion this may get shipped back to amazon at this rate also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears i appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on at least do it right,170,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,package came extremely fast bike was easy to put together the suspension is great it is a well made bike for the price,23,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,it is an amazing bike and i am pretty happy with the purchase would have given it 5 stars except that it requires allen keys and a spanner for assembly which took me over a week to get as i do not have a car so if you are planning to just get a bike and start riding try the nearest target store or if you want quality get this one little expensive but trusty bike frm mongoose letitsnow,83,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was very happy with my purchase the bike came in a double box and did not have a scratch on it i found it was easy to assemble and only needed a quick brake adjustment and air in the tires for me to be off and riding the aluminum frame makes the bike light and the shifting was smooth this is a great value for the price,68,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,if i can figure out how to put the thing together it would probably be nice,16,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,considering that my next-door bike shop was selling something similiar for over 350 i suppose this a great bargain if you are not a pro i think you will like the bike as well since it does exactly what it is supposed to assemblying was super easy and i was using the bike just 1/2 hour after receiving even if instructions are not provided anyway remember this is a cheap bike so you might consider having it checked at your local bike shop to get brakes and gears tuned up it usually takes 1 hour of labor-,94,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,this bike is kind of hard to put together instructions are not the best the ride quality is average it is good for just getting around town i would not go mountain biking with this bike good bike to buy on sale,42,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i purchased this bike a short time ago i have been trying to assemble it for 3 days now the pictures do not look anything like the bike after i finally assembled it on pure instinct the front brake was difficult to adjust but i managed the back brake is broken and needs to be replaced i think the shifting unit was not factory assembled properly i had to take the shifting unit apart as well as take the back tire off of the bike and re-assemble it for it to even function now that it is functioning i am trying to adjust it to shift properly i guess that was too much to ask because it is still not working properly however the bike looks awesome i can not wait to finally be able to ride it although it will probably be snowing by then,146,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,this bike is very poor quality and i would not recommend as an example the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way it was not worth the hassle to return for another as a relacement might have been worse and cost us more to get it tweaked by a professional after assembly than the bike cost I shall never buy another mongoose what a waste of money,88,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,well i loved the bike at first i was able to put it togehter easy enough and loved it for the first month i rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months the brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter the rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy i thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed so if you need a weekend warrior this is the bike for you amazon has always been the best internet shopping site please do not refer the rating of mongoose products to any afliates of amazon,142,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,bike is good for casual riding use it extensively on the weekends and it is great this is the first bike that i own and i was able to put it together and tune it up i do minor work on my car so that may help keep in mind that when you get the bike not everything will feel right out of the box you will need to use it for a week or two to tweak out the minor details seat position / height brakes gear shifter wheel alignment just keep your tools handy,93,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,this is the best bike i found in the low end price range i would suggest to anyone who purchases this bike to take it to a bicycle shop and have it professionally fine tuned and have them finish the assembly for you it really made a difference and for safety it is the best way to be sure the bike is operating at it is best the man at the bicycle repair shop i took the bike to agreed this is the best bike you can buy for the price i purchased this bike for my fourteen year old and he is very happy with it,106,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,seems to be a good bike although it is a bit heavier than others i have the seat is comfortable and the shocks are good and it looks sharp i did have trouble with the gear but mongoose reacted quickley and sent be a replacement the assembley is difficult and instructions are unclear but a good bike,57,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i did not like the handling of the bike itself the steering seemed a bit off the quality of the bike itself is just ok the price is the real attractor for buying it,33,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,very well made bike well worth the price too bad it did not have disk brakes because it would make it better otherwise it is an excellent bike,28,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,lightweight and unique beyond our expectations arrived in quick amount of time in good condition this bike was an excellent purchase and the price was extraordinary especially with free shipping and extra off i would purchase another if i can get the same deal as i did on this one we are very satisfied with this bike,58,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i bought it for my 12 years old daughter this mountian bike is much better than i expected vert strong and very light top quality my 12 years old daughter can carry it consider i only paid for less than 70 for this one similar bikes in our local stores are selling at 150 it is a real great deal for a top quality product my daughter liked it very much thanks amazon,73,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,got this during the holiday wish list promo really wanted an xbox 360 but got this for 30 so obviously I am thrilled as it was dirt cheap as far as the quality of the bike i have only used it ride in my neighborhood no mountain use the bike assembled pretty easy make sure you have got some allen wrenches had to get a new seat due to the fact I am 230lbs but I am happy with it the gears are kinda rough to shift so i mainly keep it in the same gear i think if you want it for light exercise then it is great otherwise you may want to spend more if you are looking for a real mountain bike,117,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i purchased this bike when it was on special the day of thanksgiving this bike is awesome especially for the price i paid,23,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,pretty easy to assemble sturdy and easy to ride for the price you can not beat it,16,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,this is a decent bike but is not heavy duty and needs some retuning after a good day on the trails the chain slipped a couple of times after steep climbs and the rims need to be trued i weigh about 165 lbs so ymmv,45,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i bought this bike for my son for christmas he loves it he says the suspension is great he is 14 and 64 tall so it has been a challenge to find something comfortable for him,36,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,fun for the 30 i paid for pedal broke off a small jump,13,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i would say it was bad decision although i got it under 100 that is why i give one more star the box was open when i got it the rear reflector was broken in addition the front gear never shifts to 3 i did not want to spend extra 25 to fix the problem so I am enjoying full 14 speeds now oh one more in my opinion the bike has bad seat cushion,74,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,the bikes seat post was too short other than that the bike is great,14,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i received this bike for christmas only two minor comlaints 1 the tires were not inflated completely this may be standard on bikes although I am not sure 2 the front brakes were not adjusted properly but it was an easy fix the manual was easy to read the gears were already assembled which is a huge plus,55,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,got this bike from amazons customer vote program it was easy to assemble the bike even when i did not read the manual at all the bike itself was very sturdy and easy to handle can not beat a good deal,41,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,the bike is good but it does not come with the tools that u need to assemble it i did not know that everything u buy online needs to be assembled i got the bike on discount during the cool deals and it costs almost the same if u assemble it at a bike shop quite inconvenient when you do not have time,60,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,for 30 i figured I had buy it and donate it to toys for tots i had nohow difficult it would be to get this thing assembled and adjusted and several hours later wish I had never bought it,39,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,this bike is impressive looking unfortunately unless you are an expert bicycle mechanic you probably should look elsewhere the components of the bike are fairly cheap and getting the bike to work out of the box will consume many many hours of time getting it operational the brakes used on the bike are of very low quality and should be replaced before operating in addition the gears that come with the bike are also of extremely low quality and will need major adjustments in order for basic use other than the brakes and the defailleurs the other components are of average quality and perform as expected bottom line is the frame and tires of this bike what you would expect for a bike in this price range unfortunately unless you are very experienced at adjusting and/or replacing brake mechanisms and derailleurs there are simpler higher quality choices available elsewhere,149,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,oh i feel very bad of buying this bike i bought this bike during the amazon thanksgiving deal for 60 the bike came in a very heavy box and i moved the box into the living room and started assembling damn there is no manual which says which part goes where the product description says requires only minimal assembling but even to do that you at least need a manual i unpacked it and had noon how to put things together got very upset so i put the things in the box again and moved it to a corner of my living room it has been sitting there for a while i saw lots of screws and small broken parts in the package i have nowhat all these totally wasted 60 so only if you have a complete bike assembling kit have patience to spend at least 3 hours and of course able to assemble it by youself without having any manual then go for it from the previous reviewers it seems that it is not a great / sturdy mountain bike so be careful before buying i am totally upset with this,194,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i purchased this bike for 60 from the amazon vote deal and am very pleased with the purchase i tried to put it together myself but failed miserably and ended up taking it to the local campus bike shop to get it put together and tuned up for only 15 best 15 i ever spent it only took them an hour and it took me over 2 hours just trying to figure out the directions the bike is very lightweight and rides smoothly i will only be using it to bike to / from campus so i am very pleased with the purchase i am a 53 105 lb female and it fits me fine great bike for college students,118,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,bought this bike during the big sale i have several bikes and am a pretty good bike tuner [ ] fortunately the bike was fine assembly went smothly unfortunately this bike has very poor quality parts brakes wheels shifters and more if you need to get a cool bike for around [ ] get one of these but make sure it comes from a store that can work with you on set up forget being able to adjust the brakes or gears yourself basically this is a childs bike made to look like an adults bike I am 5 foot 10 inches and this bike is way too small spending money on a bike like this is a waste of time [ ],118,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,this is probably the best i have ever owned great bike great price bike is well made and very durable,20,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,first off this is a good working bike there is a little noise when on higher gears but other than that the ride is smooth and stable amazon shipped the bike quickly and it arrived within three days after the order as mentioned in earlier reviews the handlebars wheel seat and pedals need to be assembled no big problems except for front brake adjustment they are cantilever brakes so just take them apart make sure you put the wheel in center squeeze and tighten it took me a while to adjust but if you have assembled bikes before it will take less than 30 min no complaints other than setup and that i have to carry it up and down two flights of stairs every day on my way to work -d,130,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,received my shinning new bike excitement opened the box assembled the parts inflated the tires checked the chain joy mounted it for my first ride emotion put my feet on the pedals fresh air good weather at 75f happiness started pedaling suddenly loud crack what the fuck something fell off pedals loosed the ride stopped now sadness anger rage damn what happened is that the rear derailleur sram 30 simply broke for no reason I am a 57 185 lbs non-athletic couch potato and there has no way i could have caused this breaking by just pedaling check the images i uploaded of the broken derailleur customers images this is definitively a case of bad quality plastic components used in an expensive product I have seen cheaper bikes at local retailers wmt tgt kmt with better shimano components now who i have to direct my complaints to amazon mongoose sram who has going to respond for it,151,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was surprised at how easy it was to put the bike together mostly everything is pre-assembled putting together the bike only took about 15 to 30 mins with the right tools it probably will take about 1 to 2 hours to tune the brakes pads and adjust the heights not a big deal for a nice bike,58,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i order this bike online from amazon and less than 5 days i have recieved the bike in the box 2 boxes the bike is a brand new and excellent condition nothing else is damaged which due to the shipment this bike is very light weight about 35 pound or less after completely assymble and it is very easy to do assymbly too,63,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,received bike ahead of schedule packing was great bike undamaged assembly was a snap no surprises no problems bike fit was ideal did minor adjustment to brake pads seat derailers and bars aired up tires to spec nothing unexpected bike rides great for the price more than i could have asked for great deal great service great product would recommend for anyone looking for a great all around bicycle love it,72,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,the bike came well packaged and was easy enough to put together i would recommend getting the bike fully tuned after putting it together or have a professional put it together unless you trust whoever partially assembled it before shipping the chain sticks sometimes when you are trying to shift gears but this has not given me too many problems and it is not like the chain falls off just if you are switching from 5 to 4 it does not switch right away sometimes overall very pleased for the price oh and get a comfortable seat,94,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,the only nice thing about this bike is it is dual suspension but you can have that with most bike manufacturers i believe that mongoose has gone downhill in regards to the quality of their cycles the brakes had to be fixed twice and the wheels replaced all in a period of two months,53,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,unfortunatly this bike came with two fist sized holes in it one had bent the rear shifter the other had slightly bent the front rim the bike itself is fantastic i am 5 foot 11 inches and it is just a tad small for me but it has a smooth ride my only complaint is that the gear ratios are heavily biased torward uphill biking which makes going around town a bit slower i am dissapointed with amazons shipping but the bike is great all around seems very durable a pleasure to ride i give it four stars because the shipping has made tuning this bike a very long and difficult process,111,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,it was easy to assemble even if i still have to fix gears and brakes that were mounted upside down i did not use it yet because it was way too cold here in new york city,34,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i just finished assembling looks cool i am no expert with bikes but i feel that speed shift and duel suspension front / rear are working as expected it may be a little early to comment on durability but you can not expect a 500 bike for 140 my wife also felt comfortable riding it esp with the free bells gel fusion seat can you belive i paid only 170 for bike gear helmet 5 kryptonite lock and pump gel cushion shipping,82,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,this bike is horrible the front shocks do not even work and neither the rear shocks no wonder why it is so cheap for christmas i got a marin rift zone which is an amazing bike but it costs alot but the marin has manitou front shocks and fox rear shocks with great disk brakes if you are serious about mountainn biking like i am get a real full-suspension bike like a marin iron horse kona or santa cruz,73,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,first this is a branded bike made by a firm called pacific cycle pacific cycle mass produces bikes and sells them under a variety of names including mongoose through variety of retailers that is not necessarily a bad thing it just depends on what you need this bike is perfect for riding around town it is light reasonably durable and comfortable I have owned it actually i own the walmart version which is virtually identical for nearly 3 years and have not had any serious problems or defects i primarily use it in an urban setting roads sidewalks curbs pot holesand occasionally take it through parks and bicycle trails the bike excels at these uses but i would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious off-road / trail bike it just is not made to withstand that kind of stress in short if you want a real off-road bike go to a bicycle shop and pay 400 dollars but if all you need is a bike to get around town then buy this one,171,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i have had this bike for over a month now it seemed to be working well initially but i would not recommend it to anyone who is planning too ride the bike off-road th gears need to be tweaked one of the peddle broke literally split in two and i never dropped the bike or anything so can not say much about the quality it is also heavy so do not expect to be biking uphill in this but if you want a bike to ride in flat terrain for a mile or so every day then it is not bad,103,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,bike is terrible but looks cool amd came at a good price the seat is way too uncomfortable rear brakes have come undone 3 times so far bike gets loose at major points must tighten on a weekly basis handlebars seat postwould not but again in the future should get a refund or some kind of credit 11,64,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was going to give it 4 stars as i had to change the seat but that is my fault for buying a mans bike and I am a woman it is a very comfortable ride seat withstanding and was just what i was looking for nice and sturdy and very easy to put together,52,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,when i was a kid i was extremely angry at my father because he would not buy me a mongoose dirt bike i guess i still have a bit of a grudge because 20 years later i decided to finally get my mongoose while this is not a bike that i would choose to scale denali in let us be serious i am not going to scale denali on any bike it is a tremendous bike for the price it came double boxed and was in great shape i only had to do a few simple steps and i was riding i did have to adjust the brakes and gears a bit but i do not know much about bikes and it was really easy the bottom line is that this bike is easy to ride looks cool and does not cost much,140,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,the bike came double boxed with not a scratch on it had some difficulty with putting it together due to the fact i did not have any hex wrenches that big 8 mm and 11 mm are needed but a quick trip to wal-mart solved this problem oh the wrench set was 099 i pumped up the tires and was on my way the bike handles great and have no problems with the performance i will definately buy another one of these for my wife or give her this one so i can have the newer one,95,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,this is a nice pouch that i wanted to try for conceal carry it fits my taurus 709 and s w 642 the only thing i do not like is that it does not have a built in holster just a separate compartment and they use velcro to hold it closed which makes alot of noise when opening it i use this now and then when i do not want a fanny pack on i have no real complaints about it except the velcro i think it should of had a zipper one for each section that is why i gave it 4 stars and i would still recommend it to others,108,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,always looking for conceal carry options had one of these years ago and loved it found it again on amazon a must buy for conceal carry of sub-compact or 5-shot revolver highly recommend this piece of equipment,37,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,i have had this holster pouch for three years the other day while out shopping one of the plastic belt loops ripped off where the plastic attaches to to the pouch the pistol i was carrying was a colt mustang pocket lite the holster did not get snagged on anything that would of caused this defect for conceal carry i want and expect better quality than this this is an expensive holster for what you get i will not be purchasing another product from this company my sneaky petes work the best,93,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,works fine a little large than i expected,9,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,uncle mikes use to make a quality pouch holster I have had 3 of them over the years but this last one i bought failed after just over a years use when the rubber belt loop broke not recommended,37,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,after a very short use with a 135 oz ruger lcr in it one of the plastic belt loops broke right in the center of the loop these loops should be made of the same cordura material or leather these weak plastic loops make this an inferior product,48,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,after 6 months belt loop rubber splint in and broke and company did not get back with me aboutuncle mikes i thought was high rated company in customer service they are not would not recommend buying from them,39,6

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,cheap rubberlike belt loop broke the first time i wore it,11,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,at first it appeared to be just what i needed after no more than 20 minutes of use the belt loops broke i do not recumbent it at all very poorly made do not let the name uncle mikes fool you it is made in vietnam,43,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,poorly constructed the rubberized attachment on the back that is meant to slide your belt through is sewn on with a single thin little piece of thread which ripped the very first time i used it also the rubber piece cracked and ripped in half apparently because it is so dry like old rubber can get sometimes I am in the process of attempting to return it if i can,68,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,works well i carry my phone wallet and some other small stuff i use everyday i do not think the plastic belt loops on the back will hold up if they break i will make new loops from an old nylon dog leash and sew them myself i am working out of state so i have not tried my s and w air weight but it looks like it will fit fine,71,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,i do not like thisbecause it is to big,9,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,broke as soon as i put it on my belt,10,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,it is a simple if not elegant way to carry a gun comfortably concealed it looks like a fanny pack or camera bag and even has room for extras it is not fancy but it works,35,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,belt loops broke nice pouch poor belt loops hope they redesign belt loops the could be just a little above center two too help prevent sagging forward to bad i did like the pouch but poor quality loops make it almost useless,42,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,very good carry option requires a belt heavy enough to carry theput into the packit heavy and you need a heavy belt easy to open well made,31,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,big enough to hold my walther pps40 with extended mag also good for carrying lots of vacation accessories passports cameras cell phones,23,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,this pouch is very nice fits my pt145 snugly and has room in front for other items however all the good features are for naught as the belt loops are chintzy and tear loose easily thus rendering a otherwise very nice belt pouch into a clutch purse do not bother buying this to wear on your belt it will not last long,60,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,this is a neat design and just what i was looking for but after only a few days of wear wore it on weekends only one of the belt loops tore in half i am four days beyond when i can return / exchange it so i am stuck uncle mikes products are always top notch so i am surprised at having a critical part break which makes the pak useless,69,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,thisis pretty good i purchased it to carry a pt145 and it fits ok mine has a laser mounted on it so i am unable to close the velcro section that is made to hold your firearm all of the way with out a laser mounted i think that you could it is well made and unlike others it is not overlay large,64,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,have had two of these pouches used to carry glasses phone and more first one lasted 2 months before belt loop broke after several emails phone calls a replacement arrived the belt loop broke on the first usage like theneeds design change,43,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,you have to remove your belt to put it on if it had snaps for quick removal it would be perfect,21,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,my handgun is a small ruger 380 and it fits in this pak it appears to be a fanny pack and i put my cell phone in the outer pocket i was not able to find anything like this in my area my gunshop or cabellas so it is perfect,50,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,the straps on the case that you put your belt through are made of rubber and did not take much to break if they were leather it would be more durable,30,24

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,i have a ruger lcr 38 with hogue grip laser it fits very well in this uncle mikes bag it has a small separate pouch on the outside of the bag that nicely holds two 5 star firearms speedloaders in interior of the bag has two compartments one for storing your piece in a concealed compartment and another if you want to carry identification or something like a small camera the ruger lcr is a fine handgun and conceals well there are times it is more comfortable to carry the lcr in the uncle mikes or I am wearing attire where the handgun is not fully concealed there are also times i carry the bag and do not belt it it works well for that too if you have a ruger lcr and chl you can not go wrong with this bag,137,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,nice fanny pack for your small revolver perfect size for a s w j frame outside pocket will hold a small mp3 player or cell phone not large enough for a smart phone the inside is devided into 2 compartments one with a velcro closier for the weapon the other for identification smart phone or any similar size items does not come with a belt the belt loops will support a belt as wide as 2 3/8 inches,73,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,i purchased the uncle mikes off-duty nylon pouch for my son for hunting purposes it performed very well for him it was easy to access and held all the essentials that he needed i would definately purchase another if the need arose,42,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,i received thisbelt pouch holster as a birthday gift it fits my semiauto compact pistols like the taurus milpros pt140 pt145 taurus 24/7 c ds 9mm/40 sw/45 acp great however it is too small for the pistols with 4 barrels like the ruger sr9 and the taurus 24/7s full size it can hold one of my compacts in the back holster and still has plenty of room for 2 or 3 mags in the front without printing it might not be the best but i would say it works very well for ccing the compact pistols the good things are it does not look obvious as other cc pouches it is made of durable material and it is not too big on my belt fyi the dimensions of my taurus compact pistols are hxwxl 5125x125x6125 inches this pouch holster fits any one of them like a glove i do not think it will fit bigger pistols,154,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,soak these in water and place in the refrigerator until you are ready for them they work great for visiting theme parks and other outdoor activities when you are done rinse thoroughly to remove sweat and let them air dry it takes 2 to 3 days for them to dry completely then you can store them until needed again i would not put them in the washer and dryer,69,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,very disappointed there is some chemical on this product that gave me quite a bad reaction it caused insomnia hyperactivity and a skin eruption like i get when a chemical has me overloaded it is a greatbut since it is not washable to get this chemical off they will go to someone less sensitive than i,57,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i was placing a lot of hope in these bandanas helping me make it through the t-ball games there are cool to the touch but sweating did not seem to activate them it just was not cool enough to cool me down at all if you put them in the refrigerator it was much better but they did not stay that cold for long in my opinion they blocked the breeze when there was one,73,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,these things work great i put mine in a plastic cup withwater and wring it out just before my workout at the gym after one hour it still cools you down switch it to the other side and it gets even cooler kind of like turning your pillow over and it is cooler would definetely recommend,60,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,after dropping 40 on one of those sharper image personal cooling systems and finding out that i would have been just as well off putting my money directly in a trash can i stumbled upon these they work very well and stay cool for several hours and stay wet for days if it gets too warm just pop it in the fridge for 10 minutes and you are good for a few more hours glad i bought them,77,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,first of all these are not shaped like a typical bandana but they do puff up with water and stay wet for days be careful they do get stinky if you do not let them air out but do not expect them to get completely dry,44,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,i bought the 10 pack based on the reviews it definitely worked great the first time i used one it kept my head cool as i played tennis on a really hot day but the problem is it never completely dries i washed it and put it in dryer it never completely dries once the stuff inside soaks water / sweat you can never get rid of it and soon enough it starts to stink i had to painstakingly slit a small hole in each of the 10 take out the chemical particles and now i just use them as bandanas for sweat,101,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,very fast shipment greatreally helped keep the kids cool at band camp,14,7

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,these bandanas have been a huge help getting me through the record heat we have had in the midwest this summer simple to activate and long lasting cool they really do what they say they will my only suggestion is to activate them and let them hang dry at least once before using since they do fade a little neat product and awesome service i am a happy camper,69,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,product is cheap one of the 4 coolers did not have enough crystals to inflate neckcooler material bleeds all over your clothing does not stay cool after about 45 minutes design is bad when inflated cooler does not want to bend easily around your neck feels like you are wearing a tire do not waste your money i have purchased other neck coolers far superior to these that actually are comfortable and work well,73,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i was so excited to get these but how disappointing the cold did not last long and they are just useless,21,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,i bought these for my husband because he works outdoors here in the extreme heat of southernthey have been well worth the price i paid for them as they have helped to prevent him from having a heat stroke,41,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,i have used these before when i worked in a factory that would get to 100 degrees these things work very well to help keep you a little cooler secret is to rinse them out after use and resoak them for the next days wearing i purchased these for my son who works outside in the sun and heat he says they are definately worth the money,67,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,seem to work fine and keep cool can not really complain although you can get made fun of because they are goofy looking around your neck,25,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,product arrived but i discovered that the product is not a triangular bandana as i assumed but a tube of cloth filled with a water obsorbing substance returned product for a refund and bought a chilly pad from frogg toggs instead,41,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,they do swell up in cold water but you definitely have to do it for at least an hour and it helps to keep them in the refrigerator during that time you also have to keep turning it to get the cool effect i will use it when gardening because it is a little messy for good clothes,57,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,the evercool reusable cooling bandana lives up to it is name in arizona it has stood up to 112 degree heat while i work outside tending my flowers and yard or taking walks in my neighborhood it is second nature to take it out of the fridge after a good soak in water and tie it on and go outside and enjoy the day not having to worry about the extreme heat i sometimes forget i have it on at the end of the day it is still keeping me cool great product i would think it would be terrific for first responders and others who are subjected to extreme heat i see many landscapers and construction workers wearing them here in az another great use would be for summer sports camps or football teams who start practice in august great way to prevent heat induced injuries the colors they come in are great too,149,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,a friend gave me a similarshe had purchased at a fair it was wonderful the beads inside were plentiful stayed plump and cool several hours after soakingable to wear it right away without clothing getting wet material was soft cotton that layed quite nicely when tied thinking these were the same i ordered 2 sets not nearly the quality that my friend had puchased not enough beads inside cloth was stiff unable to wear after wetting material it soaked my clothing,85,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i can not believe i fell for this a man in his elder years should know better but it gets hot on the arkansas river fishing in the summer and i was a little desperate fact is this thing did not do any cooling that i could tell after about 2 minutes i agree with the person who said that it did seem to block the wind making you hotter the crystals the seller talks about were all in one wad bunched up near one end of the little shoestring-like scarf so how could the crystals cool anything i sure do not have the answer what i do know however is that these things are purely and simply ripoffs amazon should not allow obvious fraudulent gimmicks to be sold on their site hopefully amazon has a system for checking out products that receive really negative feedback like this one and can outlaw future sales of those products i am probably dreaming however,160,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i prepared the bandana per instruction i had them in the refrig over night for the next day that next morning i went to put the bandana on and some of the gel beads were sticking out of the materal i took those off and then put the bandana around my neck the coolnest only lasted maybe 20 minutes i was very disappointed i went back to my stand by which is a cold wash cloth that had been in the refrig and it lasts at least an hour i would never buy this product again,96,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,cover is pretty thin and tares easily also does not secure in anyway so it can blows off easily,19,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,the first time we used this cover it tore on the rear axle bolt it also did not fit the classic style bicycle we were placing this on very well but that was to be expected since it is a one-size-fits-all type of cover,43,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,after several months of storing a bicycle outdoors this cover has begun disintegrating the plastic has become brittle i suspect due to the sun i live in a temperate part of southern california this cover has become completely useless i will be looking for a cover which is more durable perhaps one made of the type of material you might find for a bbq cover avoid this product at all costs if you plan to store your bike outside,79,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,after a few rain storms this cover is all ripped up it is not that heavy,15,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,4.0,positive,thin but durable bike cover fits my large beach cruiser as pictured it also fits my standard bike but not my stretch cruiser overall this bike cover works well for my outside storage needs just do not let the dog near it because it shreds easily,45,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,4.0,positive,inexpensive and useful glad i have this and i can keep my bicycles out on the balcony at the condo without upsetting the management,24,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,very pleased with the bike covers they came faster than expected i would buy from this company again,18,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,it was difficult to figure out how to cover the bicycle with this cover as it did not seem to have any demarkations for installation it started coming apart after the first use a large about 1 foot long tear appeared i attempted to tape it withtape but it not only came apart again but ripped in several other places as well i would recommend that anyone needing a bicycle cover buy a better quality one than this you get what you pay for,86,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,the first time i used the bicycle cover one of two which i bought when i went to uncover it there was a foot-long split in the seam i taped it up and am using it but basically i feel it is a rather chintzy product also it is very hard to figure out how to orient the cover to fit on the bike but i suppose since it was inexpensive it would fit in the category of you get what you pay for,82,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,they fit over my bike with plenty of room to spare keeps hem dry and clean,16,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,the product was advertised as durable plastic should have said very thin plastic when i took it out of the bag and opened it was torn the company responded and gave me a return number but now i would have to spend time and money to return in the end 16 wasted,51,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,excellent value and fast shipping cover is lightweight but perfect for covering two bikes instead of one highly recommended,19,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,i realize the price being so low that i would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine i did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike it does not since it does not fit over both tires the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit i have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable my tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike very misleading very disappointed,137,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,these boots are great i use them on my 153 foundation qh with big hooves and they fit perfect these are the only I have tried a dozen different kinds bell boots i can turn him out in that do not rub him they tend to last about 2 - 4 months of constant wear daily turnout and riding in wisconsin winter / spring before the rubber starts giving out and needs to be replaced but for the price and overall quality that does not bother me too bad the only other thing I am not thrilled with is why the blue are more expensive than green / red I have purchased both and the material / quality is the same but the green look just fine with my tack as well so nothing tragic,122,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,these work really well a little tough to pull over but i did it on anbar and a wedge shoe but once they are on they work great and you really do not have to take them off just flip them up to groom the leg and even if wet no parts of the boot are touching hair so it does not hold any moisture in,65,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,exactly as advertised fit my 17hh tb perfectly thanks,9,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,excellent choice they have been on a pastured horse who overreaches all summer to prevent him pulling off his shoes they have held up well update they lasted the entire 4 months i had the horse the extra large fit perfectly on a 17 hand warmblood with big feet,49,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,iove theof green it does not match the grass so easy to spot they were very easy to get to get pulled on over my horses shoes and hooves i would love to give 5 stars but length of boot is to short considering size i purchased and there is still a high potential for my horse toon his shoe and rip it off,67,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,fit great but i wish they stood up to turnout better after a few weeks the bottoms were chewed up and i had to toss them out can not complain too much considering the cost,34,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,these are lighter than another brand i tried but stayed on for a remarkably long time and better than expected a bit easier to pull over the hoof than the heavier ones,32,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,worst boot ever on my horse for 2 days and they are shredded do not buy,16,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,it is true to it is fit but does not last very long my horse tore it within a week of them being put on,24,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,good boots for long term use i doubled up for my mare that had corrective shoes,16,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,my mare is out more often than not she has been wearing these boots 24/7 for 8 months and they are just now looking like it is time for new boots she has access to a pond and loves mud so these boots have been tested,44,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,love thebut not sturdy or durable at all he ruined them in 2 days very flimsy,19,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,these boots did not even last one week the first one was shredded in just one day there was not even enough of these boots left for me to return them buying these was just like throwing money away,38,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,i put them on my tb and it rubed so bad that i had to get some other bell boot for him,22,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,i was pretty disappointed with thisthey are listed as hunter green and while the picture is a little brighter than hunter the boots themselves were closer to lime green they fit pretty well and were easy to get on and off but the material is flimsy and had small tears before the first week the only pluses are they were fit and they were cheap but i guess you get what you pay for would not buy again,80,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,they were too small and the size i ordered,9,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,lasted about a week do not recommend these for turnout they are a very thin rubber,14,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,super reasonable super tough using one pair in normal fashion over front hooves to protect his heels and another pair upside down on an older horse who tends to hit himself in his fetlocks with his front feet,37,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,used on my horse who steps on himself in the hind end to try to minimize damage to hoof / coronary band worked as hoped they lasted about 3 weeks and i wish the rubber was a little bit more sturdy for that reason they did not leave rub marks and were easy to put on and off I have used other brands since buying these and would probably go back to these if only because the rubber is malleable enough that i can actually pull them off if i needed to also a benefit is the blueis easy to see when he lost it in his large pen yes they trap a little mud but that is not unexpected and i did not have any significant problems with it word to the wise definitely buy from the amazon prime eligible seller as i initially went with the other seller and i cancelled that order because it was taking so long,157,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,protection is great the large covered heel and shoe perfectly on my 161 appendix gelding size 3 shoe but i have tried three pairs of these now all have ripped within a week even although it is hard to get on the really thick boots I am going back to those as they are the only type I have found to hold up to the stress of playtime in the pasture,70,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,my gelding has to wear these s 24/7 because he over reaches and pulls off his shoes and they hold up pretty well we go through a pair about every other month because he rips them from stepping on them can not complain although they are priced well i do not want to buy expensive ones if they are going to get destroyed from 24/7 wear i have a few pairs stored away in my tack box i always keep a few pairs on hand,82,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,love them have one pair on my horse now and they are doing great no rips on them yet and have had them on for a week so far so good,32,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,the large size is too small for a 15 hand horse,11,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,if you buy any trainer i would recommend this computer to train with it is easy to operate gives instant information not hard to setup and works well it is particularly useful if you track your workouts,35,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,for a device at this price i would not expect much just a consistent power reading for the effort i put in it does not even have to be correct or reflect short spikes in power to test this out i bought one and used it with my powertap the initial readings were pretty close but over the course of a one hour workout it drifted by about 30 watts for me as the fluid in the trainer heats up it gets easier and easier to spin while this is great for the ego it is not useful for training as the computer makes no adjustment for this even if the readings were wrong if they were consistently wrong it would still be a useful device as it is it is pretty useless i returned it,132,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,the directions are horrible I have hooked something like this up before and so i improvised it does not work i called customer service they responded quickly and tried to resolve problem they are sending me a new wire for it,40,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,goodpoorly designed the display is not appropriate for serious workouts the premise is that you can see your power output becuase the kinetic trainers are so accurate however while you are observing your power you can not see your cadence so you can not accurately maintain your rpm and power at the same time but both aspects are important when training i returned the product because it did not meet my needs,71,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,did not get far enough to see how this thing worked because installation was ridiculous with poor directions / instructions i consider myself pretty mechanically inclined but these directions were impossible to follow so rather than waste time and aggravate myself further I am returning this thing,43,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,this is the w model it does not do heart rate or altitude so no need for a chest strap like the wl model i bought it to use with my kinetics road machine and specialized hard rock bike it took a bit of time to figure out the placement for the sensors for speed and cadence but in the end it seems well laid out the manual is small and the pictures a bit hard to understand but the company was great and sent me a pdf version of the manual the most difficult to understand is the arrangement for the lap timers but those will not be of that much use for me just now and the rest of the functions seem to work well this unit was about the same price as the strada cc-rd300w wireless but has a larger display and includes cadance and power which i really wanted,151,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,this is not the easiest computer odometer to operate it functions well but is somewhat difficult to reset will need to spend more time with the operation manual,28,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,i was getting sporadic gaps with another manufacturers wireless model so i purchased this product to match the kinetic by kurt trainer plenty of included ties the install is pretty straight forward the wattage calculator is wonderful and there was plenty of cord slack for application on my cannondale hybrid solid product no complaints,54,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,i installed this unit and it works great the only after thought was if it would have came with the chest strap also it would have been 5 stars,29,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my son and he said that it worked as expected he was well satisfied with it,21,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,i concur with the reviews that describe this device as shoddy and poorly manufactured however i want to add that it is totally a misrepresentation to describe this as a power computer it does not really compute power what is does is take your speed and run it through a simple equation that derives your power as a function of your speed if you are expecting a device that does anything but give you a rough approximation of your power output by placing your speed into a quadratic equation with some regression coefficients derived from who-knows-where this is not it very deceptive product description good thing it is cheap,104,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,at first i would agree seemed like junk however everytime i called kurt kinetic they were extemely helpful and shipped me a new one mine kept shorting out and losing the display and info then might or might not come back on after i receive the 3rd replacement i saw that the use of an extention cord had been eliminated and a solid wire from computer to pickup was used instead that was it my computer works perfectly now for 50 bucks you can not go wrong it is extemely accurate and matches wattage with the other much more expensive offerings ie power tap and more great service from kk,108,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,very cheaply made readout is small buttons are loose wires are flimsy shocking contrast in quality when compared to the kinetic road machine trainer i bought it with should be included free with a 275 trainer in my opinion but it works just not worth 45 - 50 bucks be careful installing it as to not pull out the wires or crack the plastic tab that locks the computer on to the mount,71,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,this computer is a remarkable piece of junk everything on it is the cheapest possible grade the magnet broke in my hands when i tried to install it i used the magnet from an old cateye computer even the plastic zipties were dried and snapped the reset button on the computer itself sticks in the in position the mounting bracket does not hold the computer firm enough so when you press the display button the computer goes flying off the bike the battery only lasted 3 months the display turns rainbow colors at about 60 degree f but you get wattage and all other vital info for your workout so you need this thing my kurt kinetic rock-n-roll trainer is bomb proof i love it however this computer is the biggest hunk of junk I have ever used in my life everything about it is of the lowest quality but you need one so buy it kurt kinetic should tar and feather the guy who thought it would be a goodto put their name on this thing it is just shameful,179,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,i was looking for a good stopwatch to help me with my training and figured i would give this inexpensive product a go it was fairly simple to set and it worked well until i noticed that the clock was falling behind i reset it and slowly it fell behind again i went and bought a new battery and it still fell behind i am looking at it right now after reseting it for the last time a couple of weeks ago and it is almost 15 minutes behind with the clock being so off it makes me wonder how accurate the other modes are i either recieved a shody stopwatch or some reconfiguring needs to be done by the manufacturer update 09/02/2006 was cleaning out my desk and came upon my stopwatch do not ask me why i still have it i was delt another hard blow when i looked at the clock again it has not fallen behind this time no instead it is twenty minutes fast i am incredibly disturbed by this i believe i will go lie down and try to forget about this oh so traumatic experience,189,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,good stopwatch for the price it does feel like plastic and it does basic functions however feels that it can break easily,22,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,great for track and field these timers work great and are a bargain actually found they will work for several seasons on the same battery,25,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,works great no problems for our use not a professional stopwatch but good for everyday use would recommend good price,20,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought the sportline 240 stopwatch about 8 months ago it has always been a little funky specifically not responding when i hit one of the buttons now it periodically has the display go out it will come back on about 5 minutes later i have reseated the battery and ultimately replaced the battery but it still does not work consistently bottom line is that i can not recommend this watch to anyone,72,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought this product sportline econosport 240 as an impulse buy when checking out at a local sport store had i read the reviews on amazon i would have known better the very brief instructions which are printed on the container are unintelligible as reported by other reviewers the alarm seems to go off at random times and there is no obvious way to stop it i was hoping that the sportline website might have a manual with better instructions the web site says that the manual can be found on the website but i can not find it overall i think that the combination of a poor user interface and poor instructions is the worst i have ever seen on any product,122,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,super annoying beeping that you could not turn off until i disassembled the product and snipped cables inside to turn it off it worked well until it died just a few months after i got it waste of money,39,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,the stopwatch works seems accurate anyway but i can not set the time of day on this thing I have done exactly what the instructions are telling me i can switch between hours and minutes but i can not select anything to make the watch begin i really think there is something wrong with the watch i guess it does not matter but the watch should work,63,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i do not know how a company can sell such utter crap hit a button and it clicks twice starts and stops now i have to bang it against something hard to get the led to display this company does not deserve a penny of ours,45,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the first one i received had a defective left reset button no way to reset the count-up time i returned it and got a replacement which functioned perfectly i love amazon they even refunded the postage required to send back the defective unit,43,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,i use the stopwatch primarily for timing student presentations i have not had to change the battery once in over 5 years amazing,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,this one attempts to be a stopwatch clock alarm and calendar it can not do any of these functions well every one of these functions get messed up because of the haphazard mode button to switch between the clock and the stopwatch you have to go through the alarm set mode then the clock setting mode this causes you to set the alarm for 100am and to reprogram the time moreover it is not rugged enough to survive a long jog without getting messed up very annoying inaccurate and worthless,89,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,product is excellent and exceeded my expectations i would definately suggest recommend this product to anyone,16,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,in the instruction manual for this stopwatch it says chime is on when dashes appear above display chime is off when no dashes appear unfortunately the instructions are lying the alarm on this watch will go off regardless of dash situation there is absolutely no way to turn off the alarm if you are there to turn the alarm off at the same time every day then this watch is a decent purchase everything else on it works well,79,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the stopwatches lost their battery life within 1 - 2 weeks they constantly went off for no reason and it was not very easy to use the ones that did not die served their purpose,32,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,now that my elementary school aged girls are taking timed tests this has been great for timing their homework it is easy to use and seems to take a lot of abuse,32,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,this is such a great stopwatch it is so much fun to play with the timing is incredible and has features such as a clock and a calender it is a very easy using stopwatch and i love it,39,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,wow i just received this thigh toner and took it out of the box i thought it was broken but on second thought that is just how it comes cheap and flimsy it is basically a thick wire hangar covered in foam with a flimsy spring inside the center black plastic cover which pops off easily it does not have much tension and i do not recommend buying it even for the cheap price I had say it is worth around 199 at most I am sure there are sturdier and better designed products,91,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is really easy to use and it comes with an exercise photo guide and directions i started to notice a difference within the first 10 days and the best part is it only takes 90 seconds to do the recommended reps i love it,44,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like this product although i do not use it everyday because i have an awesome treadmill but when I am tired from work or just tired and do not want to use the treadmill for the day i can flop down on the bed turn on my favorite show and use it i saw a lot of reviews that it is uncomfortable so i was hesitant about getting it but i found that you just have to find the right position that is comfortable I shall work out laying on one side for about 10 minutes then flip to the other side of the bed and work out the other leg it is actually kept my theighs in shape a lot better than i thought it would,122,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,works well makes your thighs feel the burn would have given it 5 stars if it were made more heavy duty seems a bit flimsy and like it could break at any time but it has not i have used everyday for about 3 weeks and no problems at all and i can see a difference in my thighs already if your inner thighs need help this is a good product to use,74,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i enjoy this product my thighs are getting tighter and toner and my buns often ache and are feeling tighter,20,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this is not what i expected i read reviews and tooka chance anyways you get what you paid for it bends when closing i had my friend who weighed 120 pounds use it and it broke worthless,36,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i bought this for my friend she is 54 it does not fit her thigh length it is too awkward and unusable,21,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,just what i expected to use at home,8,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,arrived on time i use it while watching tv and i can feel the burn,15,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,seems to be cheap quality i am not a large person and it still feels too short and the cushion presses in easily and makes theuncomfortable to use i let my 20 year old daughter try it and she said the same thing not made well and hurts to use it not at all like the original thigh master,61,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it works well but sort of squeaks a little when using it,12,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,it was christmas in sept as i have missed thissooooo much i am so happy i can now do my exercises and keep it moving I am a senior so i must keep it moving thanks for all of your help,41,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this works really good it trims your thighs and hurts after use so you know if you feel the burn it working,22,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,product was a mess not as expected at all returned,9,13

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this used only be used by a woman does not have the support i need as a man so for the ladies great for a man i would get one with a lot more resistance,35,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this product does not work you can sit there for hours and you will never feel the burn i have resorted in taking my dog on longer walks do not waste your time or money on this product so not worth it,41,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this was horible the original thighmaster from suzanne sommers is ten times better i would highly reccommend spending more money for a better product,24,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,well i tried it out for about two weeks and even looked up online how to use this contraption but no results came through plus it looks kind of awkward when you use it in the public,37,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i have to wonder what some of the reviewers have been doing to theirs becausehad mine since 2010 and it is still very new looking and I have used it a lot it is awesome and you actually feel the resistance with this little device,44,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,what a great gadget it has toned my thighs a great deal but you have to be diligent i am a very active person and workoutand if you want to have great thighs i recommend the bally thigh toning kit great investment i rated a 5,48,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i had one of these 20 years ago when suzanne came out with it and i sold it lost it or donated it so i thought I had get a new one i got this one for a great deal here on amazon and i was worried about the quality but it does the trick and i love it,58,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,simply did the job no hype or gimmicks i wanted to firm up my inner thighs and this did the trick at half the price of it is competition,28,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,the bally total fitness thigh toner works well and it comes with a workout sheet it it great for the price,21,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like it it does what it says and i am 57 and have had no problems using it as it is supposed to be used i just did not like that it said it was out of the pink one for the lesser price so i bought this one and ended up with the pink one,56,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it really works i used it 10 minutes a day 3 times a week i just wish they can make it little stronger the black middle part brakes easilymine broke after 4 month of usage,34,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i thought i would like this gadget and it would be easy to operate I am not sure of it is effectiveness because after trying it i realized it was not for me,30,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was a little disappointed because it was flimsier than i expected but i did not pay much so it is ok it does do what it is intended for it slips off my knees sometimes but I have learner to hold it a certain way if you want something better than spending more money is the way to go i got what i paid for so i can not complain or rate low super fast shipping,72,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i use this several times a week it took some time to notice a difference but I am starting to get that defining line down the inner thigh I am always mad at supermodels for having the padding is a bit lacking but i push the u-shaped part down past the bony part of my knee and it works great without discomfort i love it,64,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,cons flimsy plastic over the spring came apart first thing plastic part that goes over the end of the wire inside the foam also fell off first thing at only 5 my thighs are too short for the thigh toner to fit right to do the outer thigh exercise when working the inner thigh have to either hang on to it or readjust after every squeeze it is off balance and twists from out from between my legs resistance is too low pros works good for the tricep squeeze and chest but still needs more resistance inexpensive but you get what you pay for goodin theory,116,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,very flimsy and low quality money wasted i had my suspicions when i ordered it and voila do not even bother,21,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,the shipping was fast and efficient the product itself is cheap and really does not work well it does bend like it states but it slips out of place with every move i would recommend to purchase something else that costs a little more but would not be a garage sale,52,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i have only used it twice for the thighs so can not really give it an honest review but it is great to use while watching tv i did try it for the arms but prefer to use a workout that has weights as it is uncomfortable i did feel the burn after the second time i used it so my guess is it will work over time,67,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,for what i paid it was good came in the mail quickly a simple and easy to use exercise equipment for a busy working mom,25,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,usually i read all the reviews before purchasing something and i did not when i bought this i wish i would have complete waist of money super cheap construction i should have bought the thigh master thought i would save the money wish i would have spent it,48,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i never got thismyself i think it is lost or somenthing so i can hardly say anything about the product the shipment sucks,24,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,the price is amazing usually is less than 20 sometimes you can get it for free as a gift,20,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i thought after reading all the review that surely this product would not be as bad as everyone is saying but unfortunatly it is i am 5 ft 115lbs so i am pretty small and not that strong and i felt like i was going to break it i had to hold it in place to keep it from wobbling around or popping out of place i am going to keep it because it did come with the ankel bands that i really did like but if you really really need a thigh master the bally thigh toning kit would def let you down sorry bally this one was a bad choice for you guys to make,116,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this device is only useful for training your inner and outer thighs and really not even good for outer i bought it because my gym does not have an abductor / adductor machine so i wanted to add that at home it is great for using in front of the television but you need to do a lot of reps to get results and remember you can not spot tone this like all muscle training exercises will build muscle in the areas you are working it is still important as part of a total exercise program for women,91,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like this toning kit and the band included is extra nice the only thing i do not like is that it does get a bit tender after extended use on the thigh sometimes i feel like I am gon na break it feels kind of wobbly and flimsy but all in all it is pretty useful use it long enough and it will wear you out,64,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,I have had and used this product for 5 months and it broke in half at the spring while i was using it this is a dangerous and very poorly made product,31,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this is essentially a foam covered wire hanger with a spring in the middle if you squeeze it between your knees it leaves bruises if you try to use it for pec exercises it flips out of your grasp because if has no balance you would be better off strapping a pair of cymbals to your knees and playing along with john phillip sousa marches to get your thighs into shape as you would be to try and tone your thighs with this piece of crap,86,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,1st strong strong strong rubber smell that goes on my pants and skin smell lasts a long time even after i washed my hands left it alone for months came back to it strong strong rubber smell still there 2nd this is very loose compare to other thigh shaper not tense enough to shape legs like a grandma wanabe thigh shaper 3nd i paid 11 bucks and my friend got a very good thigh shaper w no rubber smell at half of the price i paid do not buy this,90,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this is very cheaply made and not very sturdy I have used the original thigh master from suzanne summers and it is a lot better quality I am disappointed in my purchase i wish i would have gone with the real thing,38,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,very easy to use and you can pick it up and put it down whenever you want i use it sitting down due to my health problems of standing i use it for increased arm strength and also between my knees to strengthen these mussels too it is a great easy to use and yes i do recommend it as exercise equipment to use even when you just do not exercise,70,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,the thigh toner is really difficult to use and my legs are too short to be able to use it for my outer thighs by placing it behind my knees it is a cheap piece of equipment and the interior wires poke through the foam casing it is hard to keep the equipment in place to use it properly the bands are useful but you may as well buy them elsewhere instead of in this package note the bands are short and are made to wrap around your ankles they are not all-purpose resistance bands the water-squeezing belts are probably useless although i only used them once i mean really,108,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was pleased with the kit for the purchase price i especially enjoy the ankle bands and use those for thighs as well as therapy on my knee the thigh toner is a bit awkward when starting out but it definitely works,42,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this is a piece of garbage i just got this in the mail today i want to send it back but I shall have to pay more money just to return it and i will not be reimbursed the initial shipping fee this is the most cheap and does not work piece of garbage i ever ordered this thigh toner is flimsy and in no way can one excerise with this without having to make constant adjustment to hold it in place garbage this gets zero stars,84,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i really enjoy using this product and the results i am getting however quality of this brand left me disappointed the cushion around arms is not thick enough i can feel the wire so unless you wear thick leggings be prepared to get bruises also the spring system is ready to crack i have only had it less than a month and use it once a day having had same equipment before but different brand i can safely say try another brand,82,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is great for a quickie or if you are on the go i keep it in the car it can be kind of awkward sometimes but just reposition some and you should be fine,33,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i find this product to be hard to use it keeps shifting around and by the time you readjust it between each rep it gets frustrating the arm excercises are easier because you can keep control but the leg excercises are when it shifts constantly i would not recommend it to my friends,51,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this thing is cheaply / poorly made i wish i would of found a different one difficult to use without it alipping everywhere or flinging,23,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,if you look at the picture it appears that the loops almost completely come around close to the center with rounded edges this is not the case the loops are much shorter with the rod stopping about half-way to the hinge they are too too long for me and are very uncomfortable with the squared corners the padding is also insufficient and the hinge is fairly loose so does not provide nearly the difficulty it should to be beneficial overall a very disappointing product although it does work if you were quite new to exercise and needed little resistance and were at least about 58 it might work alright but you would soon exercise past it is usefulness and need something sturdier,121,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i think it works awesome the only thing is that for some reason the little rubber caps on the ends of the metal that keep the metal from tearing the foam keep falling off i love it although just a few minutes everyday for about a week now and i can already notice a slight difference on my way to my old jeans again,64,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i am not happy with this purchase these are not well made and there is a fear that they will snap apart while in use this is not what i wanted and i doubt it will be used very disappointed,40,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,now first i will say that i do get a little bit of a burn from this but this device is constructed with extremely flimsy material the plastic in the middle that covers the spring gaps and pinches when you squeeze most annoying of all however is the fact that the interior wire does not go all the way around the loop if you look at the picture the interior support wire only goes about an inch down after it makes it is second turn the rest is just foam this means that pressure is not distributed evenly and you end up with one end digging into your thighs basically if i knew what i know now i would have bought some resistance bands instead this is not worth the money,128,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,the firm tension of the bally thigh toning kit is very good for people who are beyond the beginner stage of exercising who want to develop firm thigh muscles,29,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this thighmaster is pretty good for the price it seems like it could be a little bit stronger but overall i like it now if i can just use it,30,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this arrived fast and on time it works I have used it every day since I have received it but it is a little flimsy it sometimes moves a little twisty when I am using it but so far it is held up,39,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,sellers description of thiswas accurate up to a point not a bad seller just a bad product theis very poorly made and cheap mine broke within a week and is so cheap that it is not worth the trouble to return you get what you pay for spend a little more money and get a better product,60,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,the bally total fitness thigh toner is a great exercize product that works quite well i recommend it if you want something affordable to exercize with,26,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i have had mine for well over a decade and use it when i need to and it is great to use at the office since I am in a cubicle i love mine and recommend it for ease of use,40,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this product is cheaply made so much so that it is impossible to use if it was not such a pain to get back into it is box i would have returned it bottom line save your money,37,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this thigh toner is just as everyone else has reviewed it cheaply made but with that said it gets the job done I have felt the burn while using it but only as long as my feet are together from the get-go also make sure that you hold it upright while using it it will be more comfortable it takes some fidgetting but i finally figured out the right spot where it did not hurt my inner thighs / knees,74,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is a bit uncomfortable at first to use but once you get the hang of it it is easy havnt had much actual thining in the thigh area yet but i have just started but i can feel the burn so i know it is starting to work,47,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i have actually used it for my thighs and arms long term use works,14,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,I have probably had it for a year it may be a cheaper version compared to other thigh masters but this gets the job done it is comfortable to me and does not bruise like some other review said i like it,39,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was a little nervous about this purchase but i really love it it is not the best made and it can be a little awkward but when you get use to it it really works,35,67
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i really like this little thing it is not nearly as uncomfortable to use as i thought it would be after reading some other reviews i do not find it uncomfortable at all actually it is small so that really helps me because i have virtually no space at home i can even feel some of my muscles in my lower abs getting worked by the way i am 125lbs and 33 years old and have 4 children i am very active and have always exercised in different ways throughout my life i like the way the thigh toner works and am very happy with my purchase,105,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i got this in a week ago and I am surprised that there are not a larger percentage of positive reviews it is holding up perfectly so far provided me the extra resistance i needed is comfortable to use and was definitely the right price the outer thigh exercise can be tricky to position but once you get it in the right spot it works perfectly i would recommend this to anyone wanting to add that little extra to their workout regimen,79,69
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,waste of money the original was much better very flimsy and unstable would cost more to return than it is worth,20,70
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,works great better than i thought it would every other day i do about six sets of fifty and within a week i had firmer tighter and stronger thighs firming up the butt area also,35,71
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i use this thigh toner everyday 200 squeezes a day 6 days a week making it a total of about 1200 squeezes a week this is not a lie i am about to become a physical education teacher next year after i graduate from college and my goal is set a perfect example of staying fit and eating at all times for children who are being mislead with high sugar drinks and eating tons of junk food everyday i always take a break after doing 50 squeezes for about 2 minutes and i go back on the toner again and do another 50 easy as pie,105,72
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i just received this product in the mail took it out of the package and i could not believe how poorly it was made it is very flimsy and flies right out from whatever position i have it in i would not recommend this to anyone please save your money and go with something else,53,73
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,let us face it the quality of this thing is super cheap it feels flimsy and definitely not the quality of the original brand that being said it gets the job done and is inexpensive if i wanted quality i would have paid more i feel the burn and am sore after i use it so i do not really care that it feels cheap works very well,67,74
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like this product it is mostly comfortable and easy to use when you are watching tv or reading or something it is good for mindless exercise,25,75

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this ptoduct is great for toning the legs thighs and buttocks been wanting one for awhile now i have it and love it so much the resistance bands and thigh wraps to help she had excess water are also a bonus as i did not know it came with it,49,78
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this product did not live up to my expectations i am truly disappointed in it it is cheap and does not work that well if you are going to buy this product look for a little more expensive model,37,79
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i love these things my mom always had one that i used and she just got me this for my birth day it really works when i slack off and do not use it i can tell the difference it makes i recommend for anyone looking to get rid of their problem leg areas,52,80
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i just received this product today and tried it out it is rather uncomfortable and the middle plactic thing fell apart imediately it still works but it is anoying to have plastic popping out also the outer thigh exercise was pretty impossible it is just too big for that exercise but then again i am 52,53,81
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for when you try it out it never stays in place it it difficult to find a comfortable position to use it when it will not even stay in place,34,82
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this product was cheaply made and not enough resistance i had an original thighmaster for many years but it finally broke so i thought I had try this one i ended up sending it back even although the postage fees hardly made it worth the effort do not bother,47,83
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i found this product to be quite charming electric blue pads cute but flimsy i had trouble holding it in place while doing the thigh and arm workouts if you are looking for a good toner keep looking maybe if you are very petite and have short legs you might be able to work it but i was not i m 57 and have long legs it was just too awkward to do not a fan,74,84
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,very simple to use lots of uses for legs and arms enjoy it,13,85
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i bought this because I am in shape overall but i have some trouble spots around my thighs this toner is super easy to use and i can definitely feel it working while i use it it is not a tool for weight loss but i do expect to see toning results in my thighs and legs,55,86
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i used the product every other day for 5 1/2 months and then the coil broke in two waste of money,21,87
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this thigh master is not the best to use at all it is difficult to find the right position to be in to get the best out of it is use not that great of a purchase at all,38,88
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,it is ridiculous to me that people complain about the cheapness of this product um heelllooo it is only 1000 i love it not only is it inexpensive but i think it works great it is convenient I am only 51 and have no problems with the size the resistance is good and it is not falling apart on me i do not know maybe if people worked with it gently slowly and steadily it would not be falling apart on them,73,89
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,bally total fitness thigh toner good price too good fast ship but very low quality the plastic case over the spring falls off with any use the foam padding is way too thin even for already toned legs it will bruise you very easily spend a little more this is just too cheap to be any good at all obviously an attempt to make a few bucks on the bally name we thought it might be decent from bally nope,79,90
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i would say this product is not good for small built ppl I am 410 and it is very uncomfortable to use it as thigh toner it does better job as tricepts toner so not what i expected also as others mentionned this exerciser is pretty cheaply made plastic parts are falling apart pretty easily so I am happy that i paid for this piece of junk just 10 bucks does not do any job in my case at all,75,91
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this really works great for arm exercises it does the job for thigh and butt it is just cheaply made and flimsy it does work although for the cheap price it is worth it,33,92

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i purchased the thigh toner really because i have a desk job and wanted to do some unnoticable exercises at my desk i really think my inner thighs have toned in no time but i also do it when i am watching tv or whenever i am sitting down at home i would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick tone for their inner thighs,66,96
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,not at all as good as suzane summers thigh master my wife reordered one of those bally unit weak and hard to use,24,97
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this little thing is so great i have only had it a few days and it is great i was searching for something i can do while watching tv in the little spare time i have and this little wonder is great i can use it for my arms and my thighs it is worth it you can actually feel it working it was a little scary getting it out of the box but as long as you are careful and follow the directions on the box and open it up slowly it will not spring up at you,98,98
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i have had a thigh toner before which i really liked i expected this one to be just as good it is too small and flimsy it needs to be repositioned after each rep the spring in the middle keeps becoming exposed it pinches it is not quite symmetric which makes it really awkward to use boo,57,99
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i recommend and sell this product to my nutritional clients they are quite pleased with their little hip-side coach thisalso scored well according to consumer reports,28,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i have been wearing a pedometer and counting my steps for over 4 years and this one is by far the most accurate i have had you do have to be careful not to hit the reset button accidentally but it is great to be able to glance down and check your progress without having to open it up,58,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i am a casual walker and found theeasy to use but both of the pedometers i bought mine and my husbands were lost within the first few weeks because the clip is not secure enough I am buying one more and this time I am going to use an extra safety strap,51,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,at first this pedometer seemed like a nice design with practical layout of controls and display but this is not the case i found three serious problems with this device 1 reset button placement and sensitivity result in frequent accidental resetting ofcount 2 the number display starting going after only three weeks with the single digit numerals gone in four weeks 3 plastic belt clip is very weak and broke in five weeks,75,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i have had four different pedometers sportline digiwalker omron and the freestyle tracer and the tracer was by far the worst the reset button noted by another reviewer has a hair-trigger response it resets way too easily and i have had the same problem with the pedometer resetting itself several times in a day i also wrote several times to the company to ask them about this and they never responded so all in all do not do business with freestyle how consumer reports rated this pedometer a best buy is beyond me the day the freestyle broke all i could think was good now i get to find a better one and in case you are wondering of the four the omron which was rated above freestyle but not a best buy has been a dream come true,139,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i could not be much more disappointed with thisthe reset button is ultra-sensitive and zeroizes several times daily so that i never get a chance to see exactly how far I have walked,33,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,this product did not hold up well i found that the numbers began to gradually disappear one little line at a time leaving it very difficult to read it is inexpensive but tracks all steps and did not discern between aerobic and non-aerobic walking like some of the newer pedometers do when it was working which it did for a few months it was moderatly accurate seeming to come within about 5 to 10 of actual steps taken it is inexpensive but i really would look at other brands models,91,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i bought the freestyle because consumer reports recommended this particular pedometer however i am ready to toss it out the window the reset button is much too large exposed and easy to use you hold it down for 3 seconds i have found that during my daily activities it gets reset without my knowledge this has happened more times than i can count and is very frustrating until the reset button is redesigned i would not purchase this product,79,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i have been using my pacer pro for years unfortunately i lost it and will be replacing it with another pacer pro small in size but big on perfomance will definitely buy again,33,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,this is the most accurate pedometer I have ever had i do have to be very careful when putting on my seatbelt and more so that i do not bump the button and clear all the info this has happened more than once and it ticks me off good product for the price,50,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,overall great product the belt clip cracked after a few days of use but still the pedometer is a greatand very accurate,24,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i did not like this pedometer it resets often so i never did get an accurate or even close count of my steps in a day or even in an hour i notified the company who i purchased it through on amazon and they admitted that this was a draw back and that i should try wearing it on my side instead of in front this may work i do not know i am using a different one the company i purchased the freestyle tracer blue pedometer from did ultimately through amazon offer to allow me to exchange the pedometer i do not want to go to that much trouble,108,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,this pedometer is advertised as having a sturdy belt hook it does not the hook broke after about 5 uses other than the flimsey hook it worked ok now it is useless,32,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,the freestyle pacer pro pedometer is great it is small lightweight and has a cover so that buttons are not accidentally pressed the display is easy to read it has several functions but i only use it for counting steps i have tried others but came back to this one,50,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i chose the freestyle tracer because of a best buy recommmendation by consumer reports i have not been disappointed the controls are easy to see and use I have had it for six weeks and have not had any problems with it great buy,41,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,freestyle tracer pedometer was rated quite highly by consumer reports they were pitted against many other pedometers in construction ease of use accuracy and longevity on each of these tracer received the highest ratings many of the other pedometers cost two or more times the cost of this pedometer and did not perform as well after reviewing many comments i purchased one myself i have not been even remotely disappointed in my tracker i find it to be spot on accurate the design and feel of wear is sound and with the price it was the absolute best i could have hoped for i wear it daily tracking my steps and calories and distance into my fitness program if you are looking for a top-notch pedometer buy this one,129,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i noticed that my other pedometers were not catching all the steps that i made switching to this one greatly improved the accuracy of my day count the only disadvantage is that occassionally the pedometer will reset itself to zero this is due to the fact that the reset button is not covered by anything and may be pushed if i bend over or run into something,67,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i initially chose the freestyle tracer because of a very positive review from consumer reports it was in fact designated their best buy in the may 2007 roundup of pedometers the display is easy to read and the controls are very easy to use unfortunately the buttons are not protected with a covering so my counted steps were reset several times when a seat belt pressed the reset button for the required two seconds the belt clip is made of plastic and broke when i bumped the pedometer on a door frame I am afraid i can not recommend this product at all,101,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,a close 2nd place for the best pedometer I have owned fairly easy to set up and very easy to use,20,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i ordered this because it had an excellent rating i must have gotten a lemon it was very inaccurate i am used to using a pedometer and was careful to fasten it properly to my belt but half the time it failed to register steps after a few months of use the labels on the various buttons were rubbed off,60,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,pedometer works safety leash broken asked for replacement never recieved reply,14,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i love my new freestyle tracerpedometer i read about in consumer reports and knew it was the right one for me i ordered it it came very quickly and programmed very easily some people hook it on their waistband or belt i wear mine in my sock i never realized how much walking i actually do doing the day this pedometer checks my steps miles calories burned and more it is super i highly recommend it cookie montgomery,79,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i bought this pedometer so i could do the 10000 steps program i ordered it around christmas so i expected it to be late the invoice had the pedometer highlighted as well as the safety leash there was no safety leash trying to reach customer service at heart rate monitors was difficult i was holding on the phone at the same time i was holding for a rep online i must have wasted 30 minutes waiting it took them 3 weeks to send the leash customer service would get a 0 in my book the pedometer itself is very sensitive it is very easy to somehow reset the pedometer if you are going on a walk and want to know how far it is i suppose the pedometer would work fine but if you are doing the 10000 steps program and wearing it all day long during regular activities it will some how reset itself I am careful when i use the restroom that i do not touch the button i do not wear my purse on that side so it does not some into contact with the pedometer and the thing still resets itself very frustrating,193,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i like the size the screen is easy to read it is sturdy,13,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i simply bought these so i could easily detach my keys so when i drop my car off at the mechanic or go into the gym i think they are great-they came in a variety of colors and sizes i obviously do not think they will hold up if you were using them for more heavy duty purposes but for smaller things they are built well i am happy about my purchase,71,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,2.0,negative,cheap but get what you pay for somehow the clip came open and i lost what was on it would not recommend unless you use it to hold a piece of yarn,31,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,these are the worst mini-biners I have ever had the quality is less than what you might get at the dollar store the spring of one of them was broken when i got it the other one is so loose that you have to guide it closed,46,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,2.0,negative,seemed like a good deal until i got it and found that the small biners really are so small that they can not be used for anything i think one of them also broke quite quickly,35,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,if you purchase this you will receive only 2 of the smallest ones i contacted amazon and they are supposed to be working on the problem you do not receive what is described in the details,36,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i ordered this and got 1 pack of 2 the smallest size in this 5 set contacted amazon they responded quickly and were very nice and they said they shipped out another order supposedly this one with all 5 nope got the same 2 same size and all i thought ok maybe this is my fault i looked in the description no i was not wrong you are supposed to receive 5 biners in 3 different sizes so where are they I am not going to hold my breath,87,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i had the same experience as the reviewer m gianola 5 biners are clearly shown in the product picture and when my package arrived i had received a set of two small biners not sure why this happened but buyer beware,41,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,they work great as they are supposed to a variety of biners is always good to have in your vehicle or tool box,23,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,great little biners they arrived a day early and they are exactly what i expected i was not able to choose abut the two i got were a nice metallic cobalt blue,34,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,now i would not trust these to go rock climbing obviously but this is a great assortment of sizes for home or office use I have found them very handy in attaching some of my pets dishes or food bags to things without pockets,42,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,the biners are working out great to use to hold my keys and make a key tree to hold multi-sets of keys,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i purchase this package expecting to receive 5 carabiners multipack as per the picture instead i received only two small 15 carabiners instead of 5 this is a ripoff,31,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i bought these to clip things on my backpack that i need handy access to they will not hold a lot of weight but they are pretty handy for light weight duty i also keep one of the tiny ones on my keychain to clip my keys to my purse strap belt loops and more,52,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,do what they are designed to do reasonable price for this may good selection of sizes obviously not for heavy use mostly for keys and more,25,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,cool little mini-biners are handy for about everything i keep them on my keys on my backpack and on my hennessy hammock they shipped fast i just wish i could pick the coler,33,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,you only get two of them not the entire package the first one i used broke within 5 minutes just from being opened and closed,25,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,i used these carabiners to replace some other mini-carabiners they are good quality for the price they are notbearing,20,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i was looking for a smaller option for keys these are definitely small if that is your goal these are for you the spring action is not as strong as i would like but that may be the trade-off for the size it works hopefully it holds up in the long-term,49,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,goodbut the biners were red and not blue as in picture works great as a keychain to help seperate keys as needed,24,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,i bought these carabiners to use while snow or sand camping to attach my deadman anchors to the normal tent stake postion as quick and easy as possible these are the perfect size and weight for my use and I am sure they would make a great key chain but beware they are very small so if you want something more robust you will have to spend teh money,67,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,i love these i label them with silver marker and the kids love all the events they can participate in at the birthday parties,24,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,love them they are perfect for our racing group price was good and delivery was fast,16,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,size of trophy in photo was very misleading actual product was very small,13,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,they are exactly how they look in the pic awesome,10,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,they worked great for the prizes we needed one arrived broken thus the 4 star but was easily glued back together as the top had separated from the base would purchase again if needed for prizes,36,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,they did what they were supposed to do we gave them out as joke awards at my daughters 5th grade picnic the base will hold an address label very nicely so you can print out a name good price the kids seemed to like them it is been a few months and my daughters has not broken yet a few did arrive broken although hence the missing star so buy more than you need although super glue will fix them,78,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,there were many broken trophies it was a good thing i ordered extras i ordered 6 packages and there were 10 broken ones i had to repair a couple with a glue gun in order to have enough for the group,41,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the description made it seem like the main part of the trophy was 4 instead of the total height being 4,32,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,trophies themselves were nice downside a third of them arrived broken i had to use hot glue to put them back together as i needed to use them better packaging is suggested esp at the cost,36,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,they are super cute only 11 came in the pack i thought it was 12 then out of the 11 4 came broken i took a picture but for whatever reason it will not let me upload the picture disappointed,40,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,great little trophy decently made did not fall apart or arrive broken used for an ugly christmas sweater contest perfect for it is use,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,definitely a noveltyexactly what i wanted,8,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,great for the price i saw some reviews about broken trophies but all of my 12 trophies arrived intact,19,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,just as stated arrived in time no problems,8,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,the trophies were exactly what i expected when buying a dozen for 5 bucks except that out of the 12 only 7 of them were still intact by the time they got to me five of them had been completely snapped at the neck where the cup meets theif i needed more than 5 of them i would return them for refund or replacement of the 7 that did make it in one piece they are what you would expect for being so inexpensive plastic throughout with some inconsistencies in the manufacturing process so there are little blemishes here and there and the necks do seem solid for something so small / cheap so it is kind of surprising that 5 of them came broken my recommendation is that if you need 12 of them order 2 dozen or find a different option,142,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i am very upset with this product do to the fact that i purchased 7 dozen and 20 of the trophys are broken now i am trying to find additional items due to poor product,37,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,the trophies work for what i needed them for unfortunately i ordered 4 packages and a total of 5 of them were broken when they arrived,26,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,as many others state many of the trophies arrived broken we chose to order these mainly since we only needed a few and knew some would arrive damaged now some would say if we knew that then we can not rate it down well just because you know something is poor quality does not make it less so this is mainly to keep letting people know problems have not been fixed expect many of them to arrive broken if you only need a few you are good if you need them all pick them up at a local party store,97,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i ordered the 12 piece and only 8 were in one piece an additional one broke after being set upright i ordered for my 6 year old and he was disappointed will not suggest this to anyone yes i can glue back together but i should not have to for a paid product should have gone to the dollar store,59,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,every single trophy was broken and they were so cheap and ugly that i could not even fix them i hated this product and i hope no one ever buys these small awful plastic pieces of junk,36,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,good small 3 inch tall trophies perfect for rewarding toddlers after they finish a race or clean up their room and more excellent value,23,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,cheap plastic trophies perfect for birthday parties and more if you are looking for high quality and durability these are not what you are looking for but served my needs perfectly one arrived broken so plan accordingly if you need the exact amount in the package by ordering in time to get replacements if necessary,53,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i bought this for my sons cars inspired birthday and out of the box 4 were broken during the party more broke dissapointed in the quality,26,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,four out of 12 arrived broken they will not last my students receiving them as i intended to use them they are going back,23,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,after reading some of the reviews i was hesitant to order these however all of my trophies arrived in perfect shape and they look great i added a gold foil label to them for the award and they were perfect for our class reunionawards,46,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i got 12 very small trophies they break very easily i broke couple of them right after i opened the package,21,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,i like these little trophy replicas quite clever a swell way to grant a kudo and friends can start a collection add a touch of the i am the winner to the one who receives this for performance above and beyond,40,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,these little trophies were a perfect reward for timed tests in math i just printed an aavery label and stuck it on the kids loved them,26,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,ordered a set to give out themed trophies at a party i was hosting were a big hit make sure you have a label maker of some kind to mark the trophies sharpie did not turn out great,37,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,these arrived on time but half of them were broken off the base and one was completely broken there were exactly 12 in the package made in china,28,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,these little gifts are corny but fun i may buy more and pass them out to other students in my classes,21,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,i ordered these for my sons 3rd birthday party i did not expect them to be high quality but at least not break or arrive broken in my bag of 12 there were at least two broken and the rest seemed like they would easily break once in a kids hand returning and buying a better quality,57,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,threw an award ceremony for work and ordered 2 dozen of these they are small-ish but really fit my needs printed labels for the award categories and placed them on the base only one broke during shipment which was better than i expected i would get these again if the situation called for a trophy,55,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,1.0,negative,this thing is deeply misrepresented on here it is not the companies fault as i did not read the reviews prior to purchase to find out that this product is simply a bait and switch in the photos it looks like cast iron even in the description they say it is seasoned how do you season cheap pop metal seasoning is usually a sign of cast iron for the price you pay about 25 you should be receiving a cast iron lid given that most cast iron skillets this size are around 50 75 rip off,93,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,wish it was cast iron but it gets the job done and price is right,16,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,fits great on the bayou classic 20-inch cast-iron skillet,9,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,the matching skillet went back due to poor quality so the lid followed and went back to the seller shipping back cost about half of the lid price a solution for people who look for a huge lid like that will be to look for mexican stainless steel comal 50 mm will be 19685 inches,54,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,what has a pan skillet without a lid perfect,8,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,2 stars for the cheap knob that comes with the lid i barely tightened it and the threads stripped useless and the inner core is cheap plastic and will not tolerate heat i will purchase an all metal drawer knob that matches if i can find one i do not understand why they do not just go quality all the way i like the product and small thing like that gives me reason to question their quality,74,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,a perfect mate for the 18 iron skillet rounds things out and adds usefulness,14,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,1.0,negative,if i could I had give it no stars totally misrepresented by the picture looks like cast iron did not read the reviews I am a dummy not even worth the trouble to send it back paid 26 to learn a lesson do your research wanted a lid for my bayou classic 20 cast iron skillet which is great by the way did not think will not do that again,54,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,very pleased a good addition to the 20 skillet,9,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,the lid does not fit the skillet well,8,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,1.0,negative,i was expecting something better heavier better quality what i got was a tin lid not worth 10oo dlls not worth sending it back,28,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,it almost fits the 20 skillet it will work,9,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,product came as it said it would also fits perfect into tthe unit came earlier than said a a a,20,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,great for the pan that i bought for it was able to cook for a lot of people with it,20,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,the pan lid was great but the plastic knob fell off the top other than that it was great i just added a steel cabinet knob and it has been great for many years now a,36,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,the lid works well and fits well it serves double duty at home the kids like to use it as a pretend shield i posted a video on you tube it is titled 20 lumberjack skillet,36,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,this lid is not cast iron it is made of a very light metal i bought it along with the 20 inch cast iron skillet when i found the skillet to be warped and sent it back i had to pay shipping to send this back so not only was it a cheapi had to pay to get rid of it next time i will be sure that myis from a different company and a better quality,81,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this sleeping pad is not the one in the picture the pad is actually green and made of foam making it thin and cheap however the price is right so if you are only looking for level ground to sleep on this is fine if you want some cushion spend the extra,53,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,picture nor description matched what received in mail it was hard to obtain authorization to return as well,18,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,got this pad and it is nothing more than a piece of rolled up foam 3/8 thick there is not any cover or straps like the picture shows this product might be usefull to put under a real matt that you want to protect but an old cushion from a couch would work much better for the price it is a real rip-off,63,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i used this sleeping pad on a camping trip in the smokey mountains it was easy to use and kept my sleeping bag warm and dry it needs a little careful handling although as it is not fire retardant and scratches easily,41,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,received this inflated opened valve and air swooshed in and was shocked it was only 3/4 inch high when fully inflated thought oh great this is going to kill my 50ish year old back completely shocked when it is compact construction supported my frame on hard floor w / sleeping bag without making my sore perfect this is going with me on a 3-day 60 mile walking event in august great product,69,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great especially for the low price a great source of closed-cell foam,12,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,not at all what i was expecting the product is like insulation foam kinda crunchy not like the soft foam i was expecting this may work if you are doing a relaxed camping trip with your family but i was planning to use it on a backpacking trip the foam is quite stiff so i doubt you would be able to roll it up again and tightly pack it i was planning to return thebut the return shipping fee is almost the price of the product itself so now I am stuck with a sheet of insulation foam i do not know what to do with,107,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,ok so i read the reviews and ordered it anyway as i simply wanted to cut it up and use it as packing material for shipping my bicycle however it is not even up to the quality of what i expected for this purpose laughably bad,45,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,really cheap it is nothing but a thin sheet of light closed cell foam like you would get for packaging with no ties would not do much for comfort i use an air mattress for camping and this does suffice as a thermal insulator still i feel like i got 75 cents worth of packaging for the price would not buy again,60,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,cheap and slippery you get what you pay for,9,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great foam indeed lots of reviews state that this foam is horrible for camping and they are probably correct but this foam is perfect for larping the foam is sturdy enough to survive beatings and is soft enough to hit people with i have made 20 weapons and 1 suit of armor and the foam has never failed me yet it might not serve it is purpose for camping but for larping no foam exceeds it,75,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it is not an air bed for someone that needs a bit of cover on the ground it works just fine,20,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,good quality comfortable but not sure how durable it will be my daughter used it for camp sleeping in a sleeping bag on the ground seemed to work for her but do not think it would work well outside of a tent directly on the ground,45,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this was not at all as expected it is a thin white mat and does not help protect against the cold hard ground at all you need two of these at least to cushion you at all,37,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,way too thin to be worth the money do not purchase,11,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,the price is very good the only downside to this mat is there are no straps to keep it rolled and it is a bit difficult to roll this one tightly minor inconvenience to not have these things in order to pay a much cheaper price,46,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this is bubble wrap i am appalled that coleman put their name on this product,15,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i thought this was going to be similar to the old boy scout style pads which were truly foam but this is nothing more than packing material it almost seems like the outside layer is going to tear when rolled / folded i bought this for a child to use and it really is not sufficient padding / durability the ridgerest pads for a few bucks more are a much better choice for cheap kids pads,71,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,arrived just as promised all description true to form,9,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this pad iis just a sheet of packing material what a hilarious joke coleman is playing on the public,19,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i use this as an underlayment when hammock camping and it is great it does not seem very strong so I had waver before using on the ground but in a hammock it is great it provides a little stiffness but also deforms nicely to the shape of the hammock if you like your bedroll to flatten the hammock out this is not the pad for you it is also incredibly light weight i wish it rolled up a little tighter but that is a pretty minor quibble,81,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not really what i was expecting i feel like it is the same stuff they pack electronics in not very high quality i was thinking it would be a thicker foam but it is more like a bubble wrap,37,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this is the cheapest flimsiest mat possible it is the low quality type of plastic normally used for packing around tvs and such would not recommend or buy again,29,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,just go to the store and buy some foam basically that is all that is to this not worth it,18,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,my grandson used it twice already on his boy scout trips and loves it,14,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,cheap packing foam let me repeat cheap packing foam it was 9 bucks so I shall live with it i guess i would not be happy had i paid 15 for this junk coleman should be embarrassed,34,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,best deal around for foammaterial I have made many a winter-camping accessory from these pads,16,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it is literally a piece of foam wrap like you would use when moving dishes or other fragile items even at this low price it still annoyed me when i opened the box it will definitely be going back,39,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i was not expecting much but this is worse than the ozark 6 brand you can get at walmart i did not think you could get more basic than the ozark brand but i was very wrong,35,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,excellent for my purpose padding for the rifle ammo boxes cuts down on tip damage and rattling,17,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great product does the job it is expected to do fast shipping as well,14,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,came a couple day ago but i will not be using until spring,13,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,thisis just great placed it on tufted coach and under a quilt it is has a very comfortable place for one to rest or sleep also great to change infant,32,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,simple synthetic mat easy to roll and kept us warm,10,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,it is not the old true blue closed cell it is more aqua and has a different texture and feel but it does the same thing i do not think that it is as good a heat retainer as the older closed cell but that is a feeling and i have no proof that this is the case,56,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,used this pad to make boffing swords it worked great and is withstanding a lot of usage,17,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,this is the best money I have spent camping i used these on my air mattress and we never got cold once i can not say anything bad about these I have been freezing cold before with out anything on the air mattress and after these i will not the best to stay worm if you have an air mattress i will never go camping with out these again well worth the money only one con is what to do with them when your done with them their not easily stored but that is not bad at all,94,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,unfortunately these mats are pretty low quality however are cheap so i guess you get what you pay for,19,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it is a piece of foam not sure what else there is to say i put this under the foyer of my tent when camping so when i kneel down my knees do not get wrecked by sticks rocks and such,39,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,very thin reminds me of packing cushion not very comfortable the worest is trying to store and travel with it does not come with anything to keep it rolled up,30,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,hard to believe that something is still made in the united states that being said i bought this with the forethought to cut it up for padding between my camera lenses while in storage containers for that purpose it worked great and i gave it 5 stars on the other hand i am big into the outdoors and if you want this for camping it is cheap and will not insulate you to any degree of comfort do not be cheap with your sleep get a good pad this is not it it would be ok as an added layer of foam but that is about it,103,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it is literally a piece of garbage i do not really know who uses this camp pad in camping a lot of better options at almost the same price,27,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i was a little disappointed in how budget this was when it arrived but i got to use it this past weekend for the first time and it did great stayed put in my hammock and if I had roll off it or scoot myself away from it i could notice the temp difference so this definitely did it is job I shall use it until it falls apart then upgrade to an inflatable,71,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,exactly what i needed foam to use as an insulator,10,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,very bulky cheap not worth taking on hike,8,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,we used this as padding for a knights armor worked perfectly,11,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,it is basically just thick packing foam it will do as far as getting you directly off the ground but you would probably be better off spending a little extra for one of the nicer pads they should probably post better photos,41,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,perfect for my sleeping bag when used with an inflatable protects the inflatable foam from rocks and more no chemical odor,20,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i would not buy again even although it was inexpensive to thin,12,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this mat is terrible it makes me ashamed for what the coleman brand has become it is basically a sheet of packing material no one would want to sleep on this,31,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this is probably the cheapest of cheap sleeping pads there are as many have stated this is little more than a piece of foam shipping mat i purchased it to take for my dog to sleep on during a backpacking trip i bought it because it was cheap and light weight when i received it i could not believe how thin and stiff it was does not even compare to a thermarest or any other camp mat for that matter i cut it down to fit the dog and brought it along i felt terrible for the dog for making him sleep on it and it is never coming on a trip like that again spend the extra money this seems like something more suited for an arts and crafts project or use as packing material than a sleep support mat,138,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,it was fine just the size was big enough,9,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,the picture is a bit misleading the actual product is a large rectangle of what appears to be a packing foam of some sort while it really seems to take theoff anything hard underneath you i can not help but feel like i might have been better off with the stansport alternative which is slightly smaller and rolls up better with built-in straps,64,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,arrived as listed seems okay have not used it for sleeping while camping,12,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,not what i expected it is only a thin piece of foam no good for camping the ground at my camp site was not rocky but it was hard it hurt my hip bone to lay on my side,40,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,i do not use it for camping but it would make a good camping pad it is impervious to moisture light it is thin but that is the name of the game,28,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,completely different material than what was ordered too thin and flimsy would not order again i would not recommend this for anything as other companies make a sturdier thicker and more cushioned material this is more like packing peanuts in a sheet the product sent was also not the coleman brand but a cheaper brand,54,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this pad is much thinner and seems more temporary than what i expected i definitely have buyers remorse not worth 10,21,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,this worked perfect on the camping trip i took light weight and easily stowed would recommend for those going hiking or roughing,22,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it was way thinner than i expected i am a wildland fire fighter and this is not meant for actual camping,21,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i wanted a thin pad to use for a product and I have used this sort of inexpensive sleeping bag pad in the past this is thinner and cheaper than i realized and i expected it to be thin and cheap i am amazed coleman will put there name on crap like this,52,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it was just as i ordered and it is going to fit well in the sleeping bag it is the right size thank you,24,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,pros it is cheap in price yet feels solid and provide adequate cushion rolls up and fits on my pack cons it is bulky when rolled up and on the pack theis pretty weak unless baby blue is your thing but hey it was 9 bucks size this is sized to match the average sleeping bag I am 510 and 175 lbs and i fit on it nicely no overhang but not too much extra room on the sides it does however have about 3 - 5 inches of room at the end I am planning on shaving off to reduce the size,99,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not worth it unless you are on some really soft ground i was camping on hard clay and a thin layer of grass and these did close to nothing,29,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,good mat next time i am going to buy the thicker one the older i get the hard the ground gets,21,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i got this pad to place underneath my more expensive camp pads to protect the foam it serves this purpose well,21,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i just received one of these sleeping pads in the mail all they did was cut out a section of foam padding and stick it in a box it is not made by coleman and very poor quality i wish i would have read the reviews before hand,48,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,my grandsons really like these it seems to make the sleeping bags stay warmer it also makes the ground softer for grandpaw,22,67
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not very comfortable only slightly better than laying directly on the hard ground if space is an issue during packing for a camping trip this will definitely be the 1st thing left behind does not provide enough comfort to justify the amount of space it will take up like other reviews state this is basically packing material the advertised photo makes it look like a higher quality pad than it actually is i only added it to my cart to get a 20 discount so it was not a loss for me however I had be upset if i actually spent 1499 on it should be sold for 5 just spend a few extra bucks and get something that is actually good quality,120,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i was hoping these were the same material as the classic blue sleeping pads just without the straps but they are not they are rather just like cheap packing foam they are firm as advertised perhaps even too firm but get damaged very easily,42,69
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,I am not a big camper so i did not really know what to look for but i have a bad back so i wanted some sort of padding if you just want something between you and the ground then this is good for you if you are looking for any kind of comfort this is not for you in the end my tent-mate had an air mattress so i do not know what this feels like to sleep on but i can say i was not looking forward to trying to sleep on it,91,70
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,i was very satisfy with theand the speedy delivery my son was very please and eager to use it,21,71
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,you know my husband has a coleman camping pad that we are really happy with and i wanted to get another one i usually love to shop at amazon but while i was researching if this is the same pad we already have it is not this is only 3/8 of an inch thick i saw it on the coleman site for 999 was surprised to find a lower price so while i do not have this pad i gave it 2 stars based on getting it cheaper somewhere else and believing that our pad which is nearly an inch thick is great and 3/8 of an inch must really leave something to be desired i guess if you are a hiker and are space-conscious it is better than nothing but if a few more inches when rolled up does not cause you inconvenience i would look for the thicker pad,147,72
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,if this pad had been a few inches longer it would have gotten 5 stars from me it is not super cushy so you need a flat and smooth place to lay it on but it does provide some cushioning against the hard ground we got this to use as an isolation mat not for it is cushioning and it does that job exceptionally well it is wide enough to easily fit a thick adult on it from shin to head i am 510 and keep the ground from sucking all the heat out of you the bottom side of me was the warmest side of me while laying on this mat and that was in 35 nights so i would guess that even at cooler temperatures it would do a good job of insulating your body from the cold ground for the price it can not be beat for it is insulating properties but if you are looking for a feather bed affect this is not the mat for you,165,73
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this is essentially packing material that is being falsely advertised as a sleeping pad uncomfortable and made of very cheap material this pad is as good as sleeping on the rocks it is not worth even a dollar please do not waste your money buying this product,47,74
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,not the best pad i have ever slept on i used it on a recent hike to the smokies and it really did not help insulating body warmth but hey it is great for the price it is very light and could barely feel it on my hike if you happen to be on a budget like i was when i bought this then yes go for it if you are not and are willing to buy a better quality pad then go for it,82,75
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i was a little dissapointed about how thin this product was it gives very little padding however it is travel friendly and gives slight padding,25,76
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,the picture is not what i recieved from the seller what i recieved is a simple 3/8 green closed cell foam mat that i passed up on at wal-mart the picture shows a quilted pad with ties attached sold by true value what a joke the seller didnot state any thing about equivalent substitutions in the ad so let it be known that true value is not a reputable seller and let the buyer beware,74,77
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,bot the canteen for appropriate use in a military parade canteen was excellent the belt fastener was not secure,19,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,just what i wanted i compared it to other simular products for sale and there was none i use it for hunting and hikeing everyone askes where i purchased it smokepole,31,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,do n't waste your money on this one a made in china special it appears the canteen is made of metal as thin as a coke can,27,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,this product is not worth bying it probably will not last fifteen minutes in service it is so flimsy it will fold up if you sat on it by mistake,29,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,does not work well with pantsit is a pic of s waist of money i hate it what a piece of junk,20,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,i bought these for my 5 year old nephews as a christmas gift they seem to be a big hit with them while i would not consider these heavy duty or made for going on a year long expedition to the amazon they are good for backyard camp outs and low risk adventuring that kids love to do,57,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,unless you intend to give thise to a child with the expectation of it being lost or destroyed i would not purchase this the belt was a cheap cotton material and the eyelets tore out easily the ones that remained started to rust after a light rain the pouch is almost the same material the canteen itself is very thin cheap tin with some sort of cheap parkerizing on it it scratches off easily and dent readily if dropped mine fell off a shelf and dented on a tree branch 2 below it this is were the parkerized was scratched thisis not durable does not seem like it would last a very long time and i forsee the belt tearing apart the only good thing about it was i was able to give it to my friends son for when he plays army this saves my friends good canteens from being lost or destroyed due to youth,159,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,our grandson is into all things military and loved the fact that this canteen and belt was so realistic and would facilitate other items that attached to the belt,29,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,super cheap and good quality it will be perfect for my naked snake cosplay and extra handy for when shtf,20,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,2.0,negative,i will not go too far with this plan and simple it is is a toy made in china after it came and i opened the box and saw what i bought i got rid of it before my wife found out i spent money on it i just can not say to othersto buy this with a stright face and sleep at night,62,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,great product I am using it primarily as a costume prop but the canteen is very spacious and I shall certainly be using it as it is intended to hold water the only negative thing i can say is that the canteen metal is thin and may dent easily i do not think it is aluminum but it may be thin steel,58,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,the produce is not as robust as real military issue especially the belt but it is adequate the canteen and cover are quite good,24,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,I have been wanting a canteen preferably metal and this is what i decided to get i also like the olive drabmakes it look cooler more of a military look the belt kit is pretty great too did what i needed to do,44,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,i would save your money and go to a military surplus store both the belt and the canteen are not of the quality that was expected from the description and photo i suppose it would make a cool toy for a child to play with in the back yard the belt could be described more as a plush fabric accessory rather than a pistol belt it certainly will not be the belt to hold my pistol off to the surplus store to get something functional at least it was delivered quickly i have enough time before going to alaska to purchase something that will work with a large caliber handgun,109,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,the canteen is a cloth covered thin aluminum canteen on a thin web belt with a soft metal slip clip should cost 5 with free shipping at the most okay for indoor use but would not take it camping the canteen halves appeared to be pressed together instead of welded i own several canteens built for real world camping so i know a piece of cheapo junk when i see one,70,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,small canteen great for scouting and not hauling around the gallon jug belt is standard and looks great with my outfit just kidding about the outfit thing,26,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,5.0,positive,this is the industry standard for colors use it often in my art business a very good tool to have recommend to anyone who uses colors in their work,29,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,as a designer i do not quite get the numbering system I have never taken the time to try to understand it it is always a bit of a mystery visual people go byso it is a matter of marking the swatches with post-it is so you can find them easily if you are matching or trying to choose the right one love the colors and consistency possible with these formulas,69,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,it is a set of pantone flip books not much to say really i would have liked to have seen slightly heavier stock but they are stillaccurate,28,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,5.0,positive,good pantone set to have for starting your graphic design business may look into getting subsequent pantone sets including the pastels metallics and more,23,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,2.0,negative,very disappointing especially the fact that you still have to pay this much for a pantone book and now the paper is this thin it is terrible i was very tempted to return it except that i need it and am not sure if a thicker paper pantone book is available i doubt it so we are just stuck with this it is so thin that I am afraid I am going to rip it by just looking through the colors also the numbers are not in order at all they used to be in order bythen number now it takes forever if your looking for a specificI have been using pantone books for 10 years and was very excited to be able to get a new one and all i can say is that I am truly disappointed,136,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,a lot of people do not like the new chromatically organized colors i find that it definitely helps with choosing colors but slows you down a little when looking for a specificnumber there is an index in the back that helps you look up colors it tells you which page to look on this adds a little time to finding theyou need but not too much my only complaint is that the paper is very thin i feel like i am going to rip the paper ever time i use the book i know i will have to break out the scotch tape in the near future,110,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,5.0,positive,what i can say about this product pantone is a reference in the world aboutsystem now with the plus series it is even better,25,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,i almost gave this 3 stars I am that disappointed in the stock the guides are printed on how much extra would it have been to go with a heavier stock this is too easy to crease packaging is good I have posted closeups for anyone interested in the chromatic reordering no flash used,53,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,5.0,positive,very usefull material to work easy to carry easy to use and with all especifications great colors and in the perfect size,22,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,the seller is not providing what is promised in the description of thisthe description states it comes withcorrection tool and the seller than says go to pantone wwww and download it the url they provide does not work then you ask about the correct url and they tell you to search for it request a refund send back the product and never hear back terrible customer service and does not match description,75,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,received product in time good service relatively good price however while comparing with same product sold in israel i found out that the product received is much thinner than the product sold over here i donot know if this affects quality i would like to receive some comment on that from seller albert hazan israel,54,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,after using pantones for the last 10 years this is by far the worst product i have ever bought the stock is light and will not stand a commercial environment for any length of time we use these books to work with the numbers of reference make no sense at all most people use numbers to reference in a consecutive manner pantone was on acid when they designed this as it is just a jumbled mess with no rationale at all if this is this company moving forward with a new product their days are numbered and i will certainly not be buying another product from them ridiculous simon,114,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,the paper quality of the stock is terrible i borrowed an older version from a friend and the quality was much better the new one is thinner and softer making it difficult to slide open and compare colors this is too flimsy not worth the price,46,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,2.0,negative,i am so upset about the newly organized pantone plus series forumula guides the colors are no longer in numerical order but are organized byso anyone familiar with pantone colors will be pretty frustrated there is an index in the back with the colors listed in numerical order with page numbers but the page numbers are located on the lower left corner of the book which makes finding the right page way more difficult than it should be the page numbers have always been on the lower left but in 25 years of using pantone books i can not say I have ever noticed or needed to use the page numbers i can see where organizing bywould be more user friendly for new users but for the majority of us it is a huge pain it would be nice if they would offer an option with the colors organized in numerical order in the meantime i may take out the screw post and re-order the pages of my guides that should be a fun weekend activity,177,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,if you are used to the old pantone books you will absolutely hate the new books the stock is literally paper thin it is so flimsy I am afraid to look for abecause I am afraid I am going to tear the book the order is new and if your used to the old way you will not like it either my number one reason to not get it is the stock i called pantone today because they came out with a new book called designer field guide i thought maybe they listened and made thicker stock nope same stock i told him i refuse to buy a new book until they change the stock,113,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,4.0,positive,works great for staining awhen you are worried about keeping paint off the house or other areas,18,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,2.0,negative,i supposed this might be ok for rough jobs but the product did not perform for my purposes i was trying to use this to protect the ceiling while painting the wall the edges came out messy even when wiping the tool after each section this tool just does not create a good enough seal the paint leeks under it,60,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,5.0,positive,earlier this year my husband and i painted the outside of our house we were a bit nervous because we have a significant amount of trim on the house this made it much easier to paint the trim a darkerthan the main part of the house without bleeding the dark paint onto the light paint naturally we needed to wipe the paint off the trip guard when moving it from one place to another but that was not a big deal just have some rags handy for that and this little gem will make your painting job a lot easier,101,2

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,2.0,negative,works best for quick small applications you need to wipe it off frequently before the paint dries and after use if you intend to use it again simply a small piece of flexible plastic that is way overpriced,38,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,2.0,negative,i did not really get the results i wanted from this product it easily allowed paint to go underneath and made the painting process messy and longer than it should have been I have had much better results with tape,38,21

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,I have had this exact set for about 2 years now and it comes in so handy I have used the screwdriver several times with no trouble it has all the bits you could ever use unlike some other sets it is very easy to put the parts back in the spot they belong yet the case is compact and stores easily I am going to buy another,64,0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,over the years i have had many tool sets especially socket sets there has a reason for that sockets easily fall out of the case when you open them and it is hard to keep things organized not so with this set each tool is secure in it is own place no falling out and getting lost in addition the quality of the tools seems excellent with both sae and metric sizes this is a really nice set and the price is right,84,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i decided to purchase a real socket wrench set after i knocked my 15 year old cheep-o set on the floor one too many times and got tired of putting everything back in the case first let me say that this case is designed so that when you knock this set on the ground all the sockets stay in place second this set is very well made and thought out for instance the metric and standard allen wrenches are different colors so you can tell them apart at a glance these wrenches fit the hand just right and are a pleasure to use i highly recommend them,109,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i learned that with tools you can buy something on the cheap and it gets the job done the first time but if you ever need to use it again and again it will end up being very inconvenient or simply quickly breaking on you and you will find yourself spending money again this set falls into that category I have been using these at work for some minor jobs here and there and even for that they have proven insufficient first the case is very cheaply made and it is almost impossible to remove / return pieces back into the molds you pretty much have to hammer the dies in / pry the taps with a screwdriver second there has something not right about the tightening mechanism of the tap handle which makes the taps loosen after a couple of turns and thereforeto the side during a cut third and most importantly the dies are brittle we have 3 or 4 pieces with missing / snapped teeth a good tool not only gets the job done it is also a pleasure to use this tap and die set is neither,182,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the pliers are super cheap junk and the case is really bulky for throwing in my jeep,17,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,my review is for the tap and die set man i hate giving products one star reviews but i really wanted to on this one in this case you get what you pay for at best i suppose the taps are ok but the handles are just garbage the smaller one can not really be tightened down enough to actually hold the tap the larger one is not much better the pieces do not fit into the slots in the box very well i do not use this set very often but i dread when i do have to use it echoing some of the other comments light duty only for those not really needing to tap things very often,117,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i was throughly disappointed with this kit it is a piece of crap and I am looking for a kit that will work I am afraid to buy and buy until i get a decent kit to use,36,12

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,case is cheap and sockets are only secured by gravity but that seems to be the norm for these types of tool sets,23,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the second time i finally used the ratchet it broke the second time i used it trash product,18,17

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,received thisand it was missing the tap wrench i opened it at the time i needed to use so it is basically useless to me,27,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the tools are a bit cheap but useable and i knew that in the cost the problem is that the case is complete junk it barely holds anything in place and each time i close it i have to put all the tools back into their place,47,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,do not buy this product unless you want to just throw your money away i have broken 2 taps that should not have broken now i have to drill these out can not return because i did not start my project until return window had closed buy quality taps let me be your lesson learned crap crap crap,57,21

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,great tool for general tap and die work around the house remember that you usually get what you pay for this is an inexpensive set that does the job for me around my backyard machine shop the box makes it handy to store it gets the same review as the tekton 7559 metric set,54,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,no cutting teeth hard to even tap plastic pipe,9,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is of such poor quality that you will be frustrated when using it the holders do not properly hold the bits and the bits are of poor grade you get what you pay for and i would not recommend this kit unfortunately it me a few months to figure out how bad it is to use,57,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,it has all the tools i need for my jeep but very cheaply made i wish i actually spend money on a craftsmen but if you are low on money and want to buy something that you want to put in your jeep or your car for emergency repairs then this is the tool set you want but i recommended buying a tool bag from walmart to put the tools in because the box is cheaply made i would not used this and a mechanic tools set it probably strip bolts and nuts but for a one time fix yes,100,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,unbelievably terrific set of tools for a great price,9,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,works great on plastic aluminum and for cleaning / straightening the threads on steel but do not try to thread drilled out steel i snapped one of the taps in half doing that after the 4th or 5th one still at this price I shall replace the broken ones as needed with higher quality ones from the hardware store having a starter kit is nice,61,37

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,so bad you can not even use it once before you have tot send it back,15,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i was thinking that this might not be the highest quality pieces at this price but it is basically unusable my first project was to tap mild steel with the 4 - 40 tap probably the most difficult test i could not even get the tap started it was terrible i thought my tap hole was mis-sized but it was not i used the 41 drill which is for 50 thread depth larger than the 75 thread depth option i went to the hardware store to buy a 4 - 40 tap and that one worked without any issues my guess is the rest of the pieces are equally low quality if you are tapping non-metal items then maybe it might be ok for you otherwise forget it,123,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,ok for the price but the small tap wrench is useless,11,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,good basic set everything you would need to do basic repairs,10,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,really poor quality material was delivered to me broken tap handle would not screw together at least two of the dies did not have any teeth at all I am guessing the poor quality material did not hold up to manufacturing and there was apparently no quality assurance,44,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it is a decent set for the price the taps are not that sharp although and the tap handle is weak i used the 1/2 - 20 tap on some 3/4 mild steel and it was pretty hard to tap the handle broke on me and i had to finish tapping with a wrench the tap did not seem as sharp as others i have used in the past would be an excellent set for aluminum,71,44

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,good product but quality was not up to united states standards still a useful product,14,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,good set of tools in a nice organized box,9,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,nothing is machined correctly on this set the holders are not square they hold the taps at an angle it looks like the taps are made incorrectly the 8/32 tap would not even start in ss very cheap set why do not i learn my lesson you get what you pay for in this case you even get less maybe it will tap wood,63,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the wrenches either will not stay in their slots or once removed from their slots are impossible to get back in very frustrating i returned this set,26,55

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,works well for occasional use homeowner i doubt it would hold up to serious mechanics needs,16,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,have not used my set yet but it does have a large assortment of retread attachments,16,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i know you can not expect much for the price but these are very cheaply made and not good quality at all even with much care and cutting oil I have broken the taps with little effort the handles to hold these are a total joke and a serious pain to use it does not securely hold the taps or dies securely and makes it tough to properly align or start them into the piece you are trying to thread the dies are thin and have fewer cutting threads which means that it is much harder and easier to break when trying to thread anything harder than aluminum,106,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,useless cheap metal the teeth on the dies and presumably other parts are certainly not hardened not even close soft metal i should have known i did not even use it to cut metal but plastic ridiculous,36,64

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,the reviews are for different products I am sure some of the products are good but i will tell you right now that i got the allied tools 49035 41-piece sae tap and die tool set that is the 41 piece set nothing else and it was very poorly made the 41 piece set sucks do not get the 41 pc set but I am sure some of the other sets are very nice,71,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,very varied is complete for that have no tools i recommend it,12,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,junk set tried re-tapping one single hole on a motorcycle fender and followed their directions for pre-drilling size to a t and the tap snapped off in the hole this was a monumental problem as the steel is hardened well beyond that of any drill bit making it essentially impossible to drill it out i ended up having to grind out the entire nut that was welded in there and welding a new nut on which had the lovely side effect of burning the paint on the other side unless you absolutely positively do not care about theyou are tapping do not use these i understand that it is a cheap set but I had except it to at least work once without breaking the cost savings is not worth the potential hassle,129,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,great starter set arrived in great shape knocked a star off since the sockets donot stick into the case opened up the case to a total cluster and mess,30,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is an ok set for keeping in your trunk or if you only do light jobs good value for the price but not for heavy work i keep this in the trunk for emergencies,35,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,cheap tools but they get the job done,8,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i used this kit for 2 years to do all the maintenance i can on my motorcycles the kit comes with quite a few of sockets which were very handy all 6pt socket not the crap 12pt anyway everything is ok quality no sockets broke or slipped the screw driver magnet broke in the first few uses crescent wrench is useless spark plug sockets came in handy but then i remembered that the bike came with a spark plug tool which worked better but one of them was used to remove the front wheel from a 2005 r6 with a pair of vice grips to hold in place finally after 2 years of service the ratchet gave out which means i need to get a new one I shall most likely get a new craftsman set from sears since their warranty is excellent good for the occasional use and the case is easy to store and carry around for 50 it is not too bad just do not expect snapon nor craftsman quality for this money,173,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i never had a full set before it is great to finally have a complete tool collection,17,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,I am used to better quality had to return it I shall have to look around and find something more to my liking they might be okay for some hobbies that do not work with the tougher metals but i would think twice before trying to cut threads in quality steel or stainless just my opinion,53,74

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i do not have any experience with taps or dies but this set does not seem too bad for casual / occasional use the case makes it slightly difficult to remove what you want but overall not too bad,35,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it worked for what i needed it to do but i see why others have complaints the handle for the taps does not secure onto the taps very well i only needed it for plastic so i had no issues for the price i can not complain,45,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this 1/2 inch drive ratchet socket set is exactly what it states but as a mechanic it is a useful set and delivers quality grip and sustains a beating ironically it is hard to scratch this set well with most sets when you use them they get all scratched up bent and truly useless but this set is tough and really delivers,62,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,everything works great and the price is great but the 13 mm socket was not punched all the way through i would give it 5 stars but this is the only thing holding me back the company will replace it for free as there is a lifetime guarantee but i find it easier just to go to the hardware store based on other reviews you may get some shoddy craftsmanship or you may not,72,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this is so handy and a def must have i never imagined that this would be so wonderful I am so glad that i got it and i would recommend it to everyone,32,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this was the cheapest tap and die set i could find i had the spout for a clawfoot bathtub strip this set worked perfectly to fix the threads saving me about 100 instead of replacing the fawcett if you only need this set once or twice a year for small jobs then it is worth the money if you need a set that you are going to use every day buy something else with more quality and higher price,78,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,very cheaply made case would look elsewhere for better quality the case broke as soon as i opened it for the first time,23,82

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i would give this tool set a 5 but very few tools get a 5 from me it is a complete set which works in the situations where i have used it so far the crank handle did not hold up to use so i replaced it with one from a local vendor,53,84

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is nothing but junk the taps have no starter tooth on them i used a 5/16 - 20 tap on a piece of cold roll steel first time using this tap the tap not only had trouble starting with in the first 1/4 of depth the teeth on the tap look like some of the taps that we have thrown away they were shot same with the dies not only are they of a poor quality the teeth are barely there there are no starter teeth on them avoid this set spend a little extra and get a set with some quality i own a machine shop so i am not new to this,115,100

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,thisthat i receive has horrible craftmentship made in china i do not recommend thissave your money and buy american product,23,102
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the taps are fine but i can not seem to get the dies to cut a thread on metal or wood all they do is just eat the wood or metal upon closer examination i do not see any or little difference on either side of the die thread so i am thinking that it just is not grabbing the metal or wood no matter what i do to try and cut the threads,71,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i lost the set i inherited in the flooding of 2006 i bought a small set from a big box retailer but it did not have the sizes i needed you never know what you need until you need it when i saw this i had to have it and i am not disappointed it has all the common sizes and i will find it useful,65,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,wanted tools for the car trunk for just-in-case needs on the road or in the driveway the case folds openon all sides and top took a a couple practices to get it right a couple of nuisance pieces fell out of place if not secured when snapping case together have not needed to use tools yet,55,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,the price was low and so was the quality with taps and dies if the quality is low they are almost unusable as is the case with these pay a pro to do it for you or buy quality expense tools if you have enough work to justify them anything else is a waste of money,56,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is a low quality set the taps are barely functional poorly finished and have burrs the dies do not work at all on mild steel maybe they are just intended for aluminum,33,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,purchased thisseveral months ago but failed to check to make sure all was exactly proper with the items i just now needed to use the 1/4 nc tap discovered that the seller included 2 of 1/4 nf i am dumb out of luck on this one beyond the return or adjustment date who would have thought just my luck to get my stuff from the early monday or late friday shift other than that good product for the price,79,108

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i looked to thread some smaller washers and used this set to accomplish the threading but results did not really work as expected and the thread quality was poor,28,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i have tried to turn a brand new bolt through every die in this case and they would not even think about starting and if you plan on tapping anything other than plastic do not bother I have used better tools out of my sons toy box just remembered something else the first time i used the tap wrench it rolled around the tap and stripped rendering it useless,66,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the product was missing pieces and damaged the outer case was ripped really bad was disappointed was suppose to be a fathers days gift and ended up in the trash,30,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i needed a 1/2 tap to complete a project for the the kids buying the tap alone would have cost me what i paid for the set a great buy,30,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i bought this product because I have had much success with them in the past problem was they kept getting loose in the case and i was starting to lose pieces thru a previous review i decided to purchase this set because the person wrote that this one holds the pieces snuggly in the box well he was right the pieces fit snuggly in the case although it is plastic but overall it is a great product i would consider this one again if i had to replace the one i have now,89,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i got this to have on my boat just is case of a minor issue product looks to be well built for that purpose with a good supply of bits this is great for minor repairs around the house in the car ect,43,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,recently we broke down in my wifes car she did not have so much as a screwdriver in the car if we had this tool kit we could have been going in a matter of minutes instead of the 1 - 1/2 hours we spent waiting on help for a loose battery cable is it a professional quality tool set no is the case perfect no however it does contain enough tools of sufficient quality to get you going in case of a breakdown also it contains electrical tape and connectors as well as jumper cables that is the reason i bought it and it fills that bill perfectly,105,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is most likely made by a toy company in china dies are covered in burrs and unusable taps are not made to spec and bolts will painfully grind into tapped threads if you can manage to tap them tap holder is made out of a material similar toin hardness and sheared the first time i tried to use it box can not even hold itself closed as it was also not built to spec being a useless waste of 22 dollars i give this 1/5 stars because 0/5 is not an option,95,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i use this set to clean up thread on lawn and garden tractors that i restore it is a low cost set so do not expect it to perform like a heavy duty one but for work that i do it works just fine i have drilled and tapped mower arbors and have not broken any of the taps i gave this five stars because for the money it is a great set and as usual amazon shipped fast and provided a good value,82,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,for the price you can not beat it the plastic box leaves some to be desired as some of the taps will not stay in their spots the screw driver included in this package is a joke they should have left it out all together but the taps and dies seem to be of reasonable quality I have only used one but it worked perfectly this set obviously would not be a viable option for a professional metal worker but for do-it-yourself occasional use these are perfect would recommend,85,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,if you need a cheap set of taps and dies go to autozone they have a set for 24 bucks with a 90 day in store warranty and a 1 year manufacture warranty this set is a complete ruin i had a 4 - 40 tap break off inside my part and guess what part ruined none of the turrets are calibrated for any of the dies so do not even bother using anything else except the t-wrench if you do buy this poor excuse of a tool set,87,120
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this for my brother for christmas he is very into his truck and this was a great addition to his toolbox now he always has the tools he needs when he is out and about,37,121
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i had thought about ordering one before the holidays as it was in stock i was short on money and had to wait until the new year when i did it was out of stock with a 1 - 2 month delivery i ordered anyway and received it within a few weeks it arrived as described would recommend my only complain is some of the pieces do not fit into the clamshell very well and are difficult to get out and put back into their places they are marring the case so it will eventually have a hole i do not know if this is a complaint or normal with these types of tools because this is my first but the tap wrench becomes loose and must be tightened several times during a tapping event one handle tightens one way and the other in reverse so as you tighten one the other loosens i fixed this by putting threadlock on the one that is supposed to be stationary,164,122
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,boght this as a started tool set for my sons best friend my bonus son wonderful set for a vehicle,20,123
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,just what you need when you do not need to spend a lot for a higher quality kit i have not broken any yet and i think that is what separates higher quality taps from lower strength and quality of thread this will work for yourprojects i would even use this on important thread jobs just very carefully,57,124
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,got this for my kitchen drawer when I am too lazy to go out to the garage and get the nicer tools and it works fine the elastic holders in the case are nice because i can replace certain tools with others better suited for miscellaneous household needs i would buy it again,52,125
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,we purchased this tool kit for our son he will be going off to college next fall and wanted a tool for his car this kit covers just about everything he will need to fix a minor problem it will last him for many years,45,126
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,these arrived with a broken tap wrench the screw handle in the tap wrench would not thread into the clamp which is ironic being that it is a tap / die set that epitomizes the quality you should expect from this set someone at their factory knowingly put a useless tap wrench into the set and the dies had threads that had thin pieces of metal hanging off of them which indicates cheap metal and poor machining i sent the product back with no problems from amazon it looks like i am going to have to pony up and pay for a real set,101,127
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i take this set with me everywhere these tools a very professional high quality you can not go wrong with this set,21,128
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i bought this set for theading 12/24 unc the end of a sizing stud i turned on the lathe thee stud was to be used with a lee case trimmer for 222 rem magnum cases this is not directly available from lee in the picture it looked like a cheap but not bad quality set but when i examined it it was just crap there were hardened steel burrs in almost all dies they did not cut cleanly rather teased the metal if you want to make a quick and dirty job and quality of threading is not an issue you may go for it otherwise better spend once your bucks and go directly for a decent quality and higher price one,122,129
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it arrived quickly and while not the most expensive it certainly seems to handle the occasional need for a tap be sure to useand cutting oil,28,130
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,it works this is was a part i wanted to use on my ar 15 to tap and screw a spring in place,23,131
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i bought this product to carry on my boat it is what the photo shows driver has magnetic tip for those hard to reach places an this kit is a fairly will rounded you could also carry it in your car or truck an still save space it is always go to carry the basic tools because you never no when you will need them also well priced,66,132
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought this tap die set for small projects when it got here it was packed well shipped in pretty good time product for the money was in good shape i figure the taps and dies will recondition threads pretty easy i do not think the set will cut new threads well tho i also wish allied would put a tap and die drill chart in the box it would make things easier for we the rookies of the machine shop,79,133
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i concurr completely with the comments about the tap wrench i recieved my set today and upon prying the tap wrench from it is location in the box the sliding blocks that should grab the square shank of a tap fell out after spending an hour trying to thread the parts back together it was readily apparent that they were totally incompatible and could never function I shall purchase a replacement wrench at my local ace hardware store and hope that the taps and dies are ok for limited house hold chores also had to pry the little thread gage from it is moulded in position in the box with a screwdriver it required so much force to remove that it bent do not waste your money on this set,127,134
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought these 4 years ago i was very excited to have my first tool box I have used it many times to replace parts on my car and they have saved me a lot of money I have always just left it in my car for emergencies it is good for it is price if you want lasting tools you will have to pay more the box does not really close properly now there are a lot of missing pieces from over the years and a few of tools have rust around them and what not i did not really take care of the tools but whatever they did their job i was expecting everything to last longer but for that you will have to pay more if you just keep these in your garage and use it from time to time and store it properly and take care of it i am sure that these will last a long time but my was always in my car so everytime i opened it up there would be pieces everywhere and then it would take me forever to put them back in place which is very annoying,188,135
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is a quality product and came on time and as published i could not have gotten this for twicw the price at a local hardware store,27,136
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i returned this tap and die set after attempting to thread just one rod the dies are missing a starting chamfer they may work for cleaning off an existing thread but are lousy for starting a new thread on a rod overall the metal seems cheap the handles feel like they would break under not much pressure i should have paid more up front for something like a craftsman set thought i would save money you do get what you pay for,82,137
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,lo recomiendo 100 articulo muy funcional,49,138
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,good selection of tools many to choose from i can always find the right one however 2nd day of using one of my bits broke i did not apply a lot of torque it just snapped structurally I am not that strong of a build myself so anyone who fancies themselves athletic may need to heed thisi do not trust this tool set at all if you want a good selection of tools with the highest quality and build purchase something better than this and spend the extra cash i was going to give this two stars but now I shall give it one,103,139
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i was surprised at how easy this product worked on the project i was doing then again i was working with steel and not plastic or acrylic like some of the reviews here nice set for light metal projects at a great price,43,140
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought this for my niece for her new car so she will have some tools with her great little kit good price received promply with amazon prime,27,141
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,for the price you expect a fairly decent kit of tool in a decent portable case to use in your vehicle in case of emergency the thing that struck me was the horrible quality of the case the top latches pop off in your hands and do not go back on easily when you try the tools are held in by plastic retaining clips that were broken or mis-formed all the tools were everywhere and 8 or 10 would not go back in their retainers this makes for a nice rattle sound as you are driving good fun most of the parts are small clips retainers screw tips and more you would be be better off getting a few decent tools from home depot or craftsman and a small tool box my biggest concern with the set is that it is for emergency and in an emergency i would hate to rely on this quality,152,142
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the metal they use is not quality or hardended correctly there tools brake and because injury this leaves lots of liability sure if it is for home use you hurt yourself and you obviously do not care about yourself anyway because you bought allied junk but think about those others who use them you do not want to kill your loved ones because you saved a nickel on hand tools,67,143
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this set has almost everything you need for an emergency tool kit bought 3 for our limo fleet awesome for the price,22,144
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this as a very occasional use kit to take with me so i would not have to wait for someone else to get around to fixing a stripped bolt hole i did not want to spend much money as this will not get used much and if it will not do the job the mechanic who has the really good snap on set can come and fix it for it is intended purpose it is great i have fixed a couple of small stripped holes with the taps and ran it down the threads of a bolt it has held up in mild steel just fine it is a very good value for the amount of kit you get for the money it is cheap but does the job i would not think about this at all if you plan on using them daily buy a good set for that,147,145
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this is a good quality tap and die set for occasional use I have only used a couple of the taps but they are sharp and work well just what i needed and at a great price,36,146
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this set seems well suited for home / semi-pro use solid metal taps and dies case is a bit tight but overall for the occasional job it should pay for itself some mechanics might actually be upgrading,35,147
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,I am confused how this would get anything above one star i attempted to thread a piece of music wire with the 4 - 40 die the threads on the die were deformed almost immediately later i purchased a die made by irwin it threaded the same piece of steel with good results i returned the set to amazon,56,148
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i had a similar problem as one of the other reviewers within a couple months of mild use the ball bearing that holds the bit in place fell out losing that ball bearing essentially makes the tool useless because the bits fall out so easily that i can not use the tool in any angle other than by holding the tool completely upright it is just not practical stay away and find a tool with better quality,75,149
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,ths is the worst kit I have ever used i should have known not to buy one for 20 bucks you could not thread hot butter with this it did not come with any guides or instructions and the dies are not the size they say they are most of the threads were cut wrong into the tool even with a guide it will start to bite then slip off and eat what ever it is your trying to thread it would cost me more money to send the thing back than i paid for it if you are looking for a paper weight or just want to throw 20 bucks in the trash then buy this,112,150
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i bought this tool set hoping for a medium quality tool set for a great price and it came in way below my expectations first of all it is not actually a 235 piece set unless you count all the screws and connectors that were so graciously included the needle-nose pliers were bent in the set i received and overall the tool set is constructed poorly the case makes the tools hard to get in and out of their positions and some of the tools fall out when you carry the case gently i would look elsewhere for a tool kit because this one is not worth the money,107,151
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this because every now and then i need a tap or die around the house for yard / garden equipment and more for the price i did not expect much but this is good quality material in less than a week after i got it i was working on my truck and broke a bolt off after i got it out i had to re-tap the hole this worked great and saved me a lot of headaches and time again when you do not think you need something that is then you need it most at least that is what i tell my wife when i buy new tools laughing out loud,106,152
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,had to use this for working on some standardized floor electrical boxes did the job well held the screws tight to the piece once the tap was done before securing the scrwes in highly recommend this you never know when you need to tap into new holes or chase threads on damaged bolts,53,153
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,nice set for the price I have seen better quality taps but these are perfect for chasing damged threads and cutting new threads on softer materials probably not good for harder materials although use lots of cutting fluid,37,154
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is quite possibly the poorest quality toolset i have ever seen i can not even see how it is worth more than 20 let alone 5999 the case is very cheap and looks like it will fall apart and there are not even close to 235 tools i suppose they count each wire terminal as a tool,56,155
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i went out on a limb and bought this tap and die set because of the great price i am shocked at how well this set works the tap handle is a little different than what i am used to and took a second to figure out that only one side is meant to screw in to tighten the tap into the t handle after i got that right the tap worked flawlessly today i tapped an exhaust manifold with the nf 7/16 - 20 tap and it continues to impress me no complaints with this set if handled properly this set will do what any high end set will do,109,156
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,my son works on his mustang often and besides his regular tool set wanted a tool kit that could provide the wide variety of tools he needed to complete the specialized tasks this kit has the electrical crimpers and other small tools typically used for radio or lighting installation as well as your standard ratchet and other small hand tools used when working in confined areas or for specialized installation it rounds out his regular set of tools well and keeps everyting in one easy to store container the tools are decent quality and should last for many years,99,157
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,it looks good does not it even comes with a little thread gauge unfortunately when i tried to tap a 4 - 40 thread into a 1/8 piece of acrylic the handle on the tapping wrench came off it was being held in by one and a half threads on left-hand threaded end this ones going right back to amazon,57,158
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,tools are decent quality for the price comes with jumper cables case is terrible opened up the first time and case would not close properly not a big deal it still goes together fine just does not fit exactly right shipped in 2 days,43,159
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,handy portable tool kit wide variey of tools handle most tasks case is a little chintzy have to used with care to keep tools from falling loose i stuffed the void in the middle to help hold the tools in their respective spots quality of the tools is adequate for the intended mission i bought two,55,160
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,these are great tools but when you open and close the set it causes the tools to fall out and get lost and mixed up so if you buy this you might want to buy a separate slide out tool chest but i definitely recommended this,46,161
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i am an antique restorer and i bought this for occasional use it worked out fine for me,18,162
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,you do not buy this expecting to get quality tools it is a good buy to keep in a vehicle,19,163
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,I have been a moldmaker for 30 years have used a lot of taps and dies even the pricey ones brake this price is unreal just ten years ago the handles and tool are worth the price along nice range of sizes 4 - 40 to 1/2 - 20 zoom on picture to see for yourself great for home use beats paying 11900 for a craftman set,62,164
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it does the job i would not stress it more than a couple of use per week,17,165
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i got this product as a gift but returned it for the metrinch set i had seen on tv this allied set is not a terrible product and it is cheaper and has a few more tools but they really can not be compared as the metrinch is a truly high end product and is actually a much better value as it is really 2 full sets of tools in one metric and standard,71,166
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i bought this set for one purpose threading plastic parts and the results have been excellent so far i expect the set will last the rest of my life ed,30,167

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,I shall admit that i expect alot from my tools but this product was not even in the ballpark i suppose if one had a rare need this tap and die set might suffice but for frequent use or for use with hardened metals it does not hold up well,48,169
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is a great product i gave it to my fiance as a gift and his only complaint is that the driver heads are not magnetic other than that it is easy to use and works well for a variety of projects,42,170
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,for the price a perfect combination of tools put this in the trunk of my car as the only tools carried truck is full of tools butprices make the little car very attractive and this tool kit has been handy instead of sure i have one but it is in the truck,54,171
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i thought thewas great the only thing was the box is difficult to fold open and snap shut at some points besides that it is awsome,27,172
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,is great for around the house jobs that require a socket set not sure why people give thisa bad review,23,173
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i purchased this as a christmas gift and recently found out that some tools were missing how embarrassing they probably thought i gave a used gift,26,174
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,the tools are top notched but that is only half of it the case is well organized and easy to snap the sockets in-and-out,24,175

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is a real piece of crap i think it was 20 bucks when i ordered it well after a few jobs it decided to finally give out the ball that keeps the bits secured to the screwdriver came out so i can no longer use any bits and hope that they stay put also just as a flaw of design the lock to keep the head in the various swiveled angles comes loose with about 2 turns of the screwdriver it becomes very annoying to have to re-tighten it over and over again while tightening one screw do yourself a favor do not look for bargains on tools at the least do not look for bargain tools that have too many moving parts,122,177
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,junk soft steel only good for tapping plastic i twisted apart the largest tap on the first use in soft aluminum,21,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,was a bit smaller than i expected but an overall good product for the price,15,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,a little smaller than i needed but that is my fault looks to be a handy set just go slow measure twice act once this is for really small work,29,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,my husband loves this set he is using it for his guitars,12,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,i had purchased this to thread holes for a project i was working on i used a bit holder to help grip the taps because they are tiny the job worked well the first time well worth the effort and price,41,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,it is a small life saver you must realize this tap set is for very soft materials such as wood aluminum brass copper and more you must go very very slow and not force the work piece it is not made to be used for cutting new threads unless it is plastic or very thin and soft materials i would never use on hard steel unless your just lightly chasing threads a must have in your tool box for small specialty work,78,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,the dies are a pain to use and it looks like it is made of soft steel may be it is just a matter of getting used to it have it tried the taps yet,33,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,tap and die set is good handy tool it is pretty small although I am afraid I shall break it when using it am careful with it when i do use it,30,7

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,i would put zero or minus stars on that product but there is no option like that the manufacture quality is below any standard which make this product useless is waist of time money and creating anger,41,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,it does the job for the soft metals these are very fragile to use and they brake very easily be careful but as said it does the job,28,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,it is quite hard to find tap and die sets at least ones that are not prohibitively expensive for casual and occasional project work so i am glad i found this set this set has allowed me to manufacture damaged and missing proprietary watch pins there is a vague stamp on the taps with a number but it is too hard to read or know what it means so i matched the taps with dies by simply screwing one into the other the packet it came is was different there was a decent pvc pouch for the die tool but the taps came in a separate disposable bag without compartments that was not resealable so i will need to find a suitable pocket miniature container to hold them safely in it is possibly not enough for a professional but i would not know for amateurs and beginners i think it does a great job and i recommend it,159,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,2.0,negative,i did not expect much but anyway this is a usable set for very soft metals if you want to keep using it,22,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,great product for those little jobs as a gunsmith i use this product quite a bit to help customize guns for owners that are wanting to mount a scope or upgrade their weapons with modern add ons such as laser sights or flashlights,43,14

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,it was too small for the door handle opening but we got it to work it is very sturdy and much better than the original and the flimsy replacement we bought at home depot sorry hd we put something in theto keep the bugs out it will work until we get one that is the right size and just as sturdy,61,0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,bought two of these one works fine for now the other broke the second day it was installed the handle popped right off update the one that worked fine broke within a month the lock on that one broke so these clearly have multiple defects,45,5

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,unhelpful instructions wish i had read the reviews saying the needed to file down the latch for it to fit i tried to force mine and it broke,29,7

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,very satisfied overall package did not come with a keeper sold separately apparently,12,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,installs easy looks great make sure you take apart your old stuff first and make sure everything matches before you buy my original outside pull was offset and used different holes than the outside pull in this kit which lines up straight so i could not use the new outside pull,50,13

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,finally went through 3 from lowes by far the best one using it on a houseboat doorwall beauty,16,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,the photo of thisis very inaccurate compared to the actual product i ordered a door handle with a dark walnut handle and a chrome / aluminum base in reality the handle is a much lighter beigeand the base is a matte gray check out the photo in my review theis not even close to the photo on it is own packaging i was hoping to find a handle that would match our darker wood floors so I shall be returning this handle,83,16

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,although i did not end up using this handle because it did not have the proper mounting screws i bought it used from amazon warehouse deals i can see this is a nice replacement sliding door handle / lock it has a solid wood handle and the construction appears strong and well made just not as heavy / thick metal as my original i thought of getting screws for this but then thought i can reorder another one i did actually i got prime-line products c 1095 sliding door handle set with wood handle black diecast because i realized my door has 3 hole spacing where this c-1018 is for 3 - 15/16 hole spacing overall i believe any of these prime-line sliding door handles are well made and a good replacement,126,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,great replacement for older sliding class door had hard time finding one locally so glad to have found this one on amazon,22,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,seem to be decent quality especially for the price have not used them a whole lot yet but the several that i have tried are holding up just fine the stand seems to be cheaply made but does the job of holding the tools just fine,45,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,if you do shop work and have to drill holes transfer punches are a must allows one to accurately locate where to drill,23,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i got them and they looked good when i went to use them the one i needed was to soft to use the point went flat so i checked them all on the rock well and found 11 to soft to use i payed for the better ones and got this junk not happy i do not think they were fowler,61,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,these transfer punches are absoloute garbage i broke the tip off of one during it is first use I shall be sending this product back,23,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,the box that the punches came in is labeled made in china i do not think they are talking about the box i called fowler and they told me this is not their product the punches came covered in grit and one punch was a little bent but i cleaned the set and was able to straighten out the punch well enough for my use i only intend on using these punches for woodworking so i think they will be ok so i gave it 4-stars,86,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i was wandering through the amazon tool section and ran across this product what a greati put it into our christmas wish list and my wife ordered it i opened the present this morning the punches look good the rack that holds them is another story the rack was twisted one screw was loose another had the nut laying in the bottom of the box i took the punches out to fix the loose screws and discovered the rack had been twisted so far out of alignment that one of the punch holes had been torn the final discovery was when i tried to put the loose nut onto it is screw it would not stay so i decided to replace it i pulled the screw out and discovered it was not threaded apparently whoever assembled the rack was more interested in getting it shipped then quality control I am sending it back for an exchange hopefully the next one has all the screws threaded,163,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,i purchased this from the price pros reseller it arrived the next day i was concerned about the possibility of getting a non-genuine product based on an earlier review but amazons return policy would allow a quick and easy resolution what a received was a blue box with no mention of the name fowler anywhere only the part number 72 - 482 - 028 - 0 was listed on mine the metal carrier is not very well aligned the middle support shelf is not welded exactly parallel but the top and bottoms are the size of each punch is stamped or etched on the top which is nice this set is made in china concerned that this may be a cheap imitation i contacted the fowler corporation and was told that this is indeed a fowler product i made a few punches into cherry stock and the tip showed no sign of wear the punches themselves look well made for the price i would give the benefit of the doubt that they will hold out and propose a 4-star rating for the obvious hasty manufacturing i could never give a higher rating regardless of price,189,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,these transfer punches are excellent quality and the delivery time for the product was far better than expected very pleased,20,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i ordered this set a few days ago because it was an excellent price for a fowler transfer punch set [ ] but when i received the shipment i discovered that it is not a fowler set but a cheap chinese knockoff the box was dented in several places and the inside had several stains from machine oil that had dripped off the punches i was very upset the part number on the box was the same as the true fowler part number in an apparent effort to fool prospective buyers do not be fooled if you want a cheap set there are less expensive sets available at amazon if you want a true fowler set look elsewhere,116,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,as soon i opened the box it literally came falling out of the box the carrier was complete garbage if that is the kind of quality that it has when it is first opened I am not even going to try the punches so i will be returning this,46,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,this is not a high quality fowler tool this is a chinese clone at best although the part number matches the fowler product they do not import and resell chinese tools clearly deceptive advertising,34,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,I am using these punches for rivet and grommet setting great set came really oiled i guess they are worried about rust the stand is pretty floppy but if you keep them in the original box it will last great variety of sizes,40,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,original shipping envelope allowed stone to be broken in shipment amazon immediately replacedno charge only with my notification by e-mail i am very happy with sharpener and with buying from amazon js,34,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the only instructions are diagrams no words on the back of the package and it took me a couple minutes to figure out how to adjust the blade holder once set up the tool and supplied stones did a great job on my plane blades and an old chisel very pleased,51,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this product worked well when used to sharpen several wood chisels and a blade for a small block plane the device used to hold the end of the chisel / blade at the proper attitude relative to the sharpening stone worked really well,41,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone itself has several spots where it protrudes out in a significant bump forcing me to avoid that area when sharpening in addition the fine grit side did not come flat so when using the sharpening jig i can not get continuous flat contact,44,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I have used this product a few times i have to say is cery badly made plastic rollers are drilled of center so it wobbles so bad the degrees guide is just as bad made of plastic and can not even find a flat spot on the jig to make your chisel parallel to the jig worse jig i have purchased the cheaper one are better than this one do not get started with the oil stone completely garbage made my chesils and planes so much worse,84,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i have tried to hand sharpen my chisels that was a mistake and this system fixed them and now can use chisels in the way they were meant to be used never put water on the stone made a mess that was my fault and am still working on it to get the rust out but the system is pretty darn good and will use it till the stone is a nub,72,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,seems to work ok identification buy another bottle of oil if you do not have any the stone soaked up the entire bottle that is provided before i could sharpen anything the angle gauge is flimsy it is just a piece of plastic that you flip over it does work but i know that I am going to lose it rendering the entire thing useless update i used this thing with different stones and it worked pretty well i put in a plane iron and spent about 5 minutes on about 3 different stones it definitely does a better job at angles than i can I am leaving at 4 stars due to the wiggly plastic angle gauge,115,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the sharpening stone seems decent and the sharpening oil usable the problem is the sharpening guide it could have been good if the wheels on the sharpening guide were made of something other than cheap plastic aside from the fact that they are plastic the wheels also seem to wobble a bit i was excited about getting a new sharpening guide but this was disappointing,65,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,does a good job but the directions were a little unclear as how to set it up the way i needed,21,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,verry disappointed with this buy the stone looks like a banana and the guide is worthless can not tighten the screws to hold a chisel in place and the plastic angle guide is so sloppy is useless,36,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone and the jig are fine but the oil bottle was empty very disappointed,15,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great got my stanley jack plane honed to perfection,10,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i love this product it is easy to understand and use and i get consistency with every time i sharpen my chisels on plane blades,24,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this thing is as cheap as can be it does hold the chisel or plane blade securly but had to use a metal ruler to get it straight in the clamp it comes with a guide to do this but it is plastic and moves all of the place so you can not trust it the wheels on the jig are made of plastic and horrible the oil stone it comes with acts like every other oil stone and clogs up and it is worthless 5 seconds into the sharpening process i used the jig on sandpaper and water stones to get my plane blade sharp threw the rest away,107,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,really did not like using the oil otherwise it is ok,9,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,it is everything that i expected it to be,9,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,everything needed to keep my chisels sharp i recommend,9,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,excelletn quality and just right for my favorite chisels and bench planners,12,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,there are way better options out there for under 25 the guide is loose sloppy and make it very difficult to square your blade due to it being a top clamp style the stone is bottom of the barrel it might make a good edging stone for landscaping although oil is good although but then again a glass of tap water will work as well so,66,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very good it met all of my expect ions thanks,10,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the stone had a big divot in the middle of the fine side the angle guide works although,18,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great deal all works as expected at half the cost of a local store,14,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the stone and oil were fine but the actual tool is sloppy and not well made,16,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not great guide is garbage no way to reliably repeat grinds with any accuracy will not buy again stone not marked and grits feel same total waste of money,28,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the rollers on the guide wobble this also arrived damaged and leaking in the package i know that is not applicable to every single unit sold but that is what happened to mine I shall use the sharpening stone to sharpen blunt force tools like axes but this is not going to be used for chisels and plane irons,55,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,there has better ones out there harbor freight amigos,8,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great love that you can lock down the chisel and sharpen it,13,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i use it many times a tear and it works great evry time,13,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,got to buy a different one do not like it at all like my dad used to say sometimes cheap is expensive live and learn,28,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,sharpen all of my planes and chisels the day i got this kit great for my wood shop,18,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone was not flat and the guide was very difficult to set properly getting the chisel or plane blade set square was too tedious i would not recommend this product at all,33,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,cheap poor construction plastic wheels finger tight locking only sloppy angle gauge and the list goes on if you just want something to sharpen and take the chips out of your beater chisels you do not care about this is a good choice if you want a decent guide for your work chisels that you count on keep looking,58,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,sub par was looking for a cheaper solution to sharpen my plane irons but i should have just gone with the japanese water stones they do not even tell you which stone is which if you need to sharpen stones go get a good set of water stones and save yourself the hassle,51,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the hone broke on the first day of use the plastic bushings keeps coming out and it is all very flimsy,19,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,love it great for the mature home carpenter,8,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this was quite a disappointment my first order arrived with the stone broken in three pieces this was not a big deal as amazon was awesome and replaced it with no trouble when i received the replacement and started trying to use it however it is kind of a piece of garbage the stone has inconsistencies that because audible clicks while sharpening and has a visible bow to it from the factory causing grinds to be slightly convex on the rough side and concave on the fine side which increases the work of sharpening by a lot and reduces control of the angles there is also a raised burr on one end of the stone on the fine side which you run the risk of slamming your freshly honed blade into if you are not attentive and careful the honing guide has a flat spot on one of it is wheels causing the blade to wobble while grinding in the end I am going to have to replace everything here with better products except for the oil which I have already mostly used on the stone I had recommend you skip this and go for something better this one does not even do the job as a cheaper entry level sharpening stone,204,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i bought this as a cheap way to get around buying diamond plates and it was definitely a shortcut i would not take again i just started restoring an old plane and although this would be an easy way to get started the honing guide is very inaccurate as the plastic piece that helps determine the angle is quite loose and not precise you could hone two different times and start honing a different angle from the initial time the stone also go clogged easily and soaked up quite a bit of the oil on the first use it is also a bit too narrow for a plane it will work but a larger surface would be much easier spend a little bit more money and do not waste your time on this product it might be good for other projects like small knife sharpening but the honing guide is a paperweight now,151,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,no directions had no clue what i was supposed to do or on which side to start the process soaked up all the oil did not sharpen as needed should have returned,30,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,instructions are not very helpful but once you figure out which sides of the stone are course and fine it does do a good job on chisels if they are simply dull this is what you need if they are in bad shape you will need to have them professionally re-cut,47,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i bought this as spare kit to keep as i got one in use it may not as the pro but if you pay more attention to try it you may find this is a fine tool for sharpening your knife chisel or plane blade,45,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,everything is sharp now just hope we do not cut ourselves,11,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,very good my chisels have never been sharper and square i could sharpen my chisel but the points were not square and this made it real easy,27,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,bought some used wood planes for a great price i needed a sharpener to keep them sharp thanks to businesses who sell on amazon i was able to get a sharpener,31,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,bought this a month ago to sharpen chisels it does not clamp the steel as solidly as i would have liked and it is slightly difficult to ensure the object it is truly square in the gig i bought a less expensive guide from a fine woodworking company and have no issues with the new purchase,54,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,my first impression when i received this was it looked like a cheap quality especially the plastics on top of it which guide the angle length of the blade being sharpened but i guess what has more you could expect from the already such a low price in use it does the job pretty well with two issues one is to check alignment of the blade being sharpened the other is to keep the blade locked in position i have to re-tightened both knob tight as he shall just to keep the blade from sliding and misaligned,95,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this is a truly remarkable peice of junk got it and the stone was severely crooked and the guide is absolutely subpar the oil i did not use as i sent it back come on stanley you used to be a decent manufacturer,43,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,works ok but is hard to keep parallel adjustment screws are hard to turn,14,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,my husband is very happy with the sharpening system,9,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works very well however i did need to look online for a video on how to use it graphical instructions were useless,23,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great product instructions pretty well suck but the device and stone are top notch anyone with some experience working with their hands should be able to figure it out i would buy it again,34,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not very good flimsy and inaccurate the stone is also under any expectations the simple made-in-china ebay items are much better,21,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the guide will get you out of square and the stones need too much lapping because the guide makes a dent down the middle the oil is great buy a super cheap diamond sharpening box for 15 and vice style honing guide for 12 you can get very sharp that way this system is frustrating and makes you think you are doing something wrong,64,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works great but it takes a little practice,8,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this is a well-made product at a good price shipment arrived on schedule,13,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,just as described good product at a good price highly recommend,11,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very handy I am just getting into sharpening and this has helped tremendously I shall probably upgrade to something else in the future but I am glad i bought this,28,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this has worked well for me for it is intended purpose it is not the best quality but it is good as a carpenter I have used it to keep my chisels and plane blades sharp for the last 4 years using the guide seems like a hassle in the middle of a job it can be a little tedious to square but it really does give you a better cuttingwhen you can keep the blade angle perfectly straight the only improvement I had like to see on this is a guide to help square what ever blade you are putting in it if you are not sharping blades all the time you really do not need the guide but what i paid for this was about the same as the price of a decent stone and small bottle of oil anyways so i basically got the guide for free i consider that to be a good value but do your own pricing research before you buy if cost is an issue for you,169,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great i really like the way it holds the chisels so tightly i have used numerous sharpening systems for my chisels and planes and this one works the best so far but what else would you expect from stanley good buy for a great price,46,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the real way to sharpen things to a razors,10,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,got this as a gift for the holidays not great it does not tell you which side is a finer grit and it is hard to tell by just feeling it the gauge i do not use as it seems clunky and just seems easier to do by hand the oil soaks straight into the stone so it provides very little lubrication i ended up getting wet / dry sandpaper of varying grits and wrapping it around the stone to sharpen my chisels the surface is flat which is the only thing i really like about it but i could have gotten the same effect from an old piece of glass so overall I had save your money and get something different,116,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,nice good material and build quality looks feels solid i like so far,13,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,while certainly cheaper than some of the other honing jigs out there I have noticed a tendency of most chisels to skew as I am sharpening i notice this even although i try to make it really tight i did not notice this as much with my hand plane blades i do like the built in angle measuring function it is really handy and makes changing your angle easy that is kind of put to the side although if things shift too easily there are markings that are supposed to help you keep things straight but they are not incremental enough for the common chisels that i put in 1/4 1/2 3/4 and 1 - 1/2 i am admittedly new at this with a honing jig so perhaps i just need more practice i spent a couple of afternoons cleaning up some old blades and there is a large improvement in sharpness i do wish there was a way to ensure that the blade is hitting the stone more flat so that it does not create an angled bevel,172,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,nice system and it works guide for proper angle of sharpening chisels,12,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i could not wait for this product to arrive sharpening planes and chisels can be a pain and if you do not do it correctly those tools will not work very well as soon as it got here i put it to the test it performed flawlessly i sharpened several planes and chisels and they are sharp as razors what a great product,60,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I am not one who writes negative reviews very often but in this case this guide is not worth the money the stone is cheap and i was ok with that but the guide is darn near useless you can not get the blades to site square and forget about a chisel for something as important as keeping hand tools sharp spend the extra money and get a better quality i can not stress enough how useless the guide is might as well do it freehand,83,64
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i love this product it makes my tools nice and sharp i would totally recommended,15,65
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,could not be cheaper find a better quality one than this,11,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it works great slow as any hand operation would be but you control things and this jig lelps,18,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i purchased thissometime ago i had several chisels that needed touched up so i decide to open this up and try it i will tell you the quality of the stone is terrible the stone started to dish within a dozen passes across it the jig seems to have a good design by the appearance but it is awful it does not apply enough pressure to keep a chisel tight i could freehand on a bench grinder and have a better finish i would not recommend this to anyone i usually use a good stone and do it by hand and that is what i will be doing in the future,112,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,do not waste your money the only redeeming thing about this set is you can use the stone for something else,21,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great product and explains how to use it so well a middle school kid can use it,17,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,why do i love it for 10 i get a stone some oil and a simple jig hard to find a place to go and eat for less than 10 i have some simple chisel i use every blue moon they are dull but i do not throw things away i used the jig yesterday and they are sharp now professional sharp i do not think so 100 square nope but way better than it was before there is not enough oil to soak the stone i used simple air tool oil i had around and it worked fine some of the reviews here i do not understand professional wood worker implies that he spend hundreds of for good chisel and buys a simple jig for 10 to sharpen them give me a break i saved 5 chisel yesterday even when i buy new ones from the chinese tool store i pay way more and they are still not as sharp as mine now for the money I am happy,167,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,a bit difficult to set up the instructions on setting the angle of the blade is poor could use a more cutting oil a lot more for the stone drinks up huge amounts of oil leaving little on the surface i used up half the bottle with one small plane blade and one spokeshave blade once set up it does and ok job,64,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i was long over due on the purchase of this it is a must have tool if you have wood cutting tools most of the newer tools are made outside of this country and tend to dull faster than normal so far so good,42,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works as advertised with a little learning curve oil is not enough for much more than a few sharpenings as the stone really soaks it up fast die cast tool guide is a bit cheap with the plastic angle indicater price is rite,43,74
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,big stone bigger than i wanted but not complaining about getting more than i paid for,16,75
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,save your money this sharpening jig is crap it is nearly impossible to square your blade in the jig and one of the plastic rollers that helps the jig slide across the stone was lopsided and caused the blade to wobble side to side when i tried to sharpen it,50,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,would not call this a sharpening system more like a sharpening gadget dont waste your money,15,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,if you are looking at this system you are probably a low-budget entry-level woodworker the tool holder is fine but the stone is junk just buy a good diamond stone the dmt and you will end your suffering trying to sharpen chisels and plane blades,43,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,in order to post a rating you have to give it a star well i over rated it,18,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,makes sharpening my chisels and hand planers really easy,9,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,pros cheap does the job quite well cons plastic parts seem flimsy but non have broken it is kind of hard to set it up correctly but you will get the hang of it you will quickly run out of oil,38,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i received mine with a broken stone but i already had others so i did not care about that i mainly just wanted the angleand was extremely dissapointed with the quality of it the oil is fine but the angle guide fell apart after about the third chisel i sharpend,51,82
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the honing guide is really flimsy the stones are not very flat the oil is not any better than water I had look for something just a little more expensive i did buy the cheap diamond honing set about 9 and they worked much better than this stone on the look out for a better honing guide now,56,83
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,stone came gouged on one side the guide is cheesed quality and there were no decent instructions,17,84
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great got a finefrom the start as long as you do not bite into the stone and use the oil you will get great results,27,85
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,my stone came with a crown on the course side and cupped on the fine side and the angle guide is not accurate time after time very disappointing,28,86
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i do handy jobs around the house this is a good addition to your tool set not expensive no need to deal with blunt knives and chisel anymore,28,87
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not very useful because the stone is too small it is not capable of taking the widths of chisels advertised without major gymnastics and with the loss of any straightaccuracy ok for very narrow chisels I am glad i did not pay full price for what i received,48,88
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone keeps clogging up with the oil that came with the kit at this point the stone is unusable the holder is difficult to get the correct angle needed to sharpen properly all-in-all a waste of money i had to go to a local hardware store and get another stone and honing oil that one worker flawlessly a total piece of junk,63,89
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,waste of time and money you can not ensure you are installing the blade square to the holder / stone not worth the cost to send it back headed to the metal recycling bin,31,90
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,it holds firmly and rolls smoothly it takes some trial and error to a blade for a plane nice and square but once you get it right it holds tightly the stone is a good size and holds up to heavy use but the edges were not very smooth when i got it it had kind of a crown going a round it a few seconds with a cheap diamond plate solved that,72,91
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,it is not well made the stone can be dressed but there is no hope for the clamp it wobbles very badly because the rollers are very out of round,29,92
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this sharpening system is a waste of money received the stone broken in half and the part to clamp the blade in is very hard to adjust and falls apart save your money i expected better of stanley,38,93
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great but watchout for stone breaking during shipment,8,94
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,a little complicated but worked as advertised as long as you know how to use the stone,17,95
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,it works but only after fiddling around with the 2 adjustment knobs that move the piece that secures your blade to the guide then there has the let us save and use low quality plastic parts on critical areas like the nuts that the adjustment screws screw into and the hones wheels the part that actually rolls back and forth across your stone plastic cmon like most things now days quality is on the decline while prices go up just another sign that americas end is near,85,96
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great stone hones anything you put to it this is a nice kit and easy to use the angle guide is helpful but not perfect I have ended up going freehand most of the time,34,97
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i received this sharpening system today and quickly went to the chisels the first thing i noticed was that it does not tighten to the sides of the blade causing you to take great care in order ensure that the blade is square and true to the stone the stone seems to be of decent quality and i think the system will work okay i believe you will be much happier with the robert larson honing guide for 12 here on amazon although it does not come with a stone it is still the better buy,94,98
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,for me this works really well i just use it for sharpening chisels with a little patience and a sharpie the plastic piece that flips out works well to set the angle i just draw a line across the micro-bevel to make sure that I am sharpening evenly my chisels come out really sharp,53,99
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,we get about a 1/2 day between sharpening of the stanley chisels which i do with a stanley sharpening tool with wheels which i spite of some unproductive negative reviews works quite well i also use the 1200 grit eze-lap 61sf as the stone i also use various 300 - 1000 grit wet or dry sandpaper for the coarse adjustments in the beginning of a lap as we use then we hold a chisel vertical and either drag it towards or away from ones self good boat guys learn to push it away but i lack the acquired strength and drag it towards this can be done with or without heat if the varnish or cetol is thick heat it with the cheap harbor freight heat shrink gun until it bubbles a little and quickly drag the chisel and it comes right off easily,142,100
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the stanley honing guide is wonderful there is no rocking no guessing about whether the wheel is level on the stone i am getting perfect edges and my woodworking is much better as a result,35,101
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my father retired contractor he loved it and wants another one for back up,19,102
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,something that keeps chisels and plane blades sharp,9,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great for sharpening plane blades and chisels the holder accurately holds the tool in place and let us you get a real good,23,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,angle guide is a little stiff so take your time and work adjusting screws evenly when fitting a blade used it to put a niceon 3 old plane irons and seems to work well for my needs,39,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this product is incredibly cheap and you get what you pay for the sharpening stone is warped / distorted one side has a crown and a cup on the other side so one side contacts the out side edges of the blade and when you flip it for the finer grit it only contacts the center i will try and flatten it before i throw it in the trash now the honing guide looks pretty cheap and parts are stamped out of thin metal but is fairly easy to use and some what sturdy then it appears to be although i could easily imagine most people having aligning and squaring up the blade issues i would not recommend this product and plan to replace i do find it very intriguing that all of the amazon verified reviewers rated it 5 stars would be surprised if they ever laid eyes on the product or removed it from package,155,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,if you truly use hand planes and you take pride in your work and tools for work or hobby you would never use this product garbage,25,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,nice sharpening stone and holder set used it to sharpen 2 wood chisels and 2 block planes worked very good on all 4 different tools and had no problem making them all sharp would buy again as it is a very good tool set at a very good price,49,108
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,nice sharpening stone will work great for planer blades,9,109
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,good value for the kit for sharpening tools,8,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,worked well the guide is not the best but for the price does the job,15,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i have another less expensive sharpening guide that has worked well but when i needed a second guide i thought I had try the stanley i have any number of stanley tools old and more recent although more recent examples exhibit declining quality i find with this guide accurate angles are impossible to acquire and reliably adjust and when trying to extract a spoke shave iron for example the tool came to pieces I am done with it I shall try to return this for a refund or else pitch it i urge prospective buyers to beware,93,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,just received this piece of junk what happened to stanley tool works silly thing comes with pictures on how it is supposed to work could not make heads or tails from the pictures pieces fell off the stone is to course for fine tools in general i will be returning for a refund total junk made in the country that is supplying most of our junk,61,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,I have been hesitated when i bought this product i found a lot more choices out there with a lot more good reviews but when the delivery came all the doubts were answered got fine honed and sharp plane blades 4 and 5 and chisels with scary sharp method throw the oil stone for kitchen knives and always have the true surface and fresh grit let the jig works and it pays beautiful flat and square bevel I have just started in woodworking for hobby andprojects this jig have reasonable price and become my entry point to sharpen my blade i never have confident nor satisfaction on my hands free sharpening this jig helps me a lot like it,119,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it is a lot of work to sharpen one plane iron be prepared to be at this for quite awhile be patient getting it adjusted right is going to take some tinkering re-check that you have that right angle and that your blade is in there straight after you have been grinding a little while you do not want to have ground halfway there and then find out you are doing it on an angle you will be able to see what you have done on the iron still a lot easier than freehanded,91,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this stone is good for sharpening a camping knife but i used the jig with a japanese water stone and it is way sharper,23,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,there is a small learning curve to use this but i have found it to work as it should and have had no problems with it i carry it in my tool bucket and use it as needed,38,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the instructions are worthless you basically have to already know or figure out how to use it it is not clear which side of the stone is which it worked fine for sharpening the blade for the stanley plane i just bought but only because the plane came with detailed instructions for sharpening it,53,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i returned this piece of junk for a refund does not hold chisels at all and it is impossible to square plane irons blades with thumb screw clamp plastic wheels are not true and round and probably would not last stone is a cheap 3 stone like harbor freight purchased a stanley combination square that was not square and took it back too walmart stanley tools chinese made are junk like every other imported pos sold with aj american name shame on stanley,80,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i bought this to give my chisels a quick hone between jobs and it works good for that price was right quality is a bit mickey mouse will see how it stands up for the quickon a already fairly sharp tool it works good but is a little labor intensive if you try refurbishing a rough blade,59,120
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the price was right and that i did like the rolling holder for the chisels which i did not intent to use does not look like it would work and in fiddling with it it fell into small pieces the stone itself is fine to put a roughon a camping knife and it is small enough to throw in a backpack pouch and forget about til you need it,70,121
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this is a good sharpening system i have and prefer the veritas system however because it is easier to set up otherwise this works just as well,27,122
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i purchased this product to sharpen chisels and plane irons the guide is so-so the irons move side to side in the carriage while sharpening and there has too much slop in the built in angle gauge to be useful the stones that come with the guide are horrible they are not even flat one end of the fine side of the stone is curved up like the grinder stopped in that spot are no instructions about how to condition the stone or use the guide all-in-all i can sharpen better without this product i definitely do not recommend buying this,100,123
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,mediocre at best very light duty and will wear out fast i think i will replace it with the work sharp ws3000 wood tool sharpener in the near future b000pvhimw,33,124
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,impossible to accurately set the bevel on plane irons and difficult to properly set-up for chisel blade sharpening i only use the stone and oil from the set,28,125
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very clear directions very effective honing the planer knife i wanted it to use it for identification you have a hand planer it is a valuable tool,27,126
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,holding the blade only by the front and back face leaves no way to square the90 degrees to the sides other than just eye-balling it,27,127
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i hate to say it but this is a very low-quality product and not worthy of the stanley name the main body is made of stamped and bent sheet metal the fit and finish are rough and there is only one low-tolerance roller resulting in wobbling blades and chisels are also not held firmly resulting in rounded corners finally the stone itself is adequate for rough sharpening only and blades will require finishing on a much finer stone to be usuable bottom line what appears to be a good value is a waste of money for anyone who desires finely and accurately sharpened blades if you can afford it save your money for something better,115,128
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i got the system to clean up my chisels and planes and worked fine i would recommend to anyone who wants to clean up their tools,26,129
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,meets expectations i had problems to place a chisel 1 but i think a good tool sorry for the bad english,22,130
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i managed to get two damaged chisels through my medium 1000grit stone before i noticed that cheep plastic wheels had developed flat spots which began causing the guide to skip drift or oscillate depending on pressure rendering it useless the combination stones grits feels to me to be in the neighborhood of a 250/600 but I am just guessing since there was no nomenclature defining grits provided in the kit the white oil leaking slightly on-arrival and worked fine for it is part in the sharpening process there is probably enough to recover three to five significantly damaged 1 chisels but i did not buy this kit for the stone or oil i bought it for the guide which for me was a waste of my time and money especially since i built a simple jig similar to the one in kwbs posted pictures pros cheep includes oil and a stone cons requires modification to work correctly easily broken poorbottom line this tool does not perform satisfactorily i would not buy it again,170,131
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,for under 20 this is worth buying but if you want a good stone make the investment there has a reason sharpening stones are so expensive i sharpened 2 chisels making sure to vary strokes so i would not form a groove and the stone still wore very unevenly the guide is worth 20 itself just what i needed and pretty easy to set I am still pretty disappointed I am about to go shop for a new stone,75,132
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this kit is perfect for wood workers who like to keep sharp tools it has everything you need to perform a profession job of sharpening your tools and is easy to use,32,133
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I am a beginning wood worker and bought some planes second hand and wanted to sharpen them before using i bough this kit because it had the stone and oil included and i generally think of the stanley brand as being of decent quality for someone that is not going to be using daily them for professional purposes I have read articles and watched videos on sharpening plane blades i tried to use this guide but as stated in many other reviews it is virtually impossible to get the blade square in the guide then once i got the blade into the guide it was a huge pain in the a to get it out of the guide the cheap plastic pieces that the adjustment screws go into are horrible the rollers are cheap plastic as well I shall chock this one up to my own idiocy of not reading all the reviews of others who bought this before ordering and i will be purchasing a clamp type guide in the very near future and it will not have the name stanley on it,180,134
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,there is no better engineered and constructed wood working tools than those made by stanley they are consistantly of the highest quality,22,135
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,theis poorly machined and fitting the chisle in the guide especially since clear directions were non-existant very disappointed with the,23,136
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i got this kit to sharpen my woodworking chisels and plane blades it is worked quite well so far the honing guide requires careful adjustment to get the blade square but it is not that hard to do so the stone is a bit gritty but that is fine with me if you are looking for a decent cheap sharpening kit this one is a solid choice you might also check rockler for the irwin / marple equivalent of this which a friend of mine bought and is happy with,84,137
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this sharpening system is constructed very poorly from the cheap loose adjustment screws to the plastic angle adjustment gauge i would not recommend this product the stone even had voids in the surface on the fine side poor quality all the way around,43,138
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this is a reasonably cheap and good little sharpening guide it is not fantastically robust the plastic guide on mine broke making selecting the correct angle difficult but not impossible but for someone who sharpens his tools only a few times a year it is perfectly adequate it works well on my stanley plane blade easily taking out a notch caused by a hidden metal fragment and it cleaned up and sharpened my chisels extremely well it takes a little care to set it up properly but all in all it is excellent value for money,96,139
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i initially rated this stone highly but after using it for a few weeks i have found it to be too soft and dusty to be much use for chisels or blades the size is awesome and i am able to sharpen blades fairly well but it is difficult and spews powder residue all over on the rough side the fine side is useless i really wanted it to be good american quality it is not stanley should drop any poor suppliers as soon as possible while their name still has some shine on it their tools so far are still good this stone is not,102,140
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,excellent sharpening tool for plane blades got my stanley block plane razor sharp you just have to be careful and adjust the angle of the blade oil the stone and sharpen away i got the blade sharp enough to cut paper easily after sharpening the block plane never worked better get it sharpen your blades but take your time to adjust it and put the blade back in the plane correctly,71,141
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this simple sharpening set is worth every penny paid sure it could be better be more precise better made larger stones and it could also have cost 3 or 4 times as much too for the price this is the best thing i have found and it does with careful use do a good job i wish it had been made a touch more precise for setup and adjustment to keep the blade set just right centered and perfectly aligned but with a little extra care this does an excellent job i have not seen any better that you can afford to buy and use i did my first chizle this week and you could shave with it when done i would still buy it again,126,142
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this product the sharpening stone is extremely warped and spending the time to flatten the stone would take days the gauge is terribly cheap and it is very difficult to keep your iron or chisel square there are better gauges out there for similar cost,51,143
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,if you need a decent way to sharpen your 10 set of chisels and your 15 block plane this is the kit for you it is not real elegant but so what do you really need perfectly square tips to clean up notches you made with a circular saw this thing is good enough for your utility chisels and block planes both of which work a lot better sharp you will see if you need something better than this you probably know it if you just like having quality gear get a veritas,91,144
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i consider this a total waste of money for the very simple reason that it is imposible to clamp a chisel or plane blade squarely there is no straightto register theof the blade on also the wheels are remarkably cheap plastic i am going to buy one of the standerdstyle guides,57,145
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i purchased one of these from amazoncom as an experiment to see how these lightbulbs performed i was fore-warned from other reviews that the bulbs were very blue and pretty dim and that they were i could tell a night-and-day difference between this bulb and an ordinary incandescent it is very noticeably dimmer than the energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs i have around my house so why do i like them well an ordinary incandescent bulb might use 60 watts of power and this thing uses 3 even 60-watt replacement compact fluorescent bulbs use about 17 watts of power so these bulbs even make other energy saving bulbs look like power hogs by comparison the key consideration before buying is where you think relatively dim bulbs might make sense for your needs for me i have a porch light and two lights on either side of my garage that run all night the light is enough to illuminate that outdoor area well enough and since the lights run all night using these light bulbs saves quite a bit of juice my recommendation would be to use these bulbs as dim porch lights or maybe hallways but use compact florescent bulbs indoors if you need more lighting,204,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,fair chance this bulb will last forever as in ones life time if you do not keep it on 24/7 not supossed to be very subseptible to failure via repeated on / off cycles the phosphor that provides the white light may well degrade with time although principle problem is output you will not be able to use this for anything but going to the bathroom in the middle of the night perhaps some minimal outdoor lighting if push comes to shove you can read with it funky bluish,86,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,the light from this bulb is so blue that it seems like one of those bluish fluorescent lightbulbs that are used for fish tanks or raising certain plants indoors i mean it it is blue on the good side it does seem durable the spread of light is wide and even just like an incandescent bulb and it is output is similar to a 15w bulb if they would just replace the leds inside with warm white leds this would be a good product,83,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i bought the westinghouse nanolux led bulb and the cc vivid 36 led bulb at the same time to see which would work better as a low-power porch light even although both are rated at 3 watts the cc vivid is noticeably brighter although still not much and has a 60000 hour expected life-span instead of 50000 for the nanolux however it has a sharper cut-off due to the design of it is base and is significantly more expensive than the nanolux since i have both the cc vivid wins as the porch light while the nanolux might make adequate accent lighting,101,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,had not real high hopes based on current reviews but figured these might work in multiple lamp applications and close lighting naaahhh headboard reading light about 2 from page too dim to read multiple lamp application in ceiling fan night light only sorrrry back they go suitable for mood lighting only and at our age mood for what,57,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i bought this bulb on 2/3/2009 to use as a safety light inside the house in an air conditioned and heated area and have had it turned on almost continuously since february 2009 this march 2011 the bulb stopped producing light after only 19000 hours of continuous burn the bulb is currently advertised for 50000 hours so I am due another 31000 hours i checked the bulb in other working sockets and the bulb still did not work i installed another brand of light bulb in the socket used by this bulb and the other bulb worked so the problem was not the socket the problem was the bulb i should have returned the bulb but it took me a while to figure out when i had ordered the bulb by the time i figured out amazons new reports feature it was too late i had hacked open the bulb looking for a loose connection lesson keep an led light bulb diary and separate led warranty file therefore this bulb deserves a poor review,172,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,bought these to replace the bulbs in our exit lights and they work great hope they last 4 years like advertised good company to do business with,27,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,ok so they have a small lag time when you flip the switch and are not as bright as other led lights but come on their 3 freaking watts what do you expect i am running these in areas where there are 2 to 3 bulbs like my ceiling fan and more works great and puts off soft light i have bought more than 5 and expect i will purchase more love them and they are great running off my solar back up,80,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,the westinghouse nanolux light bulb is superb and meets my need for great area lighting and low energy consumption westinghouse 03466 nanolux 3-watt g19 led bulb white,29,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,this is a very small bulb it is the equivalent of a 20 watt incandescent we are using it as a nightlight in a living room this is a good light that is non-polluting no mercuryit is a long lasting bulb about 50000 hours,46,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,fyi do not buy this bulb i bought it to try the new technology and this model is worthless not enough light to do anything even three in the bathroom fixture could not light the small bathroom maybe in a couple of years they will get this right stay with cfl for now,51,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,purchased to place in hood over stove even with light yellow metal of hood underside as well as shiny mesh vent screen it did not give off enuff light to even cook by so into alamp on lamp of three to see how it would reflect off cream walls / white ceiling okay to leave on for when darkness sets in and one enters that room otherwise it can be a very expensive purchase when there are other energy saving solutions out there maxxima mln-10 led night light with sensor pack of 4 these will light ur way into a room and when left in 24/7 go off when sunlight or lamps are turned on a much better investment than a single bulb that is dimmer than these,136,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i have many led head lamps and they are all brighter than this bulb why is it that we can not seem to find an led bulb that puts out any light for a good price and low watts frustrated,39,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these are soooo blue they barely illuminate at all bummer is not blue enough to use as holiday lights and the base is so wide i could not get them in walkway lights about the only thing they are barely useable for bottom line a waste of material mine are being returned i have others that are white so i am an led fan,64,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,well since stores do not carry these items yet in my area for all to see actual examples i ordered a few to try and i have to say that i am disappointed these bulbs are not that great at all and barely light a space enough to see they produce a very blue glow that seems like you are looking through night vision goggles only blue inand not white i wish manufacturers would understand the difference between thespectrum and correctly advertise the product so i think i will be returning them all for a full refund do not waste your money i have heard that there is a particular brand of led bulb coming to home depot that will actually fool most people so i am hoping to give it a try when i recieve a refund,142,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i bought this bulb to try out as a replacement for my 15w cfl reading light unfortunately i did not read some of the other comments closely enough and found out too late that this is an incredibly dim lightbulb do not buy this bulb unless you have a very specific low-lumens use in mind it is not adequate for much more than mild accent lighting comparable to a night light or less really,73,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i had hoped to replace some 25 watt light bulbs with these but they are much to dim and the lightis a distinct blue even with all five bulbs in place in the bathroom fixture the bathroom was dark and blue a definite no i have placed these in outside fixtures out back to provide a guide to the door they are not bright enough for much else not a 25 watt bulb replacement maybe a 10 - 15 watt equivalent and then there is the distinct blueof the light summary i do not like it,97,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,literally pennies on the dollar for where ever you need just enough light to walk or for a reading lamp that is very close to your head as long as you do not mind blue light i do not i actually find leds much better for reading in general although i have these particular bulbs in hallway and porch light if you are an energy minimalist you can not possibly beat the quality of this almost unbreakable indoor / outdoor bulb for the price yes i dropped one from a ladder unbreakable but I shall be more excited when true 60w white light replacements are available for under 10 because there are really only a very few places in the house where this makes any sense at all in fact i bought three and wonder what to do with the third since the other two will practically never need to be replaced best use in outside fixtures and walkways that are on all night all to help slow your meter down and get under baseline not to mention never need to climb the ladder there again they are rated to burn for almost 58 years,189,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,trying to go green but these light bulbs are way too dim great for kids room nightlights,17,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,this is a great bulb for accent lighting or using in multiples for a lighting fixture,16,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,when selecting an led bulb it is important to check the wattage of the bulb and compare that to how you intend to use the bulb most led incandescent replacement bulbs are in two wattages 3 watt which is about equivalent to a 20 watt incandescent bulb 7 watt which is about equivalent to a 50 watt incandescent bulb if you are familiar with compact fluorescent bulbs then you may notice the wattage equivalence is not the same there is a difference in light output between a 7 watt fluorescent and a 7 watt led on the whole you will need many led bulbs to replace incandescent or fluorescent bulbs in the same lighting situation a typical light in a living room for instance may use a 150 watt incandescent bulb in order to get somewhere near the same amount of light that living room need three led bulbs to replace the incandescent bulb finally the type of led bulb needs to be chosen carefully unless you are ok with a very blue cast to the light rather than the light orange cast of incandescents or soft white of the more popular brands of compact fluorescents,196,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this led light bulb preformed below expectations this bulb uses 3 watts of electricity but puts out less luminosity than 13 watt led light bulbs costing about one third the price i would not recommend buying this led light bulb lesson learned not all led light bulbs are created equal,50,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,I am not sure what the other reviewers are talking about this light is bright i have a breezeway between the garage and house where themajority of people enter i wanted a light i could keep on all the time for guests and myself trying to put your key in the hole in total darkness really sucks so for 3 watts i figured i could keep it on 24/7 without much impact i wanted something fairly dim that would just allow me to see the door and lock this light is almost too bright and illuminates all of the breezeway and some of the driveway i would not use it for task lighting too dim or a night light too bright but as an entryway light it is superb,128,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i like this bulb as a bright night-light i think it is good if that is what you want and you are fine with the white bluish colored light if you are expecting greater light output or warm white light then you will be disappointed pros the spread / distribution of the light is better more omni-directional than typical for led bulbs indoor or outdoor other easily noticeable blueishbrightness seems just a bit brighter than a 4 watt incandescent night-light bulb i also found a nice use for them in my fridge they are not as bright as a 40w appliance bulb and are bluish but they sure do generate a lot less heat,116,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this bulb is clearly not a 3watts bulb as i have an led bulb from another manufacturer that is rated at the same 3watts that is so much brighter,29,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this bulb is dimmer than a 15 watt incandescent bulb i did not see any tv interference although the box says it could happen however this bulb is just too weak for any place i might use it the bulb comes in a nicely printed box this is unusual as most led bulbs purchased through the internet have plain white boxes with very little writing on them the price of this bulb seems to have varied widely from time to time and place to place in the last 2 months up to june 8 2010,95,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,the light works in and outdoors it puts out the light of a nightlight i put it in the garage which is always dark now i do not need to turn on the big lights every time i go in the gargag do not use it for a porch light or anything where you want real light,55,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these bulbs have a good build quality but they are not acceptable incandescent or fluorescent replacements,16,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i purchase two of these bulbs one is much brighter than the other and flickers both bulbs are dimmer than advertised and have a very very strong bluethese bulbs are about as bright as a 4 watt incandescent bulb but with a bluethe only application that this might work for is an inaccessible location that it is very hard to change the bulb and you want a very dim blue colored light otherwise do not buy to save energy the compact fluorescents are a much better choice but with a 3 - 4 watt bulb the old night light bulbs i use mine with an adaptor to fit in standard fixture does great and still uses so little energy after this purchase i realized i was being penny wise and pound foolish they are going back to amazon,139,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,they were too dim and i returned them they need to have a standard that let us the consumer know what the led light output is equivalent to in old wattage bulbs a simple 299 ge one led night light is better than these bulbs that would be okay as a night light but pricey when compared to a simple one led nightlight for 299 i tried to find out how bright these were and as i recall i did not see a equivalent too incandescent rating,85,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i should have listened to the reviews very dim and blue you best have a flashlight near by if you need to read anything they indicate by the picture to use outside it is not as bright as they show in the picture try 50 times dimmer,46,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,i bought one for my garage door opener it is dim but enough light for me to get out of my vehicle and in the house safely my cat likes to chase mice in the garage at night and leaving a dim bulb on hopefully gives her an advantage so far it has been a winner all the way low watt just enough light and hopefully out lasts the short lived regular bulbs my garage has 4 100 watt bulbs in the regular lighting system for when i need to see like unloading groceries over six months now and it has made me happy all the way if it lasts a few years and saves me a couple trips up and down aladder then it will fully deserve 5 stars only time will tell,136,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,be warned this light bulb provides light with a decidedly bluish cast and is not suitable not by a longshot as a replacement for a 60w incandescent light the light is dim enough so that from ten feet three meters or so i can not really distinguish colors of things however the bulb may actually be a bit too bright as a nightlight if your nightlight is close to your bed this is the good part this bulb is cool and easy to use if you need a nightlight and suspect you may forget to turn it off then this is the perfect light for you at only 3w it will not run up your electric bill there has no glass in this bulb at least as far as i can tell the bulb is plastic specially designed to disperse the light uniformly this bulb is not a spotlight,145,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,as other reviewers have noted this bulb is dim i was wanting to use it to light a closet where a dimmer bulb would be fine but after installing it the bulb turned out to be too dim for the closet i now use it in a lamp that is used like a night light,55,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,the bulb is great for a 3w bulb i have a stairway with a single socket lamp that used to get hot with a 60w bulb in it i replaced it with this 3w bulb and it is bright enough to use the stairs at night i can comfortably leave it on all night without using too much power and it stays cool,62,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,it is amazing that the quality of led bulbs have not developed farther along i have been experimenting with the various bulbs for a few years now and sadden to say that no major company has steeped forward to develop an led bulb that puts out a normal light which is useful i have led flashlights that will blind you and will spot you something at 75 feet why can not they do the same for househould led bulbs i just ordered 4 more which may have promise one set uses the luxtron led which is what they use in the flashlights I am keeping my fingers crossed,106,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,not a replacement for a flourescent bulb the advertised savings are not really there with these bulbs i bought some and was disappointed when they did not give the same amount of light as a 99 nite light i can not even read by their light these bulbs are so dim i love theof these things and I shall have to see what products are out there which can outlast flourescent bulbs,70,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,we bought a light for our daughters room as a night light the light was a perfect brightness for this but after 6 months a flicker developed after 9 months the light was occasionally going completely dark an led light bulb should last for multiple years not 6 months,49,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i bought two of these for our kenmore refrigerator that friends warned about having issues with the light switch breaking they ended melting the interior and nearly burning their fridge when the light switch broke and the two 60-watt bulbs stayed on for hours these led bulbs fit well into the fixture inside the fridge and even although at first they looked pretty dim compared to the overly bright 120 watt total of the factory bulbs now i really do not notice it i think putting two 60-watt incandescent bulbs into the fridge is insane and kenmore should be ashamed what happened to the 25 watt appliance lights i wish the price of these led lights was more affordable but considering they last so long i think it is worth it as long as you do not expect them to provide bright illumination that you get from old styles bulbs or cfl i think you will be happy with them,158,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product the light output is awful if you are expecting to use this bulb to replace a 20 watt or higher bulb please understand it is not suitable,33,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,very disappointing night lights are brighter than this puppy maybe they will get it right with the next design do not buy this,21,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,bought this to put in a swing arm lamp for reading at night about seven months ago works very well for this purpose light is cool white against the much more yellow incandescent light bulbs makes a little soft noise while warming up,43,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,has good dispersal of light and can be used in place of an incandescent bulb,15,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,understand when you buy this it gives about the light output of a 15 w incandescent bulb that being said i used it to replace a 15 w bulb as my front porch light and have been pleased with the results i previously had the 15 w bulb on a photoresist switch mount such that the light was only on when it was dark outside this led bulb was not happy with that switch flickers on / off rapidly so i removed the switch mount and the led bulb is on 24/7 [ that is still lower total power usage so no problem ] the bulb works well even in sub-zero temps it gives enough light to find the key hole on the door but not so bright as to attract swarms of bugs in the summer exactly the right mix for a porch light it is bluish-white compared to the deep yellow of it is predecessor but i do not mind that,158,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,this bulb makes the perfect night lite and for only 15 to 20 watts energy useage what more could i ask for,22,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,yes they save energy but at the cost of producing light so it kind of makes sense that they save energy all i can do is echo what most people here have already said these are very dim and very blue there are few applications these lamps are suited to other than slightly illuminating a dark hallway with a somber frigid glow look elsewhere if things like lumens and warmth matter to you,72,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,i recently ordered three of these bulbs and was pleasantly surprised by them they appear to be the equivalent of standard 20 watt bulb not a 20 watt cfl now i must say of the three bulbs i ordered one of them cast a greenish-yellow light the other two bulbs are bright white i wrote a letter to westinghouse and they promptly shipped out a replacement bulb with no hassle great customer service i would like to clearly state that this is no replacement for a 60 - 75 watt cfl but i have sensitive eyes so the dimmer light is preferable to me you can read with this bulb if you have a goose-neck reading lamp or a lamp that would accept multiple bulbs,122,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these bulbs are quite dim conclusion wait until leds improve or try another brand we have a pair of porch lamps after replacing one 13w cfl with this led bulb my wife said is it on comparing them side by side the cfl has about 4x the visible light output and about 4x the wattage so the led seems to have equal eyeball efficiency to the cfl if you are only concerned about getting your key in the door this is probably acceptable but for any kind of security move on i am trying to envision an indoor application because i bought 5 but can not unless you are living off the grid and concerned with every watt pass,118,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,if you are expecting this to be a bright light get a higher wattage bulb i use it in my backyard where it stays on from sundown to sunup and it is perfect for that just to give some light without being too bright and I am doing my part to reduce energy waste leaving this on for 10 hours is the same as leaving a 60 watt bulb on for 30 minutes,70,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,like has been said before this is roughly equivalent to 20 - 25w incandescent it is great in the fridge i do not feel the heat when i reach for stuff on the top shelf like i do with an incandescent and somewhat useful as a bedside light the one downside for use in a fridge is that the bulb is rather large about 25 diameter it is a tight squeeze for the fitting in my fridge,72,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,we have recessed lighting along our stairwell and these lights end up staying on 24/7 currently there are 5w cfls installed and i thought this would be an ideal application for led lighting the cfls are about half again too bright for what we need so i figured the leds might have a chance not even close at most they cast about a 2 - 3 halo of light and dim light at that beyond that radius not much help at all as a rough figure of merit i do not believe they cast as much light as a candle they are also a very blue light-but are so dim it really does not matter i expected some compromises with led lighting but these are just ridiculous i assume that leds that cost 10x as much as these might be useful but at current electric rates the payback is about 25 years i am hard pressed to come with an application where these might make sense given the duty cycle of a refrigerator light the payback is probably 25 years as well they might make a nice nightlight-except for the bulb base being a standard size i do not think thelends itself to mood lighting either,204,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,when we starting putting these 3-watt bulbs lamps and other mood or supplementary lighting these bulbs cost 25 a piece even at that price they were a bargain they use less than 1/10 of a 40 watt bulb and we have seen a marked decline in electric bills i certainly hope amazon will find and sell more led bulbs at the 5 and 6 watt range because these bulbs are a greatand make a significant dent in energy consumption,81,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,for close low light situations this lamp is pretty good a desk lamp especially with a downward facing shade a range hood that uses 2 bulbs 1 led light may or may not be enough the light is white not the warm yellow of incandescent bulbs but i like the white light this can also be used in a table lamp that would be used as a bright night light that illuminates most of a dark 10x12 room or for low level mood lighting not bright enough for me to read by but my preference is for a bright reading light recommend and will buy again,106,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,yes i read the reviews before i bought this but i decided to buy it anyway this light is so dim and so blue that it is not practical it is equal to about a 15 watt bulb not 40 if you want to try an led bulb then buy a brighter one based on the lumen rating after searching I have found a 13 watt led bulb with 900 lumen but it is 70 subtract wasted money from this and it is really only 60 edited 1 - 17 - 09 this light is dimmer than the 3 watt mini maglite mag lite,95,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,westinghouse 03466 nanolux 3-watt g19 led bulb white bought the bulb for back lighting behind my tv currently using a 40 watt incandescent which is a little too bright did not mind the super white bluejust not enough light here the haunted house description is very accurate no way could i read anything with this light in the room,63,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,if you like a good night lite that saves energy than this is your product otherwise they now sell xmas lights as leds alot cheaper than this or if you do not care living in a room that is like an solar eclipse far out man,45,56

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,the sad fact is this white led is the cheapest to manufacture that is why we see all of these blue white lights instead of the very nice warm leds that exist did you notice all the led christmas lights last year all very cold looking not what you want to see on a cold winter night but they are the cheapest so that is what they produce i would easily pay 30 for a warm white than 20 for cold white also it is way to pricey for the lumen output you can get warmer brighter led bulbs for much less,98,61

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,these cups are in fact not nonskid cups they are actually hard plastic cups that are super smooth and actualy ficilitate sliding easier than not using them they in no way stopped my couch from sliding when placed between the legs and the hard floor and slid around just as easily as the legs did although seemingly at random they would stick to the floor and the couch legs would slide off the cup i would recommend for nothing except for perhaps use as shotglass coasters,86,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,this product is a cheap plastic imitation of the rubber originals the casters do not stay on furniture feet because of the flat slick plastic and are therefore useless when trying to slide,33,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,4.0,positive,i purchased this staple gun to attach paper targets to cardboard backing for use at the firing range it is compact lightweight and uses standard staples i would not use it for any heavy duty application but as a light duty staple gun it works well I have been using it successfully for a couple of months now with no issues and would recommend this,64,1

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,2.0,negative,worked the 3 times i used it to staple targets up to plywood but like others stated the staples started coming through the bottom of the gun for 3 more dollars you can buy a arrow metal universal staple gun from lowes now going to have to buy another one,49,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,this stapler is marked in millimeters 4 - 8 mm tall and 07 mm in width the staples that amazon states that are most commonly purchased are 4375 in and 1111 mm in width without doing the math converting to and from metric to inches i purchased this with the extra staples they are to long i did use the stapler until i ran out of the staples that came with it and it did jam but was not hard to clear the jam i gave this product a one because after doing all the math it is extremely hard to find staples that will fit i have not found the exact size staples that go with it i am even trying to find a staple gun that the extra staples i purchased will fit,130,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,5.0,positive,i originally bought this for re-upholstering my kitchen chairs but it has helped with a lot of random crafts around the house and i could not be happier with it cheap but a great product,34,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,pass on this one it is very flimsy and jams up a lot you can get a good metal one at walmart for cheaper if you ignore this advice then do not do the add-on staples in the larger size they do not fit this stapler,44,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,great product fits right into my sink awesome product stop food for going down and the sink yes i would recommend,21,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,believe it or not i ordered three versions of this strainer from different manufacturers i knew from experience that they tend to be cheap and poorly designed so i wanted to see which was the least poorly made this one is the best the post is made of plastic of course but unlike the others it remains in the open position when set and blocks the drain well I am buying a few more because it will wear out sooner than later,81,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,does not consistently set properly in the sink drain,9,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i use this on one side of my sink the side that is tyipcally empty and even although it has been relatively unexposed to most dishes it is broken after having it just a few months the center pin fell out and can not be put back in I shall have to try a different one now,54,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,i was worried that it would not fit my stainless steel sink that is quite old no problem it fit fine and it works fine,25,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,does not fit all standard sinks measure your old stopper and the push pin was too short unhappy,18,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,about the only thing negative i can mention is that it does not fit 100 in the initial part of the drain hole of the sink and that there is not adjustment to open and close it also known as you have to pull it out to open the sink the rubber fits perfectly it is a lot easier to plug and unplug the grip does not hurt the hand even with a lot of water pressure to fight against and it is decent quality minor issues aside i recommend it if you are having problems finding a good one as i was,98,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,keeps stopping water flow even in the up position a real pain,11,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,best sink basket i tried worked perfect for 9 months broke after that ordering new one not sure how long sink basket should work but it is acceptable for me to change once in a year,36,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,original 5 star review fits and works perfectly much better design materials and construction than i expected for the price updated review purchased august 23 2014 center part separated from strainer basket november 18 2014 rendering the strainer useless this is what happened to the cheap one i bought from home depot except that one lasted 2 1/2 years this one only lasted 2 months this good looking piece of junk is not worth anything all it did is cost me it is price plus the cost of a better one and time and energy to first buy it and then replace it,101,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,my last review under rated this it appears flimsy when you get it but surprisingly it is sturdy and light weight cleans easily and this is the first sink basket I have had that actually holds water got to love it since i use it every day when doing dishes and it makes cleaning the sink a lot easier,57,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,total junk plastic and does not even fit can buy the same at wal mart for 097 cents save your money,20,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,it does not fit my sink i have a blanco double sink and the basket had to be returned because it was not just the basket but the entire parts that need a plumber the basket need not cost 2000 i do not see a phone number to speak to someone at blanco,53,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,cheaply made and overpriced better to go to home depot or lowes and spend a few bucks for a better sink basket,22,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,great price great product i love how the product works when you push the button to stop up the sink it is a spring type of action and really works no leaking no kidding,31,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,i should have listened to all the negative reviews of thisbut it seems as if none of the baskets are very good this basket is so light weight that as soon as water runs into it the rubber stopper drops from the open position it works fine to stop the water but is a constant nuisance to keep in the open position,64,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i encourage you not to waste your money no matter how much they sell this thing for the basket is metal but the thinnest cheapest stuff you have ever seen the post must be plastic at least it looks and feels like plastic the rubber gasket seemed to fit into my sink but it would not stay down would not lock and basically was useless i felt that if i pushed very hard on the stopper it would break pick one up at your local hardware store and you will be much better off,92,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,it stops the water from leaving the sink which is what i wanted as the others did not work well for me the reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it comes apart unexpectedly and i have to fish out the 3 parts and put them back together it still is the best water stopper ever,59,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,the quality is good but does not quite fit my sink right I am disappointed in this product i expected it to fit,22,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,all my other sink baskets that i bought at ace hardware and home depot lasted less than a week so I am encouraged that this will stay together i would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it is pretty light weight i do wish some company would make a sturdier product,54,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,one of my kitchen sinks is very fussy when it comes to a plug i have tried half a dozen different plugs and this is the only one that keeps all the water in even when left overnight,38,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,i have a standard size sink this stopper did not fit tightly enough to keep the water in it drained away slowly but drained out it is very light weight and cheap,34,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,we have had to buy 4 strainers in the last year for our sinks finally this one is made of good materials and we think it will last and do the job,32,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,this did not fit my standard size sink i should of purchased a banana slicer instead three inches is standard right,21,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,returned it it does not fit a insinkerator drain so the claim that it fits most sinks stretches the description a little,21,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,thought i would have to replace my double stainless-steel sink when my little strainer basket fell apart what a relief to find one of these on amazon for so cheap and free shipping we are sure the whole new double sink would have cost a bit more,46,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,every place I have lived there has been a sink basket with the option of letting it drain or using it as a stopper to collect dishwater in sink this does not act as a plug only let us water drain if i went to a dollar store to buy one i feel sure it would have the two options that i could use it as a stopper i do not get it why make one that does not,75,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,it fits my kitchen sink when i got it i had this very weird smell to it so whatever workshop it comes from must smell weird but it works great,30,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i bought this from reliable retailer it had a chemical odor the stainless steel sink basket does not look like the image the middle part is plastic,26,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,replaced old basket but the hole is much wider as i have a garbage disposable so it does not stop the water i do not need that feature anyways i keep my bucket in my sink when I am soaking dishes,38,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,unfortunately it did not fit and keep the water from draining out of the sink i had hoped it would fit well,22,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,good strainer works as advertised however there is a strong rubber smell the smell seems to lesson after each washing,20,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,this kind of sink basket is hard to find it is made in a special way at the bottom and is much more effective than other sink baskets,27,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,my local big box store has decided that it is better to sell fancy sink baskets and tail pipe assembly as a kit for about 30 dollars a lot less work when you just need to replace the stopper,39,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i had need to mill some light aluminum for an experimental airplane once bolted to my drill press thewas solid and easy to line up with the bit i am very happy with the vice and the outcome on the pieces i needed to make,47,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,thisis completely different that the harbor freight cross slideor any of the other cheap ones it has adjustable gibs on both slides so you can take any play out of both of the cross slides the micrometer indicators are kind of hard to read but it is easy enough to set up an indicator with a magnetic base to read the distance i took mine apart before using it and filed / sanded all the surfaces that touch some of the ways were a little rough so I am sure this helped some of the liquid coating that covers that casting dripped onto the ways so i scrapped that off before sanding and filing i then coated it with regular synthetic oil same lube i use on my mini lathe and put it back together there is no play at all in either direction for 38 this blows the 50 harbor freightout of the water they are not even in the same category,164,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,very nicefor the cost i could not find anything else even close for the same cost the slide adjusters are accurate enough to use for basic milling i milling to a precision of 01 inches the vice is a little loose so you have to take shallow cuts each time i was able to achieve the required accuracy i needed of 01 inches this is the first milling project I have ever done and the milling was done with a drill press not a mill i had guidance from an experienced machinist in my set up and measuring thehas also been immensely useful for drilling so i do not have to constantly reclamp the work piece to move it,121,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it 's very nice for big machines but not for my little drill press even so it 's worth every penny i paid very very convenient,21,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not a precision milling table but it is fine for eye-balling the right x-y position and hold it there that is what i wanted that is what it does good job i have it mounted on a big delta floor press the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of amazons description i do not love cast iron hardware from china,65,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,clean it up when it arrives and it works perfect shipped quick as advertised will use this vendor again,19,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,bit snapped about 15 into soft aluminum made in china do not waste your money and yes that rust came with it,21,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,arrived missing several components spent 2 hours at hardware store buying replacement parts do not eve consider ordering this piece of crap,21,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,as a lazy and cheap retired machinist i expected more quality but was saddened when i got a good look at it poor quality and poorer engineering but like another reviewer I shall spend some time on it to try to bring it up to speed i would not purchase this again you pay your money and you take your chances that is the way it is,65,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,oh brother i probably would have kept it if it would have worked at all the thing is the parts did not all fit or match the lower threaded adjusting rod did not go all the way to the end like it was made for a smaller sizealso i am surprised all of the parts arrived at my home the heavyhad busted through the flimsy cardboard box and the inadequate styrofoam packing was broken in pieces fortunately i was able to return it at their cost,89,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very cheaply made not precise at all does it work yes does it work good no extremely hard to adjust,20,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i knew that this was a low qualitybut it arrived with pieces barely attached bolts literally hanging out about 1/2 and one part was left disassembled because the threads were messed up and it could not be assembled this is far beyond any possible notion of acceptability mywas knowingly shipped in a defective state I have since re cut the threads and certainly appreciate manufacturers who provide lower cost tools that can be fine tuned by the customer but this manufacturer has lost any respect i could have had for them,93,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,the slide is rough and jumpy apend rhe extra money and get a good one,15,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,device worked well solid and sturdy calibration dials were rudimentary but functional worth the money,15,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,i followed the advice of other reviewers on here and immediately cleaned filed sanded and greased the contact areas when i received it now it works well enough for what i need as received 2 stars after a little work 4 stars update actually used it and it is very loose and not smooth anymore i ended up having to tighten it down to the point it was nearly impossible to turn and it still slipped final review 2 stars,79,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,ok it is cheap but i do not need to do any super-precision work and i figured that for something made out of metal i could get this thing dialed in I am an engineer well it is actually pretty solid and would have potential except for one very critical component the lower axis screw threads through and drives a small loosely mounted threaded block made out of plastic this interface has an incredible amount of play which can not be adjusted and if the plastic wears out which it will the play will get worse and when it breaks you no longer can move that axis strangely the upper axis threads through cast metal and is reasonably solid,117,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,the lag screw that moves the table goes through a plastic block this block cracked in half during the second use rendering this vice inoperable i should add i was using it gently,33,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,first vice was cheap and had a plastic broken piece company contacted me and immediately sent a replacement the new one was much better quality and the plastic piece that moved the vice had been replaced with a steel piece that worked much better,44,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works good little to big for my drill press need a larger drill press,15,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,greatafter a little work and cleaning,8,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,husband made a ak kit he said it did the job,11,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i did not expect much for the price i paid this made for a nice surprise to find that with just a little normal adjusting the vice is just what i needed if you do not work with tight tolerances 010 or so this vice should serve you well,48,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,like others stated low manufacturing tolerances leaves room for parts to wiggle take it apart lube appropriately and reassemble tightening nuts bolts and screws and the looseness goes away not bad for hobby work high precision or repetitive manufacturing will likely need something significantly more expensive,46,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i have nott had time to install it and use it yet due to illness but it looks good for my uses as far as i can tell will update later if it does not work or works better than i expect,40,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,works great built very solid i am using it on my drill press for more more accurate work you can not go wrong with thisand at a great price point i also received it in a few days ahead of the delivery time,44,24

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,very satisfied with the product and service don,8,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i surmise that amazon did not like my first review I shall make this one shorter i should have researched this tool better before i ordered it i wasted my money it is too rough to be used for milling but it does work as an oversized vice although it might be more useful as an anchor but i do not have a boat the vice came with a broken-off crank handle not from shipping the package was fine the postage to return it is not worth the benefit of a refund live and learn,89,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this is a good quality x-y directionali use it with a drill press to do precise work good quality and a fair price,25,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works fine it is not a highly precise milling machine but it gets the job done for non-precise applications,18,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,four stars as a 40as everybody else said this is aproject if you are expecting a ready to use product out of the box then thiswill get another one star review i read all of the reviews and knew what was coming so thanks to all that took the time to write those descriptive reviews i spent an hour disassembling and cleaning theright out of the box btw the brand name on the box is stark then i spent better part of two hours filing sanding and stoning the machined surfaces see pics at the end of all that i have athat is still only better than noat all what i had before buying this one,129,30

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,thought it would slide smooth has some jerking to it and needs constant adjustment good for the rough stuff but not precision,22,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,it needed some tuning and engineering to take out the slop it works great now great price super glue the crank handles and tighten,24,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the money you can not go wrong one issue you will need to deal with to make it function better and that is to clean it,25,35

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,too many bad reviews got here fast and really good price look take it apart wipe it off file or sand any burs where it slides also on other side of gib from where the hole is drilled into there is a dimple file or sand with emery paper till smooth once everything is clean and smooth put back together snug the gibs and go there is little play and for what i paid i am very very pleased,79,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works just fine for what it was needed for,9,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,not the highest quality but you can make it work at least i did,14,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not the best but it is good for the money gil,11,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,the ways are rough on this thing after a complete rebuild and light lapping they are still rough but might be able to fix it with more work the backlash is also pretty wicked the price was right and it serves my needs and will stay on my drill press i have a mill for real work although,57,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,this feels like cheap assembly / construction unfortunately this is the only crossof it is kind that i need i have seen for sale on amazon lowes hd and meeks this thing needs a wd40 bath or drop in a bucket of lube the thing is really stiff to rotate back-forth / left-right,50,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,all i have to say is that yodaddy and big hoss are so right this is athat when you get it you take it apart you clean it up put it back together and it works just fine do not be afraid to take it apart it is easy all large pieces that go back together in a snap and it does not take more than a few minutes thanks for the review yodaddy and big hoss your reviews were on the money,81,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,greatfor a small drill press when you need to work on small things that require precision easy to set up and take down,25,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,i have never used this it just collects dust covered in thick oil and slides still barely move do not waste your money buy a good one,26,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,very loose and jumpy only works for soft material wood plastic,11,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,great for what my son needed it for,8,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,product as advertised good x-y feed for a drill press not for precision work,15,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works great a little stiff at first but may need to be lubed or just need some use now that i know how it works i am thinking of many more jobs it may be useful for it is a little large for my drill press so there is not as much room to mount it in different directions it may be better to buy a 3 one for a 15 drill press but i bought a larger commercial 20 drill press at an estate sale and it fits it better i will know better how it is after some use i am not a machinist so it will using it for many types of jobs jeweling the bolt on a rifle will be the first task,128,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is what it is a cheap cross slide vice cleaned it up and it works fine,16,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,a little on the sloppy side for doing precision milling however considering i was using a drill press when i made allowances for the lack of tight tollerances on the slide movement i was able to do a pretty decent job on my ar-15 lower receiver other than that the quality of the device for the price is excellent,59,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,poor workmanship platform unstable cannot perform precise cuts poorly made do not waste your money,12,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,not a tight precise machine ok for holding it to drill holes forget about milling,15,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the price it is hard to beat it took a little tweaking to get run out dialed in but after that held tolerance well enough for my purpose,28,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,returned for a full refund thiscan not be used for anything precision,14,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,while this probably is not made for a production shop it sure works nice in my garage on my drill press i took it apart and cleaned it up like some other reviewers said to do and it is working pretty darn good,41,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,first of all this is the 2nd time amazon has asked me to rate this they would not post it i guess they did not like my last review because i wrote that the product was junk and i would not recommend it to anyone i do not believe they will post this one either second the package was delivered to my neighbor not me i stand by my reviews period,67,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i bought this to help me mill a lower receiver for an ar15 the project turned out great for the cost of this vice i have no complaints,29,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,than this vice a two access vice that it a x and y acess in english that means two directions right to left and forward to back there are two hand wheels that allow you to move with ease if you are milling or drilling or any other process the requires moving to another location without removing the project from the vice,62,64
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,should have paid more attention to reviews saw a better one with better response at harbor freight this one does not line up with my drill press oh well lesson learnd,30,65
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i just finished doing the task i bought the thing for here are a few observations using an end mill with this slide table is problematic pretty much drill bit only chatter is death to an end mill and the work you are trying to complete that said you can easily rough the work and use the end mill for plunge finishing pockets which was just as effective if not as fast as just using the end mill to mill out a pocket super drill pressif you spend time setting it up 80 receivers can be finished with patience but you are not buying a bench top mill here if you combine the price of a drill press plus this slide table you can get a hobby mill that would be much better suited if you already have a drill press this is worthy of purchase,147,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,mounted this on a grizzly drill press and it works great i almost bought the higher priced one but glad i did not this is what i needed,27,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very poor way too much slack in cross feed i would send it back but it would be to much i will just write it off dw,27,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is a basicno extra bells and whistlesdoes what is supposed to do you could spend more money on a flashier one but not necessary,27,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,it looks like a nice thing but no handles in box were hay extras wood just like to no if it was over looked thank you,26,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,the price on this thing was unbeatable but the workmanship suffers however once assembled it does work quite fine for what I am going to use it for i think it will be perfect but true machinist types would not be happy with this,42,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i use thisand it has held up really well just a few tips for the buyer re-grease using really good grease i wired brushed mine on all moving surfaces re-greased and the motion is slick as glass the seller was very helpful with a shipping mishap the seller was prompt and concerned that it met my needs,59,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,as others have indicated it is a roughly manufactured vice the acme threads on the three screws vice closure x and y axis are very sloppy i was able to completely disassemble clean and lube it it smoothed out the operation considerably nothing can be done about the slop between the male / female threads but you can adjust the tension on the gibs using the set screws to have a reasonable piece of equipment i have it mounted on a 5/8 drill press and it performs well well worth the money considering it ships free and weighs about 30,98,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,anyone who gave this less than 4 stars must not realize exactly how the world works listen you are not going to mill parts for a swiss watch or anything with this thing but it works exactly how you would expect athis price would for any person that repairs stuff around the house or small shop that needs decent quality work this is fine if you are not happy with the quality at the price then fork over the 200 300 for one that is intended for that,86,74
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,thiswas shipped quickly and the quality of the unit is great not sure where these other people got theirs but i have had no problems with mine right out of the box very smooth operation on both x and y axis,43,75
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,would not buy for ato come broken just says it all made very cheap spend more and get a goodi wanted it for one project and i could not even do that they took it back with no problem although so that was good,47,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,expecting precise repeatability and high quality at this price point is for fools this is something that at best should be expected to be a compromise and never more than good enough in my case i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of thethe out-of-the-box performance and the quality of machining although the excellent machining may have been a fluke i have been impressed with thisfor the price my only real complaints are the handles are a joke they are floppy flimsy and appear to be bakelite and the paint job is laughable theappears to have been dipped in a mixture of recycled enamels baked and then finish-machined there are even brass and steel chips cured / baked into the multi-colored paint on mine,127,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,if your going to do something do it right i personally thought it was a sloppy piece of junk and sent it back your results may vary,27,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,horribledoes not like the picture does not function do not buy it this a total ripoff made in china can not say enough about this,23,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,both axis drift 060 rails not cut square took it apart cleaned it tried to square up without success do not try to use for quality work oh yea the x axis has z travel as well as stated earlier pos,40,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,thisis fine for very limited use where precision is not needed the parts are machined barely to proper fit / function tolerances meaning it works but is clunky,28,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it only took a few minutes to adjust the tension on theways to get a reasonably tight and linear travel good quality for a reasonable price,28,82
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,there are expensive mill vises out there but i was on a budget and this works well does require some lube for smooth movement and some adjustment to remove slack but then it is ready to go,36,83
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,total waste of my money the machining on this sand-cast import cross slideis very rough and inaccurate on my copy the upper dovetails are not parallel so it is sloppy loose on one end of the travel and jamming tight on the other to use it i have to be continually adjusting the three tension screws along the side of the dovetail furthermore the lower and upper dovetails are not exactly 90 degrees so i had to make a set of special tapered jaws for it to correct for the run-out i did not expect machine-shop mill quality at this price but i can not even cut a decent slot in thin aluminum with it it is ok for positioning a piece to drill a hole but useless for any milling or slotting,132,84
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,this is not a quality product but for casual shop work it is a good value i took it completely apart upon arrival cleaned off the shipping grease and added some metal shims to eliminate some of the excess play mounted it on my drill press and it performs very well allows me to drill very accurately and repeat as necessary has really improved the fit on items i make in steel,72,85
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,this is not a very well made or stablebut i puchased it simply to avoid having to clamp unclamp reclampit is loose and needs constant adjustment but because of the price i knew that going in so i gave it 4 stars simply because it did exactly what i expected it to do and it should last you can not beat the price,66,86
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,this thing is garbage the thing is so wobbly and shaky the screw thread clamps are not even close to quality they hardly turn with normal handles as shown in the photo the base is large and you will have a hard time trying to clamp it onto a drill press plate i would give this 0 stars and send it back if it was not too late and i saved the crappy corrugated box it is also terrible with plastic straps,80,87
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i expected that i would need to clean and adjust but this thing is barely functional the bottom screw for the slide does not extend to the outside of the vice casting so it wobbles around and gets stuck the vice portion has a catch in the middle because the flat sliding surface does not appear to be parallel with the shaft that the jaw rides upon to adjust i will need to drill out a pin very poor quality i will stick with hf in the future,87,88
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i am used to dealing with cheap tooling with a bit a babying or cleanup you can quite often get a good deal this however is just awful all slides wiggle side to side you can clamp down the screws a bit and this helps a bit but then it does not slide well the killer however is the lower pin that mates with the lower gear drive it is not round and is so undersized that the entire lower stage has 1/8 of slop if you were to try and drill anything tougher than thin plastic it will shake and either make an oval hole damage the bit or both avoid,111,89
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works fine for the money i paid for it it is a great value decent enough quality works fine for my use no complain it can be more precise finer adjustment longer range tighter machine works those are available on the market just not at this price be prepare for to pay several times over,54,90
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,at first i was not too happy with my purchase but he shall i get what i pay for if you are looking to get within 05 this is not the product you are looking for it is misaligned and only has decent travel for about 2 inches works great on very small cuts also make no attempt to try and zero this out for a vertical mill because that will only piss you off,73,91
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i had to tear this thing down and rework all the ways and clean it up just to get poor results harbor freight has one for 5 more and it seems a lot better out of the box all of it is cheap chinese junk but you would expect it to at least function when delivered this one did not spend more for a qualityyou will not be disappointed update dropped theon the floor and the base cracked it is not like it fell 10 feet but i would think it would survive a 3 foot fall with little damage,102,92
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i would say this is a good buy for the money there are some rough edges but overall it is a very serviceable,23,93
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not high precision but it works for my needs and for the price it is a great value,20,94
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the price thewas a excellent buy delivery was good this was a very good deal for my use and saved me time and further cost,28,95
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for and that is what i got given those parameters i recommend it they said i need more words so here they are,27,96
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,this vice was very poorly made and a waste of my money the gibs are not very well designed for smoothing out the action returning it was too much of a hassle this time so i will use it as a paper weight in my shop,46,97
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,it is a cheap rough casting take it apart stone the ways put it back together with a little polishing compund and run it back and forth take it apart again clean thoroughly use a heavy oil reassemble and set the tension on the ways so that it is a firm smooth motion you are not going to machine to minute tolerances but I am happy with it,66,98
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,product i recieved was not as pictured mine has 2 tension screws not 3 the handles are low grade and the set screws that hold them on are worthless i had to replace them i also had to modify the retainer for the sliding jaw so it would not bind up you get what you pay for here,59,99
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,the vice is everything i expected and the quality is great tzseller deserves at least a ten rating for selling such a quality tool,24,100
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,yes this is a really cheapbut it does do what it is supposed to do i knew what i was buying when i shelled out only 30 bucks for this x / ythisunlike others has a nice low profile my big disappointment was that the rotation handles were not like those shown in the photo of the product i made this choice partly because of the handles i plan to voice my disappointment with the company selling these for a device like this the handles are important it does seem to track strait i am not seeing lots of wobble it has smooth face jaws so marring of the work will not be a problem you may want to take theapart if only to understand all the parts and how they work together,139,101
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before ordering so i knew what to expect and the top few reviews were dead on theis rough at best but after a using a file for remove major burrs some emery cloth to polish the slide surfaces and a little time and elbow grease I had say i have a damn goodfor under 40 yeah it is not top grade but will suit me as the weekend garage project monkey please do not buy thisif you do not plan to do some work on it because all you will do is post a negative review you have been warned,109,102
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i purchased this to use on a bench top craftsman drill press to be used as a milling machine for many projects that i do as a gunsmith i do a lot of research before i buy just about anything I am glad i did for this crossit comes as others have stated covered in varnish / cosmoline / grease it needs to be removed i took the entireapart used a rotary tool to polish the sliding surfaces and then cleaned everything in my parts washer it cleaned up well i then treated it as a gun and oiled everything as needed added grease to certain areas and put it back together tightening everything i did not have to replace anything as once it was put back together it is almost like a 150 200 crossi say almost as there is a bit of loss in it is precision but for what i needed it for no issue overall once you do the work keep in mind you really are saving a lot of money over other models that come to you almost in the same unusable condition it is well worth every dollar of money and time,191,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this vice is a great addition to my bench top drill press i have had it for a while now and have been using it on almost a daily basis not just for milling work but it also works well as a bench top vice to i use this vice more than my standard bench top this cross slide is a great buy for the money you can not get a better cross slide vice i have used it to mill 6061 t6511 aluminum and various types of steel as well as other materials with no hangi did have to polish the surfaces that the vice slides on not required but i am picky and it was sliding a little gritty feeling at first but after i got it polished up it works awesome now,129,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not the smoothest operation of gears in the world and it seems universal in the sense I am not sure what platform it is designed for but i have a small drill press and i bought some bolts large washers and wing nuts and mounted it to the drill plate and it works for my purposes,56,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,like many others here i found the bolts loose and movement very stiff took it apart cleaned all the shipping gunk off polished and lubricated it theis now a solid smooth piece of equipment if you want an inexpensivethis is the one to get just remember you will have to clean polish and lubricated it before you use it,63,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,screws must be tightened past ehere wheels can be turned with the handle other than that thisworks fine I am milling delrin plastic which is just a bit easier than aluminum my drill press table will not lock anymore probably because of all the plastic shavings but theworks perfectly,53,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,pleasantly surprised the ways on thisare adjustable so you can make it nice and tight the handles have some play in them so i used some loc-tite green for cylindrical bonding to stiffen them up a few minutes to adjust all the points of the slides and properly lubricate it and it is a decentfor under 30 bucks for all the little drill press projects i am going to do,75,108
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for in my case i just wanted to hold a piece to drill and tap not great accuracy but it does the trick i like the little vice i have a machine shop so i can make things to tweek this product for example if you want the vice in the middle of the table you will have to have an extension bar to move your y axis because the handle will hit the table it works and if that is all you want then enjoy if you want precision go to kurt,95,109
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,this vice is not quite that pictured in the sale image the one i received is quite stiff and trundles up and down when being adjusted on the other hand it is very stable and the top slide can be used separately sooo it is worth the money it was delivered quickly and on time,57,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i was hoping to get one of these simply to increase the accuracy of spotting holes on pieces using a center drill in my drill press i went to local tool supply store to check thisout and it was simply a very cheap piece of chinese junk far worse than i expected of course the price raised that flag so i put it back in the box and did not buy it would rather spend two or three times the asking price for something a bit more solid and accurate like others have said you get what you pay for,101,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,even although the pic shows a black unit i received a blue unit my handles are solid billet while the ones on the black vice look plastic a few minor differences but the thing worked well and had good grip,40,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,they sell these all over the place ebay amazon harbor freight none of them are worth a hoot all they will do is make you miserable and as far as fixing them good luck maybe if you have some professional machinists tools you can do something with them otherwise boat anchor and not a good one because it ll get stuck on something and you will never be able to pull it up again z,66,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,there is considerable play in the ways in both axes the crank on one axis interferes with the slide limiting travel to a very small amount it is not remotely square there are several loose fasteners and fasteners that are not straight i was expecting better even for anat this price,52,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,those of you complaining about the quality of the product are probably not happy with anything ever you need to consider that you can not even buy a standard benchfor 30 dollars let alone awith an x and y axis movement those of you with realistic expectations will be thoroughly satisfied those of you who want professional machinist quality results will need to she shall out 100 dollars or more you get what you pay for i am totally happy with thebecause i had 30 dollar expectations for a 30 dollar product,96,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i expected this unit to be somewhat sloppy due to the very low price i was prepared to disassemble and polish all the mating surfaces the paint blobs pressed into the surfaces and crude machine work should be expected for such a cheap unit what i did not expect were key ways that were milled off by 10 degrees the mating surfaces only contact at their edges which were pitted and irregular there is no way to get a reasonable amount of slop out of it without it binding in places across it is travel it is not worth returning it due to the cost for shipping a heavyI shall use it as a fixedforget milling with it,118,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,quality lacking but price cheap translation you get what you pay for wish i had spent more and purchased better quality,21,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,beware the price is cheap and you get what you pay for the machining was so poor that there would be no way to get any accurate milling i returned thealthough the shipping was almost as expensive as the product kudos to the seller for refunding theand their shipping bottom line heavy junk might work as a boat anchor,64,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very poor quality the ways were machined poorly very rough and uneven machining with lots of chatter and the adjusting screws were cheap i was unable to get the excessive play out of the ways even after much tinkering there is also a lot of end play in thescrews especially the bottom axis the bottom axis on myslides back and forth about 1/8 without turning thescrew this makes it almost impossible to position anything in thereliably after taking theapart i noticed that one of the adjustment shims was drilled completely through so the adjustment screw was not pushing on the shim but directly on the way itself i was going to bring the whole thing to my relatives machine shop to re-mill the entirebut i think it would be easier to build a whole newfrom scratch instead of fixing this one do not waste your money no matter how low the price,164,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,reading other reviews i thought these lights would be quality they were not they are all plastic except for the stake but that is cheap metal very disappointed sent them back immediately but to add insult to injury i had to pay over 800 in shipping out of my own pocket for this piece of junk buyer beware,58,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,it was nice reeived the package intact the lights are easy to assemble they look nice in our front yard,20,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i bought both moonrays 91398 balletto style solar powered hanging plastic path light and this one and i think this one is much better than the moonray light the only problem of the product is the battery without good batteries the lights are just pieces of junk can only last for around 2 hours at night but after replacing the batteries the effect is so good that I am thinking buying more btw i bought sanyo eneloop batteries and they works great for these 2 weeks,85,2

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i bought four of these solar lights to replace four similar lanterns i had had for seven or eight years unfortunately the ones i had were no longer being made or i would have bought those but these were the closest i could come but when i received them they were not even close the quality of the stakes was poor and two of them bent immediately trying to put them in to the same holes i had before the lanterns themselves were flimsy / cheap not made in heartland america at least the heartland america i know the lanterns may have worked a whole few weeks and then they died never to return i should have sent this junk back but i did not i live in south-central new mexico and we have sunshine lots of sunshine more than enough to charge these lights the lights still stand well two as a reminder to myself to not buy junk like this again if i can not find quality setups do not waste any more money i would suggest to others they do not waste their money either at least not on these,183,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,would have been great if they were not all smashed to pieces in the box too cheaply made to withstand shipping returned,22,7

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these solar lights are extremely dim they are barely even visible along the pathway i purchased them to help light the pathway to the door at night I have had to purchase others because these did not do the job i would not purchase these again,44,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,amazon said this light is heartland of america but they shipped me the light by lily home i bought this product from heartland of america before and they are good but this one from lily home is a strip down model they are the same price of 3000 for two lily home light use only one battery instead of two it has 2 battery compartment but one is not wired up so the light is very dim and almost could not see that is on even the candle itself is very small not like the one heartland of america which is big did amazon do a switch on me because it said the light is by heartland of america the product detail is lily home did amazon advertised one thing and sell the other may be heartland of america product is sold out so they sub the lily home instead do not buy lily home product and it is not good at all construction is poor light is very dim and use one battery instead of two lily home product is bad,182,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,the lamps are very poor quality being made of very thin plastic the lamps i ordered had scratches on the pastic and appeared they would fall apart with the first good wind i would not recommend this product the lamps really look nice on-line but not in person i returned thethe day i received good news is amazon stands behind the products they sell,66,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,no the lights are not yellow are white and the quality of the batteries is very poor,17,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this purchase i ordered two pairs and from the 4 i received i had to take parts from all four to create two functional candles pieces were broken upon arrival batteries were old and not working wires were not connected and the metal posts from which the candles hang were not complete,57,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,very cheap for a reason do not expect it to last very long we did not even bother to get them after we used them after the wedding,26,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,total junk had to return them save your money,9,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,only three flickered then two died replaced with others purchased elsewhere not what i expected,15,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love the flickering i use them all year round but they look especially nice with winter decorations,17,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these months ago and they have proven the test of time against the florida rainy season they are beautiful in planters and i always get compliments,28,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i received a defective set one lantern arrived with the dawn / dusk sensor ripped off and the other had a deformed battery cover the glow is surprisingly minimal given the size of the candle and i even used my own fully charged battery to test it very disappointing,47,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these for my mom and she just loves them heed the warnings about the inferior batteries that come with these solar lights although and get yourself some 2300 mah energizer power plus nimh aa rechargeable ones instead,39,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,beautiful lights they make my front porch look so neat,10,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i just love these putting them along the bushes of a walkway in front of my home the soft flicker looking like a candle in the night the charge does not last as long as i would like but it stays on about four to five hours and for the price these are also hard to find as an fyi and having owned similar solar lights before i took these apart and put caulking around the inside of the solar panel holder which tends toand allow rainwater into the electronics and of course you will want to bring these in during the high point of winter to give the panels longer life out of the elements which seem to be in all these kinds of units the first part that goes,133,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,I am not the pickiest person and will settle over most things whew i have to say these poor things are really cheap flimsy and unattractive the company that makes these hired a good photographer for the product images the lights inside of the candles only illuminate the side of one wall and i can see shadows of the wires the lanterns might make it through one season if i do not expose them to the rain they are so ugly i stuck them on the side of the house I had say you get what you pay for but I have bought cheaper candles from a dollar store that look better than these,110,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look beautiful in the photo i wanted lights just like these and loved the look the package arrived and they are made of cheap plastic i broke off one of the stems that place them in the ground and it was soft ground after it just had rained they are not sturdy i live in a windy area in the mountains the light they emit is very dim not what i had imagined would tell other to steer away from making my same mistake,85,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,candles work great get a lot of comments on how they look only use in the summer only thing would recommend better batteries for longer life,26,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i purchased two pairs of these lanterns and am very happy with the 3 that worked one was defective which is why i gave the product only 4 stars i used these lanterns to replace the battery powered lanterns i used previously these are much easier because they can be left on constantly and they recharge every day they looked very pretty hanging in my perennial beds all summer i added split rings to the top of these lanterns so that they would fit on the sturdier shepherds hooks already installed instead of the flimsier hangers that came with them i did use one of the included hangers to hold a different garden ornament,114,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,one of candle did not work already i try to switch reset and figure it out outside but i do not know what is worng,26,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,the lights arrived not too long after i ordered them i am very satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the lights themselves they are like glowing candles in the dark after soaking enough solar power,38,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,since heartland america will not post let me post an unhappy review on their site I shall post it here do not buy this set it was embarrassing i bought this as a gift for someone and they have not been able to get it to hardly work she told me all kinds of damage was done to the products and some trouble was went through to get these lights to work a little i contacted ha and they said since she had to work with it to get it to turn on somewhat they considered it being tampered with and would not assist in any customer service you have been warned,108,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,love the natural glow and flickering of the candlelight the only reason i did not give the product 5 stars was because the original batteries that came with it were cheap and had to be replaced,36,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,after only a few days only one lights up i am very disappointed with this product this product is very cheap,21,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these look like they might be pretty high quality but do not be fooled they are super thin black plastic and easily damaged during shipping amazon sells some great products but these are not part of that set,36,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i purchased this set for the cemetery at my parents graves i liked the concept of a candle flickering in the night unfortunately when i received thenumerous key pieces were missing a solar battery a battery cover screws for the rod to put together i had to invest more money to correct all the problems would not reccomend anyone buying this too bad i like the look of the light but not the people that distribute it,79,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,given the price of these lights i was expecting a better quality product first off do not be surprised if you are missing the screw lags that connect the 3 piece poles together as i found mine rolling around in the bottom of the box the lights themselves appear to made of very cheap plastic with large gaps between individual pieces i do not expect these to hold up to the elements for long the top of both ground stakes broke as i gently pressed them into the fresh dirt around my patio stones which is another example of the cheap quality i have lots of solar ground lights at my property and these are by far the worst stakes I have every seen so be very careful when you put them in the ground i plan on replacing the batteries as per other reviews experience but time will tell how these lights hold up to the weather,156,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,this product is not amber when received they are white if you are ordering them for the specificit shows you will be disappointed,25,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these came in and i put them right back in the box and sent them back each one had 1 out of 2 battery doors broken they would not stay locked on their own 1 of the batteries was out as well upon arrival i could not imagine having to use tape for an outside lantern just to keep the battery in so it would work correctly each one also had 1 out of the 4 locking mechanisms broken off and missing 1 lantern had a big glob of glue or something on the top as well that looked really crappy they are all plastic and you can tell they just look kind of cheap and well plastic the stakes that come with them are in 3 pieces which i thought odd you have to screw them together and never looked exactly straight to me they are not 100 horrible although and can serve a purpose maybe i was just unlucky and somebody else would get them in a better condition I am just not taking a chance again,176,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are very cheaply made do not waste your money they are also white and not amber as pictured,20,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these are delightful providing a wonderful hint of lit candles as they hang in our living room one reviewer was correct place new batteries in from the start and they last forever,32,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,merchandise was constructed very poorly fell apart very easily when handling very poor performance only stayed lit for two hours at the most daily have ordered similar product from another seller and they work just great stay on all night,40,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love these lights for the ambiance they work great the light submitted is low but i love the amber affect,20,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,I have had these lights for a couple of years now and enjoy watching them when I am sitting outside i especially like seeing them sway in the breeze they have a soft glow and flicker randomly much like real candles in fact shortly after i moved them to a different corner of the house my neighbor called worried that something was burning in the back yard these lights are decorative they are not bright enough to light a walkway they have withstood plenty of wind and rain they do need a lot of sun to charge I have had the best luck with them on the south side of the house but you can remove the batteries and charge them if you have a nicd battery charger the batteries that came with them stopped charging after less than two years i put the lights in storage during the winter i do not know if that contributed to their demise after replacing the batteries they are working fine again,163,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,thiscame with a missing part that the other lantern could not be as tall as the other one it was returned and the customer service did not follow up thewas cheaply made not like the photo,40,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,contents arrived with pieces broken off inside the light housing original seller / manufacturer did not use packing materials disappointing because it is difficult to find amber solar lights rather than the white lights that almost look blue,35,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i purchased these for a christmas present and returned them immediately they looked very cheap and not what i expected at all,22,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i really liked this but the batteries corrode regardless of the type they light are great for pretty and not functional because they do not put off much light we got about 1 summer out of them before they went to crap not really worth it,45,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love love love these solar lights they work great and look fantastic i will probably be buying more would highly recommend buying these,23,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i had to send them back because they were obvioulsy used they had scratches on them and only one of them worked i was very bummed because i loved the looks of them if they could assure me that i would get brand new ones then i would definately order them again i can not find these anywhere else so very disappointed,61,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,a very good purchase no problems i enjoy watching them at night would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying this set,24,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,what you see is not what you get can not tell by the picture what you are actually getting it is all plastic and very flimsy not worth the money get better ones in home improvement stores for same price,37,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are not what they claim to be they were fine for the first week since then i have not gotten them to burn anymore either of them do not waste your money,32,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i was so excited to put these on either side of one of my garden statues and they looked terrific the first night and they have not come on since i like some other reviewers also broke the flimsy shepherds hook just trying to put it into very soft ground so i used a couple of my big lots hooks luckily they fit through the top ring of the lantern i did see the review regarding bad batteries and may try that because they really did look like candles flickering for the first couple of hours however i would not buy again not worth the hassel of returning,106,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,these are way cool unfortunately the hanger part broke on one of them right away it is still useable just can not hang it up,23,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these are attractive when viewed close-up unfortunately one of my two stopped working i tried new batteries and even charged them in my home charger at first it came on if i tapped it but then it stopped entirely i do not recommend them,44,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i have 10 of these and might get more if i want to hook up these lights to a solar array it panel can be done easily breaks if not handled real carefully but the shipper replaces them without fail and covers the shipping cost so no pain for me the cheap plastic top when you fist go to turn on the battery would break easily as you then try to lock it in place i learned through this breakage that thisbattery while cheap the wires can be hooked re-connected to a solar panel to get all night lighting you can find a good panel at any store which you can find woks allnight for thirty bucks which comes with their own lights i have which i plan to hook up in far future but for now it lasts about 4 - 5 hours in full sun and shade and 55 to 6 hours in full direct sun i added pics,161,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look very nice but unfortunately are very poor quality i broke one just trying to get it open to turn it on the price makes it cost prohibitive to send it back i will spend more to get better quality the next time,44,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these look great on my walkway on the way to the patio they look just like lit candles very romantic looking and pretty durable so far i have a few large dogs and they have bumped into and knocked them over quite a few times and they continue to work just fine very pleased with these solar lights,58,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i love thisand feel i received a good bargain i have put these two lights in the front by a walking path and they have really improved the look and curb appeal of the yard not just at night when they are flickering but also during the day even although the lantern part is plastic it is hard to tell it is plastic and they have withstood a couple of pretty severe hailstorms without any damage at all i am very pleased,83,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i love the look of these lights but they are not amber they are white i bought them because i thought they were amber also the plastic holder the stake goes in broke immediately on several of the lights very cheap the lights worked okay for two nights and then they stopped working completely when they did work the lights did not stay on for very long what i found out after only a few days of use is that the top plastic part have several sections that are glued together and the glue stopped holding and the top part of the lights started coming apart which caused the wiring to pull apart after trying to fix this i was so aggravated at how cheaply they were made and how they kept falling apart that i threw three of the four lights i bought out a complete waste of money i see now that for something like this it is important to see and inspect them for quality before purchasing,171,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,they look so nice but how fall are they I am looking for some like this but tall like 6 maybe,20,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i have never written a negative review but i have to warn people these are complete junk i buy from amazon all the time but these were a complete waste of money i literally broke these in just ten minutes and have thrown them away cheap quality and the plastic tops of the lamps broke just untwitsting to turn them on the metal stakes do not align so i could not use those either this is my personal opinion but the worst purchase i ever made on amazon save your money folks,91,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,easiest thing i have ever setup press and hold time while pressing hour and more does not get any easier i got this for turning on / off a lamp place in bottom outlet and you can still use the top one great design i have not had it long so i hope it holds up for my 5 stars,55,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the timer works as advertised i recommend it to anyone who wants a multiple setting timer,16,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,problem amazon write-up on it when i purchased it indicted that it would handle 15-amp loads but when i got it i found that it will handle just a bit over one-half of that advantages electric motor timers power draw is actually enormous overall since that little motor in them is running 24/7/365 and you can feel the heat generated by them and they lose their timing schedule with a power outage this timer is all electronic and has a back-up battery thus taking almost no power to operate and keeps it is timing cycle after power outages after replacing 3 electric timers with these a measurable drop in kwh was noted making it a good green device other once you get used to the programming and over-ride sequences required it is easy to use,136,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the turn on / off is a lot quieter then the mechanical relay types the manual bypass is also a good feature lite on lcd panel would have been helpful,28,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,i normally like woods products but what a disappointment this one arrived dead as can be the display would not operate it would not power up so i must join the chorus of unsatisfied customers here whose timers simply did not work woods needs better quality control,47,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,thisjust does not work i would not recommend it i returned it despite multiple efforts this timer did not work maybe i received a defective one but based on other reviews it seems unlikely,33,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,i had two of these and neither could hold it is programming for more than a few hours I had come home find the light still on and the screen in the timer blank i would not recommend this even although it claims to use less energy than a mechanical timer,48,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,the first timer i bought lost it is programming and time / date within one week of use thinking it was just a defectivei requested a replacement which amazon sent within two days to me however the second timer also lost it is programming within a couple of days i thought that maybe i needed to charge it for awhile before putting it into use so i charged it for a day same thing happened I have had to reprogram it about 5 or 6 times in less than 2 weeks and it consistently is losing the programming i was hoping it would work because it has 20 on / off settings but with it not keeping it is programmed settings it is just a worthless piece of plastic I am sending it back to amazon for a refund and will be buying a timer from a brick / mortar store that has 6 on / off settings i need something that i can depend on and this timer does not fit the bill,161,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,bought two and each repeatedly lost the programming i painstakingly entered received two replacements and they do the same thing,20,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i have had this hooked up for over a year and it turns the lights on and off as programmed simple to set up a great product,27,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,very nice when i received it worked fine very easy to program but it just stopped working after 10 days,20,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i like that you have so many options for it to activate i set mine to turn on the bedroom light monday thru friday i was really glad it did not have only a choice for every day i do not want the light to come on at six am on saturday,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,my old mechanical light timer drove me nuts with it is constant grinding noise as the wheel turned and the big clicks when the lights came on and off this is silent which is what i wanted it is also been totally reliable out of sight and out of mind and working reliably I am glad i picked this one,57,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the user interface is quite standard and works reliably it is a bit slow to rotate through 60 minutes it would be nice if there was a way to decrement the minutes / hours,32,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,we have tried other timers but they often cost a lot more and have less features like most products mass produced in 3rd world countries there will be a couple out of 100 that are not perfect good luck trying to find an alternate product that has a built-in rechargeable battery backup so you do not loose the programming in case of a power failure 20 program on-offs daily weekly m-w-f mtwtf sat-sun easy to program easy to read and no dip switchs to loose for the money you can not get a better timer it works great with our redytemp whole house no-wait hot water optimizer,103,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,bought two of these timers both were broken one never turned on and the other the time could not be changed maybe the off chance one is defective but two product stinks would have given a 0 star if given the opportunity,42,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,this auto-switch works as advertised it lost a star because i thought it could have been a bit easier to program it was not that hard or anything just could have been easier,32,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,it could have gotten 5 stars but the directions were a little confusing it works fine and the time invested in figuring out the directions was worth it not expensive and works great,33,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i have three of these that have been in use for several years and i like them much better than the analog timers that they replace they seem to keep their time more accurately and the fact that you can set them to the exact time instead of approximating as with analog timers is a plus resetting the time is not as easy as it could be but if you follow the instructions it is not too bad my only comment is that mine look nothing like the photo that amazon has posted and i know that the part number is correct i got it off the back of the unit,110,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,pros i was excited when this timer arrived to discover that it actually handled 20 on / off times when the product description said it only had six the unit was easy to program and operate cons within 3 days the unit malfunctioned and reset itself losing the time / date and all programming this unit was controlling my cat feeder so I am glad we were not on vacation when this happened the next day the screen went blank and i had to hit the reset button to bring it back to life I am returning the unit for a replacement and will update this review if the replacement turns out to be more reliable,109,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i used it for xmas for my lights it was easy to program and worked as advertised,17,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,after several attempts to find an old-fashioned timer that would last more than a week this has been happily cranking along keeping our fish well lit the directions say to charge before setting the timer but i had to use the reset button while it was plugged in to get to the setup screen the override settings are a bit odd but once you get used to it it provides a wealth of configuration options i will probably never need the backup battery is a nice feature and seems to work fine tested with an intentional outage,97,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i purchased three of these about a week ago am very happy thus far great price great functionality one appeared to be dead on arrival but i just pushed the recessed reset button and it sprang to life what i received is slightly different in appearance to the internet ad less asthetically pleasing but has even more flexibility 20 settings / day you can easily configure it for all seven days of the week at once if so desired which would normally be the case packaging is clearly marked indoor use yet i am currently trialing one outdoors i have always used the old-fashioned mechanical timers this seems far superior,109,22
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,4.0,positive,my daughter has just started collecting bratz and has almost everything the dolls are great but this toy is junk my daughter does love playing with it but the pieces do not snap together well and falls apart easily also if you do not have the dolls on just right on the runway they will fall over the wires get lose from opening and closing the runway so now the music will not play through it it also has too many pieces and the dressing shelf is not big enough to hold them so everytime you bump the set they fall over for my daughter it is a dream and very fun to play with she does get frustrated when the dolls fall off the runway,125,0
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,1.0,negative,my child received this toy for christmas last year the dolls will not stay on the runway the toy will not stay together there is always something falling offmailed the company about how cheap this product was and they told me to return it in the original package the package was thrown away on christmas morning they told me there was not anything they could do my daughter was very disappointed in the toy and became when the toy kept started falling apart it is not in peices in her closet,92,1
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,2.0,negative,bratz has some great designs and boy was thispriced right when i saw it on sale but much like the other bratz products that require assembly i was very disappointed when the parts did not stay together and kept on falling apart until the company puts more time and effort into engineering their products better so that they actually stay together save your money and do not buy any bratz plastic products that require assembly I am an avid bratz collector and I have assembled many of their products and I have had to take almost all of them back save your money and buy something that will stay together like legos,109,2
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,5.0,positive,my daughter recieved the disco for her birthday and she loves it these bratz dolls are the coolest toys to come along in a long time i have been purchasing toys for a long long time so i know fun toys that my kids will like the only downfall to this studio is the speakers on the sides of the runway do not always want to stand up considering all the other very cool features that this toy has i have no ohter choice than to say if you do not buy this for a little girl who loves dolls than your missing out on a lot of good times playing with them yourself the price of the dance studio is also more than reasonable,123,3
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,4.0,positive,this playset is fun but it is very annoying some of the pieces come off of it and the lights fall of very easily one time when the lights were off my little cousin took them and put them in water it makes me so angry that this toy is so un-durable but this playset is still fun although also the runway is cool but when you put nevra or any other bratz they fall off some of them do not but still it is very frustraining the back as no promblem to me no wonder my mom was so angry with this I am a little angry with it too but it is rated 5 stars for fun because it can be better fun if this playset was more durable that is why i put 3 stars on durablity on this playset and the educational valuei do not get that i mean i know what it is but to me there is no educational rate but 3 stars i love this toy but it was hard to put together,172,4
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,4.0,positive,my nieces and my daughter love it i have two nieces and a daughter that play with the runway disco my daughter is 5 and my nieces are 7 and 11 years old i am going to purchase one for my daughter so that we will have two of them in the house but so far the three girls love to play with the one that they have the main feature that they love is that they can connect the limo to the runway disco and hear music the girls have two limos but only onewe have not had any parts to break or anything of that nature when the girls get home from school the first thing they do is play bratrz the girls have a lot of bratz products one thing that i can say about the bratz is that my daughter and my nieces love them and so do i no matter what the cost,159,5
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,1.0,negative,my daughter age 9 wanted this for christmas so santa got it for her christmas afternoon turned out to be an episode in frustration as the doll would not stay on the track the runway lights no longer worked and every flimsy piece kept falling apart finally after a few changes of new batteries the compartment by the way is located on the bottom of the platform so that a battery change requires dismantling the whole thing my daughter said dad let us return it and so we did and amazon refunded the money i took her out a couple days later and bought a guitar which she is happy with hopefully your experience will be better but for [ the price ] this is the most overpriced piece of junk yet,129,6
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,2.0,negative,this disco was a big disappointment it is so cheaply made yet so expensive to buy my sister in law and i put it together on christmas eve for my 8 year old daughter my sister in law could not believe how much i paid for this toy because it is so not worth the money it also does not work that well the dolls usually fall off the moving runway and there are so many little pieces and only one little drawer to fit it all into also the dolls are unable to sit on the chairs my daughter was excited to get this toy but after playing with it for a little while she told me that it looked much funner on tv i forgot to mention that it falls apart if moved so make sure you have it where you want it before you start playing with it do not make the mistake i did do not buy this toy your child may think that she wants it but once she gets it and tries to play with it she will not be as intrigued as she should be for a toy you spent [ this much ] on,197,7
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,5.0,positive,my little sister got this for christmas and it works spectacularly at first the pieces would not snap but as we were putting it away i gave it a push and they snapped very easily and for the other commentators if you know anything about geometrics you should know that you have to balance the doll well before she goes on my sister loves it i gave her the limo and they work great together the dolls will stay on the runway forever it is a great gift buy it now,89,8
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,4.0,positive,i have read many of the reviews and i have to say i am very happy with this toy and my daughter plays with it all the time it is a little easy to come apart but this is made for a child i have her take it apart and put it together each time she wants to play and it teaches her responsibity this saves space in her room and she can play anywhere she wants to at the moment she is not stuck only playing in a certain part of the house she has a good time setting this up and playing for hours i feel it was worth the money and getting the limo was a added bonus i will be buying more of the pieces and the dolls i would say this is a very good choice for your child to own it just takes patience and imagination something all children have some of us adult may need more of these,165,9
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,1.0,negative,we had all of the problems the other reviewers listed with the toy falling apart and more my daughter is 5 and she just did not even show any interest in all the little pieces because there were just so many in addition the limo radio would not play when hooked up to the runway even if everything worked i think it was just too detailed for her and the recommended age should be moved up to 7 or 8 the only bright spot in the whole thing is that toys r us took it back even although we did not still have the box so she got a wooden doll house and some bratz furniture and she is now happy,120,10
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,1.0,negative,this is the worst toy ever my 6 year old received this toy for christmas 2003 what a joke it is cheaply constructed and falls apart very easily the doll does not stay on the motorized runway for more than 5 seconds speaking of motorized runway it is loud and sounds like it is dying what a disappointment for 100 you would think it came with some kind of music they actually have the nerve to give you a little cord to hook up to your own radio and the cord is not even long enough save your money your daughter s will only be disappointed back it goes,104,11
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,4.0,positive,we do not have the fm limo so my daughter hooked it up to her walkman and played cds on it the sound was kind of choppy the bratz fall off the runway very easily it is cute when it works with the dolls turning at the corners of the runway i thought it would have more lights on it this was the 1 toy on my daughters xmas list and she was thrilled to get it if your expectations are realistic about this plastic toy with battery-operated moving parts and tiny speakers it is ok,93,12
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,5.0,positive,do not listen to the other reviewers i recieved the bratz runway the limo and other bratz stuff for christmas it is durable the runway is awesome and it does stay together the runway works and so does the lights a must have toy parents any girl would love this set it does work and is pretty durable,57,13
Toys_and_Games,B00005BRE5,1.0,negative,have bratz spa and salon plastic junk never play with it falls apart when finally put together toooo many small pieces can not move it after put together hard to keep dolls in chairs i am sure runway disco is the same way over priced at 5000,46,14
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son received this walker from grandma and really loves it i was looking at walkers before and this one is aabove the rest it has a speed control we tried out the fisher price walker at his aunts house and he kept falling down the walker just rolled right out from underneath him i was hesitant to give him this walker but he loves it for now the speed control is about half way on but when he get a little better at walking the skies the limit,91,0
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this walker and after putting it together i immediately had misgivings about it it did not seem very stable and i was right when my 9 month old son tried to use it to pull up it flipped over backwards luckily since i had my suspicions about it doing just that i was standing right behind him and able to catch him in addition to tipping over withing 1/2 hour he had the two mailbox panels pulled off the front of the activity area I have already disassembled the walker and put it back in the box it is going back to the store,103,1
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,all my son 11 mos wants to do is walk but he can not quite do it by himself yet we got this walking toy so that i did not have to spend my days hunched over holding his hands as he toddled around the house since he is still learning to walk most walking toys we tried just slipped out from under him but this one is stable and slow just right for a learner my sons walking has become much more confident and stable since we bought this walker he can easily push and turn all around the wood floors and some carpet in our house the toy portion is not very exciting my son mostly puts things in the mail slots and then takes them out but walking is the most exciting activity for him right now my friends little boy 9 mos larger and stronger than average 9 mo old sat and played with the walker and the first thing he did was pull the doors off but it did not seem to pose a hazard he also enjoyed spinning the rotating piece,183,2
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this is a tough one overall i would rate this toy as fair it is not terrible and my daughter when she was stable and could walk with a walker used this and did fine but the doors on the front are a pain they have fallen off at least 100 times and for this reason alone i would say get another walker it is just not worth the minor irritation of having to constantly put them back on when there are many other walkers that do not have this issue we moms have enough little battles to fight every day than to have to put back pieces that should not be falling off every single time the little one gets his / her hands on it my son uses it now and it is just the same thing sorry not worth it,138,3
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we got this walker as a gift for our 8-month old son he is just learning to pull up and stand on his own so we were excited to get a walker as a gift i have not compared this to other ones but it is not very stable it can easily be tipped especially when he runs into a door or something if he pushes hard enough he topples over the front of it he has also lost his balance and fallen backwards i just expected it to be a little more sturdy like some of his other toys i understand it can not be perfect and expect some falls but it seems cheap to me the little doors mail slots always come off again just seems cheap he loves this toy however he pushes it everywhere one good thing is that the wheels can adjust so that it goes slow or fast depending on the floor or the skill of the child that is really a good thing and has worked for us other than that although I have been a little dissatisfied with it,184,4
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this was a great walking toy for my 11 month old granddaughter she loves the bright colors and the mail toys are great for teething,25,5
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this walker for our daughter when she was about 9 months old because she was starting to cruise around things and we thought maybe a walker would be fun there was more assembly than we had expected not difficult but it was not out of the box ready we discovered quickly that mail carrier was not in this walkers future the doors have not been on it since the first week they come off so easily that our daughter rips them off whenever she sees them she likes to put her dolls in the walker and push it around like a stroller she is now a year old i like the feature that let us you put the wheels away it works well for controlling out of control older siblings the only warning i have is that the wheels are slick on hardwood floors for little ones that are not sturdy on their feet yet i looked around although and could not find one that was good on hardwood anyway overall this toy has been played with off and on and has held up very well,186,6
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this days ago and it is already going back an impromptu stop at the store for a walker for my 10mos old to take on vacation so he would not be cruising all the furninture at grandmas house after three kids i was missing the old ones i had for the other two but was tempted because of it is simplicity and no battery thing let me break it down time consuming assembly had to hunt down screwdriver it tipped over immedietly as the baby pulled himself up so it only worked when i held on to either him or the front of the walker making this not an independent toy within minutes mailslot doors came off now have to hunt for mail so it can all go back to the store the adjustable traction worked on some floors in our home but not all of them on the plus side it does not run on batteries is pretty basic and the baby loved playing with the mail slots while the doors stayed on either way i am returning it and getting a different activity walker for him,186,7
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,as the grandmom of 1 year old triplet girls this is a great product the girls are just learning to walk and are fascinated with the activity walker the width gives them stability the tension on the wheels is adjustable so they do not go flying across the floor the removable doors are entertaining off the walker as well as on,60,8
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought this walker for our daughter when she was 11 months just a few weeks later she was walking she loves it she is constantly putting the letters in and out of the compartment it is quite funny to watch her walk around the house picking up different things the remote control books the dogs toys and putting them in her mail bin as for me and husband we love the fact that you can adjust the speed on the wheels much safer for her the doors came off once but that was no big deal they pop back on easily i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality walker for your baby,119,9
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,the package was delivered quickly the toy was easy to assemble it seems like it will not easily come apart my granddaughter loves it there are lots of things to push and twirl and it will help her stand up and begin to walk at the same time as entertaining her it is a good toy,55,10
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we bought this for our baby in january when she was 8 months old because she was just starting to cruise she loved it then and still uses it now that she is 12 months my only complaint is that the doors come off so easily that they are never on the thing which means you can not store anything in it if the doors are off they were designed this way but i think they would be better if they were not quite so easy to remove,87,11
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i did not like that the doors came off so easily or that my son could stand next to it and knock it over but he really enjoyed it he was walking on his own within 2 weeks of having it,40,12
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this products does not hold up it falls a part from get go not really safe for toddler learning to walk sorry but truth i was very disappointed susanna / nanna sc,30,13
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you are looking for a sturdy push toy for a child who is learning to walk this is a great option the wheels can be tightened depending on the flooring it will be used on we have tile throughout our house and i was worried about it sliding out from underneath my daughter when she tried to use it that never happened it always remained within her control yes the doors come off easily and some of the sliding toys on it are hard to move but she never showed much interest in them anyway and as a push toy it is great even now as an almost [ ] she will put her toys in it and cart them around the house with her at top speed,125,14
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,it is cute it holds my 11 months old attention for a brief period she loves to place the mail in the slots the slots do not stay on they do fall off quit easily but they slip in pretty easy too it is a great push toy do not expect much it is pretty flimsy the bright colors are attractive although,59,15
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,within 1 week of having this toy my daughter wanted to walk on her own within 2 weeks of having this toy she was walking by herself she was 10 months old now at almost a year old she uses it to run around the house i have recommneded this toy for several moms that have babies around the same age as mine,62,16
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my mother bought this for my 11 month old son who is a late walker the doors were constantly falling off and there is not much else to do if there are no doors also every time he would try pulling himself up the whole thing would tip over if we would lift him so that he could walk with it he would either fall backwards with the whole thing falling ontop of him or the front wheels would go flying forward and he would fall forward even when he was playing with the front toys it fell on him the only good thing was that we called little tikes to complain and they were very nice and replaced it with a different toy,124,17
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 11-and-a-half-month-old nephew for christmas 10 days later he took his first steps on his own to be fair he was pretty close already but he loved this toy and walked it all over from the day he got it i know other people complain about the mailbox door and yes it comes off pretty easily but it is no big deal to slip it back on at all my nephew loves the mail too he will put them in the box and take them out over and over again this is a sturdy toy and perfect for a kid who has almost walking but not quite for what it is worth my 2-and-a-half-year-old niece loved this toy too she kept stealing it from my nephew and trying to put all kinds of toys in the mailbox i do not know why this toy is adaptable to lie flat my nephew totally lost interest in it when we changed the position we also never got to try out the tension control because the playroom is carpeted but it is a great feature nonetheless,184,18
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i have tile floor and this walker was so terrible i threw it away if you have carpet i guess it would not be so bad but the speed control wheel did nothing on the slow one it just drug accross the floor and left scatch marks and on any speed the thing was too light weight in the front and tiped over as i said i have tile floor and every time she fell she would fall sideways and land on her head very very very dangerous do not buy if you do not have carpet,95,19
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this product is just awful my son 10 months recd it as a christmas gift and it stands there empty all of the time the doors fall off the sticker inside says removable door for easy acess what a joke i bet that sticker was an after thought when they realized how bad of a product it really was i am sick of putting this thing together 10 times a day when my teenagers were young i trusted the name little tikes because their toys were usually better than the others because they seemed to be more rugged and used heavier plastics it is a shame how they have changed i am very dissapointed lisa,115,20
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is not very sturdy it tips over easily the toys on the front are not easy to use or very engaging,23,21
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this walker play toy was one of my grandsons favorites at age 1 - 2 years old first he just played with the attached toys and then taught himself how to walk with it i sent one to my great niece for her lst b / d her mother raved how wonderful the toy was she also helped herself learn to walk i just sent my cousins child the same gift for his lst b / d with the same response this will definitely be my gift of choice for this age group,87,22
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,it was easy to put together i just wish it would stay together the doors on the front for the pretend mail are worthless i wish this toy had more activity things for the child to be impressed with because i was not get another walker toy i would not recommend this one,53,23
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,easy to put together very sturdy my almost-walking-11 month old nephew loves walking with it playing with the pieces and teething on them too he can not get enough of it finally he can stand upright with the correct proportions for him to be stable and walk around like everyone else hurrah,47,24
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,not worth the money there are better walkers out there i agree with some other posts that the little doors or whatever you call them come of way to easy i am sick of picking them up off the floor i got this because my son loved the walker a friend of mine had for their baby so i figured they were all alike and bought this one i was wrong he hardly touches this one but loves any other walker he comes in contact with not enough integrated toys on this one to make him happy especially once the doors fall off,104,25
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my little boy loves this walker i know it was not expensive but it does the trick just perfectly i love it because it is simple no batteries required i also disagree with some reviewers that the plastic letters are not a good asset my boy plays extensively with the letters even if he has not focused on walking I have seen him take the letters and use them as a hammer and happily bang away on other things,74,26
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we bought this for our first child and loved it this one is so stable with the wide stance we turned it into an outside toy once he was a good walker because he loved to use it to deliver mail when our 2nd was born we bought a new one for inside we thought about getting a different one but so many out there have flashing lights and more kids do not need all that junk to have fun walking is already fun for them,84,27
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy helped teach my girl to run around and walk she used to fly around no problem with thisshe first had it when she was 13mos old and still uses it today she has 2 she uses it with the doors off to cart her doll around and will on occasion pretend to deliver mail with it not bad for the price no annoying sounds to drive me crazy either,72,28
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my grandson just loves this toy and now he is trying to walk with it,15,29
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,wow this was an instant hit with my 10 month old it took me nearly an hour to put together simply because she was crawling over me the entire time trying to help with the slide toys my baby is only 18 pounds and pretty agile so we have not had any problems with tipping she loves walking through the house after me i also think the letters are a greatjust the right size for chewing and large enough not to get lost easily fun toy and great value for the price,93,30
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you are like me and sick of toys that play music and have flashing lights then this simple walker is for you because it folds up flat easily we would take it to the park with our 10 month old son and set it up on the grass my son would push it from one end of the park to the other end happily and when he got tired he would sit and post the letters or whatever else he got his hands on or play with the buttons yes it occasionally tipped but no harm occurred and what toddler is not going to go face down from time to time and because it is so simple i never worried about getting dirt grass or sand in it it washed off easily but here is what really struck me a kid at the park came up to us and started playing with the walker after pushing the numbers stickers really he complained this does not do anything my son would disagree,172,31
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is unstable and falls over when my baby tries to pull himself up it also collapses when my baby tries to walk with it it is probably the worst one i have ever seen save your money and save your baby from a horrible fall do not buy this walker,51,32
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son loves this walker even now that he is walking on his own he loves pushing things and this moves good on any type of floor the doors do fall off easy but he does not care he likes to carry the doors around great walker for the price,49,33
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old all the other reviews are right the doors break off way too easily but our daughter really liked it and for that one month she used it as a walker to help her walk now she uses it with her playhouse and sticks all kinds of things into it she is now a year and a half and although it sits along the wall she still uses it with her other toys when her friends come over they always want to play with it for 2 - 3 minutes and then they move on the other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well i think it was a great gift but i would not have bought it 2 stars for durability due to the doors they are still somewhere around the house,157,34
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my sister purchased this for my little guy for christmas and it is not a good toy it is a good walked but the compartment doors on the front just fall off when you open them i would not recommend this toy,42,35
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this activity walker for my son when he was about 8 months old we had visited a friend whose son had it and as soon as i put my son behind the walker i assisted him up to the handle he took off walking it does not get much more exciting than that i ran to the toy store that evening and bought it my son has always loved this toy he is very active and started walking on his own around 11 months i am sure his use of this toy helped him develop that skill he is almost 17 months now and he still pushes the cart around often collecting toys in it the little mailbox doors have been long pulled off but he uses it in other creative ways similar to a grocery cart i highly recommend thisin fact i am buying it for a friend,152,36
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,after researching several walkers online i chose this product because of the adjustable wheel speed i was very disappointed after spending 20 minutes assembling all the parts with screws and a screwdriver my daughter pulled off the doors on the front-in about 1 minute next-she tried to stand up to walk and it fell right one top of her i had to hold it still while she stood up-but it still was too light weight and tipped to easily also the smooth plastic wheels slid right across the rug so the speed adjustment feature was mute the toy was so boring that within 5 minutes she was off doing something else needless to say i was disappointed and will be returning it immediately,123,37
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker whe my son was standing up on his own and trying to learn how to walk it was too dangerous for him to use before he could walk because it would tip over whenever he leaned on it now that he can walk it is too dangerous for him to use because he tries to climb on it and it tips over so i would not recommend this toy,73,38
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son tried to pull himself up with the handle of this toy and as the toy tipped backwards he fell backwards and hit his head on the floor he did not want to give up although and proceeded to try again same result except for the fact that we caught him this time this walker tips backward did not work returning it,61,39
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we recieved this as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law her daughter played with it from one year to eighteen months and loved it the doors do come off the front very easily for cleaning purposes it claims and it does require parental supervision she can not pull herself up on with it tipping over and it does not steer very well but the speed adjustment puts it far ahead of similar toys and she just lights up when playing with it and can not stop laughing overall it works well for us we just colaspe it when we are not walking around with her when calasped she loves to play with the attivity board,110,40
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i did not like this toy at all as all the others say the plastic door on the front come right off my baby enjoys putting the letters in but they slide right out very poor construction,36,41
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy with the hope that i could encourage my 9 month old to start walking he pulled off the pieces and scattered them everywhere for 1/2 the money i found another similar toy that works just as well,41,42
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we received this toy last christmas for my 9 month old at the time the first night she ripped off the doors and they do rarely stay on however the wheels do tighten easily to allow them the right speed i thought for sure after she learned to walk it would be old news but around 15 months she used it as a seat without the doors it fits her perfectly she loved to get pushed around in it as well as stand up in it scary but no accidents now at almost 2 years she uses it to push her dolls around in it just keeps transforming,109,43
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we bought this toy for our 9-month old daughter I am glad we did although the activity portion of the toy leaves a lot to be desired we did not buy it for the activities our daughter needed something to hold onto while she learns to walk and this toy was perfect for that purpose it offers a very wide and stable platform while still encouraging our daughter to develop her own sense of balance like other reviewers we also appreciated the speed control so that our babys first steps could keep up with the walker my daughter loves the mobility that this toy provides and occasionally enjoys the activity features i would definitely recommend this toy to my friends and family,120,44
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,like other reviewers i thought the only good thing was the speed control on the wheels unfortunately my box was missing the screws to attach the large blue handle the exposed sides were dangerous and my daughter pulled the lids off then used the spaces as stairs to climb the toy of course it could not support her weight so she fell over i removed it quickly after that,68,45
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my grandmother had purchased a winnie the pooh walker for my 9 month old which he had trouble controlling where it went especially when it went forward too quickly when he was not ready this walker is much easier for him to control and he loves getting around on his own steam with regard to the front panels coming off my son actually likes taking them off and they are very easy replaced he has never injured himself by doing this and i do not see that being feasible,87,46
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,it is a great toy for a toddler who likes to push toys on wheels it also has very interesting activities to challenge a childs mind and easy for small hands i believe it is a great toy,38,47
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my son has loved this toy since he was about 6 months he is now 11 months and walks all over the house with it it is great because he could play with it flat on the floor and then when he was ready we turned it into a walker it is durable enough for him to push around yet is not beating up all of our furniture and doorways i recommend it for the money,74,48
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i recently bought this toy for our son he has been cruising for weeks now from one piece of furniture to another when i opened it he immediately began trotting across the living room the other problem is not enough floor space he gets upset when he hits the wall and it does not move anymore since we have bought this toy he has taken a few steps on his own i believe it helps little ones learn to walk i would recommend this toy to anyone,85,49
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my son because he is walking along furniture and i thought it might help learn to walk i loved that it said it had adjustable speed but on our carpet the wheels do not turn at all it just glides over the floor just as fast we have also had the mail door problem the worst thing about this toy is that my son was playing with the mail slot while i was putting his laundry away and i heard this awful screaming he got his little finger stuck in the side and had his other hand pushing the mail door shut with all his body weight by the time i got to him and released his finger it was white and then bruised shortly after i removed the doors and put them away so he can not get them but he has not touched this toy since this has been a total waste of money for our family,160,50
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you have a sore back from helping your cruising baby walk i recommend the wide-track walker my daughter loves the independence it provides her and i love seeing her grin as she walks all over the place pushing it,40,51
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy was great although i bought it only one month ago and both doors are gone they do not stay on ver well one is supposed to be removable but my 9 month old could get them both off this was his favorite part it really is a great toy he was walking with it the same day the wheel has a resistance lever so the toy does not go flying when they push on it but this lever always switches itself back to the least resistance position oh well for the price it was worth it they grow out of things so qiuckly,104,52
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i was sooo excited to see this product and thought it would be perfect for my baby girl so when grandma brought it home we were thrilled and tried it out right away when it is folded down on the ground she loves it all although the little doors just snap right off she will just play with the door too but she has learning to walk and that is the part i liked best until she actually started walking with it she lost her balance and fell backwards and the toy went backwards with her and smacked her in the face this happened everytime she tried to pull up on it as well so i have put it away in the closet for now so be careful not to let your little one use this toy on hard surfaces they might crack their head and smack their face at the same time,150,53
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i was disappointed in the design little tikes usually makes such great things my son started playing with this at 9 - 10 months and even then he could pull the doors right off it was not very good if they were intended to be used as mail slots to learn how to put things in and take them back out i agree with the other poster that he was not at all interested in any of the other toys on it like the caterpiller or little bugs my son did walk at 10 months and has not stopped to rest since he only pushes this on occassion like i said we received it as a gift but i would never buy this one on my own,125,54
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,not a very good toy for a young child it is too lightweight and it tipped over backwards everytime my daughter tried to walk behind it this caused her to bang her head on the floor many times also the doors on the front come off very easily so my daughter uses it as ato climb on and even used it to help her climb up onto the couch,71,55
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we were very displeased with this product the pieces come off way too easy and the worst part about it is that when baby starts to tumble backwards the toy comes with my daughter also can not use the toy to pull up on either we got a much better playskool one for 5 at a yard sale sorry i wasted my money on the other one,66,56
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i absolutley love this walker and so does my son my son is now 10 months old and loves to walk we received the fp brilliant basics walker as a gift but we soon found out that it was not for us it was lightweight and flimsy everytime my son tried to use it it would push ahead of him and he would end up on his knees or on his face not exactly the right way to help a baby learn to walk my mil bought our son this walker and he just loves it the speed / traction control feature is a must gone are the days of him falling on his face or to his knees he can actually walk across the room with this and it does not fly out from under him yes the mailbox doors come off very easily but so what my son likes to take them off and play with them when the doors are off you can put a favorite toy there instead my son loves to push around his stuffed animals overall great sturdy walker for the price very pleased,184,57
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is very lightweight my son picked the whole thing up instaed of trying to push it even with the brakes on the plastic wheel just slide right across the floor leaving baby face first behind it do not waste your money go with fisher price,45,58
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we bought this for our 7 month old girl at christmas she loved it from the beginning taking her first few steps with the walker with daddy right behind her even although she is now walking independently she still loves the walker as she has found new ways to use it she pulls off both flaps to make a seat for herself and now at nearly one year she loves to climb all over it and placing one foot on the front uses it backwards as a scooter at first the bee and caterpillar were too stiff for her to move but over the months she was able to move them great value great product,115,59
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this is only good if your child can stand up on his or her own it is so light and narrow it tipped over backwards when our daughter tried to support herself with it by the way putting it together is no fun,43,60
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this for my 8 month old who is learning to walk she absolutely loves walking around the house with this and gets the biggest smile on her face for that alone it is worth the 20 it is bright and cheerful looking when my husband put it together i had him readjust the toys on the front the moving bee and caterpillar so they would be looser and easier for her to move back and forth yes as everyone else said the mailbox covers come off way too easily but that is not too important to us my 2 year old is the one who pulls them off i will try the suggestion from a previous reviewer of putting the top slot on the bottom my 2 year old has had fun with this toy too she likes the novelty of pushing it around the house and then watching as her baby sister does it i would definitely buy this again,162,61
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my daughter got this toy for christmas right about the time she was starting to stand alone i really do think it has helped her learn to walk although as soon as she could walk without it she lost interest in it i do like that it has a wide base and is adjustable as far as speed i think i would buy it again,65,62
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we bought this when my daughter was ready to start walking she was able to stand by herself and sometimes would make aor two so we thought it would help her to learn walking however this toy did not help at all the tires are plastic so they slide very easily which means a child has to run very fast in order not to fold down because as soon as a child presses on the handle the walker starts sliding forward like it is onthe leters and other fun features of the toy are ok and my daughter played with them a little but she was not really excited about the toy,115,63
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker for my ten month old and 2 mins after we put it together the doors are pulled off they do not stay on and the letters then just fall out and it is very hard my son to turn it i packed it up and brought out my daughters old fisher price walker much better quality,58,64
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we bought this for our daughter to play with when she was learning to walk the mail is difficult to put into the holders and it frustrated her the little drawers that open up to put items in fall off the cart after using it a few times the bottom one fell off completely causing a huge temper tantrum of frustration it does adjust in it is speeds ie it gives more resistance for those that are still unsteady which is nice,81,65
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,while in the sit down position playing with this toy my daughter got her foot stuck inside the corner of the blue handle opening it might seem hard to believe but she had her ankle wedged inside where the blue handle tapers down to the walker i immediately threw the walker in the trash this will never happen to me again luckly i was right there to remove her foot and it was not easy i was very scared her foot was going to be broken can you image your baby with a cast on it is leg it is just not worth it,102,66
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i can see how it can tip easily but my son likes that it is more flexible he takes turns and does 3 - 60s it is his first choice of walkers we have the hippo and a car as well,39,67
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this toy appears to be pretty neat but alas it is not my daughter was always trying to play with it from the front and would pull up on it to put the envelopes in the mailbox and when she leaned on it the doors fell off and she fell face first into it one time she fell into it she got a huge knot on her forehead w / a nasty purple bruise this toy went in the trash after 2 weeks we are totally not thrilled with this especially being made by little tikes which is a brand we have always trusted i do not recommend this toy to any child no matter what the age it is not safe,121,68
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this for my twin nine month old grandsons for christmas the problem i have is that i can not get the speed of the wheels adjusted no matter what setting i put them on the walker goes too fast and they fall i find that they are always removing the mailbox doors they also get their fingers caught in the doors it is cute for the price but i wish i had bought just a regular old fashioned walker like my children used thirty years ago,89,69
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,there are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market but they also cost more money so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker personally my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase as soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest i put it away in the baby things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking that being said if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk this is not the toy the mail slots come off way too easily and are boring the mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house the accessory toys bug themed on the walker are way too hard to manipulate plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox what are the bugs doing on it you have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs / wants,188,70
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my husband and i purchased this for my son when he began to walk he absolutely loves it he pushes it all around the house and in the backyard he likes to drop the mail into the mail slots he also enjoys playing with the bee and caterpillar it is not difficut to move at all for him the mail doors do come off easily but it is not bothersome at all i guess it just depends on what the child is more interested in doing my son just loves to push it all around i think it is a great toy and helps begining walkers i would recommend it to anyone,110,71
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this walker for my son when he was 9 months it was much less expensive than the other walkers and i liked that it had a wide track and wheel speed control i was initially very disappointed like the other reviewers i could not believe how easily the mailbox slots fall off we had the toy home and assembled for 10 minutes and the bottom mailbox fell off and our dog chewed it up even with the wheels on the slowest setting the walker would go too fast for my son to keep up and it skids on all surfaces even although it claims to have wheels that grip however my son loves this toy and loves to pull of the mail slot and play with the plastic envelopes now at 10 months he can pull himself up easily on it without tipping it onto himself and can cruise around the house pushing it he likes to put his stuffed animals in the mail slot area and give them rides I am so glad i did not get rid of it right away which was my first instinct because this is his current favorite,193,72
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my 7month old son who was standing and walking while holding on to things but this toy was a total waste of money he did great walking while holding on to it for a while but if he pulled back on it both him and the toy would hit the floor and then after he started walking at 8months he could rip the covers off the front way too easily and once he realized that they would come off so easily he continuously pulled them right off and walk around with it in his hand while never bothering with the rest of the toy so it was pretty much useless after that,117,73
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,since she learned to walk at 105 months this has been my daughters constant companion she has still using it at 13 months in different ways we had another similarstride to ride but this has been the clear winner she prefers and uses a lot it was stable esp as she started out leaning on it and then pushing it now she can steer it and gets great satisfaction as she negotiates corners and doorways i like the speed adjustment on the wheels the stickers faded outside it is an indoor / outdoor toy with us and the dexterity activities on it are pretty lame but she is mainly just go-go-go w / this she does try to climb and sit in the front pouch area although cute / funny we discourage that safety issue overall i think this purchase was a good value,141,74
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this toy falls over every time my nine month old tries to brace himself to stand up and push it also the mail slots fall off constantly overall this toy is dangerous and a waste of money,37,75
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this toy for our 10 month old who was starting to cruise unfortunately this toy did not instill any confidence in our son everytime he tried to pull up using the toy it would roll away from him causing him to fall when he was already standing and tried to walk holding on to it it would scoot away from him again causing him to fall the doors do break off easily this toy has gone in the garbage as i do not feel it is safe enough for any child to play with,96,76
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,when i bought this walker i did not realize that the rear wheels are not on an axle and therefore do not spin easily they are secured with screws the wheel control is on the front wheels so you would think that the rear wheels would spin easily they do not and will seriously scratch your hardwood floors we had our floors refinished two years ago and now due to this toy they will need to be refinished again this is a very poor design and as others have mentioned the doors come off very easily my son likes playing with the doors but gets frustrated when they keep coming off the other toys on the walker do not interest him at all i will say that the walker is sturdy,131,77
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,as other users have stated there is not enough weight at the base of this toy to keep it grounded when a child is using the handle to pull up it does fall on the baby when he falls using it this toy is being thrown away at my house my morals will not allow me to sell or donate it risking the endangerment of another child,69,78
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this toy is not recommended for babies learning to walk it is flimsy and when my son falls backwards it winds up falling on top of him and frightens him sometimes even hitting his face there should be more weight to the bottom of the thing to help keep it stable i wish i knew this before i purchased thisinstead of assisting my baby with walking it hurts him,71,79
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this for our son just before he was 11 months i wanted something with speed control because he just kept falling on the others he had tried i love the speed control he was not falling forward like he was on the others we had to stay close for awhile because it is light so he would tip over when he was first getting the hang of it he is almost 1 year and does not tip and is able to pull himself up on it despite it being a light toy,94,80
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we recently bought this walker for our 9 month old he loves it we like it because it does not have music noise yet another toy with the abc song it does what is was intended to do be a walker he loves the envelopes and is getting good at putting them into the mailbox yes the doors come off easily but our leapfrog table has a purple door that pops off just as easily plus this walker was not expensive,77,81
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i purchased this toy for the sole purpose of helping my baby to stand and then walk he can stand if he pulls up on a couch or similar unfortunately this product is so light and flimsy that it topples with the smallest amout of pressure there has no way my baby can pull himself up on this toy unless i hold it and then what has the point in addition i agree with several of the other parents comments about the flaps being easy to come off and then a hazard my son loved in the 1 day we owned it to pull off the flap with the spinning disk and then promptly got his hand caught and pinched in it as he tried toon it he did love biting the plastic envelopes oh boy i returned this product,140,82
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this push-toy is nice when pushed but the doors come off very easily and once they are off my daughter climbs into the shelf on the front of the toy that is very dangerous plus the busy-box features on the front are lame and the letters are a waste they just wind up scattered all over the house i wish we would gotten her a different walker,66,83
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my twin boys first birthday as everyone has said the doors come off very easily i am sick of picking them up off the floor it also falls over backwards very easily it falls over backwards onto my sons when they try to sit down holding onto the handle one of my sons likes to touch the bee on the front while he is holding onto the handle standing behind the toy it falls over backwards on top of him this toy is not very sturdy for small children trying to learn to walk i expected a lot better quality from little tykes,108,84
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son loves this toy he got this toy as a gift when he was 10 months old yes the doors fall off but my son could care less he uses this toy to walk all over the house it is also light enough that we take it to the park shopping and more so he can walk on his own when we go out he has fallen down a few times as other people mentioned but i assume this is the case with most early walkers now that he has the hang of using it he pulls himself up with the bar and has few problems walking around with it i would say this is one of his favorite toys we own so i think it is quite a deal for the price,134,85
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this is a terrible toy like all of the other reviews say the mail doors come off way to easy both of my boys would try to walk with it but the toy would not stay up and they both just fell on there backs and then within 2 days the toy would just collapse once i walked in the boys bedroom just in time to see one of the boys standing on the toy where the doors are supposed to be lifting himself up to the crib and almost falling i just with i could return this toy what a waste of money and it is too dangerous to donate,111,86
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this for my son when we was 9 months old he had been walking around the furniture for over a month my main complaint about this toy is that the doors come off very easily garrett loved the letters and opening the doors but as soon as they came off he was scooting them around the floor i think he used the walker feature 2 or 3 times i returned it after a few weeks,77,87
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we just purchased this toy a few days ago the doors on the front are detachable and they detach way too easily my son was pulling himself up on the toy and the doors fell out and he bumped his head on the toy now he has a big shiner on his head i am so upset that little tykes did not know better it is very dissapointing dangerous toy,69,88
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,the two pieces on the front will not stay on and my friend has a different one and it looks more durable,22,89
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i just watched my 10 month old daughter topple over with this contraption on top of her from the moment we put this thing together my wife and i were concerned about it if you have hardwood floors be prepared to chase your child around as the walker simply slides uncontrollably across the floor my biggest criticism is that the weight distribution is totally screwed up presumably this walker is being used by children who are learning to walk when our daughter pulls herself up on the handle there is not enough weight in the front to prevent the walker from tipping over I am no engineer but something about the design is all wrong ours is going in the trash,120,90
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i got this walker for my 8 month old and i highly reccomend it people keep complaining about a piece of the toy coming off and losing toys well i did not buy it for the toy part i bought it for the walker part-as will most people i assume i love the parent controlled speed adjustment i was expecting about 3 speeds to choose from no there are 11 yes 11 i was so happy when i stood my little girl up with it and it did not roll out from her that is why i would reccomend this walker to everyone i know i only gave it 4 stars although because the toys on it are a little cheezy my daughter seems to love them although so i guess that is all that matters,133,91
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,the first time my baby started walking around with this i screamed i called my mom and said my baby is walking my baby is walking it was so cool watching him walk all over the living room he loves this toy give it a try every baby is different,50,92
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my 10 month old son it is pretty sturdy however the doors as well as the envelopes that come with it are lost somewhere in the house the doors do come off with little or no effort and thus making it possible for my son to climb onto it and stand which makes me very leary to turn around for a moment because it looks like he will tip over he played with it for approximately 30 minutes and his 4 year old brother like to use it to try to run over him and the dog with it i like the speed control of the wheels but would be better if the wheels clicked or made noise of some kind it does not teach you anything at all keep on looking unless you are prepared to keep putting on the doors and not let them climb on it,152,93
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,my daughter loved to play with this toy the only problem was the doors come off way to easy the first thing she would do when she played with this was take the doors off they need to do something to secure them it also tends to tip back when she tries to walk with it i think your better off trying a different toy if you are looking for something that will help your child walk ours now takes up space in the garage,85,94
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my 8 month old son who is learning to walk it was not a good buy for me it is made cheaply and is not worth the money i spent on it not only do the doors come off but the slider toys do not slide well the speed control on the wheel does not work either beware of buying this toy,67,95
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i was really disapointed in this toy i have had numerous little tykes products over the years my oldest 22 youngest 8 mths and i expected the same quality but was let down with this toy when my son trys to pull up to this toy so he can walk with it it flips over backwards with him and he falls hurting himself the little snap on pieces on the front just pop right off with little effort this was a waste of money fortunately it did not cost to much,89,96
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,too unstable it tips when they pull up to stand also the plastic flaps which my son would normally love came out to easily to be any fun,29,97
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son who is now 15 months old got this when he was 8 months old and just learning to stand and cruise my son still uses it and loves to push it around however thiswas purchased new and since day one the mailboxes have yet to stay on they keep falling off even with the smallest amount of pressure so we just now leave them off because frankly they are useless at this point the workmanship is poor so in essence this toy is just used to push around the house and little else i hope other people who have gotten this do not have the same trouble I am just glad i did not shell out my own money for this,119,98
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we received this as a gift for my third child the older two used a wonderful one that gave out after the second one and unfortunately they are not made anymore this one only has two advantages over the old one 1 it has a wheel control like those on roller skates to tighten the wheel so it will not go too fast for the baby learning to walk and 2 it is much easier to make it go flat or sit it back up right i broke a lot of fingernails trying to make the old one change positions the two doors like the other reviewers said come off way too easily once they are off there is little left on the toy except the boring sliders in comparison to other baby toys the three letters just float around the junk pile and are a waste at least the walker has two handles one on top for standing and one on the back for walking on knees which my baby likes to do I am glad it was not me who bought this,181,99
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this walker despite what the reviews said i now see for myself how right they are about the doors my 8 month old granddaughter loves to walk and play with the walker it is very stable and i love the break controls on the wheels the only problem is the doors want stay on surely they could come up with a better door all in all the price and the over-all performance is worth the buy we just do not use the doors,85,100
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for my 9mo son and he has had nothing but accidents with it the doors on the front are very easily removeable leaving afor the child toup and climb on top of the unit causing the unit to topple over child and all the doors need to be permanent fixtures on the unit the unit also is called wide tracker activity walker this unit is not any wider than the traditional activity walkers previously out on the market i personally have not been pleased with this purchase,93,101
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,sure most of the parts fall off and get lost but so does every other toy and walker on the market after the doors were removed and lost by my 10 month old son he became interested in using it as a walker this walker is wide and much better then the narrow handle bars on the fisher price it is resistance is great for carpets and i never worry about him speeding off uncontrollably he just loves using this walker and complains every time we take it away i think it is a great stepping stone for his next milestone walking on his own,104,102
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i would rather not have a toy with a lot of frills this was purchased in an effort to help my son walk and because he was sure footed and cruising already he had no problems taking to it at 9 months and 23 pounds the doors on the front do come off super easy but that is not a concern of mine if my son gets to the point to where he takes it off to use as a stair to get on furniture i will simply super-glue the doors on there so that he can not i do believe it is sturdy although i think that is proven by my sons age weight and use of the toy there are probably better choices out there but i think the price is right and so is the product it is not always necessary to have the perfect and most expensive choice out there,151,103
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this walker for my daughter loving thethat the speed was adjustable my daughter is almost 9 months old and is ready to take off cruising but we just do not have much for her to cruise around so i thought that if this walker was slow enough for her it would be a great beginner walking toy for her i got it home put it together and she loved it instantly especially the spinning flower but when she tries to hold onto the handlebar and go it falls on top of her the legs are set way too close to the body of the toy so it gives absolutely no balance whatsoever unless your kid is so secure on their feet that they never wobble this is not the toy you are looking for i took it back immediately within an hour of purchasing it,148,104
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this for my 10 month old daughter where do i start the brakes do not prevent this contraption from slipping and sliding sideways and forward so every time she hangs on she slides face forward on the ground now she is afraid to walk with it she will try to put the envelopes in the mail slot which just like the others has broken off countless times and she has cut her face from falling forward do not leave your child alone with this product,86,105
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i have this for my 12 month old son it is not sturdy at all do not buy this with thethat it will help balance your child and assist in walking it is so flimsy that it tips over anytime my son tries to pull himself up the only thing he liked about it is the plastic envelopes that he could remove he lost interest in this toy in about a week,73,106
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i was a little leary of this after reading the other reviews but i had already bought it so i took it out of the box you have to understand i am not a logical thinker and have a hard time putting anything together but once i got past the fact that there were no written instructions i figured it out pretty easily armed with only a philips screwdriver i managed to get it together with only a few curses all by myself even with my baby trying to climb all over it he nine months old loves to walk with it and it moves at just the right speed for a beginner my four year old daughter will fight with him to play with it is that good so it is not one of the toys in the corner gathering dust because no one wants to play with it I am glad i bought it and i love watching my son smile as he walks all by himself,169,107
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,like nearly all of these reviews i was really excited to buy this product for my 1 year old who is just beginning to cruise not 5 minutes after I had put the toy together she had crawled up on the green mail flap it snapped off and she fell to the base no split lip but a flurry of tears i can not believe how poorly-made those doors are an infant can pull them off i agree with one of the reviewers stating that that alone should be reason for a recall as well as this the toy when collapsed is not flat enough to provide a sturdy base for a budding and unstable new walker to play on very disappointing,120,108
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old who can not wait to walk on his own he rarely uses it as a walker although he has more interested in pulling the doors off the front of it and on more than one occasion has used it as a climbing tool once he even fell and split his lip open the doors on this thing should be attatched better and barring that the toy should be recalled,80,109
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this for our 10-month old son and he loved it instantly he is just beginning to start cruising on things and this gave him a stable start he pushes it well and stays steady he also loves the mail slot and double doors that open on the front and loves to put everything inside a good purchase all in all,62,110
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son received this for his first bithday and has yet to get any good use out of it it has no balance capability so your child is always at risk of falling back also the door flaps are poorly made and always falling off basicly i do not recomend any one to buy this toy i would have been really upset had i purchased it my self,67,111
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my 10 month old daughter as she had been cruising for about 1 1/2 months and i thought she would enjoy having something to practice walking with and push I am not happy at all with the durability she is constantly pulling the mailbox slots off they come off very easily and has squished her fingers in them on more than one occasion once she pulls them off she likes to stand in the opening thing which looks really cute but it is really dangerous as i can just see her tumbling backwards she is not interested in the toy things the catepillar is too hard to move back and forth overall i wish i would have bought one of the fisher price walkers they seem much sturdier and do not have parts that come off so easily i would recommend you shop around before purchasing this one,150,112
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my husband choose this activity walker because of the speed control feature thinking it would be safer on hardwood floors i expected a little tikes product to be sturdy but i am very disappointed in this one my nine month old pulled the mail doors off within the first minute he began playing with it i am also concerned with the safety the back wheels the back support is very unstable and appears as if they might snap off at the least amount of pressure i would not recommend this activity walker there are much sturdier and safer choices than this,101,113
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my husband and i bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter we liked it because it was the only one on the market that had cruise control and we thought that would be important since we have hardwood floors we spent almost an hour putting it together and then we let the little one try it out at first she was so excited to play with the toys but as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up the the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip needless to say it went back to the toy store and we bought the playzone activity walker she likes the colors sounds and sturdy craftsmanship better than the little tikes,132,114
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy is an excellent tool for babies learning to walk it has a speed control which is great for hardwood floors the only problem is that the doors on the front are easily pulled off but can be placed back,41,115
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i recently purchased this toy for my daughter she had so much fun with it until she leaned on the front of it and the pin that holds it open snapped and it collapsed causing her to fall and scrape her back we did not use it improperly i feel that we may have gotten a defective one since i have not seen anyone else complain of this problem i wrote a letter to little tikes today so i have not recieved a reply yet i just wanted to let you all know incase there is more than one defective one out there,103,116
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,2.0,negative,this was a little tacky looking and felt cheap also we did not get a packing slip with it so we could not return it,24,0
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,4.0,positive,this costume was fairly well made and was purchased as part of a dress up set for my 2 year old grandaughter it runs a little small but is very pretty it does fit her but just barely i think it is well made and perfect for little ones thewas bright and costume was soft,55,1
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,1.0,negative,this did not fit my daughter it was too tight and it was too hard she did not like feel of the costume it felt like sand paper not worth a buy,32,2
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,4.0,positive,got this little ballerina dress for my two year old daugther and she really loves it it has to be hand washed but it is so small that it is easy to wash in a few minutes i think it was a good buy,42,3
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,5.0,positive,i love this ballerina costume for my 1 1/2 year old it came really fast and the quality was better than i expected it is great for playing dress-up i read that it runs a bit small so i got the next size bigger for her and it fits just fine with the exeption of the shoulder straps i have to pin them together in the back so they do not fall off her shoulders but it is very cute and i am very happy with it,86,4
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,4.0,positive,cute quality is what you would expect for this price it is not going to be around forever but the toddler will grow out of it soon anyway the 1 1/2 year old that it was purchased for thinks she is a beautiful ballerina in it and loves it,47,5
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,5.0,positive,loved it price was excellent for the quality,8,6
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,1.0,negative,poorly made very tiny marked 2 toddler inside it said infant one year and two year what a difference very scratchy material i threw it away,26,7
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,1.0,negative,the outfit is cute and my daughter was very excited to wear it it is cheaply made when i washed it all of this weird jelly stuff came off of it and the lace started to rip just from on wear and hand wash i would not recommend this product,50,8
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,4.0,positive,my sister got this for my little 2 year olds birthday she was super excited and when she put it on it was a little snug my girl is 24 lbs so she is very petitie other then the size i think this is beautiful,45,9
Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,5.0,positive,ordered this for my niece who is 2 and she loves it it was too cute it is a halloween costume and the material is not very thick but it is definitely cute and the price was not bad either,37,10

Toys_and_Games,B001B6JIDC,1.0,negative,it would be best to buy an actual ballet outfit this one did not do it for me it seems cheap and ugly,21,12
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,bought this toy to be messing around with the food people in front of me had did not even get to try the joke before it broke minutes after opening it from it is wrap nevertheless hda fun the minute i played with it,42,0
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,purchased this as agift so i can not review as to how well they work for a magician but this was a funthat was packaged nicely and worked for the few times it had been used seems like it would last and does look like a real fork when it is not extended,55,1
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,the fork is a fun party trick and is durable enough for some good laughs however do not expect quality flatware here the metal is pretty thin and as another reviewer said you have to fork at an angle to prevent it from collapsing also the extendability makes washing just a little more challenging,53,2
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,this is fun to use during dinner when people know nothing about the fork reaching across the table to sample someone elses meal always brings on laughter,27,3
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,kind of hard to steal food without it collapsing if done at an improper angle if you figure that out it works fine also makes a wonderful back-scratcher and pointer,30,4
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,very poor quality the package came half opened and the back of the fork is rusted ok for agift for yourself if you do not want to give someone a rusted present,33,5
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,the material is kinda weak a bit disappointed,8,6
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,this for rusted after using it to get pickles from a jar disappointed that it rusted before i even washed it,21,7
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,great for family-style dinners you can taste something from everyone is plate without the rude reaching a must have,18,8
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,my fork arrived with a ragged indented area which was already rusty i understand this is a noveltybut i still expect better quality than i recieved my daughter is disappointed she can not use this,38,9
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,bought this as agift and it turned out to be a total piece of garbage broke before i removed it from the package i ordered a second one from a different seller turned out to be the same and broke on the first day as well poor quality do not buy i wish i could give zero stars,59,10
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,get one go out with friends eat the whole meal then ask your friends for their left overs and say oh not do not get up and extend this puppy it will bring the house down,35,11
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,i reached over laughing about to steal my boyfriends food and it broke immediately very hard to get any pressure to pick up a bite without pushing the fork back together kind of an oversight wish i got to use it at least once,44,12
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,cheap quality it will probably break any day now,9,13

Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,it broke immediately into 3 pieces and was not repairable,10,17
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,if you tug too hard it will come apart and it will never work right again there has not really all that much tension to indicate that it is fully extended my husband pulled it apart before even getting to use it for anything,42,18
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,these are not just a prank fork it is a daily aide for disability it allows a person unable to lift their arms to eat for them self,27,19
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,bought as agift has since turned into a must have once used at a buffet style lunch with friends mad them envious now we all have them good for reaching things a bit farther than your reach that your greedy friend will not pass can be used to get food from a distant plate to try as a sample from a willing / unwilling friend it is just fun,67,20
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,this was meant to be a funny birthday gift for my brother and initially it was fine when i took it out of the package and tested it however after i washed it off and took it to dinner as soon as i fully extended it the brackets on the inside of the end piece popped off and therefore it lost about 6 or so of extension coming apart the fork technically still works but we just have to be gentle with it however i do not think we can really fully fix it slightly disappointing,95,21
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,not as good as some of the other ones mfg cheaper and not as long not finished nicely either and more,20,22

Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,great fun for gatherings or to surprise those folks at the table next to you make sure there is one for everyone they disappear fast,24,24
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,i bought this to have a long fork to make bacon with on first extending it the rods pulled completely out of each other and would not go back in shoddy make this product is definitely a novelty and is not for actual use it does not wash well in the sink either,52,25
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,it is a inexpensive fork if you use it you may be called a dork reach out and take someone has meal you may just get smacked for real cheapcomes in a plastic bag,34,26
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,i bought this to actually use to trick people like others said it is too flimsy to actually stab food when extended i have an extendable spoon from another brand and it is well made when it is extended it stays straight and firm,44,27
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,1.0,negative,bent on the first try by the recipient who tried to use it toy only not for use not sturdy waste of money,23,28

Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,thisis so primary that it does not merit comment as to it is use quality seems adequate and it works fine,22,30
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,i found it to be flimsy my husband likes it because he wanted a replacement it looks as if it has only a spot weld keeping the fork tines and the shaft together will see how many gags it survives,40,31
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,5.0,positive,this extendable fork is the funniest thing ever people are very surprised when we pull it out at dinner everyone wants one once they see it in action,28,32
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,this was a fun gimmick toy while it lasted i used it to eat off a few peoples plates as a prank at a mens retreat i worked it is not very durable but for the price it was worth it i think i used it 4 times total before it broke in half where the telescoping portion attaches to the fork portion the telescoping portion is similar to the old school radio antennas and is somewhat fragile the fork portion came in completely flat like it had been stamped out of a flat piece of metal after some bending and prying i got it to resemble a fork adding to the realism of it,114,33
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,recommend to get the job done great quality easy to use fast shipping,13,0
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,i love the wii winter sports ultimate challenge game graphics are really authentic many games to chose from too great game to while away the winter time hours,28,1
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,it was hard to control your person in this game not alot of instruction it is sitting at the bottom of the games,22,2
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,bought this hoping it was like a game we had tried before really not much interaction on your part disappointing but the price was right so not a huge loss,30,3
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,this was a great buy and the kids i bought this game for the kids in my family i do not understand it but the kids do,26,4
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,it is a hard game to play i find i do not use it anymore i think you need to be alot more experienced than me at game playing,28,5
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,got this bundled cheaply with another game and actually enjoyed the game graphics are not all that great and the format for some of the events is rather odd at times offers an ok variety of the different winter sports but would have liked to see more overrall good game but kind of overpriced i got the game rather cheap and i did not find the game as whole to be worth what it normally would cost on average retail,77,6
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,was exactly as pictured this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend and he loved them would recommend this to anyone,21,7
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,good group of games hard to find my granson and i challenge each other routinely on the slalom course very challenging,21,8
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,this game is beyong difficult to figure out even the main menue is confusing not only that but controlling the characters in the game is a proccess in itself i would not reccommend this game for anyone under 14 years of age and good luck trying to figure it out,49,9
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,when i bought this i thought that it would involve a lot of activity and excitement however when i started playing i was really disappointed i agree with all the reviewers that say the graphics and everything is great but that is not what the point of playing the point is having fun and not thinking that what you are playing was a waste of money and frankly that is not what i think of this game for every sport curling bobsleighthere are different levels and they are pretty hard even for the easiest level also sometimes the controller does not work with it and it gets really frustrating the different sports are pretty boring to play and it does not require a lot of movement at all bottom line if you are looking for a fun and exciting game then you should not get this the sports should involve a lot of movement but instead you are just sitting on the couch holding the remote horizontally and tilting it side to side plus the game can be really hard sometimes and with the controller not working properly it just makes it all the worse save money do not buy it,194,10
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,thought these games would be more in line with the wii sports not so has a very annoying commentary instructions and choosing of game i bought for exercise and the only exercise anyone will get is in their wrists no fun at all,44,11
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,I am very disapointed in this game not fun at all and we did try to find something to like about it and sadly we could not,25,12
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,the game is very hard to move around and understand once you get the game set it is not much fun very disappointed in this game,26,13
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,what i hate about standard video games is having to remember what button to push when to make a character do an action that is why i love the wii the controllers allow true motion to determine the action but not in winter sport you have to pump controls and hit buttons and i just did not want a game like that i wanted to do the motions of skiing or lugeing or what ever not my cup of tea although I am sure it is a bunch of fun if you are used to that type of game it looks great,98,14
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,it looks like fun from the case but the actual game was complicated and blurry and hard to navigate through and even after we figured it out the games were not that fun i can see why someone wanted to sell it,42,15
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,i wanted to have fun with the game because the graphics are very nice to look at unfortunately the difficulty of the events even on the easy mode made it completely impossible to play downhill skiing looked fantastic but i was in the fence every 3 seconds the bobsled did better on it is own without me doing a thing now that is odd,61,16
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,i personally did not like this at all it was to difficult for the children ages 8 - 14 and they have not played it more than four or five times i was dissapointed with the whole things graphics are ok but the gaming experience is just boring,45,17
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,my favorites are the ski jump and the downhill skiing i have learned quite a bit about skiing from this game grew up water skiing not snow i would like for the events to be longer in length to produce a more sustained workout but overall i enjoy this game,51,18
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,this was a total waste of money the accuracy of the remote is poor on one game i just set the remote down and the event continued without any activity by me there is also annoying commentary throughout the events,40,19
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,the controls are lame the announcers and background music were annoying the announcers were hard to understand because the music was louder than their voices the only event that was interesting was the curling but i had the hardest time trying figure out the controls even something as simple as releasing the stone all in all it was pretty boring,60,20
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,this game needs a nunchuck and it is very difficult to manipulate the controls to follow the action my seven year old granddaughter was disappointed and she is an expert with other wi games that use the nunchucks,38,21
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,I am not sure what i expected from this game but it is not the game my kids go to when they turn on the wii we have all tried it in our family some of the games are fun and some are just too difficult to figure out I am not sure i would purchase this again if given the chance,60,22
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,this game is very good i find it to be more challenging and difficult than i expected the instructions are not very clear so i fell a lot luckily unlike real life skiing it does not hurt great game once you get the hang of the controls highly recommend,48,23
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,this game is a lot of fun but it is not exactly a thrill seat of your pants kind of game there are so many different games to play that you will be hard pressed to not enjoy something about this game the graphics are good the game play is good the controls are good my son loves it my daughter loves it it is a lot of fun and at this price it is a good value let the games begin,80,24
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,this game has many sport options however i do not enjoy it i did not really understand the instructions and the ones provided on the game are not very helpful all in all maybe as an amatuer gamer it is just not for me i was hoping it would be fun and it is just frustrating i guess my patience level is low for entertainment that is impossible on the ez settings i would only recommend if you think you can master any game,81,25
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,the game is poor at best it might be a good game if you want to spend a long time figuring out the controls and how to actually play each event but if not then stay away the controls are anything but intuitive and in some cases are just plain stupid and this really ruins the game I am all for games that offer a challenge but not ones that are close to impossible at first because the control system is so bad if you are thinking this will be a winter version of wii sports or something similar then you will be seriously disappointed,104,26
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,i did not like this game the graphics were very good but i really did not like the game itself i found it very hard to handle the controller with the games i was playing i just felt silly working the controller during the game play it was just odd i tried it twice and then sold it,56,27
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,we have tried this game several times mostly the skiing parts compared to similar games we have played on other platforms it stinks pass this up for a game that does not stink by the way 2 player mode stinks,38,28
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,i bought this game for speed skating and curling yes i am that much of a nerd but i love all the winter olympics sports the graphics looked pretty good in the preview so i thought i would love it i did not love this game controls were unresponsive and most of the games particularly bobsled and luge require no skill whatsoever most importantly after 5 tries i still can not get curling to work I am glad i got this game on sale i guess i should not have expected too much quality from conspiracy games,93,29
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,the game is very solid has excelent graphics and good sound there is an opening ceremony and medal ceremonies i really like this game very much,26,30
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,this game is missing the interactive excitement created in the ski jump snow board and ski race that the wii fit board brings to winter sports it is just not that fun,31,31
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,wii controller does not work properly with this game for example in alpine skiing i can not accurately steer in the direction i want it is very frustrating it is a huge waste of time the music and the graphic are okay i regret buying it i should have rented it mario and sonic at the olympic games is much better in terms of good controlling better graphic and more fun,68,32
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,it was hard game but when u know how to do the moves it becomes wow,16,33
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,fun game can be a good work-out if you get into it the curling is a tough one but i am still working on it,25,34
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,i have played this game with my grandkids there are 9 different exciting games in all this game is fun for the entire family,24,35
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,i so wanted for this game to be good i just could not sit and play it more than once the controls are horrible if you want to be frustrated this is the game for you graphics um bad the game had so much potential but it just did not deliver pass on this one,53,36
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,we had high hopes for this game but the bobsled / luge is way too easy and the skiing is way too difficult for bobsled all you do is tilt the controller one way or another and it is very simple to stay in the line that they display for you for skiing it is not too bad but unless you are extremely patient and want to practice a lot it is difficult to see any improvement in the short-term,74,37
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,honestly most of the sports are just too hard to learn the game my 10 year old liked theskating which is like dance revolution but with your hands but once she mastered it she was all done with that my six year old liked bobsled which is like a driving game but got bored with it pretty quickly even as an adult and knowing how to do most of sports personally i found it to hard to learn which makes the games not fun,86,38
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,i was expecting to get some more games in the spirit of wii sport but was rather disapointed by this game as we did not have much fun playing we have tried with the kids age 10 and 8 the various winter sport and failed to get excited,47,39
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,absolutely awesome i can not ski fast or jump long and the commentators keep saying i should have stayed in bed but it is so great anyway i just tell them shut up or I am trying it is pretty hilarious the graphics are amazing love the luge and skeleton figure skating is tricky requires grace and precision so no surprise there unbelievably real feel the speed thankful although that when i crash into the fences or fall off the jump I am not actually breaking any bones want to keep playing because i really think i might learn to win one day,100,40
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,i bought this game for my 12 year old son who is a big gamer he has played the game a few times he said that it is really hard to play i come from the generation of the atari so i can not provide any feedback just thought my sons opinion may help,53,41
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,lacks the intuitive control of other wii games some of the games are worthlessskating and curling are examples others are repetatively boring i would get my money back if i could,33,42
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,if you look at the reviews of various game sites outside amazon this games scores pretty badly i only read the amazon reviews although before purchasing and they seemed to be pretty good i thought it would be fun to do some 2 player skiing but you need 2 nunchuks for that and i only have one this game is not anything like the other snowboarding / skiing games where there are poweryou go off jumps build up your character and more there seems to be only 1 course / run / trail per activity skiing sleddingtoo so it gets pretty boring pretty fast if you are curious still i would rent this game before buying and you can see for yourself,118,43
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,i was really disappointed in the quality of this game after reading the reviews i expected more the controls are hard to get down you get the feeling that nothing you do affects what happens I am really having a hard time finding good wii games beyond wii sports and wii play,51,44
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,i have not been disappointed with the gameplay of winter sports i have been impressed with the graphics on each of the games that I have played the controls are somewhat complicated to master curling is very difficult to learn but i think once you take a couple of falls you figure out what exactly needs to be done the instructions for the controls on screen are not that great i would recommend reading the instructions in the manual first i do think this will be a great party game with our friends and family and at the price it will be one of the sports games we turn to,108,45
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,game is a blast will all the winter sports will keep you moving and are very challenging lots of fun for the whole family this is a game everyone will enjoy playing,32,46
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,we are fairly new to gaming we really like wii sports as well as race games for playstation like crash cart nitro wii winter sports is very difficult to use it does not seem to respond well to the controllers i would not recommend this game to novice gamers,49,47
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,except for figure skating most of the events are lots of fun the actions required in figure skating seem to have no relation whatsoever to the actual sport excelling at some of the events is quite difficult there is a high degree of arm movement required in many of the events although leg movement is unnecessary our favorite at this point is downhill skiing ghost competition against a family member in split screen is especially fun one improvement i would suggest is to allow direct competition between family members in curling one can play at the same time as another family member but never directly there is always an opposing computer-generated team i do recommend this game but be prepared in some events to spend a lot of time getting good at it,133,48
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,my husband bought this game because he liked the look of it he is not a video game player but i frequently see him playing this game it is a lot of fun to play we have not played it single yet because we are always playing against the kids it does take some practice to get the hang of the moves but it is well worth the time put into it you will be skiing down the hills in no time,80,49
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,hours of fun for the person that loves to watch the winter olympics and dreams of skiing the slopes,20,50
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,overall good do not expect anything out of this world but i like the ski jumping figure skating kind of sucks but there are plenty of games to choose from some are easier / mindless and some are a little bit more tricky like downhill skiing which i have yet to figure out hope this helps,53,51
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,i was expecting more eximent from this game i read the reviews and they praised on how good of a game this is I have seen way better games,28,52
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,this game does take some patience in learning and getting better at each event however you will find that many of the events are rather fun such as the luge bobsled cross country and ski jumping although I am still trying to figure what makes me really jump farther especially notewothy is the curling you can actually play a full 9 frame match with 8 stones each frame either against the computer or another team this curling event can actually wind up lasting 1 - 2 hours so it is no half-hearted slap-together event very cool for those who enjoyed watching curling at the last winter olympics the curling in this game will prove to be well worth the price of the game for a fan who enjoyed the basic bowling provided with the system i find the curling to now be one of my favorite wii events to play,145,53
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,there is a need for patience to get the hang of the controls but after that this is really a fun game after having gone through all 15 games once i think the alpine skiing and bobsledding type games have the most replay value i have to agree that there is not much to theskating game after playing it three times i do not think i will venture that way too often the downhill races whether skiing or bobsledding are a lot of fun and get my game adrenaline going i have now gotten the hang of skiing through the gates and am trying to get my 20 coins on the alpine super g when playing this game alone i lose at spider and bobsledding everytime but mostly beat my better half in the down hill skiing neither of us have gotten the hang of the single player skiing circuit and keep getting disqualified we still have to figure that one out this game will have my attention for a while as i am very competitive and determined to win all events,184,54
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,I am amazed at how realistic the downhill racing feels the rhythym and excitement of htting the gates is intoxicating something i would not dare do with this 60yo arthritic body but it brings back many thrilling memories of younger stronger charges downhill other sports are fun too some of the instructins are inscrutable I have done curling a few times but do not have a clue how i got it started that is frustrating wht don y they ever tell you how to exit the game seems like a conspiracy to keep you playing,89,55
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,game had potential but has no lasting entertainment value will not come out of the cover often now that christmas is over,22,56
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,this game is like most wii games terrible such a waste of 50 i would highly suggest renting games or reviewing them extensively on objective websites impulse buys with wii games have yet to do me right,37,57
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,this game is very fun and quite a challange for the entire family would recommend purchasing,16,58
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,this game is amazinly fun but be careful you will be sore the next day arms and back from playing so much another wii hit,27,59
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,my husband and i are addicted to this game our favorite are the ski jump and the bobsled the directions seem a bit complicated for some of the games but once you try them a few times they are easy to handle we think this is a great addition to our wii sports games as we love the interactivity and the multi-player options of these games for parties family events and more,71,60
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,this game offers an extension of traditional wii sports i love the skiing especially and at 30 it is hard to beat,21,61
Video_Games,B000X418EU,5.0,positive,great action and fun controlling the performance of the skaters skiers and all the events highly recommended,17,62
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,for once it seems conspiracy has done something worthwhile conspiracy is the publisher for this game known to create the most painfully bad experiences on the wii to date seriously check reviews of their other games but this game is surprising well designed and thought out the graphics are actually up to par with the other wii games on the market the whole game itself iplays like mario and sonic at the olympics were you have the opportunity to do several games in sequence or just pick one at a time the controls are much more intuitive so therefore the experience is more engaging and overall better the individual events can actually take some time to complete which makes the game alot more playable for 30 dollars this game is a steal,132,63
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,4.0,positive,another fun little adventure game for the younger set this adventure game is very similar to the first nancy drew ds game and while this game has it is flaws the adventure portions are quite good and fun to play the look is similar if not identical to the first nancy drew ds game and plays like it too the mini-games are back and can get a little boring after a while for me the game was very simple and alot of fun so if you want a fun little game for on the go entertainment for younger gamers this one will be fine flawed but easy to play on the go so if you liked the first one you will like this one too,125,0
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,1.0,negative,i really do not like these ds nancy drew games they are just really boring i would much rather get a nancy drew game for the computer,26,1
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,2.0,negative,i bought this game off the sale rack at target i thought it would be interesting since it is nancy drew i was wrong the game is tedious and boring i lost interest with it very quickly,36,2
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,1.0,negative,i do not agree with other positive reviews got stuck every 10 min searching all the levels for a clue that is not found anywhere bored disapointed so i turn the game off waist of money and time,36,3
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,4.0,positive,i played this with my 6 year old daughter and we had a lot of fun it is a good game to share as she will not be able to solve the case on her own we spend half a day running nancy around until we finished it there was a part although where they showed a man stabbed with a knife on his chest with a note attached to it in the lighthouse thank goodness she was on a break when i was at this part other than that i thought it was a pretty good game,97,4
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,1.0,negative,the only thing i have to say about these game it that it would be a great game for very young girls that would be interested in nancy drew compared to the her interactive nancy drew games this games was and epic fail,43,5
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,2.0,negative,the game is fun but at two different places i got stuck and had to re-start the game once when i got to theto talk to doyle to try to find his cat i had not gotten the fish in the village so could not get the key for the boat and could not go anywhere else either i was stuck in about 3 scenes and could not get out i had to re-start the game the 2nd time i was on the roof of the lighhouse and got stuck in the corner and could not move i tried and tried but was stuck in that corner once again i had to re-start the game and for those of you who have played the game you know that is near the end very frustrating the game is fun and i enjoyed playing it a great deal but it does have some glitches in it at least mine did,157,6
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,4.0,positive,this nancy drew game is definitely better than the first one if you have not played the first one do not buy it for yourself try it first from someone else but if you have not played this one yet definitely buy it for yourself it was very entertaining and you are not just on the mansion grounds the whole time you get to go to a womans house a town to explore and you get to drive a boat and scooter you solve this game yourself and the game does notyou other places automatically you have to find clues and converse with people before you go anywhere if i were you i would definitely buy this game not a major disappointment do not listen to other reviews about how it was ok because it was better than ok it was challeging and made me think it rocked happy sleuthing,146,7
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,1.0,negative,the game was recieved in a timely manner and in excellent condition unfortunately the game itself was found to be boring not only by me but my daughter as well i was very disappointed in it,36,8
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,1.0,negative,game play feels like it was designed by a first grader very disappointing for a nancy drew game,18,9
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,4.0,positive,i definately enjoyed playing this version of nancy drew although i perfer the computer games it is easy enough you will not get stuck at one part too long but it is also a good story line i trhink most of the nancy drew games are not long enough,46,10
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,5.0,positive,great mystery game for ds pre-teen daughter loves it finds it difficult enough but not too hard that she gets frustrated we hope to see more nancy drew mysteries for ds in the future,34,11
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,5.0,positive,this game was on of the best nancy drew video games for nintendo ds it really kept you thinking and i found it to be fun to play if you really like games that make you think and keep you interested this is a good one to try the only downfall was i finished it in a day and a half,61,12
Video_Games,B0014QAO3C,4.0,positive,remember that this perspective is coming from a 37 year old woman i reviewed the other nancy drew game and I shall review the hidden staircase after i master it this weekend no challenging feat I am not bragging i liked this game it was a bit longer than the last one and if you are familar with the mini-games they really have not changed the story was better and i have to admit i had to locate a cheat to figure out how the grandfather clock worked for adults this game is like a cheap novel you can finish it in a few hours it is fun requires very little brain-power and it takes your mind off of the real world i do not have kids but my neighbors teen beats us at halo and everything else i would image this might bore video game junkies,141,13
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,game selector works great plugin free games select between the three can play games for hours fits the back of the 3ds and dsi perfectly,25,0
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,i love not having to change games as much put 3 in and go and 3ds work to in these love it,22,1
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,good product and for a very low price it is working well and i purchased it a few months ago,20,2
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,it is a great product no need to fumble around to find games anymore just turn it off switch to a new game and viola done,25,3
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,2.0,negative,i could not get this to work i put it in put the games in and it would not work maybe i am doing something wrong but no luck for me i did not find that it wanted to came back out of mt system when i put it in like some others have said but then agen i mite be doing something wrong,64,4
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,this game selector is great i do not seem to be having the same problem others are with the unit coming off easily during game play but I am using it with a 3ds and maybe it fits snugger on that in comparison with the lite my only issue with it is it is nearly impossible to plug it in to the 3ds it works great and stays in place on the 3ds if you can get it on but it is a hassle to get on in the first place,87,5
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,the universal game selector arrived very quickly after my purchase when i first opened it it felt extremely lightweight and i was a little bit worried that it would be more likely to break than i thought once I had put 3 carts in it although that worry vanished I have had no trouble with it staying in my ds lite and removing the games themselves is easy it works without a hitch and i would say to gamers who like to play on-the-go and own a ds get one I am very pleased with my universal game selector i just wish that memorex had more products for the ds line,109,6
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,great product but it has a flaw the selector can com of easilly by mistake when playing certain games that require grip and us of the l1 and l2 buttons,30,7
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,i usually enjoy playing a thinking game that is based on a story like phoenix wright or professor layton straight through with occasional breaks to play a button mashing game like mario brothers or bejeweled this case was the perfect solution it allows me to store and keep the three games I am playing letting me easily switch between games now i do not have to carry around multiple game cases and switch cards in and out simply flip a switch to select one of three games the only thing i did not like was the fact that the unit could become disengaged from the ds player causing you to lose your game progress my solution i used double-stick tape to attach the unit more securely to the underside of the ds player even with the unit taped in place you can still switch game cards in and out of the three game slots,150,8
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,if you are trying to play 3d games on a regular ds this will not work this will only work with games that were meant for the console your playing on this will need forced applied on it or else it will not read,43,9
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,very useful never going to lose my games and i do not have to keep switching them out also slim enough to not take up that much space in your pocket package was opened and tampered with although,36,10
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,made for the ds lite but works well in others there has aon the 3ds between the console and the switcher i put some tape between to pad it works with 3ds games,34,11
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,it will not stay on for anything causing the game to get disconnected save your money,15,12
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,it falls out easily so you have to hold it in place,12,13
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,this product did not work at all and i was very disappointed in the quality of the product as it appeared to be of low quality,26,14
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,i would love to love this product but alas i can not the concept of it is great being able to have 3 games on your ds and with a switch of a button move between them is cool however there is a major drawbacks first i shall say that i used this on my 3ds xl you can not have a case on your ds with this plugged in the game slot you can not move your ds while playing your game because it clicks out of the slot very very easily the games are very hard to get out of this thing which is awesome while the games are in their slots because you know that they will not fall out but not great when you need to take a game out of it it does weigh your ds down a bit but is tolerable i suppose would i recommend buying this no i would not save your money for something else like a new game,164,15
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,if i do not apply pressure super-specifically the game card disconnects and that just ruins it seriously do not buy this,20,16
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,i purchased two of these one for me one for my friend they both work but the one he got is a little more touchy it is still a cool accessory for the nintendo ds although fits well on both my 3ds xl and his regular sized 3ds,47,17
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,2.0,negative,thisis a great concept but does not function properly it will work for a few minutes but becomes useless with the slightest movement,25,18
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,i really enjoy the convenience of this i love being able to switch between the three games only one shows up on the main screen and there is a switch on the back to choose which one you want to play the switch has just the right amount of resistance to prevent accidental sliding while playing a game however the insert is spring loaded almost you have to be really careful because any pressure on the game selector instead of the l or r buttons will because the game selector to be ejected and your game will be ended with no warning since i play games such as animal crossing and pokemon this ends my game promptly erasing hours of data that i was too focused on to stop for 5 seconds and save that is the only draw back as i can tell and the game selector does not add too much bulk to the actual ds console itself,159,19
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,works great just what we needed to keep from losing our games by laying them around exactly what i was looking for,22,20
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,i tried this product with both my 3ds and my ds lite systems and neither of them worked at all i wish i had gotten my money back,28,21
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,really cool works with 2d and 3d games would recommend to anyone who likes nintendo ds game systems yeah yeah,20,22
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,2.0,negative,it did work reading the games and switching between them but every tiny bump made it completely stopped reading the game so i had to reset and lost all my data quite a few times before i ditched it it is a goodbut this particulardid not work very good like i thought it would,57,23
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,this is awesome no more fumbling around trying to switch between three game cartridge now i pop in three different games and after saving i can switch between games,29,24
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,great little product by a brand name company plugged it into the 3ds and voila 3 games at my teens fingertips d the only complaint and i mean only one is that the case does not fit over the unit when attached other than that it is a hit,49,25
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,1.0,negative,read some of the reviews on thisand figured i would have some of the same problems but thought it would be a part time problem i was wrong it was not worth the problem the games are hard to change out of each spot the entire game case comes out with a slight touch then you have to restart the system to get the games to register if you hate to change games in and out for your child you will hate this even more it does not save any time,92,26
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,4.0,positive,this product does work as advirtised but it does add some bulkeness to the system other than that it works great,21,27
Video_Games,B005TFJB2Y,5.0,positive,this was so ideal for my kids dsi i have a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter it is so easy for them to play and keep track of their love love love it,38,28
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,unless your a genus on alien life forms and alien technology you will not get this game and understand how to win too difficult to deal with not knowing what techs to research and how to win,37,0
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this game must be downloaded by steam this is a slow process worse steam says it will only download once and the download got wiped out by a windows security update all unused items were wiped from my computer as potential virus carriers i am displeased with microsoft and disillusioned with steam which i will never use again,58,1
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,this is a sg keeps you on theyet calm and relex you it is for a fan of sid meirs games i like it worth buying it also good graphics for these types of games give it a try you will not be dissapointed,45,2
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,this game is buggy af at first i thought maybe i was missing a patch but steam takes care of those updates or so tech support tells me i checked teh interwebz and other players report some of the same problems i probably would not buy another these considering how unstable it is,52,3
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,i love the civilization series of games and beyond earth is no exception,13,4
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,this is another great title in sid meiers civilization series the graphics and animation are beautiful the variety of planets and landscape is great this game introduces a new non-linear technology web and it also introduces new concepts in diplomacy affinity and cultural synergies the one glaring flaw i find is with the ai players the good each seems to have it is own unique personality and affinities characteristics the bad the ai players often do not act in a rational or logical manner as with other iterations of civilization the ai players can go from being your friend to being your enemy and declaring war in one turn and with no warning I have played through it several times and the ai is not enough to make this a bad game but it could use some improvement in my opinion,139,5
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,did not catch the fact that you need a steam account to use,13,6
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,i ran into issues many others have expressed online the terrain becomes overly pixelated and glitchy to the point i have not been able to play it,26,7
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this game is so counterintuitive that it makes it too much of a chore to play as my first civilization game i may be handicapped but the tutorial is no help and give instructions to select options but does not show where those options are or what the icon looks like i could not do anything to progress in the game and after only a few turns i gave up and finally just threw the game in the trash i have never been more frustrated with a video game in my entire life,93,8
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,the game concept is pretty good however the flaw is the delivery method network if they truly would allow stand-alone game play it would be awesome steam servers constantly overload slowing down and locking up the game redo the game and simply let us play w / out forcing us to rely on the network,53,9
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,i love this game i love the new type of tech tree i love the graphics and pretty much everything about this game i have long been a civ player and they just keep getting better,36,10
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,it was a fun novelty and had a lot of interesting new content and ideas within the civilization framework they got more right than they got wrong but there was just enough wrong in it for me to take a star away i hated that there was a maximum turn limit no matter what it really put a damper on certain types of gameplay styles,65,11
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,does not work on windows 10 for a ton of reasons tried verifiying files updating video drivers i can get the older civ v to work fine but this one not once,30,12
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,boring looks like a cheap attempt to sell another product,10,13
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,the civilization style with different graphics and names / and more it is fun and a good deal,14,14
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,very much like the old game alpha centauri have always wanted to get a copy of that game but this one is even better,25,15
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,if you like buggy software you will love it otherwise skip it even on easy level only perhaps 1 of 6 games are playable the rest have to many obstacles to let you even get started poorly thought out and even more poorly written,43,16
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,got blank screens requiring reboot while playing game online,9,17
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,take civ 5 remove everything that made each civilization unique then reskin it as a space game and you have got beyond earth actually beyond earth is worse than that they do not have good quotes from historical figures or books instead they are made up nonsense from fictitious people in the game you land on the planet and found your first city but you have nowhat the map looks like because your astronauts are too stupid to take a few photos from space before landing there are fewer victory types available for example cultural victory and diplomatic victory have been removed in this game,106,18
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,my dad had rising tides and needed this in order to play it i gave it to him for his birthday,21,19
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,not as good as civilization 5 but still a very fun game where you can spend hours of your time the game is well made and fun to play if you love strategy,33,20
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,now that i have had the time to get acquainted with the moves of the game i enjoy it i am new at this type of turn based play it has a number of game settings on which to play time moves along quickly i am very satisfied with this version,51,21
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,fun game compared to civ games it is not quite at that level but that may be because I am not as familiar with this title yet i enjoy beyond earth although challenging but fun,33,22
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,civ v was a much better game save your money for civ 6,13,23
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,after putting in about 70 hours i am done i have tried and tried and tried again to like this game I am a huge space nut what can i say but in the middle of trying a buddy asked if i wanted to play civ v again it was like a breath of fresh air that playthrough called into question everything that is wrong with this game and i do not recommend beyond earth in the slightest at this point it is too confusing the basic combat unit advancement removes a huge part of research units the tech tree is not well done the resources are used extensively or not at all the list goes on it really was a good attempt there are varied and interesting map enhancements and the unique units are interesting enough but do not have enough unique abilities to make the anything other than better units and obviously the setting is something that is not done well enough but i keep going back to civ 5 ever since my buddy asked says a lot my suggestion is to wait until civilization 6 comes out and find a mod that puts a sci-fi skin on it,199,24
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,lot of potential here for alien / predator / all the classic sci finothing like that here all the edifying bits of wisdom from civ5 gone replaced with gibberish strategic view gone now it is a mess of useless animations save your money save your time do not reward the people that ruined this game,49,25
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,fun game that continues the civilization saga that being said you need to research all of the new techs / alien life / game mechanics this is not as easy as picking up a copy of civ v,33,26
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,do not buy runs off steam platform do not know what steam is it is dog crap software designed to make you mad it updated for me once and 6 months later and i still can not login and play google steam login problems or steam software problems you will not buy after that,49,27
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,do not buy a used copy of this program a product code is required which can only be used once the previous owner will have used this code so you will be left with a game you can not play,38,28
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,the game is ok wish you can create you own units with different tech,14,29
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,awful gameplay i loved civ 4 but since then it just keeps getting worse,14,30
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,i bought this as a gift and the recipient is very happy with it,14,31
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,requires steam which is horrible i still have not been able to play because of problems with steam pathetic,19,32
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,my fianc loves it and often remarks on the games surprisingly thoughtful and insightful strategies,15,33
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,the overall is fine nice graphics however the tech tree is all crazy stuff that has not hardly even been thought of like alien tech n such thus i played a few games and got bored of not knowing the tech tree and a way to even do well,50,34
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,if you are buying this in the expectation that it will be easy loading and running you are in for a disappointment there has this thing called steam which appears to be an additional interface that is needed to run the game slowing the computer way down to the point where on my pc i was never able to view the game although steam informed me the game was running i really loved alpha centauri and alien crossfire but this was a huge letdown windows is not enough to run the stupid game,89,35
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,game is a lot of fun some of the new skills to learn took a bit to learn but overall was simple enough to understand in some ways yes it did feel like a reskinned civilization 5 but it still has me coming back for more the old just one more click and then about 20 clicks later you are ok now I am shutting it down if you like previous civilizations then chance is you will like this one as well,81,36
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,interesting expansion on civilization 5 game play very similar although new and fresh design,14,37
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,latest sci / fi civilization games installment from sid meier works on win 7 systems,13,38
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,bought as a gift my fiance enjoyed this installment in the series,12,39
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,best of the civilization games since civ 2 still miss the throne room and wonder movies would have given 5 if the devs would have given those back far more detailed and interesting game then civ5 i expect those that think it is the same as civ5 either have not spent much time playing both or just do not bother with much thought or strategy in there play styles easiest level players perhaps great game impressive tech tree variable degrees of help from advisor very nice for experienced civ players new to this game,91,40
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,basically civ 5 with cosmetic changes some of the diplomatic dialogue is identical to civ 5 very disappointed,18,41
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,yet another great iteration of the cavitation franchise,8,42
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,not nearly as fun as other civ games but definitely more complicated,12,43
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,a lot of fun to play for civ fans,9,44
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this is crap i buy the disk so i do not have to use a 3rd party program to play and it says on box steam needed to install game no indication that steam needed to play game yet clicking the icon opens steam i had it closed deliberately and game does not run without it this is false advertisement by the packing licences on the outside of the box if i was going to buy as a download type program i would have gotten the better package for a discount on newer addon game it has,96,45
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,the improvements and change of venue make it worthwhile,9,46
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,I have been playing civilization for a number of years and really enjoy this new version i recommend to all civilization fans,21,47
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,i have been a civ player since the old dos days this is a good game with the classic civilization style play but it feels like something is missing I have only been playing a few months but I shall play this then go back and play civ v for a couple days i just can not seem to get the civ feel from this game like the classics all had including v i wish they would have made this as an add onto civ v so you could have moved into space from earth as you earned it and more true civ style,100,48
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,it was bought for a gift and the receiver loves it,11,49
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,this game is way less fun and much less polished than civ v if you already have civ v do not bother with beyond earth if you do not buy civ v instead way more fun cheaper hugely disappointing,38,50
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,civilization has to be one of my 10 favorite franchises over the past 30 years and has brought me possibly thousands of hours of entertainment and great memories this game honestly was disappointing and does not live up to the civ name it was tedious lacked the depth of civ v and is really a watered-down poorly done skin on civ v i wish i had never bought it,69,51
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,excellent game absorbing gameplay like eating potato chips once you start it is hard to stop,15,52
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,for the game i did not really like it but the shipment was fast,13,53
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,my wife loves this genre and this one is one of the best lots of actions and excitement yes she was excited she played sid meiers in ps3 for years and there were no new games if you love this genre definitely try this one my only gripe is that the disc does not really work since steam ignored it and download everything it was a long install,67,54
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,disappointed as explained to shipper jazz but kept the game anyhow even although my grandson did not want micro legos,20,55
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,would be an awesome game without the tracking and all around bad steam software application that you have to install and have running to use but as it is mandatory i can not recommend a product that has to have a third party app even to run buy anything else but this maybe the programmers will take note that offline games should not need and online part just to start and run and it takes up space runs slow too bad as i own all the cid meiers games but this will be my last that i ever buy because of steam fix this or lose another customer i do not like having tracking software installed on my machine turned in to antivirus makers as a malware app,125,56
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,i expected more i was hoping for a really sophisticated universe-based game akin to the old masters of orion games instead it is almost exactly like other civilization games with futuristic names and aliens instead of barbarians really disappointing another problem i have with civilization games is they are all now steam-based even if you buy the cd / dvd version you can not even play the game without internet and a steam account one of the reasons i got into civ games was they were playable when i did not have access to the internet as a fun way to pass time in a hotel or in other situations when internet was not readily available honestly when the internet is on there has almost always something better to read / do / play i would not buy this again i doubt I had play it on steam even if it were free if it were playable offline I had give it 3 stars for fitting it is niche where i needed it but still failing to meet my expectations as a new game,167,57
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this is a re-hash of civilization v with new skins for old game mechanics it is no great feat to beat the game and a simple and nearly guaranteed path to victory is hard-coded into it but worse still 2k / firaxis has patched the game to the point that it is unplayable on many systems with nvidia graphics cards that exceeded the both the minimum and recommended requirements and does not seem to care this is my last purchase of a 2k / firaxis game and i am submitting a request for a full and complete refund as the implied warranty of merchantability has been voided by the manufacturer,107,58
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,seems kind of like a re-skin of civ v although i do like some of the new features such as the tech tree web affinities trade routes and unit upgrades,30,59
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,great game if you love the civ series it really could have been called civ 6 alien encounters while the inability to stack units is still a bit weird it does not detract from the game in any way i applaud the fit in with your environment aspect but it is played a little heavy handedly by the other civilizations I have played through several times and do not ever remember one of the other civ leaders saying good thing you blasted those aliens out of the way thus i tend to build around the nests rather than over them,98,60
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,my son loves it and is challenging for him,9,61
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,not a great civ game compared to previous ones nothing new or exciting just some confusing new tech tree and renaming of countries to corporations which land on a planet game play feels clunky and there are bugs i would wait till this game goes on sale before i would buy this i made the classic mistake of falling for the hype and advertising,63,62
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this game has not worked since it was received it will notalthough both computers we tried it on met all parameters my son has tried to contact steam regarding the issue and was directed to twitter no customer service whatsoever from 2k or steam they have released several patches that still do not address the problem,58,63
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,was not great sid meiers civ lost something i have played them all,12,64
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,great next edition of a fantastic series of games,9,65
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,I have been addicted to the game since I have installed it i am disappointed that the boxed version still requires steam to run it although but a great fun game despite having to use steam,34,66
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,weakest civ game yet it is not building on some of the best parts as the last few civs as a big civ fan i am sad to say this is the weakest game in the series and it most definitely is not alpha centauri 2,46,67
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,it was a huge dissapointment this is not what one should expect from sid,14,68
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,such a basic game hard to believe waited so long for something like this graphic are good but otherwise can not say much for it and I have playing civ since civ2 not many opponents engineers merchants and more I am used to in a civ game i really can not believe sid meier put his name on this,53,69
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,similar concept to previous versions i have to figure out the tech tree kind of confusing and not a really good format to know how to pursue tech or military or cultural you have discern it from the way it is presented and some of the options offered within each choice just as addictive as v and other versions on trades you get favors i have nohow to call those up or when they are used or how no good explanation on wonders so i keep wondering if it is worth it and what will you get from it do not regret the purchase but not that much better,110,70
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,definitely a worth addition to the sid meyers civ games more of a sequel to alpha centauri than civilization v however it is still very fun and adds quite an interesting new mix of game mechanics and playstyle options i find myself playing this game very differently than how i normally play civ 5 games which is good a must buy for any fan to the civilization series or sid meyers games all together,74,71
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,game would not install either by a too early game release or issues with the required steam site too many problems save your money until these bugs are removed i have worked with 2k to remove these issues although they are helpful is this to be expected following an expensive purchase,51,72
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,it is more like an expansion pack than a new game diplomacy functions much the same as civ v with the addition of exchanging favors also the spy interface is updated with more options i like the ability to terraform the landscape and the planetary resources are new and different once you adjust to thelandscape you it will feel very much like you are playing civ v instead of barbarians there are aliens instead of happiness there is health to contend with one of my favorite aspects of this game is the automatic unit upgrades as your technologies advance take advantage of trade routes to have ample resources to support units and buildings the technology web is somewhat confusing although well thought out good job overall four new and interesting ways to win in addition to domination victory,139,73
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,hidden on separate system requirements page requires internet activation and patch download should have been listed both on the box and clearly stated on amazon sales page fail to both 2k and amazon,33,74
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,i brought this game for my little brother and he loves it,12,75
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,a large disappointment i had hoped that it would be in the style of his other games,17,76
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,i have found the game to be counter productive the aliens are very aggressive they attack at every chance normally i would build up my defenses and defend myself or even wipe them out entirely i have not gotten that far but there are indications they are important later in the game and i should leave them alone this takes a lot of enjoyment out of the game every time i try to explore or advance my civ the aliens are there to attack,83,77
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,can not even play because when iit the screen goes black but because i had to use the code toit i can not return this will be the last steam game i ever buy back to the 360 for me pos,43,78
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,this long awaited sequel to alpha centauri definitely lives up to the hype we have had the game since the release date and have already logged many many hours into gameplay for fans of alpha centauri [ the original ] or the civ games this game is perfect for you the game was pre-ordered just a few days before the actual release date and was delivered right on time i would definitely recommend this game,72,79
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,i absolutely loved civ 5 and i was really looking forward to beyond earth I am not disappointed with the game or with buying it at full price but i do think that it still feels like atruthfully I had wait for it to go on sale before you pick it up in it is current state there are some bugs nothing breaking thankfully and i think that more content needs to be available to really help it live up to bar set by civ 5 and the hours and hours you can spend there,94,80
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,this is a preliminary rating i have attempted the game several times so far and was very pleased with the way it played and the concept of the game the graphics are rather blurry and dark unlike previous versions the problem that i have with the game is that it could not be completed twice i went all the way through the research and in spite of have the requisite object in place for the victory for over 50 turns it would not complete the victory there was no way to get help on the 2k site although there was a page to ask for help it would not allow me to enter anything i have been playing the civilization games since the first and have found them enjoyable this may be only a problem with the type of victory i attempted so will keep trying if it works i may change the rating,154,81
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,fun mostly what you would expect some new features a lot of old features remain yet had their names changed not enough work was put into the ai although remains decent 75/10,31,82
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,have not been able to play it yet so the one star is my frustration in trying to get it to run could be I am just stupid and i can accept that besides being stupid i am not sure what the issues are my problems may be with steam which you have to use other games i run through them work this one does not my computer meets tech requirements i have corresponded with them twice but no answer beyond the automatedresponse black hole of tech support others do not have this problem so i give up for the time being,102,83
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,classics of the genre probably the most beautiful of all the games in the series civilization it is difficult to name a new subspecies of the series most likely i would say about this game as a reincarnation of good old alpha centauri fans will remember this game from sid meier the game is very beautiful with a nice initial videos but the game is still buggy sometimes by itself hangs treated only by closing the process in task manager,80,84
