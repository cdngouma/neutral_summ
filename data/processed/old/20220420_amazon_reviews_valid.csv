AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the finish comes off super easily and the clasp is super hard to fasten the first time then falls out after that,23,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,my first time wearing a clicker in my septum and i absolutely love this clicker fit my petite nose perfectly i would purchase again,24,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,did not show up in 2 days like they were supposed to with prime shipping got them about a week later and the bar is super loose and really hard to click into the hole i bought these for my diath peircing and they are not going to work i think if i was using them for a septum identification have trouble getting them in that too and in the picture they look black but are in fact a dark silver,80,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i have a little trouble getting clicker closed but do love the over all look it does hang low but that is what i like about it,27,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,it was really nice for the first couple of weeks sadly the clasp gave up too soon and would not stay closed enjoyed it while it lasted,26,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the clasp broke after a few uses kind of a bummer since it looked great when it worked,18,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i love this nose ring it fits really snugly and it is super sturdy some people mentioned having issues getting it off it can be a little difficult and i just used hemostats or roach clips as some call them to grip the bar and pull it out so that was no issue for me but i much prefer the piece being sturdy instead of falling out everytime i move my head i get so many compliments on this ring i would repuchase in a heartbeat,85,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,this is the first septum ring I have ever bought that did not turn green in my nose within a week so that is a only issue is that the hinge is really loose so you have to be really really careful while blowing / rubbing your nose and it makes it kind of difficult to put it in,54,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,the clasp will not close and if you get it to close it pops open immediately,15,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,pros feels light on the face looks good easy to put in con all the reviews about the clicker are true it is sh t broken by the next day after only replacing it maybe twice,34,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,a little bigger then i usually like but i also have a tiny nose,14,10
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i bought this clicker specifically to wear to a wedding in india because it is way bigger / more showy than i normally wear it was absolutely perfect for the occasion and i liked it so much that i ended up wearing it the entire time during my three week trip it held up pretty well despite me constantly playing with it and having to take it out a couple times for facials by the time my trip was over i noticed that the locking mechanism was not working as well and that i could not play with or tug on the nose ring without it coming unclasped still the clicker cost less than my average daily coffee purchases so I had say it is still a good value for the price,125,11
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,avoidis not surgical or stainless steel gold looks really fake hinge is wobbly and clasp does not stay shut if you have a wide septum the bad will not fit your nose comfortably returning for refund,37,12
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,looks as expected but where it is supposed to click does not do so appropriately so it comes undone often,18,13

AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,it is so cute and snug in my nose it does not seem too sturdy but honestly you get what you pay for I am using this for one event one night so as long as it holds out for that evening I am golden,41,15
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,nice look tight fighting at the nose but comfortable,9,16
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,it was great the first time i wore it now it will not click into place it actually got stuck in my nose for a few minutes because it closed to the side of where it is actually supposed to it looks like the hinge wore out already,46,17
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i bought this for my best friend for christmas she loves it it fits her face perfectly and her best friend knows her so well haha i would recommend it,30,18
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,since getting it it will not clasp or hold at all even when it is out in will not clasp very cheaply made you get what you pay for i guess but still not worth it,33,19
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,piece is tiny it sits right up against my nose making it stick out a bit i would have preferred it hang like others photos clasp is firm which is always nice keeps it from coming loose but the hinge is loose it just flops all over the place making it hard to get in it sure is pretty although,60,20
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,the nose ring would not come out of my nose,10,21
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,looks better in the picture almost looks like a plastic piece of jewelry you would get out of a quarter machine in person also it is way to small i almost could not even get it to click shut,37,22
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,when thearrived it was not theshown it is in fact much lighter almost silver the clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot still a beautiful septum ring however happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading,52,23
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,much too small and it is not as dark as the picture it looks silver ti me,17,24
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,was not black first of all it was more of a gun metal grey which is fine except that it was not shown that way the coating came off in less than a week and started to irritate my skin so i have already had to get rid of it,48,25
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,cute lightweight trendy easy to insert and remove but hangs a bit loose in the septum making it feel like you have a runny nose,25,26
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,this was great wore it for about two months before the clasp stopped holding closed it is very very large although the bottom rested on my lip not exactly comfortable,29,27
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,flat top septums are no good at least for me i can not wear them as long as i can wear a fully rounded clicker worth the price but do not expect to be able to wear it constantly,37,28
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,this is one of the first clickers i have bought i have heard some clickers are hard to close and particularly hard to open but this one was really easy to open the hinge is a little loose but can easily be handled i would buy a similar one from the same manufacture and would recommend to people 10/10,59,29
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the clicker part of it is not stiff making it hard to put in your nose the actual ring of it i found too small for my nose as well was 3 weeks late for my shipping it is cute although,39,30

AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i love it it was super super hard to get in the first time because the bar is very loose but once i finally got it in it fit perfectly and snapped in fine it is hard to get out but not too bad after opening and closing a few times the clicker became loose but all you have to do is push the circle part closer together,67,36
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,did not fit clasp too hard to open and close waste of money,13,37

AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i really like it it came earlier than expected and it is really cute the only thing i have to complain about is that it is a bit large but other than that it is great and i would recommend it,39,43

AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,it is a pretty septum clicker but unfortunately for me it is too big and looks silly my septum piercing is low so that could be why it is so big on my face hope this review helps,36,55
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,does not look like thepictured what so ever it is not a terrible design but it is absolutely not the sameas pictured the hole is also very small so it develops a lot of crusties,37,56
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,fits nice and snug it is a bit abnoxious perhaps that is why i love it so much the filigree reached down to the top of my lips the clicker is very easy to put in and take out,37,57
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,latch can be a little janky but it looks so cute,11,58
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,total waste of money i just got it in today and put it in it went in fine but then it got stuck and i could not get the clasp open to take it back out my work does not allow them and i work early in the morning so i had to go to a piercer at 11 at night and pay 10 for him to use pliers to pry the stupid thing out of my nose so basically I am never going to put it back in and i wasted money buying this dumb thing,93,59

All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,the 17fl oz that is claimed on bottle is actually fraudent the bottle has less than 01 fl oz the whole quantity of the cream fits in that little middle bottle that is fitted inside the huge long bottle which is not 17fl oz by far that is why the diptube is that short see images the product owners lie about the quantity and for sure they are lying about the quality of their product give the positive reviews a second thought,81,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,kinda cheap and i got an uglynot going to be getting anymore these are for toddlers,17,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,that i received was not listed but i still like it it took a long while to arrive but it was still cute when i received it there has a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well however beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire,66,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,love it i wish you could choose the colors although i received a polka dot black and white and polka dot teal and white,24,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,this is cheap and a waste of money,8,3

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,really cute but was a different material than i expected it to be i think it is satin,17,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,you are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be alisted not worth the money,21,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,it is a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it is supposed to be,36,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2,negative,i got some ugly funkyand while it looks cute on me it is really small i have a rather big head and so it does not reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model it is also made of cheap wire so be careful with it,53,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,I am very disappoined i ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material what am i going to do with three of the exact same headband,27,9

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,it is okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick thebut i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,do not like it at all from the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and i received a light pink polka dot one i have no use for it,37,12

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,bought for my daughter she mentioned that they were fantastic and she really liked them the designs were girly and fit her style i find them pretty too,28,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,it came quickly and works great i got one that was cream with dark pink polka dots,17,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,all I shall say about this is i believe it is meant for kids not adults,15,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,really thought these were coming as a set was really disappointed to receive 1 single head band,17,19
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,the maroonis nice and the blue is not bad but i will not use the other two now that i know that the magnet does not work i was really sad to figure out it did not work but it still was not a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature,56,0
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,i love theand everything but when i opened it half of it was spilled everywhere and i could only use the red and silver extremely disappointed i love the other colors and it wears nicely but i just really do not like the fact half of my order was unusable,51,1
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,i love the colors but the magnet did not work at all good thing i had ordered another magnet to go with these i tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked,39,2
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,problem was not with the polish itself it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all i tried everything so i am disappointed,27,3
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,i recieved the package and they looked fine i did not open the individualboxes when i recieved it since it was a gift for my niece when she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top andwas leaking out and starting to dry already the others worked great i just wish that the other one was not broken,67,4
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,i do not recommend it it is clumpy and hard to put on cleanly,12,5
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,love this magnetic polish i have worn the silver / gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer,21,6
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,this product is terrible i tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work the polish is clumpy like it has sand in it or something so it can not be used as regular polish either i tested the gold and the blue very very disappointed i would have asked for a refund but i bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them,67,7
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,the brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,i got a 3d magnet gel polish i tried them on my nails i work at nails salon and i know how to use that the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality seem they had sands inside and can not work at all especially the silver and gold one i will never buy it anymore bad and bad,63,9
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,looks great and simple to apply just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends roughly 30 seconds and it works nice,25,10
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,i was so excited for these polishes to arrive today unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable they were mostly dried into a big clump i even tried using gel thinner the other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them,45,11
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,i love this polish it is beautiful and exactly as described the shipping as fast and the seller is super nice,20,12
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,beautiful colors do not think the magnetic thing woks well but the colors make up for it,15,13
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,beautiful colors the cat eye does not seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me I shall practice more update after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4 i kept them in the original box all the time so it was not light that was cutting them,59,14
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,i purchased came quickly two of the products look as if they had been previously opened the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out i give 2 stars one for each good product the blue and silver,40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,i bought these solely for the star shaped magnet i found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish I am going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if i can get the desired results still holding out hope on that i can not give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is it is lose runny and it pulls away from the nail horribly by the time i was done applying it the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that i eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing and i still had bare spots the formula is subpar the only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately which would end up being more time consuming i do not recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure so on top of the bare spots i can not even see the start mark i can not wait to scrape this off my nails,180,16
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,initially i ordered this product and received a duplicate colour ie blue red and two silvers instead of gold and silver however customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end i received all four colours i have used the blue red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark slate colour i have not tried the gold yet but generally i like the sensationail brand a lot,88,17
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,this stuff is awesome the colors are very pretty and the magnetic stuff works great even comes with the little magnet wand,22,18
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,i can not figure out how to get the magnets to work right they seem to barely work which just makes the polish look sloppy,24,19
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,the colors are pretty was not sure i would like the dark colors but after trying the blue i discovered they are pretty have to master the magnet although did not get it centered the first time,37,20
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,it took me a while to get the hang of it but this polish is quite awesome i got so many compliments on the starburst people were in awe and wondered how i did it,35,21
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,these were awful i love sensational products and normally they will last a week these only lasted a day or two before peeling off and the design looks nothing like what has on the package,34,22
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,birthday present for daughter she loved the set,8,23
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,there were horrible we have used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy seller would not comment back on returns such a waste as I have seen these in videos and they look like they would work great,45,24
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,i opened the package of the blue which was completely sealed took out the brush and it was all wonky and clotted i cleaned off the mess and it was bubbly and lumpy and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles it was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush then i tried the magnet thinking well at least i get a nice magnet from each of these nope did not work the gold also was clotted and wonky but not as much and the brush stiff like a toothbrush but the magnet worked on that one still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box but more like thin straight lines i do not want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I am sensitive to that i purchased these a while ago so it is past my return window or these would definitely be going back the colors were great although,160,25
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,do not buy i use this brand of nail polish all the time and these are very inferior compared to the norm they were clumpy goopy and completely unusable when i went to request a return it said these items not eligible for a return either old or used but either way do not waste your money,58,26
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,terrible one bottle came with the brush bent completely up unusable another bottle came with hardly any polish in it at all my daughter was very disappointed the other 2 bottles were fine and the magnet does work,38,27
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,this was part of a gift and she loved it,10,28
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,horrible this stuff was crap the magnetic properties were a joke if i could rate it a 0 i would 2 out of the 4 bottles were a dried out mess of goo beauty brags said that they would send me 2 new bottles or reimburse i got nothing from them do not purchase this junk,53,29
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,takes less than a second to install and works beautifully keeping any spills from the stove on top of the product instead of falling down onto the cabinet and stove i have a white stove and countertops so it also looks great too i like the l-shaped design which is magnatized so it clings to the side of the stove great product,62,0
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,i really like the design of these guards they are l-shaped rather than the other t shaped ones that i have seen the advantage to this design is that your stovetop does not need to be exactly level with your counters for these to work the vertical magnetized side adheres the the side of your stove and the horizontal part rests on top of your counter i have had no problems with the magnets as described by the other reviewer i think the quality of thisis very good,90,1
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the manetic strip separated from the plastic after a couple of days so you see the magnet against the stove this is a piece of junk,26,2
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,the magnets hold the strips against the stove so it does not slide around also there is a little play on the height of the stove and counter so strips can go up or down to compensate,36,3
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,placed it between therange and the adjacent countertop per instructions good fit after i trimmed about 3/4 off the length to fit my counters after less than one month while frying up a batch of fresh wild mushrooms one night the dang thing melted and warped a goodbut poor choice of materials it needs a higher-temperature resistant plastic it is being used next to a stove fer cryin out loud,74,4
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,what a greatstops crumbs grease and more from slipping into the cracks and keeps clean up at a minimal easy to install and keep clean wish i had thought of it sooner,33,5
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,they do not fit between my stove and new cabria stone counter top so now using along the side of the deep freezer and the wall so dust bunnies stay out of the,33,6
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the first time i cooked with this on one of the sides warped but i was able to bend it back a bit the second time the magnet started to stick melt to the stovetop and pulled away from the further-warping plastic there has still a bit of melted magnet residue on the side of my stove this is not appropriate for actual use on a stove-top while cooking maybe for looks but not for use waste of money wish i could rate it 0 stars,84,7
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,works fine for what it was designed to do especially like the longer length the magnetic strip keeps it in place,21,8
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,thought the magnet would be great they are generic magnets not neodymium i did not think about the plastic needing to be heat resistant duh for myrange the plastic seems to be polystyrene they melted / warped the first time i used a large skillet and high er power i ended up buying silicone typefillers they work fine and are much cheaper,63,9
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,fit perfect cover my husbands mess up oops laughing out loud,9,10
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,it is worked really well at keeping liquids and crumbs from going in between the stove and counter i have really big gaps between them although so i think it would hold up better if that were not the case the magnet strip has come unglued from the plastic which is annoying but i think were my gaps smaller it would have a harder time of doing so but they are still working,72,11
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the website description does not have information about it is material thickness and it is critical since you have to slide it isinto thebetween counter-top and cabinet it only says the length / width / height of the product in my case both edges can not fit into the gaps because it is too thick so it should have this thickness information,59,12
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,solved the problem of changing out a glide in stove with free standing with granite countertops the fit was not exact and the extenders solved the problem,27,13
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,save your money these warped within just a few months and made them useless the fit was never very good from the beginning,23,14
Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the plastic warps i had to shim it so hide the heat warps would have bought the metal ones but stupid amazon would not ship them to canada,28,15
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,after doing extensive research on dishwashers we selected this model bosch this dishwasher is amazing cleans tremedously the dishes are spotless every time quiet performance a terrific value and excellent cleaning ability buy this one and you will not be disappointed,41,0
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,this is a great productit is very quiet i was looking for a drinking glass and opened the dishwaser to find one it was running that is quiet,27,1
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,i have owned a more upscale bosch before and loved it recently moved and bought a house with a relatively new whirlpool that cleaned nothing was loud and was too short to allow the upper arm to go around when my stone wear plates were in after multiple cleanings and more i saw a best buy sale and went looking for another bosch the options in store were not great and this was the low end choice no adjustable shelf i decided this was not worth the 300 difference did not notice there was no rinse only cycle until reading the instructions after installation decided to just live with it so firsthad dried on cheese other assorted rinsed in the sink by teenager stuff used the auto setting this works great and have not worried since have only had for a short time but would buy it again is deep enough for pots and pans and have not tried to put the wine glasses in the upper rack yet to gauge height it works as well as the more expensive model i owned previously,183,2
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,we have been using this dishwasher regularly for about 3 months now so i can not comment on it is longevity however so far we are very impressed this model is extremely quiet and gets dishes very clean with minimal pre-rinsing I have seen reviews of other bosch models that complain about the dishes not being dry when they are finished but we have not had that issue at all just follow the instructions and use some jetdry and you will not have problems so far a quality product we would definitely buy it again,86,3
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,great dishwasher at a great price gets dishes squeaky clean plenty of features for what i need you can set extra dry heat cycle and set the amount of rinse agent i use auto wash function with extra dry heat off and it figures out cycle strength wash time and amount of water on it is own dishes are still hot to the touch when unloading a half hour after complete it is quiet so i do not have to turn up the tv anymore when the dishwasher is going,88,4
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,we have the she3ar7uc we had a need for something quick in a very busy time i bought what cr and consumerresearch recommended we have only done oneso far and it did clean the dishes well but my two complaints are 1 it is a funny internal design and unclear how you are supposed to put the dishes in and how you are supposed to fit in big baking caserole dishes 2 if you forgot to put something in for ayou can not stop the cycle and continue where it was you have to stop the entire cycle and start all over again very annoying whoever designed this clearly must not entertain much because that seems to be a pretty common thing to have in every dw I have ever used and is going to take a lot of getting used to,140,5
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,we have had our bosch dishwasher just over 2 years the sanitizer light stopped working a couple of weeks ago and the dishwasher seemed to be working overtime a longer cycle and unclean dishes at the end the repair main told us it was because the electronic circuit board had burnt out apparently the water coming into the dishwasher when it was turned on was not at maximum hotness and so the dishwasher was having to work overtime to get the water to the correct temperature the dishwasher we had before for 20 years showed no such necessity and i had never considered this requirement before nor had i been told about it disappointing,116,6
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,we have owned this dishwasher a week and it seems excellent it cleans very well very well we do not rinse off food before loading it is so quiet that you have to strain to hear it i like that it is good on energy and water this was a less expensive option of models recommended by consumer reports i purchased it at lowes for a little less price,69,7
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,i have had a mid-price bosch that was recommended by consumer reports for two years now and i can not understand why no one else has complained about it it cleans great at first and is quiet but the wheels are constantly falling off we have lost 4 of the 8 of them when you pull out a full bottom rack it skittles across the dishwasher door and every time i worry that the whole thing will crash on the floor the water flows through jets in two different spinning arms the tiniest bit of food often a scrap of lettuce or something unidentifiable will get stuck in the jets this signifiantly impacts cleaning i struggle to pick it out with tweezers i do rinse my dishes before loading them,131,8
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,I had be interested to hear whether any of the other reviewers have had this problem but a couple of months after installing this dishwasher it started to smell terrible after months of trying to keep the filter clean and living with the terrible odor i called a repairman since it is still under warranty he came and cleaned out the filter and sold me some dishwasher cleaner and told me that it is normal to have 1/4 inch of water under the filter after running the dishwasher that is the source of the smell he ran the dishwasher with the cleaner and a couple of hours later still stinky I have googled it and this seems to be very common to bosch owners i will absolutely never buy a bosch dishwasher again pros it does a decent job cleaning the dishes although it is not perfect there is often food stuck to the dishes after running cons it reeks the dishes come out sopping wet unless you use jet dry which is expensive it could definitely be roomier my last dishwasher was a builder-grade basic one and i could fit a lot more dishes in it,194,9
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,we recently purchased this dishwasher at a local big box store it cleans and drys well and looks nice and is relatively quiet we are a two person household so the size is fine however it makes a very irritating high pitch sound throughout the entire cycle we exchanged the dishwasher for another one thinking and hoping that we had simply received a bad one the first time around unfortunately the second one makes the same horrible noise i can not believe no one else has complained about this we even added a piece of foam behind the foot plate but it did not dampen the noise enough,106,10
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,a repairman just left my house after an unsuccessful attempt at repairing a five-year-old bosch dishwasher it needed a new control board which was discontinued unavailable recalled and the recall had expired in other words my not-so-old very expensive dishwasher is junk I shall not be looking for another bosch would you,51,11
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,we have only had this for about a month so i can not speak to longevity but i can tell you it is very quiet it is a breeze to install you can adjust the amount of rinse agent used and you will probably have to adjust it it does not stack tallish things in the upper rack like our older bosch did for the money a very nice washer i am very pleased with the job it does and the low noise level update 7/2/12 the dishwasher is very sensitive to food particles in the water be sure to rinse well before putting them in the washer still love the dishwasher november 2 2014 still chugging away not a problem in any way update 8/7/2012 had a problem with the washer not starting and having two blinking lights repairman came out on a warrantee call he could not figure it out either we finally soved it by turning off the circuit breaker and letting it sit for about 10 minutes it started working normally then still love the dishwasher just be sure to keep the food strainer clean,185,12
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,ours has been broken for almost a year it will not complete it is cycle and just jumps to clean 8 different repair guys 5 different control boards i am not exageratting anyway ours was a lemon terrible purchase,39,13
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,i own several apartments and have purchased and installed at least 15 dishwashers this dishwasher replaced a 12 year old whirlpool it has several problems 1 it stinks up the entire house 2 the door pops open about seven times during a cycle-shutting the unit down 3 it does not dry dishes 4 cleaning is just ok not as good as the 12 year old whirlpool it is replacing after some research review sites i have found several others complaining about the strong odor many many many people are having the problem with door latch it is improperly designed in order to get the sound level down the frame is built out of plastic instead of metal it flexes the latch just barely holds door shut one finger will open it as it runs the thing flexes and the door pops open takes longer than 24 hrs to run ain order to achieve energy star rating they quit putting in drying elements i guess ones suppose to hand dry one would think after 12 years there would be some improvement i certainly did not know i would be going backwards,190,14
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,i purchased this dishwasher because of the bosch name and my daughter-in-law has a bosch my ge was so rough on my dishes that it chipped the edges of cups and bowls i was not able to see this particular model in person so i took a chance and ordered it not through amazon but from a local store i will not purchase another the best thing about this dishwasher is that it is extremely quiet however it is small on the inside and would never do for a family the tines on both racks are positioned in such a way that it is very difficult to place dishes or glasses and cups the utensil basket is ok i like the piece that sections it so that spoons do not get stuck together the clincher for me is that after 2 years the main board went bad and it cost almost 300 to repair that is just for the part i had a maytag in a different house that lasted over 5 years with no service i wish i could have brought it with me when i move a more expensive model may be built better but not this one,199,15
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,i bought the new bosch ascenta because it was highly rated by consumer reports for performance and reliability but the lay out of the machine makes me wish I had bought another model the control panel is needlessly complicated compared to my old model one needs to reselect the setting eachand the rack layout is very frustrating if i have a casserole dish to wash it can only go in a place that blocks off the racks for the plates the owners manual shows various ways of loading only dishes that are models of teutonic order but where are the casserole dishes kidss cereal bowls who lives like that also should you have to open the door while it is cycling you will get a face full of water from the upper jet also the soap dispenser will not lock shut if you get even a small bit of dishwashing powder outside the tray the springless door is not very user friendly and the lower dish rack goes clanging off the tracks if you open it more than 3/4 of the way bosch designers need to buy a kenmore and take notes,192,16
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,we purchase our bosch because of the good reviews from several sites our machine is less than two years old and it is only my wife and i that use it we are retired and travel so usage has been minimal after exactly one year and a few days the pump went out then we had trouble with the computer screen next it would not drain again and another pump was put in with bosch represenatives he spent a whole ten minutes and left without checking to make sure it fixed to problem it did not and we have water in the bottom of the machine we have contacted our own appliance rep who believes the computer board is shot we also have had the racks replaced because of rusting all in less than 18 months we called bosch about it being a lemon no help just a bunch of lip service this machine is a mess we are ordering a new american made machine and dumping our loss never never again bosch you screw me once never again,176,17
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,my head is killing me the high pitch noise has given me a terrible headache and is present throughout the entire cycle how is it that only one other person has commented about this I am pretty sure this will be the only review i will have about this dishwasher unless whatever is causing the noise can be fixed,58,18
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,4,positive,see video for hands-on demonstration and close-up of burner pros fast shipping less than 4 days nice and snug fit excellent price on amazon saved me a trip to the hardware store cons sticky sticker angered wife hope you find this helpful,60,0
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,4,positive,i give this 4 stars because there is something slightly off in the way it sits on my burner pan and i have to make sure it is completely inserted before turning it on great product for a great price i just need to quit being lazy and get a different burner pan will buy again if needed,58,1
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,got this sooner than expected had to make alittle adjustment to make it fix the old drip pan but work this piece of work works better than expected the heating time and cooking time are like wow but make sure u let the cool down time run it is course ps get a drip pan that fits this and your oven or be like us and make a small adjustment your going to love it,74,2
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,great price and it fits perfectly thank you very much,10,3
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,prefect replacement for an old range cooktop that had broken supports it is still going strong,15,4
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,1,negative,was wrong part even after reding description so i am stuck with a uselessh ad to buy a new stove because it shorted out the wholw junction box on stove,32,5
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,products works fine with hotpoint stove it has loops on the end as connectors and it still works even if you have the old flat connector style it heats up very fast and it did not cost me an arm or leg for one element thank you amazon,47,6
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,2,negative,fits this is a low density not really hot unit despite it is size the connectors were also poorly made compared to the one it replaced with the electrodes not fully filled we bought one at lowes and this is a backup,41,7
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,1,negative,was mentioned for hotpoint but it never fitted properly as soon as you put the element on the burner it comes out from front and does not fit properly,30,8
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,my range cooktop was a great price and i am enjoying it,12,9
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,4,positive,it fit and works well on my stove,8,10
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,takes a while to heat up than my original one but it does a great job,16,11
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,1,negative,it is green so it looks ridiculous on the stove it ended up in the to donate pile,17,12
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,4,positive,the package was broken when it arrived the two pointy parts stick out thank god it fitted the stove perfectly and worked i had to replace the heating element when i moved out of my previous apartment,37,13
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,4,positive,did not fit right i had to bend the contact posts fine now,12,14
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,2,negative,does not fit as needed but it works meh,9,15
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,5,positive,i saw that this was not an exact match to the one i needed but close enough i had some problems at first but now it works as good as the original,31,16
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,2,negative,works fine but does not fit well one leg is too short so it sits not leveled using a metal spacer to level it now,24,17
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,1,negative,does not look anything like the one in the picture less coil and going to cost half of what i paid for it to return it,25,18
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,1,negative,do not get i received this product in the picture does not match what i received at all it does not work in my stove even although he claims that it is a hot point replacement it is misrepresented the ends or tips of the burner do not match the picture in or not compatible with a hot point range,60,19
Appliances,B00DVPRPWM,2,negative,nothing wrong with the product it did not fit my hotpoint cooking range correctly since it is got only 4 coils my hotpoint needs a 5 coil burner,26,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,this product works well when you follow the instructions but it takes some patience i accidentally oversanded the area i was repairing which could have made the leather look worse but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it i was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair and i think this repair will not be noticeable as the damage is lower on a chair leg take the time to mix theto match the leather do the repairs in daylight and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying and it works pretty well,110,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,my dogs finally put a 1 inch cut / hole in my 4000 leather couch i followed the instructions for the kit mixed a near perfect match with the colors provided deep wine / maroonand applied approximately 3 separate coats to the damaged area allowing for complete drying in between coatings i was very pleased with the result the couch is sealed and can not tear further and the patch is very discreet i would recommend this product and for those who seem to have problems with it my guess is that care was not taken with the instructions,96,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,if you have a rip of any size in your leather i would not recomend this the product says it repairs smaller rips i had a quarter inch rip in my couch and followed the instructions provided and only accomplished one thing making sure everyone knows about the rip now i would recomend looking for a professional to repair any expensive piece of leather,64,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this stuff is just stupid look up do-it-yourself leather repair and you have it i got leather magics deluxe kit and found out it is exactly like do it yourself they have the leather magic cleaner think a simple soap and water solution they have sanding paper they have leather prep think rubbing alcohol they have a leather compound in a tiny tiny container you supposed to apply several times uhhh how can you apply something so tiny several times then they have acrylic paint so in the end you have your beautiful leather couch covered in paint looks good until you sit on it so i say stupid,104,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,too many steps 4 pages of directions could not matchto couch,12,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,what a rip off only colors not found in nature and not qualified for a return so disappointed,18,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,i was disappointed in this product i purchased the kit to repair a tear in my beloved leather couch the sub-patch and leather patch were barely large enough for my repair would it have been that difficult to make them a decent size the special leather adhesive was dried out and unusable i used wood glue 7 of the 9 leather filler colors were also old and almost solid fortunately i was able to use brown on my couch but had no way tomatch i rated 2 stars since i was able to make the repair but clearly this kit had been sitting on the shelf for many years,112,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,two of the colors had congealed making it impossible to make a match,13,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,this thing is amazing i have not had to use it on any big cuts or anything but i have used it several times already on my new leather couch our dear cat satan has ran through it a couple times and used it as a scratch post about three times so there were plenty of punctures all covered nicely and blended perfectly only thing is you can tell when the light hits it a certain way but that is expected still worked really well,83,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i have a bicast leather couch and based on a youtube video i was looking for leather studio clear paint to fix a rip and a peeling spot the leather studio product was discontinued so i gave this a shot i did not use the patch that came with the kit instead i applied this in layers just as the video showed with the leather studio it is not perfect but you can not tell without looking for it and having the ability to mix ato match the leather is also a plus it is only been a week but i have had dogs and kids jumping on the couch and no issues yet,113,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i used this kit to repair a 2-inch irregular tear in a dark-blue leather couch cushion the kit performed as advertised and the repair seems solid however the repair required considerable dexterity and care and even after long trial-and-error i never could get thecorrect so the repair is obvious the kit could also benefit from additional backing material patches only one is included in the kit and this effectively makes the kit suitable for one use only but it was worth the price,86,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,oh my god i was desprate to fix a spot on our favorite chair someone left a bottle of bleach out eating a hole along with some horrible looking discolorations a bit tricky to get just the right shade of deep wine after blending i took my finger and would add the smallest bit ofto a test spot bottom of the chair mix quickly you will be amazed mine took three cover / blending now you can not tell at all perfect for small jobs,82,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,covered my rips and holes nicely for about a week of normal use the gel dries nicely and looks great after a couple of hours but will lose all of it is flexibility after a week or two the repair gel begins to crack itself completely nullifying the whole reason you applied it in the first place junk product unless you are trying to patch and area that sees zero tension and/or wear like the back of your couch,77,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,works like magic you can not find the mark unless you are really really looking for it company comes over to visit and can not tell it has been repaired,28,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,the package i received appeared yellowed and old like it has been sitting on a shelf for some time it also provides only what appears to be the barest amount of materials to utilize no real margin for error i have not yet had opportunity to actually try fixing my problem but the quality of the kit is rather poor,59,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,great product unless you knew you would never know my leather bench had tears in it this product is worth every penny and could easily sell for hundreds of dollars,30,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,this works well i would prefer to have more white to mix with colors,14,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,very happy with the results would buy again,8,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,seems too all purpose use to me was ok but really not invisible to see the mend in terms of surface texture,22,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,the kit does not provide enough dye paste to do large leather repairs i was forced to purchase the kit twice to complete a section of my ottoman,28,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,amazing product i had to use a lot more heat than recommended i tested it to be sure it would not affect the surrounding leather ended up saving my thousand dollar couch,32,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,ruined my couch we now have to cover up the repaired area with a throw blanket i wasted so much money trying tomatch and more the entire kit was terrible it looks worse than before i used it,39,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i have not used it yet but by reading the directions i think it will be great,17,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,more fabric and leather should have been included in the kit,11,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,not recommended for jeep vinyl seats it flaked off leaving a spongey stretchy melted layer underneath ended up recovering my seats with real leather instead haha do not use it on your jeep seat jeep seats are not leather and maybe not vinyl either which is what this is made for,49,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,you get what you pay for this product is mediocre at best for what i needed basically had some cat scratches on the arms of a bicast leather couch small amount ofcompound to work with and the shade that i ended up with was slightly off yeah it covered the scratches but the process actually made the rest of the couch worse off than when it started i am now trying the more expensive products from leather touchup dyecom,79,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,absolutely love this product it is pretty darn close to perfect in fixing leather although it would be nice to be able to dull it up a bit as it leaves a fairly shiny finish I have also used it for fixing plastic rubber and more it dries like a latex finish and can be peeled off carefully if you mess up using a paintbrush to apply it in small spots works well too the only complaint i have is that i believe the kit should have twice as much black as the other colors because it gets used up too fast otherwise it is a great product,106,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,did not really help repair our leather couch it really just made it worse,13,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,saved my leather couch easy to mix colors you can not tell where my couch was damaged i would recommend this product to anyone before giving up something that you really loved give it a try first,34,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product i repaired a minor scratch in the leather on my couch and it now looks well janky it has nothing to do withmatching either it is quite easy to mix the colors to match whatever theof the leather is the problem is that it does not have the right texture it is incredibly easy to tell where the repaired section is because it is so smooth not a fan,75,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,have yet to use it but will be handy on my leather purses that get pen marks or peeling,19,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,would be nice to have measurement guides so you could recreate the identical formula,14,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,does not adhere well to some surfaces when there is incidental friction,12,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,it was very easy to use i bought this because i damage my leather massage chair during the move very easy to use and fixed the problem and my new place has laminate floor i noticed that there were few chips on few floor boards i was looking for laminate floor repair kit but actually i was able to use this to fix that issue also,66,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,way too complicated not an easy application as claimed,9,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i am disappointed with this product it does not do a good job of repairing leather i would not recommend this product,22,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,yesit help me to fix my car seat very good,10,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,easy to use and fixed a tear in a brand new leather coat saving it,15,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,it works pretty well but i should have used it two years ago do not wait repair early,17,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,used this product to repair my vinal seat in my car product was fairly easy to apply and seems to stand up to the stress of getting in and out of the vehiclewas no problem with me because the brown that came in the kit was the same as what i needed otherwise i think matching thecould be a challenge,64,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this product was less than satisfactory product was completely dried out and unusable i would not recommend this product to anyone,21,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,it is marginal if you follow the directions carefully and it is a minor fix you will probably be ok but most of the time someone will want to repair a more extensively damaged article and it does not handle big rips very well in my own case it was a torn leather jacket i followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough part of the problem is it is nearly impossible to get thematched seal to look good if the repair is large plus the fix is kind of flimsy after a couple weeks it started to fall apart i came away wishing i had just done a patch,117,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,all the colors other than black and brown were dry and hard rendering the kit useless,16,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,I had like to give this product five stars but when i went to repair my car seat the adhesive was solid it had not been opened by me but since i did not have any adhesive i could not fix my seat poor packing if adhesive dries up before use,48,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,useless the prep flluid ruined the leather and most of the colored fillers were dried up absolute crap do not buy it,20,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,it does what it says but does not really furnish enough to fix more than one or two cracks would not order again,23,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,worked just fine but these things only last so long and there is enough for touch up now and then,20,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,definitely exceeded what i thought it would do excellent product,10,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i repaired my wingback recliner got it to match pretty good but if you are picky i suggest you use a professional my husband had gouged a few small holes in the arm keeping his pocket knife in his cargo pants you can tell how old we are the chair is about 15 years old or older it looks much better than the holes did but if you inspect it you can see the repaired places however no one looks at my stuff that closely had to send another kit back i ordered by another maker their repair stuff was dried up appears all of this kit was good there is no stress on the place i repaired so i imagine it will last as long as the chair i have a small split in my lexus seat also 15 years old and I am afraid to try that bc it puts stress on it every time i get in the car afraid i will make it worse,167,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,pain to get right and a pain to put on but so far it is lasted you can see the repair but it is holding and it is not getting worse,28,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,the adhesive was extremely difficult tomatch which is probably a ploy to sell tospecific set after an hour of mixing and testing i ended up with athat dried as a splotchy dark tan but frankly i did not care about theas long as it repaired the damage it did not i put on about 5 layers and let it dry for 36 hours within an hour after sitting in the drivers seat the adhesive cracked and came apart this was a complete waste of money for me,93,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i have repaired several pieces of furniture with these kits for myself and friends the bond and the patching is easy enough the tricky part is thematching if you follow themixing guidelines and make small tests allow them to dry for 24hrs to really get a sense of how thewill finish you should be able to make a really great patch,67,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,did not help fix the cracking on my car seat just made a bigger mess,14,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this kit does work it takes some time to mix the colors just right but once you get the right tone it looks great it just does not last the patch just peels off after while not a good product it also does not include that much product for a larger application i had to reapply a few times since it came off after a month or two,66,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,it does not have the composite most of the secondary colors were dried and left with very small usable quantity this may be suitable for leather jackets but definitely not for sofas,32,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,have not used it yet but it was exactly what i expected,12,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,after six months the glue fails and matching theis almost impossible will not buy again,17,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,did an outstanding job on my leather coach,8,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,once you get theright it really is magic application takes several coats so you get multiple tries to match the,23,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,i could not get theto match after half a day since it dries differently than when wet which is understandable it makes it even more difficult and the repair keeps peeling,32,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,total bs the stuff peels off do not bother with it,10,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,had to send it back i already had one,9,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,looks like crap does not work more like a toy think do it yourself window tint trust me you will not get this to look good,28,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,i might have scored this product higher but some of the patch materials were dried out a condition the instuctions warn will because failrue of the repair the package appeared to be sealed and tight but the cheap plastic poys containing the colored patch material had loose-fitting lids that allowed the contents to dry this is indeed what we have experienced peeling of the surface i can not recommend this product,72,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,this product did not work for me first of all the glue did not stick no matter how hard i tried i tried putting more glue but in the end i just gave up i would not recommend this product my sofa still has the tear that looks so horrible and i am at a loss as to what to do to repair it,64,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i purchased thisto repair the claw marks on my dinning room chairs thanks mr kitty this product worked great and came with everything i needed to repair these unsightly imperfections i was really worried about getting theright since my dinning room chairs are a teali mixed the green leather paint with a touch of black and thecame out perfect if your leather furniture is damaged this is the answer to your problem,80,65
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,this seems like it is going to work pretty well overall I am upset although because they do not tell you the glue is instant i mean as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied it bonds and there is no repositioning it so i have puckered edges to my tear now puckered under so it is not like i can trim off the edges hopefully i can make it look better with the repair compound but if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant this should have made a great repair but because of the glues properties it now looks pretty bad,108,66
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,it is great it is strong enough to stabilize the tear in a very used part of the leather cushion on our couch the colors allowed me to mix the green brown and a tiny dab of black to get the exactof green i required for the task,50,67
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,it kept leather from tearing more and was good size to begin with however had hard time matching and keeping it small like tear like said it dries fast and takes some skill it did work well just i did not do as good as i like,43,68
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,the repair is not completely invisible since i know where to look but no one has said anything if you have a large tear i would suggest ordering extra of the colors that you need,35,69
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i had a few cracks in somewhat faded black leather and the kit easily patched those the problem was getting thematch right and it was really hard to get the right gray,34,70
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,this product was delivered on time and preformed as advertised it took me about an hour to make the repair it was not perfect but it did look pretty good and keeps the seat from tearing more,36,71
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,we bought new leather furniture on liquidation sale and got an extra discount because there was an inch long cut on the side of the love seat we bought this kit to patch it I am not a very handy person and definitely not crafty decorative artsy or anything else you think you might should be to repair brand-new furniture but thanks to this kit my couch was fixed in under 20 minutes it comes with an empty container to mix your colors in and a mixing guide they are so easy to mix to get a goodmatch the instructions are easy to follow and work perfectly if you do i covered the cut let it dry overnight covered it once more and cleaned the area after it dried i did notice that the leather cleaner seemed to slightly dry out the area i used it on but i rubbed a bit of coconut oil on it which fixed it back up I had definitely recommend this kit,167,72
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,it looked good at first but now after several weeks it is starting to peel up i do not know if it is operator error or the product,27,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,my german shepherd had punctured a few holes in our leather couches this mended them up and prevented further damage take your time matching the colors as they seem to dry a little darker,34,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i received the product and it was all dried out i attempted to use a thinner to see if would fix it and it did not threw it away i will never buy this product again and i do not recommend it I had give it zero stars if i could,48,75
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,this leather repair kit was a true miracle you need to be precise when cutting the leather to fit your hole otherwise you will be sanding forever other than that i have no complaints and would definitely order it again if i need more,43,76
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,while i would have rated the product a five i actually have to wait and see how long the repair will last other than that the product really worked even better than advertised as long as you follow the instructions will recommend product thank you,44,77
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,be sure to mix thelighter than theyou desire it darkened up quite a bit my repair was a four inch rip on a leather sofa i followed the directions and watched others perform repairs online the repair looks good 8 out of 10 mymatching was not so good i mixed it a little dark the product performed perfectly thank you,66,78
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,looks horrible on any leather not easy to use does not do the trick do not waste your money not recommended,20,79
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i bought this for my husband when he replaced the leather seats in his car he poked a whole where he should not have even although the whole was not in a very obvious place this kit helped to save the day the whole was patched and was not noticable afterward good buy,53,80
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,well it looked absolutely beautiful when i applied it thestarted out much lighter which i expected then dried to match perfectly blended right in however it does not seem to be holding up i do not know if it is my leather which could be some kind of synthetic stuff not sure I shall try again and use more coats let us see if that works,65,81
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,did not work on our car seat the ripped leather about 2 - 3 inches would tear out again after a few days,21,82
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,it worked good for about a month then the patch dried / broke and the hole is back i do not recommend buying this to use on something that gets a lot of wear and tear like a sofa or a chair like i did,42,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,product is too hard to use and kept rubbing offmatching was impossible for me and the product did not dry well,23,84
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i have not had the time to use it yet hope it works very well on my truck seat thank you,21,85
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,it is a tad complicated to mix the stuff to the right consistencybut once you do that it works great,23,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,certainly would do the job difficulty in mixing paints to match theis the greatest challenge but not the fault of the manufacturer this kit contains what one would need to make any minor leather repairs,37,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,the kit includes base colors that are to be mixed to get amatching the leather good luck with that this is nearly impossible add a little of this then add a little of that it is never right,40,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i was very disappointed had cut in arm of leather sofa did not work i would not recommend the product to anyone,22,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i could never get a decentmatch and the repaired spot sticks out like a sore thumb i sorry i bought this,23,90
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i bought the carpet / upholstery kit i cut a piece of fabric and sent it in for them to match thein the kit is way off mine is like burgundy-brown they sent like burgundy-grey i emailed and got no response i called and asked for a refund they said i could send it back to re-tint i said I had have to pay to ship it and since they could not get it right the first time I had rather just get my money back i was told i have to pay to ship it back anyway so i said then I shall ship it back for a re-tint i suppose they will want another material sample she said just send it back and we will refund because it does not sound like we will be able to please you i said oh i send a sample you guys do not match it and I am the problem so i disputed the charge with my credit card company my suggestion it to find someone else,166,91
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,we used the product on an old leather couch and it worked quite well the hardest part was mixing theand decided that making it lighter was the best thing to do as it dried darker,37,92
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,not sure i was going to be able to match theetc it was actually a snap and kind of fun even i did it over two days put the patch in place and let it dry and then came back the next day and blended it in with theyou would have to know it was there to even realize it was patched nearly impossible to tell thumbs up,72,93
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,the description was a bit misleading to me i tried using it but had no way of making it happen i ended up disposing of it,26,94
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,works exactly as described no complaints except that there was not as much paint / putty as I had have liked but still did what it described well only as good as you apply it do a good job and it looks great get sloppy and it will show,44,95
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,seam was ripped on good quality office chairs i bought cheaply from sale at work since it is a seam repair i did not expect it to hold up but it is seen daily use including from a 7-year-old monkey boy who has to climb all over it while sitting for a couple months now and stil looks holding up not the prettiest repair but since it is black no one will be looking that closely,73,96
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i bought about 7 different leather repair kits black leather spfa was damaged / worn in several places and got super confused with the reviews so just bought one of each of the different types this one was by far the easiest to use and gave the best results all i used was the black so no mixing of colors s o really can not comment on how easy that is but simply applying a thin layer of the black stuff to one of the very worn patches on my sofa really helped make it look better it is not fabulous if your really close up but that is probably more cos my hand was not very steady but from a few steps away looks pretty good wish identification bought more of this one and not all the others ah well,139,97
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i used it to repair my brown leather sofa and it looked completely new when the repair kit was used i can not even notice where the scratch / rip was,28,98
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i followed the instructions but could not get theor the texture right the instructions said to make thelighter as it would darken as it dried it actually gets lighter as it dries the texture turned out like plastic sheeting it would have been better and less permanent to slap a piece oftape on the leather,60,99
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,the instructions for this product were hard to understand and trying to mix the righta pain in the i would not recommend this product to anyone,27,100
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i was repairing a hole in sleeve of school varsity jacket for my first time using a product like this it worked good i spent considerable amt of time getting theto match but finally got an exact match yellow / gold / brown,41,101
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,this product works well in repairing ripped or damaged leather we used it on our ivoryleather couch and also a black leather jacket the only thing is that it already comes with glue so no need to buy a separate liquid leather stitch,44,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this product cracked where my leather had cracked and now is peeling so i am left with cracked leather and now a peeling product that looks even worse than what i started with do not buy,35,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,it took a long time to finally get theto match but finally got it close enough i had a 1 square damaged area on a chair that was ultra leather fake leather just the outside skin was pulled off i filled it with this paint and now it is hardly noticeably,53,104
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i used this kit and did not like it at all had to mix different things to try and matchdried ok but the smell was like burnt plastic and lasted for days this kit is ok for a cheap repair but the area i repaired actually looks worse,50,105
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,if you take your time to get theright prep the area and do several light coats it can turn out pretty nice i do not think it is possible to get it where you can not tell there was a repair but it is much better than a gaping hole,48,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i bought this kit because i got a small tear in an expensive designer jacket the trick to this stuff works to the best ability is a a spot that can be blended b on non textured leather c a reasonable repair do not expect miracles my jacket is black calfskin and very soft very smooth very fragile i repaired it and you can not notice a problem unless i tell you about it the jacket was a 2000 john varvatos and i trust this stuff on it it will do just fine,91,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,easy to use did not need to apply heat clear directions for applying paste i applied three layers 2 are recommended there was enough paste for three layers madscientist52,28,108
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i have an inexpensive dark vinyl couch that had several tears and i purchased this to repair them mixing the colors to match my couch was pretty easy but applying the product was a little difficult to get the texture to blend in the end the product did a decent job of patching the holes and the repair is hardly noticable in most light i believe if my couch was any lighter init would not have blended well all in all it did what i expected it to do however if i had a more expensive couch or the leather was anything lighter than my espressoi would probably call a professional for the repair,118,109
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,you know what i was skeptical but we got it anyway we tried it on a very obvious 1 tear on the front visible portion of our dark brown leather couch thanks alot kids and you can barely see it now pretty easy to get the righteasy to do just follow the directions can you see where the problem is yes if you are really looking for it but it is way better than a rip or a piece oftape and for way cheaper than a professional repair worth the risk i say,97,110
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,if you are getting this to repair a 5000 genuine leather couch then just keep walking get a professional but if you have just an average-priced or bicast couch this product is perfect if you can get your colors right you will be pretty pleased i spent some time mixing colors and everyone has been impressed with the results most have to really search and feel around to find the tear it was originally about a 1 1/2 inch tear in a bicast leather couch and it was growing daily if you have a rip in a bicast couch you need to stop it as soon as possible because it will keep ripping also i put on about 4 - 5 layers of the goo over a 3 day period and it is held amazingly strong it might even be stronger than it was before great product a little pricey but it is better than a nasty tear as a side note if you can send in a sample of your leather to leather magic they will magic thefor you,173,111
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,this is the second time using this product to repair a tear in a leather sofa works pretty much as advertised will repair small tears it does take some time several light layers to make a good repair but the end result is good toughest thing ismatching but the includedguide is helpful the first repair i did same spot held up for 2 - 3 years sitting directly on it daily I am hoping i did a better job this time and it will hold up for a few years a lot cheaper than the alternative new sofa,99,112
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,did not like it at all just used it once on my leather couch after using it the leather got harder and started ripping more i will never recommend this product,30,113
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i have a crack on my white leather car seats however i was not brave enough to try the colors on my seats theset has white but it does not match my seatsand it was really hard to tell whichi should mix to match the seat this package is not expensive the glue does the work it fixed the crack but left some darkmarks on it,72,114
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i used thisto repair a worn lay-z-boy chair armrest i did not get a perfect match onmy choice and i did not do a perfect job but it is very adequate and serviceable,34,115
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i somehow ripped my nice black leather coat an l-shaped tear about 1 both vertically and horizontally in a spot that is over my pants right rear pocket i took it to a leather shop here in la and they quoted me 75 to repair it mostly labor no doubt on the advice of a co-worker i figured I had give this kit a try before popping for that much the tears location was another big factor in my decision give this kit a try since it is only visible to people behind me who look down which i would question anyway i received the kit followed the simple instructions and 30 minutes later voila no more tear it is not invisible by any means but since my jacket is black with a slightly faded appearance / finish the kits black coloring blended in perfectly with the leathers appearance andand although the kit includes several colors and instructions how to blend them to achieve the desiredi was fortunate that i only had to tone down the black coloring to account for the faded look of the leather if the user needs aother than black then your mileage may vary,200,116
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i bought this kit from magic mender website 1st problem it does not match thethen when you left your car under the sun wow it is so sticky it will look nice as long you do not use and seat on it one more thing it does not last in other words it is a useless thing,57,117
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,better than nothing but not much had about an inch and a half tear in a leather chair head rest followed the instructions and it turned out very visible and more like a rubbery patch than soft leather i think it will keep the tear from getting bigger but it looks terrible,52,118
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,the product works very well to fix a hole or tear in leather mine was a couch the only problem i had was the cleanser took the shine out of the leather so if you have a shine to the leather make sure you use the cleanser sparingly only on the area you intend to directly fix otherwise i was able to match thealmost 100 very good product my work looked a little sloppy so you have to be very careful and do it in stages i will use this again if i have another rip,98,119
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i got my couch fixed and it looks great it was so easy to match the colors and repair it myself great product quick service thanks,26,120
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i had my leather surface peel off to a expensive camel leather couch i have and this worked great you have to add the darker little by little and test theon the area before putting it on to see if thehad to be adjusted but worked great can not even tell it peeled just remember thedries darker when dried highly recommend,66,121
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,we have a 6 year old leather couch that had worn on one cushion and a 3 x3 hole had formed it really needs to be reupholstered but i do not have the funds for that right now i bought this kit instead for a fix i was super worried about using it because I am not aperson and had never done a repair like this but the instructions were so simple and the patch looks good I am not going to lie and say it is not noticeable but compared to the hole that was there before this is a dream,100,122
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,arrived in a timely manner matched our lariat leather seat just test in area not visable just follow the instructions and you will not go wrong sincerely eddie g,28,123
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,the rip is hardly noticeable should get another 10 years of use the rip is completely closed andmatches perfectly thank you,22,124
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,had an l shaped tear on seat cushion of my couch maybe 4 long figured i would need a kit that was better than average given the size and shape of the tear theis as described including more than enough fill to do multiple jobs it could use more underlayment but seems like you could use almost any cloth as such for future repairs my couch is dark brown somatching was quite simple the most challenging aspect is prepping the tear getting the tear to line up and then holding it long enough for the glue to dry kit includes one rubbing alcohol swab not nearly enough for the whole job considering you clean the surface before applying the fill and can use it to smooth the fill between coats and as posted by another multiple coats are the way to go i did not use the 2 sq patch included,155,125
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,great product that actually works just need a bit of practice with applying the compound in a smooth manner all necessary supplies are provided to make your fix look great i used it to repair a big rip in my leather car seat and it worked beautifully highly recommend,49,126
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,the patch itself was pretty easy and seems strong gives about a 2 x 2 patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath you use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole needing at least 1/2 overlap in each direction you cut the leather to fit the hole and thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth i have not tried tho the hardest part is mixing the paint to match they have instructions for basic colors ex tan but to get it to be theyou want is not for the faint of heart they might say mix orange yellow white and brown add more brown if this add more yellow if this i sort of wish they would show shades and give ratios to mix,142,127
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i was a little scared by the multiple steps and having to mix my own matchingbut it worked out great you can still tell it is a repair if you look but it is not noticeable at all themix directions are easy enough the tricky part was cutting / shaping and installing the sub-patch tip with the light sanding stay within 1/4 to 1/2 from the tear any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather overall great product,95,128
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,please bear in mind this review has nothing against the seller it is against the manufacturer do not waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it that is what i have and this was a waste of money i would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch bigger than what i have the patching pieces sub-material and the leather were just too big to fit into the holes i have so now I am just using the glue to see if i can glue the rips shut unfortunately i really thought this would be a better product based on the price compared to other similar products,122,129
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this was a total ripoff i needed to cover up some cat claw prick marks on my leather barstools they are black so i did not have to worry aboutmixing the first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried it was very shiny like patent leather so my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots the second thing to go wrong was when i cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework using a normal soft dishcloth wet and well wrong out no cleaning product on it at all just plain water i lightly wiped off my barstools and there went my new shiny polkadots all the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic the best thing i can say is that the claw marks are still there and i am right back where i started the worst thing i can say is i wasted my money on this product i definitely would not recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture,174,130
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i think success depends on your ability to match your ownbut i was ultimately really surprised at how good it looked they do not give you much although so after very good success with the 1st kit i had to buy two more for enough to patch up my sofa,51,131
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,wish i could say that this product was great but when i opened the paint colors they were all rubbery and would not mix or spread easily,27,132
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,repaired a tear and touched up a few nicks saved me from buying a new sofa i wish i would have matched thea little better that was my fault although i was too impatient and used up all the white so i could not lighten themore also touched up my black leather car seats black is easy no mixing,62,133
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,the manufacturer makes it clear that this kit is not intended for use with suede i bought it anyway figuring what the heck it is worth a try when the alternative was to throw away my torn suede jacket or pay a lot for a professional repair and maybe I shall need it for something else down the road well i just tried and am absolutely delighted with the results it was really easy to use and no one is going to notice the repair,83,134
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,the past reviewer was correct if you have a large rip do not use this product unless you want everybody to know where the rip is as it show up even worse would not recommend this product at all,39,135
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,i followed the directions to the t in a few days the split started showing on top of the dried so called paint please save your money,27,136
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,this product was an absolute disaster i had a huge hole in my leather couch which this product describes how to put a subpatch and glue the pieces together except that the glue was old and putty-like it would not hold anything together secondly although it claims to tell you how to combine the basic colors to get anyin the world it is a very basic description like tan is a combination of yellow orange white and brown this resulted in a salmon colored liquid when i tried to make tan anyhow in desperation to get my couch not to continue to rip i took out a needle and thread and sewed it together also now have salmon colored streaks on that cushion which is not pretty i returned the product for a full refund,137,137
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i havint used it yet but you can tell from looking at the kit that it is going to be the right choice i know it will not be 100 but it is going to prolong and save a 1000 replacement corvette car seat for a few more years I have been shopping along time and am happy to have found this,60,138
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,i bought this product to try to fix and conceal several small holes in my cars leather seating it really did a pretty poor job the holes are still pretty noticable i was able to get a goodmatch i also tried the product on some minor scratches on a leather chair that application worked much better overall the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips and make sure to go light on your colors because you do not have much white to play around with to lighten your mixture up you will also need many more alcohol wipes than are provided in the kit,109,139
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,do not bother with this kit you get one tiny piece of backing and one small piece of leather i opened the glue and could not figure out why it would not squeeze out finally pried off the top to find that the entire bottle had already dried up and i had just opened it for the first time definitely not worth it,62,140
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i recently bought used leather couches there was a cut in the leather and this product helped make it disappear the couch cost over 1450 new i got it for 170 plus this product looks great,36,141
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,this product is fantastik i bought it with no much hopes to repair my husbands reclinable arm chair he use the chair to sleep because he has health problems this leather chair was damage in various areas i am amazed how easy were the instructions and all the process the final result a reclinable arm chair like new i recommend it without reserve,63,142
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,it is junk did not work at all had to throw it away complete waste of money,15,143
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,the glue works well on leather it is bendable and seems to hold well because i am not a professional thedoes not exactly match it is very hard to get it to match completely as a result it looks a bit unevenly colored and unevenly textured after i spent lots of time trying you can still tell there was a problem in the car seat but the cut is held together so the problem is fixed but it does not look great,79,144
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,i was a bit skeptical at first but i have to say this product delivered i had vintage style aged leather that had become a bit worn in some areas and had cracks that began to open in others and was able to repair them with this product the repairs are not invisible but they are satisfactory by far for the price of this kit,65,145
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,ok i was allready to go with this stuff then i tried to use the adhesive it got jammed as i was squeezing it out so i popped off the little nozzle and applied through the larger hole in the jug then the whole jug of adhesive got hard there goes the adhesive so i used some of my own adhesive right now i am letting the leather patch dry but i am not hopeful waste of 3000 use that money for somebody to fix it for real,88,146
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,i spent a lot of time looking for the perfect patch kit then gave up and decided to start cheap this one it worked perfectly yes you can tell there was once a hole if you look very carefully but nobody is going to casually notice it my couch is black so thematching was not a problem i imagine light colored leather such as beige or brown would be quite difficult to match with this kit edit about 6 months later the patch came off I am not sure it was the fault of the kit although because i did not have enough room to fit a properly-sized patch,108,147
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,I am reviewing this product as what it is a product for do-it-yourself non-professional types i would not expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable using that standard I have given this five stars positives the instructions are excellent particularly the very detailedmixing instructions plenty of colors of compound are provided ensuring that the correctcan be mixed also i will be able to use this kit again if necessary although I shall need to provide my own patch next time the materials are easy to work with if directions are followed now this does not look perfect on my leather chair we had a large rip about 4 inches i can see where the rip is but our chair is a burgundy textured leather neither thenor the texture is uniform so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather but it looks pretty good certainly way better than a rip it is not immediately noticeable if you are not looking for it for the price i paid about 25 this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home I have uploaded some photos of the repair,197,148
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4,positive,the instructions were a bit confusing but i still managed an invisible repair on quite a large tear i definitely saved me from having to buy a new sofa for awhile I had recomend it but do read all the instructions through to be sure you use the product correctly,49,149
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,these products are difficult to use especially if you have little to no experience my results were awful the product may yield a good result but you absolutely have to know what you are doing this is not a good system for the novice,44,150
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,do not buy this product state of the art materials include a scrap of fabric that is not the shape of the hole some rubbing alcohol a piece of 220 sandpaper and not enough filling compound to complete the project with a beige sofa you need plenty of white but that container was half empty when i got it save your money and your time leather magic leather repair kit,70,151
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,product was too dried out to be usable received refund from amazon thank you,14,152
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5,positive,used it to repair a leather couch worked great very satisfied,11,153
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1,negative,does not go on as easy as it states also not enough white material to fit in 2 holes 1inch but 5 inch colors do not mix to match the chart shown,30,154
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2,negative,adhesive and vinyl compounds were already hardened and unusable could not use the product,14,155

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i do not recommend this product for any type of work even if is a small project the instructions are very hard to understand and once you figure it out you find that everythat comes in this bag is very cheap let me start with the glue it is a cheap glue and does not work the paint is also cheap and good luck matching the colors be aware that the peace of vinyl that comes with this product is like 2 x 2 save your money and buy the existingvinyl by the yard and replace the whole thing or get it professionally done,109,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,thisworked as advertised it took care of the small rip i had on my couch the instructions were very clear and easy to follow they include several basic colors that you can mix and create more also amixing chart to help you mix the colors and get it as close as possible to the one you are tying to match i would buy it again,69,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,i used this on a chair in my living room and was able to mend one area smoothly but it cracked after the chair was used but still looks better than it did before the other area is still kind of bumpy and i will smooth over soon but it has not cracked i think the first patch i did was too thin it will take time to get it right the product is obviously packaged at someone has home and is not mass produced,84,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,this was a wast of my money i tride to repare a smoll cut in the set of my motor scooter it would mot stick i had cleaned the seat before as per instructios it is just a wast of money for my part,44,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,made the furniture look so bad that i put towels over the area until i can replace the couch,19,5

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,the directions caution that the material turns darker once dry i had the opposite reaction covering a small wear spot on my hard plastic dash if i had it to do over again i would have used j-b weld tinted a shade darker,42,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,can not compare this to any other product since this is my first time needing such anfor the price it is worth it in my opinion this is my first go around with this product so here are some pictures to help you decide fyi in person theof the patch in the first picture does not look that light it actually looks like the ottomansas in the next two pictures the first one was taken with a flash,83,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,it is very hard to use did not mix well it was like my box was old or something,17,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i had purchased this product with theof using it to mend leather shoes i followed the instructions completely i applied one application at a time had it dry thoroughly and then applied a second application the shoes looked great until i wore them not only did they crack worse than before but now the remaining leather frayed the shoes are headed for the trash and I am stuck with this package of worthless paints do not waste your money,81,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,it is not easy to use for big projects such as furniture that is why i bought now i use it mainly for shoes it is very tacky which can be a good thing,31,13

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,i was repairing a brown leather love seat the kit has an empty container for mixing colors and by adding black to the brown i attained the perfectmatch i hate directions but this was so easy to use and unless you get up close you can not tell where the sofa was repaired,55,16

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,did not actually use this instead used another product but i kept this around in case i do need it so to be fair 5 stars,25,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,does not work even when following the instruction i used it on a fake leather couch and it looks worse than if I had just used sharpie tothe scratch in,31,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,did not work as expected and very hard to get the right,12,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,trying to match theif it is not one of the basics will take a lot of patience and luck,21,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,i bought this to repair a bonded leather couch that has started flaking away matching thewas the most difficult part the patch is sturdy and has held however the part that has the patch is a bit stiff and hard just looking at it it looks great when you touch it you can tell it is a patch great for a small spot that needs repair,68,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,i have 2 imitation leather couches with cat nail pricks all along the top headrest I am not saying it is perfect however we can now use them in the family room,30,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,worked very well not that hard to match colors maybe i should have given it an extra star because of my own lack of experience,24,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,good luck trying tomatch your furniture,8,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,not sure if this was supposed to make it look like there was never any damage but it is very obvious where the repair is and is worse than before the repair was made the instructions are not very clear and the pattern swatches it comes with did absolutely nothing i had high hopes and was extremely disappointed,58,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,i did used this restor-it leather / vinyl repair kit in patching my leather sofa so far the patch is still holding i just can not get the bright red match i settled with the close to red that comes with the kit it is a good repair kit for vinyl and leathert,49,30

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,the black does not at all match the black sofa and thedid not dry darker than it appeared it got lighter i guess they did not take into consideration that most leather couches are not matte if you have a glossy leather sofa like we do do not waste your money the product will look like you used black paint to cover scratches and holes the texture samples given to re-texture a scratch or hole do not do a whole lot aside from smudge it around and good luck removing it when you do not like theit dried as we used a sponge a magic eraser our fingernails and nothing took it off and I shall be damned if i put rubbing alcohol on my 600 leather sofa,127,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,this actually works follow the directions but you can not even tell where i repaired my chairs,16,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,could not get a matchingfor the life of me but that was not as big of a deal as the fact that the material once dried is subject to peeling off theyou have just attempted to repair,39,37

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,this kit should have an activator according to the manufacturers website no activator included,14,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,actually worked quite well on a rather large area where the vinyl had come off of the fabric base on a sofa thematch was not perfect nor could i match the texture but it was a very reasonable repair and quite easy to use i put on multiple thin layers and it looks like it will last the last layer i spotted to match the variedof the sofa of course not perfect but i think it is better than the heat techniques I shall try to remember to add a picture,94,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,thewas really hard to match who knows if theis pink puce plum raspberry there has nochart just these names thei mixed looked alright in the beginning but when it dried it was totally off looks like little polka dots on the vinyl i would not recommend this product,54,42

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,colors mixed very close difficult area on truck glove box applied and dried ok just a little rough on my application an improvement over the tape i was using which left sticky residue when the heat got to it,39,50

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,I am a huge fan and practicer of restoration work but i normally work on ceramics and resin when i noticed how awful my leather work shoes looked this was a natural thing to try for me if you are careful it works really well to hide damage and to renew older furniture and shoes mixing colors is hard and that is why a lot of people gave bad reviews because they did not mix their colors and got mad that thedid not match you have to have the patience and artistic ability / dexterity to really take your time with this and to test carefully ifmatching i bought this for black pieces and the black paint works fine you just have to be careful not to over-apply and to wait for the glue layer to dry before applyingit is saved me almost 100 of new work shoes and an office chair,150,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,this worked fine i used a very small stiff-bristled brush to apply instead of the applicator supplied i repaired one big and complex tear it looks pretty good upon close inspection not visible to the casual looker i did a few small repair that are almost invisible,47,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,works very good on corners or hard surfs,8,61

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,horible waste of money this is elmers glue in,10,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,match went well but areas repaired did not look good for long,13,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,this product was easy to use and i repaired my leather recliner in no time,15,75
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,this is a terrible product especially considering the price first of all thepaste is the patch if by some fortuitous circumstance you are able to match theof the piece to be repaired you had best hope it is not a hole larger than an inch if it is forget it there simply is not enough paste to patch once patched the repair material barely sticks and the texturing process to allow it to blend in is poorly thought out michelangelo resurrected could not manipulate this product into anything discreet just buy coloredtape or a new whatever you want patched,104,76
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,worked really well on our new pleather couch my husband dropped a drill and punctured our couch the first day we had it and this disguised it very well,29,77
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,love it very easy to use so far so good,10,78
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,ruins whatever you apply it to what a waste will not do business with again,14,79
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,this really did not work for me but i think i might have screwed it up also i think it works best on broad flatter surfaces the one i was trying to repair was on theof the chair,39,80
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,i use it to restore vinyl flooring I have had good results,11,81
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,used this to repair the binding on my wallet now i get anlook when i go out to bars have another classy wallet although for work and business occasions,31,82
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,i think it depends on the size of the tear and your expectations i used this to fix a rather small hole my parrot had chewed in a dining room chair as others have said if you look closely you can see the repair but it looks much better than it did before this product is unlikely to make your damagedlook as good as new but it did a decent job for me,76,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,difficult to use and make the repairs look good,9,84
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,i repaired our couch when my wife was out and she could not tell where i had applied the repairs themixing is easy and the product appears to be holding up well thanks,33,85
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,this product is ok but do not expect the same results you see on the box,16,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,it hid the blemish somewhat but not in good lighting and it was not long before the edges began to peal up it was on a faux leather couch and the repaired area was hard and crusty compared to the surrounding fabric i could not make thematch the fabricwell enough may work ok on a small superficial blemish on the fabric but not good enough for a sizable puncture or tear,74,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,this was not a good product i had flesh-colored leather furniture and tried to mix up ato match i tried red white and brown and there was not enough to properly match the furniture,35,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,takes a couple tries but i got thejust right this is not a high end product you can not beat the results for the investment,25,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,it took a while to match thebut in the end it looks nice recommended,16,90
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,was not as shown or as described very poor productchanges as it dries long dry timethis company offers a similar product with a hardener it may be better,32,91
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,most incredible junk i ever saw did as instructed and it pealed off the first time i used the seat junk junk junk too bad i have to give it even one star to post,35,92
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,easy to use this product does what it says solved my issue with a vinyl chair cut on the side,20,93
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,not a bad repair kit at all much better than using heat-based repair kits easy to apply but mixing is a bit tricky as the vials are very small to work with,31,94
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i normally do not give out negative reviews unless it is a really bad product this product is that bad nothing but junk i followed the instructions to the tee and it made the damage look worse especially around the edges definitely looks like a patch job highly recommend that you stay away from this repair kit,58,95
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,even after emailing a photo of the area to be repaired to the manufacturer and following the instructions to the letter the repair simply pealed away after several days,29,96
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,worked great i have a dog and leather sofa had a few surface cratches worked just fine thanks dale in florida,21,97
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,if you are looking for an inexpensive way to patch a chair this is a good product if the patch lasts time will tell very easy to use,28,98
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,this product is very difficult to use and would perhaps work on a tiny project but it is messy and not easy to match the leather or vinyl i was trying to repair an office chair and that was impossible,40,99
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,i followed the directionsbyand when i took the patch off after the paint had dried it immediately started pealing and did not conceal the area at all bummed because i really was hoping this product was going to work,42,100
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,first i thought it would noit work by painting but the touch-up paint stay in our sofa for long time and looks great because of the colors provided low cost and definitely works great,34,101
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2,negative,i used this product to repair a small cut in vinyl flooring i followed the directions mixed the colors to match it matched pretty good applied and let it sit for 24 hours initially i thought this was going to be a great fix the next day i cleaned the floor with my swiffer no scrubbing and noticed that the product was coming up i put some water on the area wiped up with a paper towel and noticed more of the product coming up obviously this is not a permanent fix so if what ever you are repairing is going to get wet this may not be what you are looking for,113,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i am looking for another product to repair my hot tub cover followed the directions exactly the no-heat glue they provide seems to be about like elmers wood glue the colors matched fairly well but as soon as i thought it was all repaired i pulled off the sheet that is supposed to texture it and the entire patch came with it really disappointed you could do better with elmers glue and a colored sharpie,75,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i am pretty darn crafty and if i can not make this look even remotely good than i imagine most people can not it really make the small tears look much worse and more noticeable not to mention that the tears reopened,41,104
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,i tried this product on a boat seat it took me an hour just to get the first application ready and put on it says to put another application on after the first one is dry it took a day to dry i got very un-inspired about doing this for the several splits i had to fix it would have taken me a month to do them all with this kit i gave up and bought liquid stitch just apply it with the built in brush and it is done,89,105
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,had a faux leather chair which had an l shaped tear along the top of the back was able to match the chocolateand repaired the chair can i tell it was ripped yes can i see the damaged area when 5 foot away no and i no longer notice it every time i walk into the room or look at my son during dinner and neither does my wife which is a good thing i would practice with ayou will not be using on anyou do not care about to get the hang of it the directions are a little hard to understand and i had to read them 2 or 3 times to make sure i understood careful when applying the grain to get the proper side down this is why i would practice,139,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5,positive,i used this to fix my boots and i love it,11,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,thisshowed up dry and not spreadable i am very displeased,12,108
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,do not bother the first came with completely dried up and unusable materials so i requested a replacement which amazon dutifully shipped right away the second came the exact same way all dried up and completely worthless do not waste your time i should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers,50,109
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,do not waste your money if you have more than a scratch to repair,14,110
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,they really do not put enough of the product for you to be able to repair I am not happy with this at all i feel like i wasted my money it really does not work not the way they make it sound,41,111
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4,positive,did what i needed it to do repair a tear in a snomobile seat,14,112
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,i used full page t-shirt transfers before and they seemed wasteful when the image is small it is good to have smaller size transfers for small projects followed the instructions and it worked well,33,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,i used these to put my book cover on a baseball cap the sleeves of several sweatshirts and a couple of teeshirts they work great easy transfer great colors and did not fade in the wash,35,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,this particular product has the wrong instruction sheet inside and caused me to damage my photos product probably would not have been so difficult if the directions inside the box were correct,32,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,this smaller sized sheet of transfer medium is handy i use it primarily when i design and print labels for my quilts on it,24,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,these work well for what they are like any other t-shirt transfer they need to be cut closely to the image to make them look decent they wear well we used them for a company event but after about 15 washes they are starting to peel off a bit,49,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,these work great for small projects just try and cut out as closely as you can to your design so it does not look ironed on at home they do also tend to crease and fade over time so take care when washing if it is something you really care about,49,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,well as other reviewers have stated the instructions are completely wrong it is like they are not even written for this product i suggest that you go to the avery site and download the correct instructions for this product I am giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions they would simply do as i did and attempt the instructions that came with the product that will not work at all if you follow the correct instructions from the avery site you will have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer it comes out pretty soft and bright not sticky like some transfers I have used in the past I have washed the shirt i made a few times inside out and it still looks almost like it did right after i made it,140,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,these were awesome easy to use and fun to make for gifts family members avery products are first class always,20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,as mentioned already the company screwed up completely on the directions took me 10 minutes of trying to separate the transfer sheet to figure this out once you know how to apply these they are actually very nice iron-ons I have made a few shirts for my 5-year old daughter who absolutely loves them I have also transferred images onto bibs for my youngest daughter amazingly they have lasted quite a long time over several washings they begin to wrinkle a bit but as long as you dry them on low they will last a while my wife accidentally dried one shirt on normal and the transfer ended up wrinkling a bit and looked like it had been through a dozen washings considering we have bought shirts from stores that have lasted less time I am very happy with these,133,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,i liked the 4x6 sheet size because i often print smaller-size images to iron-on to t-shirts and find I have wasted half the page i found it did not peel easily after being ironed on which is always a plus avery has a high-quality product and if you are interested in making your own t-shirts matching aprons for a cooking or gardening club or memory quilts custom onesies would make a perfect baby shower gift great rainy-day activity to help kids design images on the computer and print out for an adult to iron on,92,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,as many reviewers have pointed out the instructions included for this product are ridiculous i have tested this product on several white t-shirts have not done any dark the actual use once i figured it out was fairly easy this was not a problem the real problem came in after a few wears and washes of the three shirts i have made i would say each have been worn and washed 3 or 4 times on all but one of them the image has already started to crack apart and peel it could be that i did something wrong but given the abysmal included instructions i called the help line and followed their directions exactly so my conclusion is this product needed a little more work before releasing it to the public,132,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,i had read the reviews of this product before purchasing so i was well aware that the directions included with the product were entirely wrong and disregarded them thankfully users had posted better instructions and i was able to figure it out on my own for the most part I have only used this on white cotton t-shirts and although it is easy to apply especially since i do not really care if it ruins our garage sale iron the images have been breaking apart on the t-shirt material since this is the main reason why i purchased the product the use of it has become null to me I am not willing to she shall out more money for nice t-shirts that I shall probably just ruin so these transfers will probably just go in a drawer somewhere in my house never to be used again,142,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,really there is not much else to say it printed beautifully in my ink jet and transfered easily onto the garment fun product to use to create some original presents and more would deffinitely buy again,35,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,all you have to do is print the design you want and you are able to iron on the transfer works great only photo size so if you want a larger picture get bigger than 4x6,35,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,i always have a few packets of t-shirt transfers and some new t-shirts for impromptu projects i mainly use these to entertain kids making team 1 and team 2 items to add to a theme event bridal shower toss pillow covers or other random temporary projects as with most print-yourself iron-on transfers the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings themust be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour / print transfer to another part of the t-shirt in other words do not leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing as with items in this genre this is purely a temporary in the momentfor something that lasts i would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick and mortar my one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing,168,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,transfer stickes for t shirts have always been a great way to produce great gifts for party attendants specially for kids birthday parties and to have an uniform look for family or group travel this stickes work great and i did not burn any transfering to t shirts only drawback is size may be a little small for large t shirts adult x and xx sizes,66,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,i used these to make transfers for aprons for my family for our holiday family reunion they are really easy to use and were a huge hit with my family i washed mine in cold water in the gentle cycle drying on the lowest setting and there was no real loss of detail orjust be sure to use a vibrant photo or image to transfer to insure that you get a quality image,75,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,I have used avery transfers for inkjet printers before instead of having t-shirts printed for employees who come and go and mistreat the ones I have bought and had screen-printed i have often opted to print our logo with these transfers i think this latest batch i got is slightly more resistant to fading in the washing / drying process i suppose I shall know better a month or two from now but so far they seem better same good performance as far as inkaccuracy and consistently even transfer of image two months later the images i printed continue to wear well through the laundry process the two concerns anyone may have about using these transfers have now both been put to rest for me the image is intense and evenly printed the image stays that way much more than it would have with previous editions of the transfer try some,149,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,this photo transfer paper works great i am not using it for t-shirts but the wife wanted to start a memory quilt i took several photos that i had archived and using this paper printed them from my canon printer the iron on transfer to the cloth she is using went perfectly and she is extremely happy with the results it looks as if i will be ordering quite a bit more of this so she can finish her quilt,80,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,these are great for my 3 year olds t-shirts they fit perfectly on the shirts and i do not have problems with them often i had one that was hard to get the sheet off the shirt but i honestly do not know if i just did not push hard enough or iron it for long enough so i can not say it was not my fault although nothing is ever my fault ask my 12 year old laughing out loud I had buy these definitely,78,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,there were a lot of problems with this product first of which were the directions that were completely baffling the other was the product itself there were problems with printing it on my printer then with tranferring it on the shirt and then with washing i would not recommend this product it was too much of a hassle to work with and poor intstructions,64,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,as others have posted trying to follow the directions that come with these is mind boggling after several attempts to figure it out i actually came to amazon to see the reviews and found i was not alone my wife is an art teacher and usally can figure things like this out much better than me so she will be playing with thiese next all i want to do is make a custom t-shirt for my 4 year old it should not be this confusing,84,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,it did not even work in the printer went in came out did not do anything just got new printer will test it and update review if a success but from the looks of it it probably will not be the directions it says avery dark fabric transfer tips what about light colors and the directions from there on are shabby as in they are muddled I am not even sure the directions in the package are even correct the only plus i can see so far is the support line a support line for t-shirt transfers is not it supposed to be easy,97,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,great mission accomplished made a nice graduation gift,8,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,i usually do not write bad reviews but this was such a disappointment and a waste of money i used it to put images on two white cotton onesies it says right on the package ideal for childrens clothes the transfer attached the white backing to the shirt as well as the image unlike other light t-shirt transfers I have used in the past but i figured it would be ok nope after one wearing i rinsed them both in cold water in the sink and the ink ran terribly nearly all the red just washed right off ugh but still I am not wasting onesies so i just dropped them in the wash after only one wash with the rest of the baby clothes the transfer is ripping and torn and looks like garbage this is the worst iron-on transfer I have ever used avery you let me down,147,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,this product is junk i only use jet pro soft stretch this stuff cracks and the colors are not nearly as nice as the jet pro you do have to use an actual heat press with the jpss although,39,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,to me it was difficult i made mistakes a lots the print came out after washing may be iron was not enough,22,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,i love customizing things fabric is no exception so when these popped up i was sure to grab them i was discouraged upon attempting to do my first transfer because the instructions made no sense in fact they were completely incorrect the instructions say that the transfers are for dark fabrics but the sheets say for light fabrics after eventually getting this to work i found out that that you can not dry the fabrics on anything other than low which is fine with me i dry everything on low to keep them soft they are really no better than any other iron on transfers i will not be purchasing these again but if avery comes out with a new and improved transfer i will consider it hopefully they have taken all of these reviews to heart,133,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some of the pens exploded and got ink everywhere so i had to return them they also felt very cheaply made in my hand like they would snap if i held them too tightly so i did not purchase another pack,41,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,all but one of the pens work well one of the purple pens is unfortunately already dried out the triangular shape makes for easy storage and allows for a better more comfortable grip,33,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,fine product good transaction a couple of pens seemed a little dry otherwise i would have rated the product 5 stars overall happy with the purchase,26,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,so disappointed in these markers one was completely dry two barely work several are scratchy and one broke apart the first time i uncapped it and ink got all over the place i feel like i got a different set of markers than those in all the reviews i read before purchasing i will never buy these again,58,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,love this i use this for my planner to doodle u have alot of different colors to play with it does not bleed through paper,26,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to go along with a coloring book of very intricate mandalas so i needed pens or markers that could handle the tiny details of the pictures the fine tips on these pens are fantastic and the colors do not bleed out through the paper plenty of different colors to choose from as well good purchase,57,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,this is the 3rd batch of markers i received 2day where all the blue ones are dried out weird i guess I am not supposed 2 use blue laughing out loud,28,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they work ok they came in fast like 2 or 3 of the pin did not work,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i got these because they were cheap artist inkers and i wanted to test them out i open the case to find out that the pens were dryed out the tips on some broke off and the caps insides fall apart i say do not ever buy these because they will waste your money,53,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,tips were broken and several were dried up,8,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,bought them as a gift recipient was very pleased,9,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,got these for college went to work on my homework and the grey and light yellow does not work i have not used all the colors yet but now i have to order new ones not happy,37,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i ordered 2 of these for christmas gifts only some of the pens worked i was past the return date so stuck with them the ones that worked are great,30,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,first off these are fine tipped markers not pens secondly I have never experienced drawing with something that does not remotely match theof the cap it is like a surprise every time the light colors are dark the five different greens are all roughly the samethe yellows are orange or green and they have run out quickly on the plus side the case is nice and i like the triangular shape and the price was cheap,76,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the colors are all vibrant 1 of the markers may have had abut after inspecting each and every single one i could not find d it but oh well i love them,33,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these i wish i had found them sooner thy arrived before the date that was given i use them for school and also for coloring I have had them for over a month and all the colors are still vibrant and i have not had any issues with the ink not drying fast enough,54,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very disappointing these are not thethat the cap says they are at all,15,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,mis-advertised these are in no way shape or form gel pens they are markers they have fine points and work well as markers but they are not gel pens which is what i was expecting when i ordered them markers can not be blended no glitter and all the colors are extremely dark would not order again,56,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,nice colors and good for details but i did break the tip of one already by applying too much pressure,20,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they have an incredibly cheap feel and are not gel as advertised i will be returning them,17,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half of these are already dried out plus the colors do not match lids i picked up a yellow one and thewas deep orange,25,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i really liked the pens they were nice for a while i used them only for a school year if that is a while but some of the colors dry out faster than others once a pen has been bent or split there has no going back that was the only sad part about these pens,54,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are a very nice fine tipped pen work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in there are plenty of colors but i did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper there was only 1 pen that i had any issue with and it was a light green which did not bother me that much since i do not use a lot of the lighter green colors but by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let thedrop and i have not had any issue since the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing the colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you will not lose them anywhere i am attaching a copy of a picture that i am working on right now using these pens for the linework the wording is done with a marker i received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review,203,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to use for adult coloring books and a lot of people end up using colored pencils but i wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick is a great variety of colors and it is very sharp clear bright pigmentation I had recommend this to anybod so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book I am not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I shall probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the colors but when i received them one of the pen exploded and was a mess,18,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the fine line it draws however three of the markers were dried up before i even got to use them disappointing and i probably will not buy their product again,32,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are nice pens very fine point they are great for tiny details however they do not blend well when you fill something in you can see each individual line each time you cover over the same area it gets darker due to the fine tip i would not recommend for anything larger however they are great colors and nice quality,61,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,good set of coloring pens but colors are not as bright as i thought they would be,16,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice pens i wanted a fine line marker to use with my silhouette machine for drawing and writing sentiments these worked perfect they have a pretty good range of colors the nibs are nice and strong also and draw a nice fine line,43,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when i purchased them they were not they are fine point markers had i wanted fine point markers these would been marvelous but not what i wanted mis-marked not what i was looking for no good for adult coloring books,45,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,when i received these 3 had leaked since then quite a few more have also love the ones that are useable,21,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,tiny markers but not gel pens useful but not what i expected,12,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these were pretty good markers they are fine tip and theydecently some colors are basically the same shade but other than that i had no problem they arrived quickly and I have had them for almost a year now,39,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,there has only one shade of red which is sad but a billion pinks and greens so that makes up for it,21,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,one of the pens blew up when i first used it i had to throw it away,17,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,great but one of the pens was leaking in the package when we got it,15,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,this pens i like so well the way thebut the tips on them do not last i used this set of pens twice and already i had to throw one away because of a bad tip and could not get any ink out and other one has a bad tip on it i was in the middle of a picture when it went bad i was very displeased,69,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they come apart when you take the top off to use them a waste of money,16,37

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,pensall of them my teen is covered in ink,12,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use on my ultra-intricate adult coloring books definitely a fine point works very well on tiny areas i recommend some larger or broader markers for bigger areas as these leave a rough texture to the paper when used toa larger space,47,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very scratchy so i ended up giving them to my grandchildren i will not purchase again,16,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these fineliner gel sketch markers are of a very high quality and have nice bold colors the markers come in a wide array of colors in a reusable plastic container I have only had one markersince I have begun using them they are excellent for mixed media projects mandala colorings zen tangle journaling deconstructing books grocery lists i would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge that is all,77,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i use these for coloring and they are great products the only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so i have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow,40,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i was so excited for these pens to comes in and they worked great at first but i have not even finished coloring one page in my coloring book and my dark brown marker is dying i made sure to cap all my pens properly but it is still dying i expect pens to last more than a day,58,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,many of the colors appear very differently on paper than what you expect based on theof the cap,20,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,I am a teacher and i love my office supplies i could not wait to try these out they are definitely fine point and there was no running or bleeding as i drew colored and wrote with them i love the variety of colors that come in the pack as well i am excited to use them very similar to the rong thai fine point markers i tried them in a coloring book and because the pages are thick it did not bleed through but not sure i would use them for coloring i did receive this product to try out and review,99,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these got an adult coloring book and these work great for all those little details in those pictures i highly recommend these and can not beat the price also got them quicker than expected so that was nice,38,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these markers perfect for small details they write like pens and the colors are great,16,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,several of the markers do not workis not in the tip,10,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,my husband will be thrilled that he has colored markers specifically for drawing these are nice and they come in a hard case so they can travel with him wherever he goes,32,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love the container of these fineliner pens and the 24 colors are good although a couple of them are pretty close in tone to another still a good set for tiny spaces in adult coloring books,37,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,not good for adult coloring books they do not glide very well scratchy / dry might be better served for signing signatures or writing text but for coloring in you do not get a consistent fill some places are darker than others and those dark places bleed through was looking to try a new brand to diversify my range of colors i typically use stabilo but unfortunately will have to keep looking,70,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i love these pens i find that they do bleed through most paper unless it is a very heavy weight paper the colors are vibrant and i use them all the time,32,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are the right pens to use with adult coloring books after trying pencils and coloring brush pens i found these work in the tight places the best i tried all of them to see if any were dried up and all were good true toas well you need to replace the lids so they snap on tight to keep them from drying up,66,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,these just arrived in the mail and at least one of them leaked as they are all covered in a bluish-purple ink theappears new as the blue is all over my hands now as well,37,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens are really awesome i used them when i was studying for my exams because i like for my notes to be colorful and organized my only problem was that a few of them dried out or ran out of ink very quickly i had hardly even used them it was only two or three in the pack that did this and the others still work great,68,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,using these for my adult coloring books and they are wondeful several coworkers plan to purchase the same product for their coloring books as well,25,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,terrible absolutely terrible 75 if them are dry they do not fill well very blotchy what an total waste of money,22,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they are great for really tiny spaces but when it comes to bigger spaces you really have to take your sweet time,22,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i recently bought these pens i have used them three times and four of them are already dry waste of money,21,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i like the flow of these pens and they only barely bleed through a quality coloring book however the dark green was leaking from the bottom of the pen and was already all over the other pens when it arrived I am sure this was a fluke also for 24 colors a lot of these colors are so similar that it is like I am using the same colors over and over i would have liked more variety in the pack,78,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice markers lots of colors to choose from,8,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use in an adult coloring book they work perfectly for the extra fine lines that are in the book they do bleed through just a tiny bit so i have a piece of paper in between my pages they do not bleed through the lines for me like other markers did i can be very precise definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs fine detail,70,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these pens are awesome i got them for coloring in adultbooks they are amazing for small areas,19,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,very good purchase the price was super they arrived on time prerfectly packed the colors are just as shown in the caps,22,65
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,received yesterday but why it is so dirty so dirty i required a new one for my friends gift i am very unsatisfied with this,26,66

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,cheaply made and the there is a inkproblem,10,70
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,great pens nice thin tip to make smaller details to handwriting or journaling if you love colored pens or office supplies like me these are amazing,26,71
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,the pens were all leaking when i got them so i sent them back for a refund,17,72
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,horrible ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer ofalso these are listed as pinkrise and they are plinrise for some unknown reason if you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove the triangular shape is pleasing to the hands although,65,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some pens were already dry and unusable very disappointing got much better pens at michaels,16,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love to write and draw and i am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers i am so glad i got these pinkrise office colored fineliner sketch drawing pen fine point gel ink pen ink width 04mm set of 24 assorted colors they are very nice and come in a plastic case that seals nicely so when you are done you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them and they write just wonderfully i am very picky about my pens and markers but could not find anything negative about these i absolutely love them i was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion i am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way i am just a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision,157,75

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,very fine point and awesome selection of colors love these,10,78
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,disappointed that some of the markers came dry,8,79
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these markers i was worried about the quality and the price but identification buy them again i love them i was impressed with the size since i wanted extremely small markers and these nailed it,37,80
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the lid and the actualdid not always match but i just made achart in the flap of the book for comparison loved the markers over all,29,81
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,markers bleed all over my hands they run out of ink right after one use I am completely disappointed i would give them zero stars if there was an option for that i wish i could get my money back,41,82
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,was delivered very quickly the colors are great and the pens do not bleed across the page very pleased and would recommend to others,24,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the triangular shape makes these easy to hold i like a finer tip but for what they are they are good,21,84
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,exactly what i wanted no problems with dried pens nice variety of colors super fast shipping i received my set 2 days after i ordered it happy with my purchase,30,85
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,not only are they dried up and yes i did shake them and wait a while to use them but some of the tips are split down the middle the colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out,45,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are great for very detailed drawings the ink seems to stay consistent even after prolonged use also the barrel is triangular rather than round i found it a little awkward at first but it certainly did not cause any issues these would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type maybe paired with an art book regarding shipping i have prime and it arrived within 2 days,70,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens work well but they run out of ink sooner than other brands,14,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half the markers were dried out upon arrival waste of money,11,89
Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,really disappointing as a noise reducer no noticeable difference does diffuse the exhaust really not worth it,17,0
Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,does not block sound that much but it does reduce dust fits shop vacs,13,1
Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,thought i was looking for a filter but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum did the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she did not know it was missing,39,2
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this installs easily on the rigid vacuum exhaust port but that is about the only good thing about it it is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it i could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not it is a goodbut really does not work too well,60,3
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this product being advertised as a muffler is misleading i observed no difference in sound level i just completed my test it is being returned an effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac this is a viable option for my use since i will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective,77,4
Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,the listing for this muffler does not say what size hose it fits there are three sizes when i received it i realized it did not fit my vacuum,27,5
Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,my ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106db at 3 feet according to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a dead kennedys concert the muffler reduces that to 105 so maybe a wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler further using an unscientific stick to your face test I had say it reduces suction by about 15 so basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac if you need that and do not want to just tape a sock to the outlet click buy immediately i finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet now i can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her f-16,124,6
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,it is a muffler makes the shop vac quiet stays in place does not stick out too far one two three four,20,7
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i did not need exhaust dispersion if i did i would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device to my knowledge none exist i wanted a muffler this does not muffle i took it back the end ps this site will not allow my zero star rating,45,8
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine does not blow air all over from the back of the machine it is a great addition for very little money we were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list,50,9
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i was surprised to see that this muffler received 4 stars when i read the reviews praise was given not because it muffles sound but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust indeed this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my ridgid vacs i bought two of them but i was in a rush and got them locally when we are working on a job site there often is lots of dust imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in it also spreads the dust over an even greater area as other reviewers describe this muffler oh why not just call it air-diffuser redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle this greatly reduces the force of the air it is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler but the difference is too small to spend any money on so in terms of living up to it is name i give it one star,190,10
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac the name is rather misleading as it was not designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction,40,11
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,if you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place if you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust this is what you need it can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust,44,12
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this is definitely not a noise muffler it is not a silencer either it does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face by redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable i bought this for our new ridgid wd1680 which amazon does not sell the big box store i bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so i got this to go with it used in a garage the vac is surprisingly quiet it seems our hoover upright is much louder i measured the ridgid as-is at 83db with the muffler on it was 83db there was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant i figure it is also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I am going to return it the wd1680 also works as a removeable blower in that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port even although it was the same port with just a tube attachment so bottom line is that this is useless,182,13
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart this really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern and also diffusing it with some very porous foam vacuum performance is not hindered it is not really a muffler as the noise level did not change for me but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying it should really come with the vacuum but since it does not its a no brainer purchase,82,14
Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,i bought thisfor the rigid shop vac with detachable blower basically the same unit as the sears craftsman version it makes a noticable difference in reducing the frequency of the sound thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit although i can not say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter i do not have a db meter it certainly makes it seem quieter and much more bearable you do have to watch where you point it although because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction although this is by design it is the blower port after all also it not fully inserted it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on worth the money,130,15
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,perfect for what i needed see behind without turning around check on skier or tuber or to see approaching boat from rear clear enough for all that and secures tightly so no vibrations,33,0
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,the mirror workes as expected on the bass boat and is used for skiing in the water in the summer,20,1
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,great product at a great price i would highly recommend thishas a wide view for towing skiers behind you,21,2
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,i liked having this mirror and it was inexpensive but it was also cheap the piece for mounting it broke off within a couple of months and that is with minimal use it was a disappointment,35,3
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,this was rather difficult to install on my boat i also found out that it does not meet the requirements for acceptable mirrors in texas by the us coast guard,29,4
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,simple mirror that gets the job done and you get your monies worth the reflective part is plastic so it is not as clear but it is certainly more durable than glass you may need to put a shim so it fits to you windshield,44,5
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,it works fine you get what you pay for the key word for this product is economy,17,6
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,out boat does not have a attached side mirror and when we have the top on our big attached mirror does not fit this mirror is so prefect for that and it is way cheaper than other i found love it,41,7
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,nice mirror easy on and off for 10 you can not go wrong a-zon to my house in two days,16,8
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,face it you do not want to pay 129 for an overtons mirror but you still want to see behind you this works mount is good as well took me a minute to figure it out and needs tightened every once in a while mirror with a few imperfections but certainly good enough view to see if a skier or tuner is on or off and to see hand signals if you have read this far just spend the ten bucks and move on you will be happy,87,9
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,universal mount will not work on my sea ray had to jury rig,12,10
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,flimsy cheap mirror that has an extremely distorted view not worth the pricether,13,11
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,mounting bracket is too large for average windshield thickness used a block of wood to fill theotherwise it is great for the price if you are looking for something stylish this is not what you want it is as cheap as it is price but will do the job just fine,51,12
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,excellent for what i needed the top left was distorted a bit although,13,13
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,the thumb screw does not work that great i ended up drilling a few pilot holes in my plastic windshield on my boat and used rubber washers and a nut to fasten works great now,34,14
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,arrived without the mounting bracket overall poor quality do not try and save the on this cheap product,18,15
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,i was looking for an inexpensive rearview mirror for my boat to keep track of any boat traffic behind me since i use my boat on a lake with a lot of traffic using the mirror does not preclude looking behind me when changing direction however i do like keep track of boats which may be overtaking me this mirror is very inexpensive easy to install and provides an adequate if somewhat distorted wide-angle view of what has behind my boat,80,16
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,you get what you pay for it is a reflective sticker on a cheap plastic base not the greatest mirror but for the price it will work,26,17
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,your basic plastic mirror meets expectations for the price,9,18
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,simple to install and works great great price,8,19

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,a little smaller than i thought but works well for the price,12,23
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,easy to mount after you figure it out looks great,10,24
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,very dissatisfied with mounted it on my pontoon boat drove to the lake when i got to the lake did not realize it the glass part of it was missing now all i have is a plastic frame you wood thinking would last a lot longer then one trip than that very very dissatisfied,54,25
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,now my skipper can see who is catching up to him easy to install,14,26
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,it mounted ok for my application but i was extremely disappointed in the poor quality of the plastic mirror lots of irregularities and distortion on scale of 1 - 10 it is a 2 I shall be replacing with a better quality one,39,27
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,dosent hold that well and is limited to thinner windshields unlike the ones on higher quality boats,17,28

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,not too shabby a decent value mirror that has stayed attached so far,13,46
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,it is more of a shiny piece of plastic sticker than anything else it does get the job done tho as functioning as a rear view mirror still would have preferred some sort of plexi or tempered glass,37,47
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,a piece of junk what a waste of time I am surprised that it is even sold on amazon,17,48
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,clamping screw arrangement is workable but some slop remains after they are fully tightened,14,49
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,still working after many days out on rough water,9,50

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,junk avoid this it will not stay clipped on the plastic is too flimsy for the clamp to stay attached,20,56
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,cheap mirror gets job done but would not recommend for anything more than that,13,57
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,it is just plastic but it does what it is supposed to for not much money i clip it to top of windshield on my boat and it stays there just fine it does the job for cheap,36,58
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,i think it would have worked well if i had not recieved someone has returnedit had clearly broken in half and was glued back together very disappointed not worth my time to return an 8,36,59

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,this is an amazing deal for the price the quality is not anything super amazing but fir the price the quality is spectacular,22,61
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,horrible quality plastic plastic mounting bracket stretched and does not hold mirror you get what you pay for junk,17,62
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,i guess for the low price it functions however the construction is plastic and the mirror quality is poor just a piece of film,23,63
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,mirror part not exactly high grade lens material but for a budget purpose does the job seems to screw into place securely and is the right size and seems solid enough we always have more than one person in the boat if we are towing someone so this was more to be legal in case we ever wanted to have just driver and person being towed and for the driver to be able to peak on their own without relying on the other passenger so this fits our needs well enough in spite of the lack of crisp visual it is ok to good not good to great,106,64
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,price is good not a glass mirror made of plastic hopefully holds up,13,65
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,the clarity of view seems fine to me but it could definitely have a larger view the problem for me is that i can not find a way to securely mount it yet it will not tighten up enough to fit any standard ski boat windshield that i have seen surely with a little more creativity i can make a spacer to take up all the space but i should not have to modify a product to fit a boat it is marketed to fit would not buy again,87,66
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,i would not put this on a jon boat straight to the trash,12,67
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,works as described i use it in my cubicle to see when people sneak up on me,18,68

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,not very clear to see and it broke around 30 mph,11,72
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,needs to be at least 4 wide and long,9,73
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,there are fancier models of this mirror but for an affordable price it is easy to attach the the windshield of a boat i use my mirror to help to watch skiers as well a see what is going on behind me in general if money was no object you may want to consider a higher-end model with suction cup mount and more i opted for this because my boats windows are tinted and i did not want to stick a suction cup the window tint I have hit this with my head a few times and it has not broken the build quality is okay but i doubt that it could withstand extended abuse I am happy with my purchase and the price paid for this mirror it helps to makes my boating experience more safe on a budget,135,74
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4,positive,this is a very universal clamp on cheapy but does the job i had to make a block to take up the space to elliminate the rattle otherwise works great,30,75
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,cheap and blurry but what i expected for the price does mount easily buy metal or glass for clear visibility,20,76
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,just what we needed for our kawasaki mule utv now we can see what is coming up behind us easy attachment,21,77
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,2nd one i ordered the slightest bump and it is broken i put a new one in my boat on saturday 7/13 and i bumped it on sunday 7/14 it broke,31,78
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5,positive,I am not sure why it took me so long to order one of these not only is it required when skiing with only two people but it is hugely convenient do not hesitate to buy one they are a great asset on a boat,43,79
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1,negative,tried to save a buck you get what you pay for the clamp actually popped itself off as soon as i mounted it,22,80
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2,negative,this is really a pretty cheapounfortunately it does not quite fit over the windshield of my boat also the only way to tighten it onto the windshield is with the provided screws it really seems like there should be a foam covered plate between the screws and the surface to prevent scratching the surface I am using it but actively seeking a better alternative,64,81
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,4,positive,use it under a tonneau cover to keep items from sliding forward and needing to open cover to retrieve items for the money this is a good value it is medium duty and not suitable for heavy items easy to fit remove and secure attractive and looks good in an open bed easy to hang bungies and rope,57,0
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5,positive,if you use your bed for groceries this is a must have i keep mine near the tail gate and i can put groceries in without having to worry about them sliding everywhere thumbs up,35,1
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,we purchased numerous loading zone cargo gates they have a limited lifetime warranty we do not have a warranty issue i am glad because they do not return e-mails or phone messages if you buy one be aware you will not be able to get parts it is a shame because they make a good gate buyer beware is all we will say,63,2
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5,positive,first one came damaged and no questions asked they shipped me a new one advanced replacement this was a gift for my dad and the second one came within a few days after christmas during the busy return season,39,3
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2,negative,we are returning we have wanted to like it and tried every way possible to make it work in our silverado but the things we are trying to block no extreme weight by any means-plastic totes with small parts in them keep pushing it loose and slide all over in the back of the truck,54,4
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,the cargo gate would be fine for very light weight loads but just a simple 5can ofwill because the bottom to push in towards the cab if you try an secure youragainst the tail gate it works fine until you tap your breaks then the bottom of the gate will swing towards the front of your truck,63,5
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5,positive,product is amazing as expected and meets standards and product description i am very happy with it is use no complaints a must have for truck owners and the price amazing,30,6
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,horrible if any weight at all hits the bottom it comes off the truck,14,7
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,does not stay in place i use it to keep baseball equipment near the end close to my tailgate and i find that it frequently can not withstand the pressure from 2 baseball bags filled with baseball gloves and 2 bats each,41,8
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2,negative,i have a chev 2500 hd with an undercover flex cover on the bed the gate will not work inside the bed as it runs out of adjustment it is made to utilize on the rails in my case the rails are not accessible due to bed cover the only way to make it work inside the bed is to use wood blocks for shims,65,9
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,the clamp lever that cam locks the gate by pushing rubber pads against the bed are made of plastic if you pick the wrong hole in which to insert the pin that fits the top of the gate the width to your specific truck will break the plastic cam lever rendering the entire device worthless you will only find this a problem once you push the lever down and it breaks which is too late i will defer to a net type,82,10
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2,negative,if you use the rubber at the bottom to prevent sliding it will not work not only that it will raise the whole thing about 3 inches and the cover will not work if you remove the rubber stuff will start sliding as if nothing there,45,11
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2,negative,did not fit under my bakflip bed cover,8,12
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5,positive,best device i have ever seen for helping you secure your cargo in the truck bed,16,13
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5,positive,very well designed and built fits under my soft tonneau rails,11,14
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,4,positive,okay my first review was hasty i was at the end of a very long and hot day when i first attempted to install this in the bed of my truck i cut my thumb and hand in the process and just was not a happy camper now that a calmer head has prevailed the cargo gate went right in as described i anticipate that it will hold my travel bags and dog travel supplies close to the tailgate on an impending road trip i would not depend on it to hold a very large and heavy object in place but if you want ordinary things like groceries luggage and more to stay within reach I am confident this is the perfect solution,120,15
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2,negative,poor quality you get what you pay for i guess strongly recommend to anyone considering this purchase to consider not purchasing thisas it is advertised as a universal fit it is not,34,0
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5,positive,they are just what i wanted i had a hard time finding such seat covers and these are great very durable very happy with them,25,1
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4,positive,i like saddleblanket material for seatcovers I had rather that the saddleblanket material was used for the whole cover instead of spandex around the top and edges one of the elastic straps came loose when i pulled on it it is cheap but better than many of the seatcovers on the market today i use a large safety pin to hold it properly at the bottom out of sight,65,2
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2,negative,not a universal bucket seat fit way too small does not fit would not recommend to a friend rips upon stretching,21,3
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4,positive,i really like the style and the toughness of the weave only one thing prevents me from giving 5-stars is that the cover should have a hold-down strap on the bottom front when getting into vehicle occasionally the cover will slide up and off the corner,44,4
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1,negative,they are nothing like they used to be and because they say universal fit does not mean they are universal i have a ford explorer sport trac and it would not fit the seats properly terrible,36,5
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5,positive,bought these seat covers for my 84 toyota pickup found them to be as good as any saddle blanket seat cover available would definately recommend them for a toyota pickup,30,6
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5,positive,these are the only truck blanket seat covers i could find for trucks that have bucket seats they have been on a couple of weeks and they seem like good covers the blanket part covers the seat part well,39,7
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1,negative,does not even come close to fitting a 2012 canyon,10,8
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1,negative,upon receiving this product by allison corporation do yourself a favor and forward it to your local landfill you will otherwise be compensating for it is poor craftsmanship and craft store materials,31,9
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1,negative,the worst product at amazon directions were horrible do not buy unless you are looking for inferior product in every way no zipper no tie down strap no opening for arm rest each with which was described for use in installation process i feel ripped off should be negative star rating,50,10
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2,negative,i put the seat cover on the seat in my truck and two days after i put them on they started coming apart in the seams would not buy again,30,11
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4,positive,have not had these for very long so i can not grade them on their durability they fit reasonably well but could use a couple of more attachment straps so far although i can not complain about anything wrong with them,38,12
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,these husky liners will save your carpet and nice mats i have 3 kids in school and these have saved my interior,22,0
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,I have had these for nearly 5 months they look and perform well i think they are overpriced for what they are worth 25 for the pair not 45 plus my biggest complaint is that they emit a chemical off-gassing smell i am not sure why cheap plastic but they still give my car an off oder after nearly 5 months of use it is particularly bad on sunny days when parked car heats up avoid unless you do not mind chemically oder,81,1
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,more than adequate will protect the carpet during the winter quite well,12,2
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,these require trimming to fit so they are not completely custom but they are very easy to trim and fit our 2002 subaru legacy outback just fine the only down side and hence one star off is that there is no molded in socket for the pin which keeps the mat from sliding around i did cut one but it does not seem to hold it in position that well,69,3
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,nice mats fit well into my 2002 a4,8,4
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1,negative,these mats does not fit bmw 525i the mat is actually on thepedal it is just too wide on the drivers side and that is not safe,27,5
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,i purchased these mats to replace the ones i have had for over 10 years i purchased a new vehicle and i wanted ato match the interior the drivers side mat did not fit properly on my toyota 4 runner after cutting where indicated there was aof at least an inch between theof the mat and the side door as it was winter i could already see the floor carpet getting dirty i cut the mat further in the upper left corner to better accommodate the foot rest and the problem is resolved but it does not look right with the ridge cut away my old ones fit perfectly and i was expecting the same from the new mats,124,6
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,the floor mats are super durable and a real breeze to modify if needed to your particular car or truck,20,7
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,driver side can be cut to fit passenger side is a little to wide and can not be cut to fit so not quite custom fit,26,8
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1,negative,needs to be cut to fit look bad wanted to surprise my daughter by replacing very old carpet mats the really look so bad i may not leave them in the car,32,9
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,these are not custom fit you cut them with scissors and they sort of fit not that impressive the back ones are dual non-fitting landcruiser has a single piece go with weathertech,32,10
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,update i contacted husky about these mats and the poor fit in my toyota highlander outstanding customer service engineer admitted these are more of a general purpose mat and not specifically designed for one model of vehicle instead he shipped me the cargo liner mats which are custom molded to cover the entire floor in front of the driver and passenger the custom fit liners are far better if you drive a highlander or larger vehicle choose the custom liner and skip this mat original review i drive a 2006 highlander and was happy to see that my specific model was listed unfortunately these floor mats are anything but vehicle specific the husky website tells you that they will require trimming and even after doing so the driver side mat does not fit correctly this is a safety hazard and i strongly recommend against this product save your monay and shop elsewhere,153,11
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,weathertech makes the digital fit for the 2004 tacoma but not the double cab i bought those mats from amazon because their fit guide said it would work when they did not sit right i went to their weathertechs site and learned that they do not make the mats for the double cab truck you can submit a product request on that site and tell them you want that this mat made once there are enough requests they will make it if you are buying these mats because you do not want to spend the 100 that weathertech charges then you may be satisfied if you have ever owned the wt mats these are no where near the fit since they were 60 of the cost of the wt mats I am not disappointed,128,12
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,very very pleased in these mats and they are heavy duty and nothing flimsy about these love them and recommend them,21,13
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,they really do catch all the dirt and slush perfect fit for my car too i matched them up with the center husky liner,24,14
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,the floor mats arrived on time and in very good condition the product was a perfect fit for my car and the quality of the rubber is very good,29,15
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,mat does not fit driver side is ok not worth returning but irritating and poor service when the type and make of car are carefully specified,26,16
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,i ordered these for my suv as mine had worn out so far they are working great i do like them and would recommend them to others,27,17
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1,negative,these are not fitted mats for your bmw 3 series they need to be cut trimmed and fitted to match the contours of your vehicles floor the product discription misleads one to belive these are custom fitted mats not one word about cutting and trimming for fitment if your considering buying these mats do yourself a favor and go to your local big box auto store and buy a set of 20 dollar generic mats as these are not worth 3x the cost,83,18
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1,negative,mats were advertised to be custom fit they have to be cut down to size and do not fit at all this should have been explained in the product description,30,19
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5,positive,these are great floor mats very durable stylish and easy to wash the crud off which is a big bonus here in the midwest with the harsh winters we have i would highly recommend,34,20
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,I have had several husky heavy duty floor mats in the past i prefer the heavy duty to the hskey liners in the front as they are less slippery and thicker normally they fit great and last forever i bought this set for my 2004 tacoma double cab 1st gen the fit leaves something to be desired initially the drivers side was terrible but there are pattern lines for trimming it down after trimming with a razor it is a good fit I am not sure if this is for multiple models but i would prefer a fit out of the box the passenger side needs to be molded differently on the bottom left corner as it comes up over a bump in the floorboard colour is great match materials quality is great and I am sure they will last as long as my other huskys have just a bit disappointed in the passenger side fit it is not terrible by any means but not perfect as others have been driver side is perfect after trimming with a razor blade along the trim lines,179,21
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5,positive,after hitting someand tearing up my front fender i decided to buy these to cover the damage they worked great and fit like a glove no sweat on the tape i just used clear silicone via caulk gun to attach nothing to it one thing to note these attach behind the front running lights via screws in other words you remove your front running lights then replace atop the fender covers back to the holes the screws in the kit were just a little short and not really up to the task i went to the auto store and purchased some stainless 8 screws with plenty of length to tighten up everything these look great on the jeep i also have real diamond plate installed and the guards matches just fine,133,0
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2,negative,if you buy these you will need to trim these and take your time to make them fit correctly i had to use a dremel to shave down the sides for both sides to sit flush then i had to use a heat gun to heat them up and mold them to the fenders so they would sit right go to lowes or home depot and buy stainless steel screws the ones they provide will not work correctly you will want to use a pan head screw head size 8 and 1 long go to your local auto parts store and pick up a small roll of 3 m double sided tape has a red backing and the adhesive is a dark gray the provided tape will not be enough to hold it down right overall not a terrible product but for a 50 molded piece of plastic i would have expected it to fit better,154,1
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4,positive,the front is much easier than the back lights come out easily and the fit is pretty good i read a review that said it did not come with new screws and the ones you take out of your lights are not long enough i did not see any when looking at the parts so i went and bought some but later when cleaning up i found a little bag with 4 black screws in it and taped to another bag the parts came in never saw that laughing out loud i assume these were for that but i did the front and backs at the same time so can not swear to it again instructions would have been nice they look great,117,2
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4,positive,neat product adds to my black and white only look thre is a slight problem with the driver side guard as it doenst want to lay flat other then that I am happy with them,34,3
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4,positive,applied these per instructions the double stick tape should be a little thicker to really catch the body better so it stays put i actually added some of mine to it so it would stay product does what it is supposed to protects corners and is stylish,46,4
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2,negative,purchased body armor guards to cover some paint chips and prevent more they do that but the adhesive does not stick and really is only being held on by the parking light screws even the screw holes had to be enlarged to line up they do not lay flat on fender goodshould come up with better adhesive,57,5
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2,negative,these guards look great in the pictures but for the money they are way over priced here is a list of things that could be improved on these that i created while installing these 1 better tape I am not sure why rugged ridge skimped on the tape for these but after installing the left gard as per the instructions it literally popped off i went down to kragen and got the best 3 m tape they had and the guard fits flush just fine 2 quality control for 50 plus dollars i would consider these a disappointment the plastic was unevenly cut was thin in some areas particularly where the screrws go the mold might have been crooked because the screw holes were also a little uneven 3 heavier duty i know plastic is very strong but i was definitely disappointed with the weight and feel of the plastic as well considering the price for 20 dollars i doubt i would have said anything but for triple that and more on other websites i was pretty annoyed definitely considered returning them they do look nice once you get them on,189,6
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1,negative,way over priced for a piece of thin plastic that attaches with tape,14,7
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4,positive,looks good and easy to install had no problem with the screws that they came with but the tape is not very good quality a little too pricey but overall pretty good product,36,8
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5,positive,upgraded the look of the front of my jeep,9,9
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5,positive,look awesome on my jeep and easy to install had them both on and installed within 15 minutes,18,10
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1,negative,i just received one of two parts i just received the right side passenger,14,11
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5,positive,adhesive sucks but buy new at the store and your set gives wrangler a good look,16,12
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1,negative,cheap product double-sided adhesive is a joke i bought these to cover up the damage the old ones caused on a used jeep i recently purchased as per the previous owner i had to rivet them to the fenders just to keep it on rugged ridge clearly does not test their products and i do not know how they have stayed in business,61,13
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1,negative,i purchased knowing the price but i was expecting a harder more heavy duty plastic instead they are a thin cheap plastic and meant to be glue to the car with 3 m tape they are not meant for performance they are meant for looks do not expect them to stick great to the body unless you are willing to drill them down left side did not fit properly i decide to return them and next time i will spend the extra money and go with the real ones,82,14
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,looks like metal with peened paint coating disappointed not as pictured not metal very cheap made go to autozone and save your money,23,0
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,does not fit the cup shown in silver in my picture even although it looks like it would my fianc said he has to put a coozie around the cup for it to fit in the cup holder he really likes the way it looks although,45,1
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,this is easily the best solution I have found to adding cup holders in my yj i had to remove the center console i was using and these fit the bill they work great fit great and look great what more can i ask,43,2
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,it works easy to mount with my jeep 1995 yj there is one problem although since i have side windows wining inside this cup prevent the window from opening i am still debating on what to do but the product is what you see and how it is advertised,49,3
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,i like theof this cup holder but it is a little specific in terms of use it was clearly designed for the type of cup in the product picture not a standard mug or something a little different in terms of shape personally i use it for a slightly different purpose than in my jeep which sadly i do not have anymore i have it attached to a cart that i use in my classroom i teach music you can check out pictures of the cup holder in action at my blog mobilemusicmansionblogspotcom,94,4
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,we have an old pu truck that is manual shift and no built in cup holder this works great even for a big gulp,24,5
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,i got these for my yj they work really well i thought that since they are plastic they might not be very sturdy they are really tough although they are really simple to put on and they are a life saver,37,6
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,very very small did not use it wast of money oh and did not come with screws either,16,7
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,it works great for most cups however i was hoping to find one that would fit my yeti cup and this one is not quite big enough,26,8
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,i mounted this to my lawnmower it lasted about 5 mows i guess the vibration of the mower was too much for the poor little guy,26,9
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,very light plastic good for a 12 oz can is about it,11,10
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,just what the jeep needed was some deep cup holders definitely recommend buying these their way better than most jeep center console cup holders tall glasses will not spill,28,11
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,disappointed in the material i think metal would be a better alternative too flimsy to hold larger drinks,18,12
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,great addition to any jeep and a easy install you can never have enough places to hold a beverage my jeep is a manual so my polerpop 44 oz would always get hit on the down shift if i was not playing attention now i do not have that problem anymore,47,13
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,wish it would have been metal as it looks in the picture but it works great for now,18,14
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,it looks a lot better in the pictures than when you open the box and pull out a flimsy plastic piece they must have changed the design from the one pictured also because it now only has 2 bolt holes if you are looking for a heavy rugged cup holder keep looking,51,15
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,worked perfectly for my 1991 jeep need to order a second one,12,16
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,cheap plastic not metal as appears in picture no factory hardware uses 2 screws to attach that the buyer supplies and only holds small bottles or cans never would recommend,30,17
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,plastic not metal like the picture shows hate it,9,18
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,glad they are plastic little snug between hard doors and the dash in my yj but no complaints would buy them again,24,19
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,not very sturdy but does ok it is plastic can not expect much,10,20

Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,it is not the same product that is on the picture and made of cheap plastic door cup holder is better and cheaper then this junk,25,23
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,works / fits as described easy install only thing is that it is plastic but heavy plastic works well enough for me,19,24
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,did not realize this was plastic hope it holds up,9,25
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,would give it 0 stars because it does not fit the 91 jeep wrangler drivers side i installed it closed the door and the door broke it,27,26
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,the images clearly show a triangular back plate which fits all three bolts i received one with only the two top bolts also this cup holder does not fits any of my tumblers the only cup it will hold is the one depicted it is so custom it is useless,48,27
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,installed in minutes the mounting holes are slotted so installation was simple pics do not show it but the cup holders fairly well braced underneath it also has a slot to accommodate a coffee cup after installing it i drove over to mcdonalds and ordered a large coke a bigger drink than I had normally carry and the cup holder held it securely and did not flex under the weight of the cup I am comfortable that the cup holder could handle anything I had want to carry in it,83,28
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,decent looking blocks the vent window and will not accept most large drinks but looks decent and fits most things too bad it is plastic not metal but price does reflect that would buy again,33,29
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,was not like the picture i am afraid it will break,10,30
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,unfortunately the bottom part of the cup holder size was not large enough to fit a typical stainless steel coffee mug contigo 14 oz with 2875 in diameter the bubba brand mug i have fit about 025 in in the bottom opening but i do not use that mug much and forget about a yeti while all mugs fit in the upper portion in most cases it was too wide and not tall enough for me to trust it would maintain a mug securely especially while driving the diameter of the smallest opening of the holder is 275 in and the largest / upper portion diameter is 34375 in,105,31
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,the cupholder is a great design but engineering fail in the use of plastic i bought two and one broke within a week the other is still holding on but because of the brittleness of the plastic poor reinforcement for the cupholder to prevent breakage due to vibration i do not think it is going to last much longer i will be building my own using these as a template out of aluminum,71,32
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,i asked questions on this product cheap cheap cheap plastic i was told by ryan manufacturer it was metal not plastic please refund,24,33
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,plastic cup holder do not know how long it is going to last besides shipped as a single cup holder so i needed to order another one,25,34
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,i bought these after reading all the reviews these are great for water bottles soda cans and starbucks cups i have not had any problems with them bought a second one for passenger side no problems with spilling,37,35
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,pretty sturdy easy to install seems to do the trick looks alright too,11,36
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,was made of cheap plasic and did not look like the picture only had two mounting holes and snapped when my x large tea from thestation was placed in it and went over a speed bump crack,38,37
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,received not as pictured would not work for me,9,38
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,wish these came in aluminium as the plastic is kinda flimsy with larger drinks also wish this was slightly bigger as drinks like route 44s from sonic do not fit at all,32,39
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,work perfectly can hold a large cup without any problems after getting coffee all on the inside of my windshield and down my left left on the first bump although i recommend always keeping it covered,36,40
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,do not expect to receive the same product like the one in the picture what you are getting instead is a really cheap drink holder with only 2 screws instead of 3,30,41
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,good utility to hold cups long-term use the jury is still out looks good and fits perfectly,17,42
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,just wish it was metal the plastic flexes alot,9,43
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,the picture shows a cup holder that mounts to all 3 screws and it looks metal the one you get will only mount to the top screws and it will be flimsy plastic,33,44
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,not what i expected looking for a rigid heavy duty cupholder for my truck this is a flimsy plastic wannabe,20,45
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,it hold cups but i was under the impression there was a place to put it really no where on a 79 cj5 dash without blocking something maybe put on the roll bar in the back,36,46
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,works well i actually thought it would be more heavy duty and for some reason i thought it looked like powder coated steel it is not it is just plastic i have it mounted in my cat skidsteer and it has been holding up to the jarring abuse so far and it does the job,53,47
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,will work fine but will break if misused it is plastic,11,48
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,very low quality plasticdoes not look like the photo very misleading,13,49
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,what a piece of junk not as pictured and made of plastic,12,50
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,does not properly fit an 85 cj7 jeep,8,51
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,i did not read the description well at all but this is the best looking faux metal cup holder made if only they spent the time to make it out of sheet metal instead also the picture shows 3 mounting holes instead the one i received only has 2 plastic things like this do not belong on jeeps,56,52
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,not for newer jeeps apparently which lack screw areas to install so not for jks i have 2014 wrangler can still install using a bolthole from passenger grab bar just one screw about 1 inch sheet metal type if tight enough this one screw will secure cupholder pretty well holder just ok plastic with significant flex or bounce no top on the drink you will be wearing the drink ps manufacturer does specify fits earlier jeep but i do not think amazon does,83,53
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,i think it is awesome works great it is fairly strong so it can hold a heavy drink,16,54
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,love this gives me somewhere to put my drinks in my cj not so sure if it would hold a 40 oz beer but it shall hold a 12 oz like gold,29,55
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,who ever came up with this design my hats off to no more coffee cup flipping out of the cup holder of jeep center console if you own a jeep you know what I am talking about,36,56
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,does not fit a jeep cj-7 would require removal of dashboard,11,57
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,I have already bought 4 of these for my jeeps looks good easy to install a,15,58
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,look at it then make you own that fits your container,11,59
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,i really wanted to like these but they are really just too small to fit most cups into a can or water bottle fit fine but big fast food cups do not,32,60
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,bought a second one for my cj7 works great,8,61
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,if you are in a jeep and your suspension is a bit stiff like mine i would not recommend purchasing this little guy it seems convenient upon first glance and it is quite cheaper than purchasing a center console although the material is quite flexible and bends with every bump thus giving any drink without a lid a small chance of success for surviving the journey of say driving to work,69,62
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,would be cool but it does not work if you have your dash pad I shall take my hula girl over a cup holder any day,24,63
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,i should have read the reviews i assumed it was metal since it is designed for a jeep the two mounting holes do not fit in an 87 yj the doors will not close when they are actually on i only gave two stars as i thought it looked cool with the rhino liner style plastic,53,64
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,i love it installed in my tool box works great,10,65
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,works great to have a cup holder in a jeep,9,66
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,very cheap plastic that blocks the wing window on the hard doors since it is plastic it vibrates so much that my coffee will jump out of the cup going down the road great concept terrible execution,38,67
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,we installed two rugged ridge cup holders in our vehicle with ease we have found cups that fit tight and we have not had any spills,26,68
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,nowhy anyone would complain after buying these es they only have two mounting holes instead of the three shown but the two hold just fine it is ruggedized plastic which it says in the description and they have ridges under the arm to help make them more sturdy unless your trying to carry excessive weight in them they will last pretty good for a cheap cup holder,69,69
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,this is a cheep flimsy plastic product rugged ridge should be ashamed to put there name on this it will break so easy do not buy unless you like buying junk,31,70
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,they show a picture of a cup holder with the cup holder above the three 3 screws holding the cup holder what i get in the mail is a cup holder which is even with the screws of which there are only two 2 screws holding the holder not what i ordered it is not stable with only two screws i guess that is why they show a 3 screw model which is what i ordered,74,71
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,fits both sides of my cj7 perfect works with all different size cups nicely happy with the product great cup holder alternative to an expensive console,26,72
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4,positive,i was a little let down that this was not metal but it works great just the same i put in in my 95 jeep and it has been great to finally have a cup holder,36,73
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,this cup holder fullfilled my expectatives the material is not metal but it is not nessesary as accomplish with my necessity keep the beer save jaja,26,74
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,the picture of theshown is what i wanted but received a similar but differentwhich will not work i am disappointed but hopefully will find a use for it,31,75
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1,negative,i purchased for installation on a dozer it was fairly expensive and is thin plastic i am not sure it will hold up,23,76
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,easy to install and very durable would buy again for any jeep you can tell it would last for a very long time also it arrived very fast,28,77
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,this is a greatbut with it installed you can no longer open the wing window it is kind of a bummer because i use the window quite a bit i am going to mount it using some self tapping screws away from the window so i can use them both at the same time,55,78
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,these exact holders used to be made from metal i wish I had seen they cheapened the product and now make them from plastic i assume that one will break within the year i have low expectations which is too bad because a couple friends have the exact one except made from metal and they are pretty much indestructible these plastic ones are not,63,79
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5,positive,does not hold a lot of weight but it supports at least a soda / beer can easily so what can you say other than it is a cup holder that works in a yj well,33,80
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,these are yup you guessed it junk they are cheaply made i ripped two of mine trying to install them and they are not universal junk product do not buy these,30,0
Automotive,B001TLITTI,2,negative,the seat covers were very nice looking i got plenty complaints but they do not last long they tear up not good material at all,25,1
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,i like these seat covers a lot i mainly got them to protect my light covered seats i did not really care for the colors but they are very useful the only thing i do not really like is that you have cut holes for the covers that go in the back for the seat belts,54,2
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,awesome totally transformed the look of my car tight fit,10,3
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,descriptions were for lexus-ls430 2006 but when i received the cover they are too small spend money to go to car dealer who were not able to put seats on also none of the covers had accommodating opening for my cay feafures,42,4
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,fast delivery excellent quality it is always looks new it does not wrinkle or out of place as if it is the original seat upholstery,23,5
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,better than i expected very good quality also perfectmatch for the interior of my vehicle,17,6
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,bought these for my niece and they are of good quality back seat covers harder to get on but that is the norm leather like material protects from liquid damage can not say how long they will she has only had them for three weeks if they hold up for a year we will be happy,56,7
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,these seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 toyota camry this camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered,33,8
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,these seat covers are pretty darn cool actually it was not that difficult to install at all the only complain is that it does not quite fit my back seats there is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat,45,9
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,great product and makes my suv look brand new,9,10
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,very low quality said it fits and did not,8,11
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,even being extremely careful and following exact instructions which are lacking greatly in detail they have ripped twice first set and then the replacement set and the 2nd set the primary strap that holds it in place broke great look great price but being gentle and careful when installing i would not buy again,53,12
Books,7487223,5,positive,charles cummings the hidden man is certainly the finest espionage novel I have read while i love the works of littell deighton greene mccarry ignatius and le carre as well as cummings own a spy by nature the hidden man is unique in how effectively it deals with the effects of cold war espionage on very ordinary people the main characters in cummings novel are not spies ambassadors or diplomats but a businessman and an artist nor does cumming succumb to having them turn into james bond history simply reaches into their lives and unravels them even one is not interested in that particular theme one will be treated to a fast engrossing drama by page fifty cumming has amassed so much intruiging plot with remarkably little prose,127,0
Books,7487223,5,positive,once you have read all of john laclare your man is c cumming you will thank me and devour his books keep them coming chuck and thanks for resurrecting the hidden man,32,1
Books,7487223,4,positive,this is one of charles cummings early books which has only recently become available on us kindle it is a tense satisfying story of dysfunctional father-son and brother-brother relationships that become enmeshed in an mi5 investigation into a russian organized crime family as anyone who has ever read any of gerald seymours books knows whenever amateurs get involved in the world of espionage and organised crime the outcome is rarely a happy one you hope that they will emerge safely but deep down you know that they will not once you know that this is one of cummings early efforts you do feel that the degree of cynicism that comes through in his alec milius stories is still in it is early stages of development here but the way in which mi5 and mi6 fail to even talk to each other let alone cooperate and the fatal consequences this has feels all too real if this is one of cummings books you have not yet read then it is definitely worth your while filling in that,175,2
Books,7487223,5,positive,although the plot suffers from too much coincidence and too much omniscience amongst the cast it is still a good read a bit of it is time but that is actually well done,32,3
Books,7487223,2,negative,not his best i can see why this novel was not released prior it is not a fully developed suspense thriller probably cummings weakest to date,26,4
Books,7487223,2,negative,i will never read another book by this author i will also be more selective in what i choose to read the ending ruins a fine novel of espionage brother ben a main character in totality simply disappears by the failure of the ending goodbye mr cumming,54,5
Books,7487223,4,positive,a very cynical look into the british secret service but considering the time frame 2003 who could expect any less cc writes great books,24,6
Books,7487223,1,negative,boring beyond words two bungling whining brothers spend more than five indeed pages whining about their father the murders spying plot have no motivation an unsatisfactory ending trash it,29,7
Books,7487223,1,negative,i expected more from cumming this rehashing of an old novel is not worth the read there is a reason this book was never published in america until now it does not work,31,8
Books,7487223,1,negative,highly disappointing not at all in the same league as some of his other books,15,9
Books,7487223,4,positive,although i liked his two alec milius books fast-paced and easier to follow better all cummings spy thrillers are fun changes of pace his characters are always well-drawn and intriguing as he ably puts his everyman heroes in challenging situations this tale of two estranged sons seeking the truth of their hidden man dad leading to friction between the brothers as the russians more business than political spies here play divide and conquer satisfies,78,10
Books,7487223,5,positive,cummings writes good solid mysteries and i like that enjoy reading his books,13,11
Books,7487223,1,negative,the worst book i have purchased from amazon can i obtain a credit,14,12
Books,7487223,2,negative,i had enjoyed other books by charles cumming bu this one was a big disappointment the plot felt contrived to me and the ending was predictable the brothers in the story are not very interesting or believable i am one of four sons and their interaction is unrealistic and not that interesting a big yawn think i will put mr cumming aside for a few years,66,13
Books,7487223,4,positive,he just gets better and better at last after early le carre we have a new gold standard for this genre,21,14
Books,7487223,4,positive,suspense and intrigue in modern day i did enjoy this one,11,15
Books,7487223,5,positive,excellent thriller that keeps you on theof your seat you feel as although you know the characters and they develop along with the plot,26,16
Books,7487223,4,positive,i thought the ending didn t go far enough with ben s life i would recommend it to others although the book was in good condition,24,17
Books,7487223,5,positive,exciting and interesting i love this author and have read every book he has written looking forward to his next book,21,18
Books,7487223,5,positive,need to be on the tips of your toes to keep up with the constant switches but worth it one might even develop looking-over-the-shoulder-syndrome,24,19
Books,7487223,2,negative,does not stand comparison with lecarre thin plotting poor character development in no way driven by the logic of the story,21,20
Books,7557787,4,positive,i found the snow queen to be equa l lll i found the snow queen to equal the high quality i have come to expect in cunninghams writing the story offers an insight into humanity being tested in very trying circumstances iil tow trytqueen t,45,0
Books,7557787,2,negative,i guess I am old-fashioned but i do not enjoy reading about dope addicts i like his writing style very much but not the subject matter,24,1
Books,7557787,4,positive,i would give this one 3 1/2 stars but amazon will not let me i love cunninghams writing style and enjoyed this read but it was not my favorite as it felt like a rather thin plot still anything from such a great author is still better than 90 of everything else out there flesh and blood was much better you should definitely read that,64,2
Books,7557787,4,positive,a book with interesting albeit quirky characters fun to read and get involved with,14,3
Books,7557787,1,negative,oh my this book was so hard to read in fact i gave up halfway in i did not care what happened to the characters and had nowhere the book may be going my book club agreed it was awful it was depressing and not in that tug-at-your-heart stick-with-you-and-change-you sort of way,54,4
Books,7557787,5,positive,another gem from cunningham if you liked the hours you will be pleased with his latest work,17,5
Books,7557787,1,negative,kiminsa i kept reading and reading and reading and thinking something would happen i was wrong this is lovely writing masking a nonexistent story in which nothing happens to people about whom i could not care less,37,6
Books,7557787,1,negative,i have read all cunningham books i really did not like this hopefully the next one it will be better,20,7
Books,7557787,4,positive,i have enjoyed all of cunninghams novels they are not masterpieces but are well written with good character development good imagery and intelligent insights this one did not disappoint and was a delight to read and a very quick read,39,8
Books,7557787,1,negative,too hard to read i very rarely want to put a book down but i wanted to put this book down several times,24,9
Books,7557787,4,positive,nice read fast shipping and good price arrived in good condition,11,10
Books,7557787,5,positive,an interesting read that awakens the senses and challenges the intellect the exploration of the relationships of the characters is extraordinary cunninghams mastery of language is what brings me again and again to this author like each novel from this author the snow queen is impossible toaway from once you have read the first page the character of beth is the heart of the story but one is drawn to each of the characters in a different way i highly recommend this book in fact all of this authors work,92,11
Books,7557787,5,positive,michael cunningham is a genius i do not say this lightly i never write these online reviews in fact this is my first i have read and re-read cunninghams work and i go back to his language again and again simply because it is so beautiful i highly recommend,48,12
Books,7557787,4,positive,compelling story line strongly drawn characters moving yet dispassionate there is so much to recognize in tyler the purpose of his life remains an elusive quest the book opens a window onto the enigma of being alive and in love it offers no obvious solution,45,13
Books,7557787,4,positive,as with all cunningham novels a challenging and worthwhile read,10,14
Books,7557787,2,negative,i had not read any other of michael cunninghams other books except for the hours so i thought i would try this one although well written i just found it extremely drab and a story that did not go anywhere,39,15
Books,7557787,4,positive,this is a book that returns to your thoughts for a long time the struggle of ordinary people to find meaning and hope i wil read it again cat,29,16
Books,7557787,1,negative,i was disappointed in the content because the detailed descriptions of both homosexual and bi-sexual activities did little to promote the rather thin story line actually i can not rememeber a book which has disappointed me more,36,17
Books,7557787,1,negative,very disappointing book I am do nt know what this book was about it had a beginning a middle and end that is the best i can do for this book the character development was very poor the subject matter very depressing i kept on read hoping to be introduced to the snow queen to no avail over all a bad read,60,18
Books,7557787,5,positive,i loved this book it is not the kind of book you can really describe you just have to feel it as you read i loved these brothers and their friends and would have followed them around for another three hundred pages at first you think it will be a quiet story and then you are pulled into a complicated spiritual domain a world of mystery love ambition and even wonder then there has the language there are words I had never seen used in sentences before words i had to look up and then marvel at the construct some paragraphs read like poetry humorous laugh outloud poetry other times serious if there has such a thing as a true literary novel this is it,120,19
Books,7557787,4,positive,the novel takes a while to get into but once you read on the prose is beautiful,17,20
Books,7557787,1,negative,love every other book by michael cunningham and i am very glad he chose a different way to produce art but it is just not for me i could not follow the multiple hipster characters and did not really care about them maybe that was the point,46,21
Books,7557787,4,positive,the novel is really quite philosophical although i did not think of that as i was reading the title and the prologue a quote from an hc anderson tale suggests that our surroundings are that of a beautiful but unyielding landscape an absolutely frozen lake the novel suggests how different characters in 21st century bushwick brooklyn adjust to such an environment some find escape through alcohol and other drugs one longs for a kind of transcendence a need to believe that there is a power out there that is aware of what we do some try to stay forever young one considers suicide the best we can do is follow the example of the two brothers now middle-aged at the center of the novel who look out for one another their mother had understood the nature of our world and years earlier had sworn each of them separately to look out for the other,153,22
Books,7557787,1,negative,could not get into this book at all,8,23
Books,7557787,5,positive,michael cunningham is at his best in this gorgeously written intimate portrait of two brothers and their close-knit group of friends and lovers set in new york city this contemporary tale follows the lives of two brothers who are very different from each other and yet very closely connected cunningham is a master at breathing life into his characters each one unique original deeply flawed and totally sympathetic I have read all his books and this one is a favorite in some ways reminiscent of the hours the authors intertwining of his characters less-than-perfect and often painful lives carries the reader through the difficult sad events of the story these people are bound to each other by a profound love and caring for one another and also by a communal sense of hope which i interpreted as a metaphor for the childhood belief in the existence of a benevolent snow queen,148,24
Books,7557787,4,positive,interesting character analysis but the story does not come together in a meaning way,15,25
Books,7557787,2,negative,this was so boring that i quit reading it seemed pointless characters were not well developed i could see some of the same plot lines from the hours would not recommend as a good read,32,26
Books,7557787,2,negative,i was disappointed i like michael cunningham but i found his characters unlikeable and they truly did nothing during the entire novel beth was sweet but not a large part of the story,33,27
Books,7557787,2,negative,this is really well written prose but i just never got involved i almost did not finish it but pushed on to the end to see if i could get more engaged it never really happened i know that michael cunningham is reputed to be a good author but it just was not for me,53,28
Books,7557787,4,positive,the writing is beautiful and for that alone i would recommend it here are living breathing characters not the movers and shakers of the world not people who will ever really reach success in life and yet i cared about them the entire book read like poetry to me and it seemed so real,54,29
Books,7557787,1,negative,dull dull dull stereotypes abound trite contrived notion of some vague blue light over the park an internal struggle with an external who cares all over it the hours was cunninghams shining triumph he is slowly devolving this is the worst one yet i could not finish it my husband did finish it and considered a waste of perfectly good time in which he could have been reading other things i do not recommend it at all to anyone,81,30
Books,7557787,2,negative,could not finish it gave up halfway through lifeless characters leading rather listless directionless lives at least as developed by cunningham endless descriptions of nothing of any interest you know like sidewalks unkempt apartments and more that did not take me anywhere as a reader not good reasons to read a book not my first cunningham book just the first i could not finish,57,31
Books,7557787,5,positive,michael cunningham is a rare writer beautifully felt beautifully expressed,10,32
Books,7557787,2,negative,a book about nothing i really wanted to like this as i loved cunninghams past work save your money,19,33
Books,7557787,2,negative,so self-consciously artful and faux serious as to be difficult to plow through even for a relatively short and light but not lighthearted work,24,34
Books,7557787,4,positive,good not his best but richly written and well paced,10,35
Books,7557787,1,negative,i began this novel with high expectations but was barely able to finish it perhaps i was missing something but i never engaged with the characters who were mainly self-indulgent 30-something has living in new york the opening lines with a vision appearing over central park seemed to promise an interesting read but this was not fulfilled in the rest of the book,62,36
Books,7557787,1,negative,i could not get into this book after reading the first 100 pages i discontinued reading it it seemed to be well written but just did not capture my attention,30,37
Books,7557787,1,negative,pretentious shallow overly intellectualized pointless meandering some interesting character development,10,38
Books,7557787,2,negative,mr cunningham is one of my generations best writers but this slight story about gen xers who can not find themselves is just basically pointless the hours a home at the end of the world and specimen days all show his strengths as a writer who knows human compassion and has a gift for beautiful / inspiring language but this novel is as aimless as it is characters yes boomers were just as lost as these characters but the theme is tired and transcendence is very hard to make interesting in a novel i will continue to buy his works but look forward to another novel about the people and themes i can relate to in his works mainly boomers who still have not lost the dream of a better world outside the smug milieu of a big city,133,39
Books,7557787,4,positive,he has a great senstive writer i love his work,9,40
Books,7557787,5,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed michael cunninghams the snow queen i had nowhat it was about but decided to take a chance it a very good it was a study a family and it is problems very thought provoking,38,41
Books,7557787,5,positive,michael cunningham is not stingy with words quite the opposite but i did not want this beautiful book to end and it will think about these complicated and vivid characters for a very long time he takes real chances and uses almost flying trapeze-like paragraphs to weave his story you need patience and grace when reading this book it is not easy but that is what i love about cunningham,68,42
Books,7557787,1,negative,very unrewarding there were passages that were quite lovely but overall it was huge disappointment hardly worth the time it took to read it,24,43
Books,7557787,5,positive,michael cunningham is such an excellent writer i feel i really know the characters in snow queen his descriptions are so articulate but not overly lengthy i highly recommend this book,31,44
Books,7557787,4,positive,i liked the snow queen i either disliked the characters or did not get to know enough to either like or dislike them it felt like being at a party and thinking is there anyone in the room i might enjoy yet i stayed with the snow queen and was glad i did michael cunningham did a great job of depicting new york in the beginning of the 21st century and of making his characters come to life if not to like but i wrote that already i also enjoy the way he writes dialogue my only in my eyes major criticism is his choice of vocabulary i found myself asking could not it have been a little less pretentious,118,45
Books,7557787,4,positive,i found the development of the characters in the snow queen most beautifully written also the author offered very good descriptions of a certain type of new york living not to much happens in this story and yet so much happens michael cunningham tells this so well,47,46
Books,7557787,4,positive,michael cunningham creates beauty with our language i loved the prose but i did not really find his characters or story line terribly fascinating,23,47
Books,7557787,2,negative,this story of two brothers meanders with no true conflict or resolution frankly i never cared much about the characters,20,48
Books,7557787,4,positive,i am so in awe of how beautifully michael cunningham puts words together that i find myself embarrassed to even write anything about his work my four stars here is relative to his other work which i have found more moving than the snow queen but please do not misunderstand that to mean that this is not as good or worthwhile i found myself a little disappointed with the ending which i found somewhat fizzled rather than ended and left me wondering what i was supposed to think / feel but that is quibbling about a book with such richness such depth and intelligence and such passionate writing,103,49
Books,7557787,4,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the writing very elegant and at times breathtaking however i never came to care for the characters and the ending left me very indifferent i love books that leave me wanting more or that make me sigh and close my eyes when it ends this was not the case,52,50
Books,7557787,2,negative,generally love his writing but this book was slow inane and boring did not care about the characters plot was thin / non-existent,20,51
Books,7557787,1,negative,i kept reading in hopes of discovering a plot concept and the i got to acknowledgements and wonder what no ending very disappointing,25,52
Books,7557787,4,positive,i enjoy michael cunnninghams novels this was not as quite quirky as his others but still with surprises,20,53
Books,7557787,4,positive,michael cunningham mesmerizes with the thoughtful elegant prose that is this book the reader becomes so close to it is characters the reader feels what these brothers feel beautiful and tragic a book that will stay with me for a long long time thank you again mr cunningham the hours remains at the top of my list and the snow queen is another gift to your readers,64,54
Books,7557787,1,negative,i really liked a home at the end of the world and the hours but i could not finish this book which is really rare for me who can read a paragraph like this with all it is parenthetical information a time-snap their mother reclines on the sofa which is here now right here in their bushwick living room smoking cheerfully bleary on a few old-fashioneds barret likes her best when she drinks it emphasizes her aspect of extravagant and knowing defeat the wry amused carelessness she lacks when sober when she has forced by too much clarity to remember that a life of regal disappointment while painful is also chekhovian grave and rather grand barrett is nine his mother looks at him with drink-sparked eyes smiles knowingly as if she has got a pet leopard lying at her feet and says you are going to have to watch out for your older brother you know could not it just be a time snap their mother reclines on the sofa smoking cheerfully bleary on a few old-fashioneds barrett is nine his mother looks at him with drink-sparked eyes and says you are going to have to watch out for your older brother you know,198,55
Books,7557787,2,negative,there are many beautiful insights in this work about what it is like to grow up and be happy with who you are independent of anyone else in all honesty although i was really disappointed with this novel and grateful that it was short i am still trying to pull out some enlightening metaphors from the work and figure out what i missed but this is wishful thinking on my part wanting to see more from what is not there to read full review visit [ ],85,56
Books,7557787,5,positive,i love words a novel using beautiful poetic language holds my attention until the very end and when the end comes I am sorry that it is over,26,57
Books,7557787,5,positive,my curiosity and compassion for these characters deepened with every page cunningham channels a bit of virginia woolf here in the beauty of his language and his elegiac evocation of the random details that add up to life,38,58
Books,7557787,5,positive,have not finished loving it would make great film his writing is like a screen play great summer reading as inhis books new york plays a role,26,59
Books,7557787,4,positive,who could deny mr cunninghams literary gifts not i who barely passed a creative writing class that said this book is filled with so much descriptive prose that whatever narrative there is moves at a snails pace and i felt bogged down by all the well-chosen and considered words as well as by the characters with one exception who seemed to live life on the fringes of their exquisite sensitivity i would call this novel contemplative or meditative many scenes had great visual impact and i wished that i had bought the book rather than the kindle version which has the tendency to propel the reader forward rather than encourage lingering,112,60
Books,7557787,4,positive,this book is about the relationships of 4 people they are all unusual the writing is great and the story is very strange almost other worldly,28,61
Books,7557787,4,positive,this story was written so well the enjoyment of the authors style superseded the story line the clumsy insertion of a political opinion was unfinished within the works the intimate workings between close siblings and their friend liz was compelling the story seemed to end unfinished,46,62
Books,7557787,2,negative,i found this book to be disappointing the writing style was hard to read and the characters not fully developed,20,63
Books,7557787,5,positive,a quiet book with gorgeous writing a wonder of a read michael cunningham is a superlative writer an american treasure,20,64
Books,7557787,2,negative,in michael cunninghams earliest books he wrote to tell a story he wrote beautifully and movingly but to propel the story in his recent books although my sense is that his writing has gotten progressively more showy more hey-look-at-me-I am-a-really-serious-writer too bad especially in this book all that showiness just entombed the story,53,65
Books,7557787,5,positive,i am a long time cunningham fan and this book is as eloquently written as his other works strong similarities to a home at the end of the world if i had a physical copy it would be soaked with highlighter i only wished it was longer,47,66
Books,7557787,2,negative,i was browsing the library and saw this book on the new releases shelf the cover and title caught my eye so i figured identification give it a shot i have to say i was disappointed I am not familiar with michael cunningham writing i only saw the movie the hours and the middle of the book the writing was not too bad there were moments i wondered if i would bump this book up from what i had categorized it as just tolerating it but towards the end the novel definitely waned physically it is a short book but it is not short cunningham is a sophisticated writer but the book was almost too metaphorical for me it reminded me of play / book the raisin in the sun which was not one of my favorite bookstoo much symbolism and the mundane set of character in the same dreary setting throughout most of the book it did not inspire me i would not recommend this book,162,67
Books,7557787,2,negative,interesting story line but format somewhat distracted and chaotic also left leaning political diatribes are interspersed in the text and are completely out of context without any necessary purpose,29,68
Books,7557787,5,positive,such incredible writing michael cunninghams book so touched me it is inspiring to read such a well written absorbing novel,20,69
Books,7557787,4,positive,i have read all of his novels and through teaching he has learned a greater craft having grown up in new york city i have experienced the awful lure of the energy of an oncoming train in reading cunningham you become aware of the draw of an open window to fall or to fly,56,70
Books,7557787,5,positive,i love the way michael cunningham is able to weave a story about characters who are caught in the paradox of life in the midst of death without sounding preachy or smug like most of us barrett liz and tyler are searching for some kind of transcendence but it is the narration cunninghams ethereal language that pulls his readers into the thoughts of his characters and their need to find that elusive unnamed something that drew me in i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would read it again,89,71
Books,7557787,1,negative,i do not know which was worse the plot which took quite awhile to discern or the writing which was confusing i began to read this while i was at the beauty salon and i remarked to my stylist i sure hope i did not pay a lot for this book because it is pretty bad well sad to say i did pay a lot for this book in my opinion and i kept reading it after i got home hoping that maybe it was one of these situations that sorted itself out as you read along not the case for me my expectation was well i do not know now what it was i guess i thought that if i had seen the light that i would have made some sort of change in my life or that at least if an author was going to write about an experience like this that we would have been able to hear about a change i read 3 - 4 books a month and this is the first time i have ever given a one-star rating now i am sure others disagree and perhaps i just missed the point of the book entirely,196,72
Books,7557787,5,positive,i love all mr cunningham novels and i am always eagerly awaiting the next one this being said the snow queen is very gripping i the two brothers are linked by what their mother said and then later on in life they are linked by the girlfriend sickness and maybe her sacrifice which liberates them i could not put it down,61,73
Books,7557787,5,positive,the revelation of tyler and liza was the icing on this most beautiful of gluten-free cake and for those who love,24,74
Books,7557787,4,positive,readers who enjoy finely written prose are those most likely to enjoy reading michael cunninghams novel the snow queen set in hip brooklyn the novel presents the contemporary life of a closely knit non-traditional family protagonist barrett meeks shares an apartment with his brother tyler who lives there with his lover beth barrett and beth work together in the vintage shop of another character liz whose current paramour is more than twenty years her junior there has a yearning among all these characters for coolness and meaning yet their behavior remains more adolescent than adult after being dumped by another boyfriend barrett pauses in the park to look up and observes a light than both captures his attention and disturbs him is this the light that erases the feelings of darkness beths cancer draws all the characters away from themselves and toward understanding rating four-star i like it,147,75
Books,7557787,5,positive,this was a visually impactful read for me the characters were developed well and the story was contained in a way that was easy to follow the ending insists that you pay attention to the details so you can draw your own conclusions about what might happen next a bit sad but not mawkish i liked that i lost myself in the story and that the imagery lingers,68,76
Books,7557787,2,negative,so much internal dialogue so little plot and character development no surprises and an ongoing past political diatribe that does not advance the plot where is the voice from his amazing early story snow angel from a prize-winning author of literary work i expect more,44,77
Books,7557787,1,negative,the book started with a very interesting well-written premise barrett one of the main characters unexpectedly sees an otherworldly light and that seemed to tie in with the title and i thought i was in for an interesting read how wrong i was the books interesting well-written start really had nothing to do with the rest of the book the title had nothing to do with anything in the book the snow queen tries to meander through the lives of it is four main characters but it all struck me as pointless these people are tiresome there has very little plot some of the sentences are nice but that alone can not save this,112,78
Books,7557787,1,negative,I am baffled that people enjoyed this book it was very short but seemed endless as the insufferable characters thought in circles always about themselves i made it through to the end but it was a close call,37,79
Books,7557787,1,negative,i usually enjoy much of michael cs books but this one forget it the characters are dull self indulgent losers except for one saint like heroine about whom we know very little except that she is dying of cancer i made myself finish this book hoping there would be some amazing denouement that would save it there was not there is one moment in the book when one thinks one of thecharacters is about to kill himself unfortunately he does not,79,80
Books,7557787,1,negative,i kept reading and reading finally 3/4 in gave up is it because i am old that i just did not see anything of interest in this book maybe i missed it in the last quarter which i did not finish,39,81
Books,7557787,4,positive,i was not sure when i began to read it that i would keep reading and then it unfolded in an interesting way and i grew to like it and look forward to continue reading it very much to my mind characters and situations of the moment that so many can in so many ways relate to and think about while reading,62,82
Books,7557787,5,positive,a successful novel uses language to create a credible world that is peopled by characters about whom i find myself caring cunninghams novel does all that his words are exquisite evocative and selected with precision his mid-2000s brooklyn is depicted with all it is tedium charm and grit his characters although flawed are sympathetic this is not a novel of immense action lofty ideas or seismic moral teachings it is much more a slice-of-life tale albeit seasoned with dashes of mysticism spirituality and pathos a great read,86,83
Books,7557787,5,positive,i stayed up all night reading wonderful rich prose almost like poetry it is a story of a few moments in time in the lives of 3 people and their few friends there really is not a plot which is refreshing just their story highly recommended to anyone that enjoys good literature,52,84
Books,7557787,2,negative,I have been a fan of michael cunningham for a very long time and have met him at readings in washington and provincetown i was very much looking forward to his new book i started and have only gotten to page 12 and am not sure i can make it the rest of the way the problem is those long endlessly convoluted sentences that go on and on and on and on and on it is turned reading into plodding I shall keep going as long as i can but i fear it is not going to get any better very sad since i have enjoyed most of his previous books very much perhaps he needs to get out his copy of strunk and white and give it another read,126,85
Books,60746955,2,negative,in nf clancy uses too many acyromens and leaves too much to the reader to figure out on there own nf does not tell you how the vr works or give you a good concrete villian that you really like to hate like in past clancy books maybe the new childrens versions will be worth a peek but if it is anything like this book count me out,66,0
Books,60746955,2,negative,the detailed research and realism that tom clancy brings to his other fiction titles seems to be lacking here the net of 2010 being a hash of weak acronyms and forced-sounding slang that is supposed to convince us these net-riders are hip it may just be that where william gibson and neal stephenson get to make it all up clancy and pieczenik are not making as drastic aforward a solid premise and interesting concepts as the selkie suffer from limited exploration and even the villain seems a bit cardboard a smattering of technical errors michaels instead of michaels virgil instead of virgil among others distract the eye from the presentation making it seem like the book was rushed out the door to coincide with the abc made-for-television production there are at least two net force juvenile titles out but i wonder how well the titles will fly with the real net-savvy kids out there,154,1
Books,60746955,2,negative,appearently tom clancy has been reading william gibson this reads like a gibson novel but not quite with all the pizazz the rest of the book is classic tom clancy but he could have left out his version of william gibsons version of the future nothing new here seems like mr clancy is reaching for new material and is falling short just like he did with rainbow six,68,2
Books,60746955,1,negative,full of predicable quasi stereotypes pc silliness and overblown internet wet dreams beyond this it is just plain old bad writing i suspect that this is a lot more the work of mr piecznik than it is of tom clancy i have enjoyed clancys work for some time and i found this to be a huge disappointment no real insight into the technology just pure fantasy on every level when the 2nd degree black belt man meets the small well trained women can you guess who gets beaten thoroughly it is not predictable it is downright boring do not waste your money,98,3
Books,60746955,4,positive,i enjoyed this book the new net world is fresh and the characters engaging I had sworn off the non-clancy clancy books after the last op force book but this one is good enough to stand on it is own merits,39,4
Books,60746955,5,positive,great action scary realities of todays technology makes you wonder how much of this is going on now,18,5

Books,60746955,5,positive,i enjoy all of tom clancy books i think they are great i would like to know how they get their information they are so close to what is happening in our world,33,8
Books,60746955,2,negative,i love the amazing body of work of tom clancy but this book just is not very interesting it has some interesting bits to be sure but not enough of them to carry the work some of the complex plot has holes that are too large to ignore to be generous i started the series with book three perhaps if i go back and read one and two the relationships among the large cast of characters will make more sense i hope so many if not most of clancys stand alone novels are rightly ranked in the five star range this one comes up only to a below average for the genre two stars i have avoided the spinoff books that clancy outsourced to other authors for years and it seems that i was right to do so there is a romantic interlude between a british and an american intell officer that is so forced that it is almost painful to read,161,9
Books,60746955,1,negative,not the type of story that i associate with clancy clearly sci-fi,12,10
Books,60746955,4,positive,different but good more realistic than I had like to think,10,11
Books,60746955,4,positive,a good read but a little confusing the difference between vr virtual reality and the real world in the story got a little fuzzy for me usually clancy books are easy reads this one required a little more effort since i read as a method of escape i had to work a little harder than i wanted still a good clancy book,62,12
Books,60746955,2,negative,after tom clancys original works the successor authors like this one are far below the benchmark set by tom,19,13
Books,60746955,5,positive,i have been reading the net force books since they started and i love them all,16,14
Books,60746955,5,positive,please people with the money if you buy a new book include a used one in your shopping cart that will help amazon enormously in their storage and it can help you too at some places the price can not lower to lesser a penny take a used book for a 001 anywhere it has many usage including cash4booksnet recycle it or burn it for survival heat use two books as spacers to raise your monitor because it is always better to view at eye leveled to the center of your screen even better send it to donation any library would take it or the third world too do not fear a book because it has no teeth when you open your used book wear gloves if you have to then you shall realize this book are not that bad after all good read and peace ricky,145,15

Books,60746955,1,negative,an impossible story badly written choked with descriptions of weapons and more borrrrrring,12,21
Books,60746955,1,negative,i am astonished that clancy allows his name to be attached to this juvenile disconnected piece of waste paper the only conclusion must be that he was I shall when his co-author wrote and had this published before clancy set eyes on it utter nonsense technically and totally confusing sans plot,50,22
Books,60746955,5,positive,tom clancy at his utmost best it is a honor to be able to enjoy his masterful work must read,20,23

Books,60746955,2,negative,there are moments where the book shows promise but when they switch to the virtual reality world it just loses me i really do not get why someone needs to travel around in the internet in a virtual car or motorcycle really corny,42,25

Books,60746955,1,negative,there are many better written sci-fi out there but if you are insisted on clancy I had suggest you to stick with the original jack ryan series whoever wrote this garbage in the 90s has no clue what internet is,38,28
Books,60746955,1,negative,this book messed with my head there were times when i could not tell when i was in the real world and virtual reality,23,29
Books,60746955,2,negative,the first part of the book i thought was slow and boring it did start to pick up a bit towards the middle through to the end i struggled with being truly interested but am an avid reader so i kept going it was not a memorable book i have defiantly read better written books,54,30
Books,60746955,1,negative,i am a huge op center and splinter cell fan and having read all of them i decided to try one of these boy am i sorry it will be the one and only net force i read i can not say i did not enjoy parts of the story but involving this stupid back and forth from the real world to vr was silly then add the stupid kids who helped and the book was dumb hopefully they will create a few more splinter cell and op center books to read,90,31

Books,60746955,5,positive,this series may not be written by tom clancy but you will surely get a lot of info from it from legal stuff to history to medical stuff to physics and oh yes pentjak silat,33,37
Books,60746955,4,positive,everybody likes to cry over how this is not writen by tom clancy and blah blah blah right at the bottom of the title it says created by tom clancy and steve pieezenik writen by steve perry if you can read the book at least read the credits before you whine so much after that being said this is an excellent series and i highly suggest 4 stars could have been 5 but a couple chapters were really really bad and kind of confusing it is one of those rare books that even if you are dead tired you want to get to the next chapter to see what happened next,108,38
Books,60746955,2,negative,this is the very first clancy novel I have tried and i was not much impressed basically a sidney sheldon melodrama with some science fiction tacked on also there were some unnecessary subplots that were weak and irrelevant the colonels son the agents love triangle the female monk these took theaway from what i thought was going to be a to-the-point intense scifi-thriller not a complete waste of time but not time well spent,74,39
Books,60746955,4,positive,this books actually not written by tom clancy but mostly dr pieczenik and that is the point just ignore the name of tom clancy written on it and you have got a perfect book and be sure to read hidden agendas right after this one without ha it seems to be rather incomplete,51,40
Books,60746955,2,negative,this story is out of reality at any time it has an almost love story almost fbi thriller almost futuristic almost childish and i can keep going about almost everything apart of that you can skip almost half of the book and you will understand it so to resume this review this book is a complete not almost complete waste,60,41
Books,60746955,4,positive,tom clancy is a genius at research on any topic and he excels in the futuristic world of the virtual world computer if you enjoy the science of computers the possibilities of virtual world then this is a must read it will be a scary prospect when considering rw real world against vr virtual reality but brace yourselves because clancy has hit the nail on the head if you are a fan of his writing do not miss this one,82,42
Books,60746955,2,negative,not up to clancy standards the main premise is compelling what might happen if a technological advancement were developed which could quickly break large prime number encryption upon which the security of the world depends a real theoretical possibility this premise kept me reading right to the anti-climactic end some of the characters are interesting like the russian fellow who had a great subplot going but even his ending is a letdown the 2 main love stories are tiresome detract from the main plot and take up way too much ink the virtual reality subplot is aof faith not worth reading currently reading without remorse which is much better so far,113,43
Books,60746955,4,positive,tom clancy is an amazing author we have begun to expect thrilling novels from him net force is just aabove the rest the book begins with the assassination of michael day the head of net force net force is the governments computer control agency believed by some to be ore powerful than the fbi and cia the assassination is the spider in the web of events leading to the exciting conclusion there are five main characters in this novel the selkie who is an assassin trying to take out the replacement head of net force plekhanov who is trying to take over ukraine alex michaels who is the new head of net force and toni fiorella the martial arts master this book has some very thrilling moments like ruzhyo placed the wavering crosshairs on the mans chest and he turned and saw the old lady with her cane held over her shoulder like a baseball bat ready to belt his head into the bleachers are just some of them i suggest you read this literary masterpiece it will keep you on theof your seat,188,44
Books,60746955,1,negative,I have read the spanish translation this book is very poor elemental there is no emotion no thriller some argumental threads become suddently dead I have not got any pleasure reading this book,31,45
Books,60746955,4,positive,net force by tom clancy is a fantastic and interesting novel i loved it because it is supposedly based in the year 2010 a time when computers are the superpowers of the world gee that sounds like fiction it made me wonder is congress going to create a special computer security agency within the fbi anytime soon we need someone to enforce the net laws this book got me to read again before i thought that i would never find a book that could give me the pleasure of adventure but then a friend gave me net force and i fell in love with it it reminded me of how fun reading can be who would not call a book dealing with computers causing famine chaos and death awesome and cyber terrorists crashing mainframes across the world who ever controls computers controll the world that has been true for the last 3 decades and computers are only getting started so if your the type of person who loves books about government agancies cyber terrorists sabotage assasinations famine chaos and death then net force is the book for you,186,46
Books,60746955,1,negative,save your money or read it for it is stupidity,9,47
Books,60746955,4,positive,the dragon soars above the trees the sun reflects of the multitude of scales covering the huge beasts back it is great wings stretch as they beat against the air propelling the creature forward this tom clancy created book is an easy read and is entertaining this series of books is aimed at the younger reader and takes you into the lives of a group of kids that are part of the net force explorers the explorers are a program created by net force the agency charged with fighting crime on the internet follow the groups latest adventure as they try to figure out what has going on with one of the hottest games on the internet this is an action packed story that kept me hooked until i was finished buy this book today you will not be disappointed,137,48
Books,60746955,5,positive,tom clancey is a master of putting suspense reality action futuristic worlds and thrill all into one novel the book gets of to pretty quick start set in the year 2010 when a middle eastern assassin kills the director of the net force fbis new system for crimefighting this killing causes alex michaels the new director of the net force to track down the assassin who had killed the director on his way to seeking out the assassin he finds that he himself will soon be the next target and while all this is going on there are internet terrorist and hackers who has intent is to destroy and create chaos throughout the system this is the kind of book that will make you not want to put it down and will have you asking for more,136,49
Books,60746955,1,negative,on the whole this novel may be one of the worst mass market novels ever published wasting a decent if predictable premise clancy or whoever it was who actually wrote this has concocted one of the most poorly written works produced in some time full of the worst kind of schlock cliches it is disappointing in nearly every respect to add insult to injury the attempts to authenticate the technical aspects of the book include ridiculously stylized language and a nearly incomprehensible vr environment for a fan of some of his earlier works this novel is a significant disappointment and not worth your time,106,50
Books,60746955,4,positive,tom clanceys net force is a breathlessly exciting novel undoubtedly clanceys best that i have read starting strong then it built me up to a shocking climax i could not belive it this is a really good book in the ending when the cyber-terrorists betrayed each other that was great i never saw it coming if you like sci-fi suspence then i reconmend this book to you it is really good i give it four stars,74,51
Books,60746955,2,negative,i just finished two tom clancy thrillers op center and net force were actually the worst i had ever read by him he used to write a crafted novel that was well researched and had suspense at least he has not stooped to using sex op center is slow and plodding and actually pretty dull for a bloody thriller net force has all too much blood and gore to be actually about the web the techno window dressing was put in to sell sell sell he has become a product and his books are no longer literature but formulas for the best seller list,106,52
Books,60746955,1,negative,this can not be a tom clancy book it is simply appalling frankly i was more than dissappointed i feel ripped off having wasted my time reading this until this book i was a tom clancy fan now i doubt I shall read another of his books certainly none of the net force series the plot if you can call it that is hopeless characters are 1 dimensional and the purile sub-plot about inane high school kids romance is irrelevent do not waste your time,84,53
Books,60746955,1,negative,have you ever listen to a dishonest politician speak that is the feeling i got from this audio book it is like you asked a legitimate question and he is going round and round with you and giving you stuff that is hardly relevant to the subject matter if there is a rating for minus stars i will give it the 5 stars one audio tape would have been more than enough for it tom clancy is getting greedy,77,54
Books,60746955,2,negative,well this book was okay it just did not leave up to expectation like books where people get killed in furious action do not look here like character development not here either do you like a shotty attempt at explaining what possibly the net will be like in 10 years look here one point of the book the ending is entirely anti-climatic unless you are into technothrillers aimed at preteens there is not any reason to read this if you want some true clancy pick up rainbow six or clear and present danger,87,55
Books,60746955,2,negative,theof the computer-world being brought to it is knees is an intriguing one this novel however does not begin do it justice i did not find the characters as well-rounded as other characters that have shown up in clancy novels but it could have happened if the writing team had devoted more pages to the book allowing the necessary details that were not there does every female have to be drop-dead gorgeous and every male fantastic in the use of guns unfortunately the plot suffers a lack of detail as well i rated it two stars because i did finish the book in just a few days but it was not nearly the riveting read that executive orders and others were,119,56
Books,60746955,4,positive,i started to read this book not knowing who tom clancy was or for that matter what he had wrote the title was the first thing to captivate me as i was studying computers at university the course itself was starting to get a bit mundane and since reading netforce i really woke upto what i was studying the information was very easy to digect and not to technically intimidating but still being within the bounds of reality the way in which tom describes the advancement of technology and the importance of internet security still captures my imagination some years know since reading it the action is fast paced and revolves around three storyline angles the long drawn out romabnce between the two main fbi agents takes you along a rollercoaster ride mixing in with the selkie nicely the selkie the daughter of an ira hitman who was murderd before her childhood eyes makes you do nothing but fear and admire her the book certainly makes you whant to read and read if you are interested in this area but if your not into computers as such there is still plenty of otherelements to keep you on theof you respective,204,57
Books,60746955,4,positive,most of these other reviewers are right it is not the greatest book ever written on the other hand it kept me up pretty late you kind of have to read the earlier books to find out what has going on there is a young boy that had his first heartbreak a russian man that they still have to catch from book one i think what i enjoyed best about the book was that these are starting to become old friends i would not want to read all the books at once because then it would become monotonous but like this is great,100,58
Books,60746955,5,positive,once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down great book from beginning to end what else can i say netforce takes place in the near future 2010 and computers control everything netforce which is part of the fbi is well you can call em the net cops the team works together to fight cyber-terrotists and such clancy will get you to a climax of a storyline and then switch to another storyline wanting you to rush through and get back to that other storyline you will love it trust me,96,59
Books,60746955,2,negative,although i would not consider myself a huge fan of tom clancy i have read and enjoyed some of his previous works but i would have to say that i was disappointed by this one for the most part i found the tempo to be too slow the buildup was about fifty pages too long also clancy seems to be very found of using barely disguised political opinions observations within the narrative if you are in the market for a good tom clancy book i think that red storm rising was far superior to this book,97,60
Books,60746955,5,positive,i do not read too many books but i found this one to be exciting and it made me want to keep reading i have read the book and have seen the tv mini-series the book is much better than the movie because the book gives a more detailed story line than the movie the movie is good but could have been better i highly suggest this book if you want the full net force experience go with the book rather than the audio cd or cassette due to the book is not abridged like the audio cd and cassette are,100,61
Books,60746955,1,negative,clancy can get pretty boring with his 900 page doorstops although he has written some of my favorite books patriot games hunt for red octoberthis thankfully short piece of trash should not bear his name written for the quick read it has no substance boring action and lifeless characters pick from many other great action books out there oh and the computer stuff was way off being a computer guy i spotted it caught ya tom i called my review debt force as this book reeks of getting a quick buck off the name so there must be some debts to pay,108,62
Books,60746955,1,negative,this book is devoid of clancy there is no hero the villian is vanquished by another villian who is vanquished by another villian the depiction of cyberspace patrol even in a vr world is totally unrealistic the net force team gets absolutely nowhere with their case the reading is slow the action boring and the supposed good guy loses out in the end there has even a totally unrelated side plot consisting of a petty teen relationship definately not clancys teams best clancy is know for being realistic and having done his homework this book is not worthy of that name if there were a zero star rating this book would get it,112,63
Books,60746955,1,negative,coming from the author who wrote hunt for the red october this book is down right pathetic do not waste your time reading this book also there are horrible inaccuracies in this book one example moksha is translated as enlightenment moksha actually means release from the cycle of life and death,49,64
Books,60746955,2,negative,tom clancy should fire his ghostwriter before he puts him out of business i found this book almost impossible to read the characters were bad and the plot was terrible i hope he starts taking his writing career a little more serious i pray that bear and the dragon were written by the old tom clancy,56,65
Books,60746955,4,positive,I have always been a huge clancy fan and admired the way he could take a multitude of complex plot sequences and tie them into a coherent and exciting tale his net force this book included has not let me down if you are looking for the grinding detail and intricate plot that is classic clancy although this might not be for you it you want something fun and easy to read this was great i enjoyed getting to know the characters better only drawback to this book was that it did not quite have the bite of the first and second in the series,101,66
Books,60746955,1,negative,i have to admit this is one book that i did not finish and i usually read a book all the way through whether i finish it out of duty to the author or plain stubbornness I am not sure however in this case i made an exception to my rule it should have all been there intrigue hacking and more etc but i just could not get into this book one iota i could really care less if everyone in this book gets shot and all the computers blow up and can we stop with all of the dodge automobile placements was this sponsored by dodge i just could not get all the way through this and i do not think going any further would have changed my mind I shall give it a star that is just for the premise,136,67
Books,60746955,5,positive,this book was good very good it was far better than the other two net force books net force 1 and net force hidden agendas i was reluctant to buy this at first but i enjoyed and will buy the next one if you were burned by the first net force you will like this one,56,68
Books,60746955,2,negative,i can not beleive that someone like tom clancy can actually lend his name to such drivel the research in to this book seems to have been derived from a boys mag and some of the sub plots seem rather childish the selkie is described as an utter proessional who never makes a mistake big laugh two stars for a couple of good chapters highlighting the dangers posed by cyber terrorists but all in all one for the little kids,78,69
Books,60746955,5,positive,i read this for a reading assignment and was immediately hooked I am not sure if it is part of the op-center series but if it is you would never know it mr clancy does a great job tying in the characters net force is a book anyone who likes computers would like and the lingo is not too hard to understand for those who are not into computers enjoy this is a great book,70,70
Books,60746955,4,positive,hey i work in the field of technology and computers true the net force book is fiction some reviewers may need a dictionary to understand that word but it is not far fetched i have seen similar technology being used today look what 10 years of refinement has done for computer storage media that kind of a jump can happen in vr netware in there is an external influence which drives it the book itself was excellent the relationships between toni and alex as well as tyrone and bella were right on the money sgt frenendez and col howard gave it the guts or glory energy it needed and when you finish with this book read the second in the trilogy net force hidden adendas it deserves 5 stars,129,71
Books,60746955,1,negative,i am a big tom clancy fan but just could not get into this one the net force characters were unbelievable and to my eye pretty inept the hero / main character was not likable and the plot did not pick up the ending is just that an ending again not up to tom clancys usual energy and level i would not recommend it,60,72
Books,60746955,4,positive,this is the first net force book i read and i have to say i liked it i was browsing the other comments and altough sometimes the action is slow and the yarn turns slightly childish i think the series is a good work by this talented writer i have enjoyed op-center and rainbow six to the maximum and have just ordered two more net force novels can not wait to see vr net surfing for real at the rate we are going,82,73
Books,60746955,5,positive,this book had everything a good storyline a mystery type format with tons of tech stuff about vr and assassains lots of action it hooked me in the 1st chapter when steve day got killed net force leader and this guy alex gets appointed leader and he wants revenge on his death it seems like it could happen it is a little sci-fi with the vr but it is not like way off it uses current weapons and is really good I am 12 years old and i only buy tom clancys books after i read the hunt for the red october i was a true clancy fan,105,74
Books,60746955,5,positive,after i saw the commercial on abc for the miniseries which i still have not watched yet if someone could tell me how to get a copy please email me i just had to read the book i thought it was such a great book that i read it twice another one of my favorites from tom clancy is rainbow six,61,75
Books,60746955,2,negative,why tom all the books such as sum of all fears clear and present danger and more fantastic 5 stars these net force books very poor tom you are not a romantic novelist so do not try to be one i just read 400 pages of romantic nice drivel i buy jackie collins for that also this futuristic nonsense is at best interesting and i would say boring where has the action where has the thrill where has the suspense clint eastwood was an a1 actor and all his western films and dirty harry films were a1 then he had to get all arty on us and try to do what he is not best at directing and the films he stars in are just ok not great tom clancy is following in these steps with net force and to a degree op-centre artists should stick to what they are good at and not kid the public into buying lesser grade novels just because of the writers name i have read all clancys books but this is the last one unless he goes back to writing what he is good at,190,76
Books,60746955,5,positive,i am wondering what everyone was expecting by reading a book that was set in 2010 many of you have decided the book was not realistic enough but there is absolutely no way of knowing what the future will be does the term fiction not mean anything to any of you anymore can not we still read a good book to escape the real world for a while does it all have to be true to life now if so what is the good of reading when we can walk outside and watch a murder the book was a wonderful book and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone it is fast-paced and full of descriptions of every detail,118,77
Books,60746955,5,positive,i do not know what the he shall all those other guys problem is but this book is unbeleivably intersting and not wordy and not not wordy it is right smack in the middle perfect you should read this book no matter what anyone says,42,78
Books,60746955,5,positive,this was the first book by tom clancy i have read and now he is one of my favourite authors this book is futuristic but is not quite science fiction in this there is a man called alex michaels who is chucked into a job because of his boss getting assasinated and alex must find out who did the crime while trying toa life i now really want to find the sequel but I am not sure wich book it is and if you do get a chance to read this book i would because it is brilliant,98,79
Books,60746955,1,negative,mr clancy would do well to carefully consider to whom he lends his name this has got to be one of the worst efforts yet i had trouble staying awake during the tv mini-series which resembled the novel in name only the book was much worse i would not recommend this book to anyone,54,80
Books,60746955,1,negative,i have always thought myself as a die hard tom clancey fan unfortunately all that stopped when i read this book there was absolutely no development of the plot or of the characters I am confident that most people know that created by does not necessarily mean that tom clancey is the author of the book however it would be nice to know that he might have at least read the manuscript prior to putting his name on it blatant errors such as giving a male name to a female russian secretary just is not clanceys style a total disappointment,97,81
Books,61227374,5,positive,in the gene re of detective / police novels i think that faye kellerman is the best ms kellerman writes elegantly and she does a thorough resereach of her subject matter in the mercedes coffin you get the feel for the life and language of the hip hop crowd i entertained my teenagers with some of the words that are used in the story my favorite is nomasayin it is sit at theof your chair kind of book the ending is very surprising i will not tell you more buy the book and enjoy,93,0
Books,61227374,4,positive,the mercedes coffin by faye kellerman is the seventeenth peter decker and rina lazarus mystery having read most of the preceding mysteries this is like visiting with old friends and very enjoyable peter decker is asked to investigate a fifteen year old murder that is now a cold case that of a very popular guidance counselor from a los angeles school who was found in the trunk of his mercedes shot in the back of the head execution style interest in the case has been raised because someone else has been murdered in the same fashion and found in the trunk of their mercedes faye kellerman always writes a well plotted interesting mystery and the mercedes coffin is no exception i enjoy reading about the decker and lazarus family as much as i enjoy the mystery the only fault i found with this book is that rina lazarus did not play as important a role in this book as she has in others I have read but that said i enjoyed the mercedes coffin very much and it kept me turning pages until the end highly recommended to mystery lovers,189,1
Books,61227374,5,positive,money can not buy everything but a billionaire can try when she reads about a murder genoa greeves is reminded about her high school guidance counselor who suffered death by the same mo fifteen years earlier and she is prompted to do something about it so she makes a deal with the lapd offering a million-dollar endowment if the original case is revived and solved who can resist such an offer certainly not the cash-strapped police department so the stage is set for another peter decker-rina lazarus novel and a marvelous tale it is complete with the customary references to the couples orthodox jewish beliefs and culinary tastes lt detective peter decker is assigned to the task and he quickly becomes involved in both cases with a little assistance from his detective daughter cindy the task becomes complicated with additional murders especially those of one of the original detectives as entertaining as the novel is it is intriguing in it is composition keeping the reader perplexed amid the lies deceptions and relationships among the cast of characters it is an exciting read among the series best and the twist at the end is as tasty as a raisin challa highly recommended,199,2

Books,61227374,4,positive,this wad a complex plot with many involved the need to solve two murders fifteen years apart added layers of complexity the family dynamics and work relationships add to increased options for exploring what truly happened there were many viable suspects many of whom were involved however the one who killed the original victim was a bit of a surprise all in all quite enjoyable,65,14

Books,61227374,2,negative,i was quite disappointed with this book especially the ending there were too many characters to keep track of too many rambling discussions of what might be going on in the case blah blah blah and a final wrap-up that is accomplished via a discussion between characters it was as although time ran out to get this to the publisher,61,33

Books,61227374,4,positive,i enjoy reading mysteries against the other thriller type books wish they were not lumped together on amazon kellerman keeps your interest i am working on reading all her mysteries hope she does not go into thrillers,37,44
Books,61227374,4,positive,this was my first faye kellerman book to read it will not be my last the author did an excellent job of writing this police procedural story she took the reader through a cold case with precision i will be reading more o her books in the future,48,45
Books,61227374,4,positive,the book was pretty good the dectective work was stellar once again the husband wife team and the daughter was very interesting getting peter to finally go on vacation,29,46
Books,61227374,2,negative,i found this mystery to be rather predictable i was always aahead of decker and his detectives as for the charming part of the series the relationship between rina and peter and their orthodox lifestyle there was hardly any of it in mercedes coffin as a mystery and as a window into a unique culture the book fails on both counts which does not leave much to enjoy,71,47
Books,61227374,1,negative,i have read all the decker / lazarus books and sorry but this is the one I have enjoyed least lack of action until the last few pages and then a bit implausible give this one a miss,33,48
Books,61227374,1,negative,i have been a fan of faye kellermans in the past but this book was bad the plot was boring very unbelievable overall the book was a big blah wish i would not have spent the money,36,49
Books,61227374,2,negative,the book starts off well there has a cold case of a body stuffed into the trunk of a mercedes 15 years later there has another under somewhat similar circumstances ms kellerman needed to stay focused on that premise halfway through the book the author is still introducing more characters you will need a scorecard to keep track she also gets heavily into the members and secondary characters of a punk rock band yep no kidding the dialogue becomes very repetitive and boring there are no twists at the end the ending just shows up it just did not matter by the time ms kellerman decided to end this travesty i just did not care who did it or why ms kellerman would have done well to drastically cut the length and characters to make this into a short story in it is present form it is tedious at best,144,50
Books,61227374,2,negative,i agree with many of the previous comments i read the first 3 books of the series and remember enjoying them i was pleased to notice this one at the library and was looking forward to a few hours with the appealing decker family i was not bored until the middle of the book but then i kept waiting for something interesting to happen nothing happened i skipped to the end of the book and read the denouement it was anticlimactic and i was glad that i had not bought this book even as a library read i can not recommend it,100,51
Books,61227374,1,negative,this is the most boring book I have ever read with the exception of textbooks nothing happens there is no suspense no action and the writing is awful i mean please it was the juiciest turkey sandwich he had ever eaten and the bread was very fresh I shall never read another book by faye kellerman again,57,52
Books,61227374,1,negative,i enjoy mysteries and cop dramas which this was however the book had typos in it right and left there were numerous scenes that appeared to attempt to flesh out the story line but seemed particularly useless in driving the plot the conclusion was entirely unsatisfying the denouement was boring and lackluster take my 2 cents and spend it wisely,60,53
Books,61227374,2,negative,there are few things that disappoint me more than a great story marred by poor writing i thought the premise of the book was great and it had great potential but i just could not suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the story what was up with the endless descriptions of what everyone was wearing every time someone walked in the room we got the dime store paperback pseudo blackwell fashion review he wore a blueshirt and brown slacks his wiry arms still sculpted with defined musculature orthopedic sandals were on his feet she wore a kelly green silk blouse and a pair chino pants her feet were housed in rhinestone sandals yawn so heres the other thing my guy has been a police officer for 32 years the conversations in an investigation just do not go the way they did in this book i read a couple of pages to my guy and he rolled his eyes nuff said i tried i really did i hung in all the way through but the book never redeemed itself I am a little bummed that what could have been a great story was killed by the flat writing,197,54
Books,61227374,1,negative,i really tried to like this book i did but it became increasingly obvious that without a map i would not be able to find the books direction it had too many details about too many characters it was hard to follow the plot line because of all the boring overwritten unnecessary details having just finished it about the only thing i remember is that peter was married to the always perfect rina the rest of the book was bogged down with such minutia that i was praying for a syllabus or maybe i just prayed for it to end sorry ms kellerman you just lost a reader,107,55
Books,61227374,4,positive,peter decker and rina lazarus series as the seventeenth faye kellerman book in the peter decker and rina lazarus series the mercedes coffin was a complex book that addressed the current exercise of solving of cold cases as someone that is very interested in the jewish faith i was a little disappointed that we did not see more of rina in this book the story line has peter investigating a 15 year old file of the murder of dr ben little a school vip his department was asked to look into the case because of a request received from a very wealthy woman who promises great things as a reward when a second victim is also found in the truck of his mercedes there appears to be a tie-in to the previous unsolved murder faye kellermans books always have twists and turns and solving this mystery is very complicated and takes thinking outside the box you must pay attention to what every person says who is questioned the clues are there hidden in their statements as a fan of faye kellermans decker and lazarus series i look forward to her next book,192,56
Books,61227374,1,negative,as other reviewers have noted faye kellermans latest should at best be checked out from the library or borrowed from a friend it really is that bad I am glad that I am a fast reader and did not mind wasting a sick-at-home afternoon on a mystery that was not much of a mystery with characters you remember liking but in this outing having difficulty remembering why and a plot that felt like the product of a bad computer program it is understandable that kellerman could be running out of steam on her decker-lazarus series there ve been enough of them still if you were to read the dust jacket blurb a cold case turns red hot threatening to consume everyone it touches including los angelespd detective peter decker and his wife rina lazarus in the spellbinding new thriller you would have to wonder if the blurb writer read the same book you had spellbinding thriller and poor rina is barely peripheral if you have never read one of faye kellermans books check the publication date and opt for one of the early ones at least then you will understand what the acclaim is all about,190,57
Books,61227374,1,negative,i really do not like reading faye kellerman but will do it if i am hard up for something to read which is what happened this time i think the reason i do not like her books is because reading faye kellerman is kind of like being at jesus camp for judaism by force it is not that i have anything against judaism it is just that i do not like being proselytized to or having religion constantly shoved in my face and that is what kellerman does with her constant references to orthodox judaism the family values the good woman slaving in the kitchen and sacrificing for her children and more it reminds me of accidentally picking up one of those christian fiction books and finding myself in the midst of some characters who talk about nothing except how they are postponing sex until marriage how they can be born again by giving their souls to jesus what they are wearing to the purity ball and more i wish kellerman would just tell her stories and stop trying to be the tim lahaye of judaism,177,58
Books,61227374,1,negative,I have read every single book in the peter decker / rina lazarus series as has my mother i love her books but we both gave up on this one boring boring boring i tried to slog through this one but i ended up giving up it just was not worth it if you have not read her before do not start with this one if you have you might want to pass on this one or at least do not buy it check it out of the library dull and tedious,88,59
Books,61227374,5,positive,this book was received in a timely manner and in the condition i paid for,16,60
Books,61227374,2,negative,I have been a fan of she and her husband for years while hers started out with more characterization they are quickly dwindling to weary plots dragged out dialogue and unsatisfying endings unfortunately this one fits in that category decker just comes across as ready to enter into retirement at any moment ms kellermann please bring back the passion you used to have for these characters or just give us a new character that all of us can enjoy,78,61
Books,61227374,2,negative,i had not read a faye kellerman book for many years i really enjoyed picking this one up and starting it the beginning was great then it moved so slowly that it was almost painful i had to set aside time to finish it which is unusual in a mystery the plot took a very long time to unwind and i had to admit i was not interested in any of the characters as others said i was glad i borrowed it from the library,85,62
Books,61227374,1,negative,this is the first faye kellerman book i simply could not finish after a promising start it became very confusing with all the extra characters that were simply referred to by their first names or last names without the hints that most authors give i only had a little more to read but i lost interest so much i just returned it to the library do not waste your money on this boring book,73,63
Books,61227374,1,negative,disappointing the best that can be said is i read a library copy so all i wasted was my time the beginning was great and then the book deteriorated into a complete bomb with discussion after discussion that could not have been more tedious and boring so much so that i really did not care about anything anyone skipping those discussions lost me nothing and the ending was simply too too boring incomplete dull need i go on sorry about this review as i have read the entire decker series very happily over the years will definitely give second thoughts after this one about what I shall do with the next title the supreme irony here for me is that i long ago stopped reading her husbands books for a very similar reason oh well there are enough really good writers out there that we have many other choices,141,64
Books,61227374,2,negative,I have read most of faye kellermans novels and have liked many of them especially straight into night but this one is well bad i kept laying it aside and picking up again forcing myself through the tedium when i finally made it to the last page the outcome was disappointing vague see for yourself there could be no murder conviction based on the evidence presented keeping the characters straight was a problem there are all sorts of low lifes without much to distinguish one from another then there is a great deal of extraneous material what characters wore every time they were presented a disciplining editor should have cut a hundred pages or so of fat off this the plot is not all that good either even if this were edited better kellerman tries to write a gritty police procedural but it is not up to the standards of ed mcbain or michael connelly or to kellermans previous work the grit somehow does not feel right i recommend that people skip this one especially faye kellerman fans,170,65
Books,61227374,2,negative,as others have said there are too many characters in this book each one is referred to by first name last name and often a nickname sometimes in the same paragraph there has a rudy and a ryan melinda and a marilyn not to mention cal and cal j a red herring that went nowhere and so many times i said to myself who has mudd again i love the series but the last two books have gone downhill,78,66
Books,61227374,1,negative,first and foremost i have to say that i am a big fan of the authors i have followed this series forever i was so excited to see a new novel with this cast the reality of it is that the only enjoyable part of this book was kind of catching up with the cast the whole story dragged and was so confusing with the million and one characters i found that the story was slow to develop and many times i had to re-read a section just to wrap my mind around the cast of characters there were just too many names being thrown around essentially i would say there were too many threads being pulled on at once i did not enjoy the book at all and although i am an avid reader it was like pulling teeth to get myself to finish reading it hopefully she can do better in the next installment,155,67
Books,61227374,4,positive,i especially enjoy reading books when the author has the main characters the same people in their books,18,68
Books,61227374,2,negative,i generally love these novels this one just did not hit the mark for me overly long and way too much time between beginning middle and end and the ending was not satisfactory after suffering through the book to get there,38,69
Books,61227374,5,positive,a smart mystery kellerman develops her ongoing characters with every outing in this series,14,70
Books,61227374,2,negative,i have enjoyed the decker series since the beginning what happened it is as if faye kellerman was not writing the book i have enjoyed the characters and learning about the jewish faith but something is very wrong i could not keep track of the characters i thought it was me until i read another review that said the same thing i have not even been able to finish the book although i am trying faye we love you please take note of this and bring back the old format in the next book your fans will be back i hope you are to,100,71
Books,61227374,5,positive,i am a big fan of faye kellermans books with the peter decker / rina lazuras continuing characters being my favorite while this is a fast paced intriguing who done it i was fascinated with the current day exploration of a case tied to the past ms kellermans plots and characters are always fresh with current events tied in appropriately her research and authenticity ring true for me i also find it a real treat to try to get a small glimpse into the beliefs and observances of an orthodox jewish family and i enjoy the real family values that these characters portray especially in this day and age i would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story that is exciting a bit philosophical and has a great underlying message about the importance of family i applaud this effort and greatly appreciated this book,145,72
Books,61227374,2,negative,I am a fan of fay kellerman I have totally enjoyed her decker lazarus books in the past this one should have come with a map a real big map this story grabs you from the beginning the first third meets and greats the characters but there are too many characters sometimes referred to by their first names and sometimes their last that i had trouble keeping them straight so many plots discussed over and over that i really can not even begin to explain the plot i wanted to like this book however i just wanted it to end tear out the middle third and you might enjoy it,107,73
Books,61227374,2,negative,i am a huge faye kellerman fan and have read every book in the peter decker rina lazarus series but i have to say that this is probably the last walk I shall take with these characters after reading the last book the burnt house i held out hope that this next book would be better but it was not i m glad i checked it out from the library instead of paying for it i was so incredibly disappointed definitely not recommended,81,74
Books,61227374,2,negative,sorry to have to be negative but i have read everything that faye kellerman has ever written and she is allowed to have her off days this book finishes it for me i could not keep track of all the characters the family life of rina and decker was not flushed out as i used to enjoy forget the picnic basket contents it was not worth the effort this time and i am beyond disappointed seems she is writing to the new generation and i am certainly and happily not one of them could not recommend this book i wonder did she really write it or was it a surrogate,108,75
Books,61227374,5,positive,for those of you that gave a few thumbs down to the past 2 or 3 books by this author do not give up this is the old faye kellerman with lots of action and what ifs in it this was a very good read and i recommend it the storyline was quite realistic in this day and time hannah is a teenager with all the angst that goes with it cindy is a detective and helps peter with a cold case that he was assigned,85,76
Books,61227374,1,negative,i have loved all of the faye kellerman books except this one the characters were flat and the plot even flatter it is as if she had to put this one out in a hurry it took me 8 days to read it i kept waiting for the plot to get interesting it never did,51,77
Books,61227374,5,positive,great story this is the first faye kellerman I have read but i will definitely read more of her work,19,78
Books,61227374,4,positive,fifteen years ago dr ben little a very popular school vice president was murdered execution style and found in the trunk of his mercedes the crime was never solved one of the students whose life he touched is now a very wealthy woman when she reads a current article in the newspaper about another man found dead in the trunk of his mercedes she believes the two crimes are somehow related she offers a million dollars to the lapd to take another look at the cold case the story follows lt peter decker who is assigned the task of finding dr bens killer through a maze of relationships that tie known associates to both of the murdered men the story contains a lot of layers as the puzzle pieces come together this is the first book I have read by the author i very much appreciated the mystery aspect of the story which was well thought out and was surprised at the outcome i also appreciated that triggers were pointed out to us during questioning of various people giving us a betterof what the detective got out of it instead of having it explained to us afterwards,197,79
Books,61227374,1,negative,i have read all of faye kellermans books this is the first one that i found boring i thought that it was way too complicated and could not follow the characters and plot i missed the family connections and traditions that were in her other books i thought the novel was too drawn out and had to push myself to finish it i was very disappointed,65,80
Books,61227374,2,negative,faye kellermans detective peter decker seems more like a woman with every new book a likable and competent woman the male / female contrast that we saw in the earlier novels is lacking rinas presence in this book is slight and it is okay because we do not have any need to balance peter he has gone over to our side,57,81
Books,61227374,2,negative,i have been a long-time fan of faye kellerman peter and rina and their family have been familiar characters for many years through many books this one started out with a compelling mystery two men were killed 15 years apart in a very similar manner both of them were found dead in the trunks of their mercedes automobiles peter decker tries to solve the two murders about half-way through the book the endless talking of the characters starts the detectives were working very hard trying to come up with viable suspects who had a motive to kill both men there were so many names to discuss where they went to school how they knew the murdered men where they were when the crimes were comitted what they were doing now and more for the last half of the book that is all they did discuss i was so glad to see the end of the book that I am not sure i could even tell you how these different characters were involved to quote the book the author said on page 331 that was detective work hours of mind-numbing tedium followed by that compensatory glory-hallelujah once-in-a-blue-moon shot-in-the-veins adrenaline rush i never got beyond the mind-numbing tedium,200,82
Books,61228141,5,positive,i had the chance to read this book over some time off recently just so happened i was waiting for a fine dining restaurant to open so i could start serving again after reading this very enjoyable book i felt extremely confident in jumping back in to the industry i look forward to her next offering with hopes that she will carry on in the same vein and this one,69,0
Books,61228141,1,negative,was looking forward to some behind the scenes gossip never materialized kept reading hoping it would get better truly boring,20,1
Books,61228141,4,positive,per se is a top restaurant in new york and the author started work at the restaurant prior to it is opening night and continued there for well over a year starting as a backserver she promoted up the ranks to the position of captain which is rare for females and this book is the story of her life in the restaurant as well as the people she encountered along the way the book is heavily laden with information about foods that most of us will never eat but still would love to try it also contains a wealth of information on how a top restaurant operates and how the staff behaves when the customers are not looking finally each chapter ends with a tip on how to or how not to behave in a restaurant it was a fun read and a must for every food junkie out there,149,2
Books,61228141,5,positive,damrosch describes food service and love as the arts that they are with a touch of poetry that is never heavy handed i was amazed amused and moved the slices of behind-the-scenes life at per se cheesemaking in vermont and a blossoming romance in new york city make for a very satisfying journey it almost made me want to become a waiter,60,3
Books,61228141,4,positive,this is a very readable book and kind of fun did you know that a waiter at the per se resaurant in new york city makes a 6 figure salary plus benefits do you know diners pay 20000 for a meal there occasionally the wine can cost a lot it was not clear how the sommolier knows anything she says he got menus from many restaurants and then picked the wines that appeared most frequently as being the best duhhh how would you like to eat a 20 course meal includingit sounds like fun even although some of the diners fall asleep at the table or throw up over the balcony onto the diners below and our waitress called a captain has to dress like charlie chaplin complete with bowtie daunting identification have a heart attack if i had to eat in french laundry the mother of per se which is probably even more extravagant,154,4
Books,61228141,4,positive,fabulous look at the operation of a 5 star restaurant easy to read and very captivating great inside information regarding premier chefs and newspaper reviewers,25,5
Books,61228141,4,positive,very interesting behind-the-scenes book a great read for anyone interested in the hospitality industry and especially restaurants ms damrosch is quite a good writer whose reflections and insights go far beyond what is on the plate and in the glass it is a bit of a cliff-hanger although i really wanted to know whether she has quit the restaurant business entirely in order to write or whether she is keeping her hand in and what happened with andr sequel please,80,6
Books,61228141,5,positive,very entertaining book with a lot of detailed information on ins and outs of restaurant world how staff is trained nuances of choosing a menu and more i enjoy eating out and trying different cuisines and this book definitely whet my appetite i highly recommend this book to anyone who considers him / herself as a foodie,54,7
Books,61228141,5,positive,this book will help you understand why people pay so much for food in a fancy restaurant they are paying for more than the food it is the ballet of the service by a highly trained performer one can only compare it to an evening at a broadway play that will leave lasting memories also the book serves to underscore the importance of provenance fine food comes from fine sources i learned a lot by reading this book,77,8
Books,61228141,2,negative,service included by phoebe damrosch a kindle book i started reading on august 8th while glancing to and from my knitting i had not expected so much woe-is-me indecisive chick-lit julie and julia prose from the get-go an almost immediate turn-off but hey i thought I had hold on and see if the juicier waitressy parts of the books got any better the book started to gain speed after the author landed the job with per se but spends so so much time on that same woe-is-me and now everybody-is-smarter-than-me helpless numb hapless prose that makes diners of restaurants feel like they are asking for so much without meaning to in fact i glazed over so much of her personal life this guy against that guy and her random michael pollan-like organic cheese rant to come back fresh anew and with surprised blinks at more description about the service at per se that turned out to be the real nitty-gritty the silk among the floss of this book wheedling aside lady people really want to hear more about the food,177,9
Books,61228141,5,positive,enjoyed the insiders view of high-end restaurants she has developed a nice voice combining work and private life enhances my view of this fine dining experience what has next,28,10
Books,61228141,5,positive,a very interesting behind the scenes of the best of the best fine dining esatblishments lovable characters delightful snippets of serious foodie,22,11
Books,61228141,4,positive,you will never look at waitresses and waiters and other domestic workers the same way again very interesting book loved it,21,12
Books,61228141,2,negative,i have mixed feelings about this book the behind-the-scenes look at the precise and methodical orchestration of a high-end restaurant with it is many players was really interesting and complex and showed the reader that there is a system to it is success as a hospitality industry albeit for a very select few what disturbed me was the authors frequent need to bash people who have political and philosophical ideals different than her own and which had absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand other than to expose the author as a hypocritical morality bigot it would have been so much more entertaining to read about the restaurant industry rather than to have to put up with her moral relativism republicans and diamonds are not okay but paying 20000 for a single amazing meal and people who vomit from the excess are is the per se restaurant experience art or pretense or both ruth reichls books about food and foodies and herself although way beyond my ken nevertheless drew me in and kept me entertained and wanting more phoebe damrosch however alienated me and ultimately i walked away disappointed ps I am not even a republican,195,13
Books,61228141,4,positive,i loved reading the backstory to such a famous restaurant the author did a great job of describing it she deftly handles the story of working at per se along side the story of her romance with andre,38,14
Books,61228141,5,positive,love the tips on what to do or not do in a restaurant description of the menu and behind to scenes action,22,15
Books,61228141,5,positive,i highly recommend this book i laughed and i cried her voice and writing style are intimate which makes it feel more like a conversation than a one-sided story this also provides for a very quick read which is sad because i did not want it to end,47,16
Books,61228141,2,negative,i was really excited to read this not because of some chick who wrote it because of thomas keller and his new york city restaurant it spent 75 of the time talking about her little fling with the sommelier really disappointing i t did get into the training there and that was pretty interesting if you want to read about tk check out michael rhulmans books,64,17
Books,61228141,2,negative,mildly interesting when the author is discussing food and the restaurant not so much when she has discussing her love life which is a lot of the book also her political jabs are kind of annoying and the story about eve and the condom was revolting but the strongest feeling i got from the book was what planet are these people living on it describes an environment where the pleasure of good food is elevated to an obscene and sometimes ridiculous level of snobbery,83,18
Books,61228141,2,negative,i was given this book by a colleague who knows my high level of interst in gourmet cuisine the book essentially covers two serparate things an intimate discussion of working at thomas kellers per se restaurant and unfortunately a semi-intimate discussion of the authors life story in regards to the first other than a poor ameturishly condescending writing style the information contained is really informative and interesting she provides a high degree of detail for the operation of per se which had me rivited for the second she provides a dreadfully boring insight into her totally uninteresting romantic life coupled with pointless jabs or ouright rants on her political views can she possibly think anyone cares and her convenient catgorization of people based on career appearence and more per se and thomas keller are interesting the life of a nasty sophmoric opinionated trust fund baby is certainly not,146,19
Books,61228141,1,negative,this book has way more negative reviews than positive i wish I had paid attention beause i would have saved myself a truly boiring experience the author goes from boring stories of her personal life to boring stories of her work this book promised all sorts of insiders secrets on the fancy restaurant world do not believe it,56,20
Books,61228141,1,negative,to be 100 honest i did not finish this book i tried twice but i found the writer too full of herself and there were no especially interesting insights into the restaurant world and i have to say that when i have something that is light reading i am not especially interested in political feelings it was a bargain bin book my tip is avoid this dreck,67,21
Books,61228141,1,negative,never got passed the forward where the writer said offensive to republicans well that is me so i turned if off and erased it from my kindle thank god i downloaded it from my library so the writer did not get a dime from me,45,22
Books,61228141,4,positive,poof anyone can land any job and that most pretensions are only that the higher up you go in the restaurant industry the easier and less stressful things actually are in fine dining you are apart of intrinsic team working together to provide that level of service all parts of life should be like that come to think instead of running around trying to balance many tables you are focused only upon a few although since people are simple to appease that is humans do not require a 17 course mean nor is it necessarily healthy you might say that communion with good friends over dinner and wine at home is the best experience of all,113,23
Books,61228141,1,negative,we fought the american revolution to end the oppressive monarchy of king george and abolish the entire concept of an aristocracy this book is witness to the new american aristocracy being waited on and fawned over on the level of blue bloods of the past the status of this new aristocracy derives from the ridiculous wealth 1 of the population now controls in our new gilded age no one no matter how rich they are needs to have their a kissed like the customers at this restaurant instead of discussing how immoral and revolting the whole concept of this place is the author makes only a passing attempt at defending such an establishment at per se restaurant in manhattan a table of 8 people according to the author regularly drops 20000 for dinner frankly this is nothing short of disgusting my suggestion is for these people to go to mcdonalds and donate the rest to charity,156,24
Books,61228141,4,positive,sure many of us have been temporary workers at a restaurant but have you ever professionally worked as a waiter in new york city at thomas kellers per se phoebe damrosch shares the trials of working as a waiter full-time in a nerve-wracking male-centric workplace while still loving the job it is fascinating to read about the knowledge and routines damrosch had to pick up to be a professional waiter at such an upscale venue and thomas keller fans will especially enjoy the detailed descriptions of the food served at per se despite still having serving-inspired nightmares to this day service included almost tempts me back into the food industry,109,25
Books,61228141,1,negative,oddly written with awkward transitions and no actual eavesdropping secrets and i could really have done without the patronizing tips for diners particularly the last few pages of the book,30,26
Books,61228141,5,positive,this book was shipped quickly and in even better condition than advertisd i loved the book and wish she had more but congratulations for finally hanging up your apron and writing this book I am intersted to know if you are still with andre and are you are working on another book darlene,52,27
Books,61228141,2,negative,the service from the vendor was great i wish i could say the same about the book it was poorly written and did not come anywhere near to the synopsis given basically it was about the authors lovelife instead of her career as a waiter at a high class dining establishment,50,28
Books,61228141,2,negative,i had high hopes for this book like many reviewers i enjoyed the inside info about the restaurant industry but could have done without the unfocused commentary around it i wondered if someone else wrote these chapters or if they were more generously edited could not quite figure out what the book was trying to accomplish which means the author likely did not know either,64,29
Books,61228141,4,positive,but a certainly enjoyable review of working in one of the most demanding and rewarding service jobs where perfection is expected not just on a daily basis but on a moment-to-moment basis balance this off with stories and fears of a burgeoning romance and you have a both enlightening and fun look behind the scenes at a job that would send a lot of people screaming into the night after two hours due to the expectations involved,77,30
Books,61228141,4,positive,as a student about to graduate culinary school and is going to work in the front of house this book was very helpful and elightening i had the unique and rare opportunity to interview with per se twice and was able to observe a night of there service from both the kitchen and the dining room this book is very accurate in decribing what goes on at the restaurant and how things are done could have been more detailed seeing as per se is deailed orriented but i would assume she would not want to bore those who are not in the industry for the people that are in the industry we understand this book pretty well written although,118,31
Books,61228141,1,negative,well i agree with a lot of people here stay away from this book what a disappointment she writes a lot about her own personal life which really nobody is interested in gives stupid tips to restaurant guests at the end of every chapter please do not steal the waiters pen please do not ask us to microvave your wine tip 20 percent or more control your limbs and the little things she writes about per se and the training she got are mainly boring and lame what a waste of time and money,94,32
Books,61228141,5,positive,this is a very fun in depth look at the world of 5 star restaurant servers and the way the industry shapes their lives phoebe does a great job of weaving the personal and professional experiences of her life into an enjoyable read that anyone especially professionals in the industry can appreciate,52,33
Books,61228141,4,positive,good book especially if you have ever been in the foodservice or hospitality industry good writing style did not want to put it down not quite as juicy as expected based on the preview and title interesting still,33,34
Books,61228141,2,negative,do not make the same mistake i did read these reviews first i was under the impression that this would be a book mostly about the experience of working at per se unfortunately only about 30 of the book is that and while that 30 is good the rest is so bad it really is not worth the money for some reason the author goes out of her way on a few occasions to rip republicans which seems odd given that it is always completely unrelated to the topic at hand amusingly she also warns readers never to ask a waiter what else do you do assuring us that waiters live full lives in their chosen profession she then spends the next 200 pages proving herself wrong as we are treated to all of the details of her shallow life strange book she has a pretty good writer i just can not imagine why anyone cares to hear about her affair when she clearly had a much more interesting topic at hand oh well i made a mistake but you have been warned,176,35
Books,61228141,4,positive,if you are interested in the food and service industry this is a good and quick read the author starts her journey before she began at per se and how she got the job i did expect more on her daily life at the restaurant and a little less on her personal life outside of it although overall it is a goo read but i wanted it to sweep me off my feet and it did not,75,36
Books,61228141,1,negative,poor shallow sheltered insecure and oh-so-modern phoebe finally gets a job where she blossoms she gets to be a waitress in a fancy restaurant where she can ogle the rich and famous at their tables and fondle the wine steward in the back room whoever thought this trash was of enough value to actually publish should be canned or fried or roasted phoebe should be embarrassed and ashamed the book is boring and petty with glimpses of triteness masquerading as incite the occasional tips to the reader about how to properly dine out without looking like a fool sprinkled throughout the book are the best part and they are as ridiculous as they are condescending do not waste your money on buying this book or your time on reading it if you happen to find someone elses copy in the trash,141,37
Books,61228141,2,negative,i thought that the book was about per se a behind the scenes look at the restaurant the clientele and and more i was mistaken roughly half the book is about that the other half focuses on the authors love life about which i am not interested i enjoyed the parts about the restaurant but there was too much self-involved discussion of her life away from per se no offense to ms damorsch but i doubt that most readers are looking for that from this book,85,38
Books,61228141,2,negative,i found this book to be worth reading once but not one I had come back to re-read i liked the parts about training service anecdotes and the vermont cheese field trip she also made me curious about bone marrow i could have done with less verbiage on her love-life and the gratuitous slaps at people who do not share her politcal views oh well red-state people do not patronize 4-star restaurants or buy books either do they,75,39
Books,61228141,1,negative,i agree with the other reviews the torrid love affair was boring at best the most interesting parts were few and far between and were always related to the restaurant this book only got published because it is about per se and by default thomas keller the author does not impress me and her need to insult her red-state readers led me to return the book totally unneccessary and obnoxious,70,40
Books,61228141,1,negative,billed as a front of the house kitchen confidential but sadly it was not at all mildy interesting but without any of the juice that was promised not recommended by me,31,41
Books,61228141,2,negative,i could not even make it as far as the romantic part i suspect the problem lay with the nature of her restaurant rich people overpaying to be seen does not do it for me,33,42
Books,61228141,2,negative,i really wanted to like this book and this author but what started out promisingly ultimately fell flat into a heap of who cares about your personal relationship with the sommelier the insight gleaned did not feel revealing as the book was so hyped to do and i ended up actually disliking the author by the end who in turns came across as smug condescending and even small i wanted this to be a book i was glad to have in hardcover instead I am just left regretting i dropped the cash and did not read the amazon reviews beforehand instead of just the critics at the risk of being cast out of some community i far preferred amanda hessers book about her latte-loving boyfriend to this one which ended up being in my mind a book about phoebe damroschs wine-loving one,138,43
Books,61228141,1,negative,what i really want to say is that someone who is brave enough not afraid of being blacked-balled in the restaraunt world needs to write what restaraunt workers are really like you get a glimpse of the truth in bourdains writings but the place for the misfits the addicts the alcoholics the nearly homeless your favorite restaraunt does not matter what or where it is that waiter who looks so dapper and well-schooled at 9 pm will be a buzzed and boozed wreck at 3 am i know this family members are the real eavesdroppers,90,44
Books,61228141,2,negative,i thought this book was flat-out boring and a long long way from what was promised there is little very singular about per se nor about keller there has not much drama either and you might expect more given the kind of clientele they have to compare this to kitchen confidential is criminal it is a kind-of sweet story about a young woman and her new york job which could be in almost any upper-end restaurant from the way the book is written there seemed to be much more about her romantic relationships than about her work which is fine except the book is supposed to be about her work she has not a bad writer and probably has a future writing other chick-lit books but if you are looking for an entertaining read about this very famous restaurant you need to look somewhere else,140,45
Books,61228141,4,positive,i took this book camping and finished it in a days time phoebe is really quite funny and keeps your interest throughout the story,24,46
Books,61228141,5,positive,this was an excellent book I had highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the food world and in the effects of food on the human experience phoebe had me laughing from the first page to the end her writing style is honest and clever and delightful to read if you are looking for a biography of thomas keller or a historical account of the per se restaurant go read an encyclopedia this is as the author describes it creative nonfiction and in my opinion this book is one of the best,92,47
Books,61228141,4,positive,i picked up this book because i am a former waiter chef and caterer owner i have never worked in a 4-star restaurant but have dined in a number of them having spent countless time in restaurants it was fun for me to read about her experiences and they brought back memories although i basically hated waiting tables the fun began after work what i liked most about the book was when she wrote about eating high quality food that is organic free-range and local as an environmentalist who eats organic and local food this was very appealing for example her description of artisan cheese from a small farm in vermont was terrific author ofaward winning book harmonious environment beautify detoxify and energize your life your home and your planet,132,48
Books,61228141,1,negative,I am still dragging myself through this one only because i spent money on it i could live without the political opinions,21,49
Books,61228141,1,negative,i can see how this got published it is a greatfor a book in theory unfortunately it is derivative and boring there has barely any more about per se or thomas keller than you already know from reviews and magazine articles there has more about the authors relationship also boring than anything else and even that narrative lacks an original voice by parts it is a poor imitation of most of the recent food-related bestsellers if you do decide to read this book you will be reminded of why you liked ruth reichl anthony bourdain and yes even amanda hesser better for a much more interesting treatment of the same subject try shaws turning tables,112,50
Books,61228141,4,positive,i could not put this book down there were a few times that i laughed out loud because the situations were similiar to my own the author was able to tie in love family dreams and the crazy customer stories so well that i was done before i knew it great book little do people know that are not in the industry is that this stuff really happens everyone dates each other hates each other forget their family forget what it is like to have a real life and know every late-night spot in town one thing that we all learn is passion you can not work in this industry if you do not love it the author was in love with her job her determination in learning how the little things count such as product knowledge service and covering for a customer when they do not know what the he shall they re talking about was little in an outsiders eyes but major in ours,158,51
Books,61228141,5,positive,a highly entertaining book that has a bit of everything a how-to guide to entering the world of the elegant gormand forks wines behavior as well as how not to take it too seriously how to get the best service wherever you go dining service etiquette is a two way street an inside look at artist / youth life in new york city and a good serving of fun stories make this book worth buying go for it you will enjoy it,77,52
Books,61228141,2,negative,another annoyingly overrated memoir about as badly written and in some cases very similar to gael greenes insatiable but from the other side of the table the only reason to read this book is for a handful of interesting details about the food and service at per se otherwise this tell all tells nothing the story of the relationship with her sommelier is beyond boring and she has impenetrably discreet with her recollections of customers and the other staff at per se she does not have the courage or wit to name spill or dish oh truman where are you when we need you the tips for diners at the end of each chapter are just ridiculous do customers at per se really make faces when the server recites the evenings specials if you want truly useful dining-out tips read the engaging and informative turning the tables by steven shaw instead,150,53
Books,61228141,1,negative,the author is mean-spirited towards half the country the book is not advertised as a political diatribe she is also pretentious i purchased 23 books in the past month sorry i bought this one what a waste of trees one star for this book is being generous due to the holiday season when i really would like to give it a minus five star rating spend your book budget on better books and support more worthy authors,77,54
Books,61228141,4,positive,i for one enjoyed how the author travels the reader to and fro her job her heart and the late-night dinning scene in new york city next time i am in the city i will be sure to conduct a few bone marrow comparisons winners as well as losers will be posted as for her relationship with the wine guy in the book who can blame him at lest in the beginning for what having a good time you are young presumably pretty good looking you know how to take a woman out to dinner and dessert and you live in new york city if he had not had some fun you would all be wondering if he was hiding something in the end it is a fast enjoyable read and a tasty stocking stuffer,133,55
Books,61228141,5,positive,this book made me hungry for gourmet food and true romance a great read for the beach or for curling up by the fireplace,24,56
Books,61228141,5,positive,i have read many books about restaurants chefs cookbooks and more most of the books are either from the chefs point of view or the other cooks in the back-of-house this book comes from the front-of-house point of view which makes it a particularly interesting read the author is a waitress in one of new yorks greatest and most famous restaurants chef thomas kellers per se she takes us through the training through the opening through the new york times very important review of the new restaurant and her intimate relationship with a co-worker at per se along the way we are treated to her other relationships both in and outside of the restaurant her love of her brooklyn apartment and her after-hours dining destinations all with her humorous and personal writing style i recommend this book if you have an interest in reading about restaurants and i hope phoebe writes another food book in the future she obviously know a lot about the subject,164,57
Books,61228141,5,positive,service included four-star secrets of an eavesdropping waiter excellent read i enjoy great food which also requires great service to make it work this book provides insight into the inner workings of one of the countries best chefs and his restaurants my wife bought the book and could not stop talking about it the author writes so well i also could not put the book down i have always had the utmost respect for those who choose to serve and do it well now i even have more,89,58
Books,61629863,2,negative,let me preface this by saying i have been an elizabeth lowell / ann maxwell fan since the harlequin days i have all of her books and always look forward to her newest release i purchased beautiful sacrifice soon after the release date I am 10 into the kindle book and so far i do not like any of the characters the plot is so ridiculous I have sent the book back to my cloud really our heroine is going to be ruined and is being blackmailed by our hero because she looked at some pictures of artifacts seized bywe have a crybaby immigration and customs enforcementofficer who is going to be fired for losing the artifacts there has absolutely no proof mind you only the word of his boss ms lowell came up with better scenarios for her silhouettes i can not remember the last time i could not finish a book at some point i may try again if i have the time after december 21 2012,166,0
Books,61629863,4,positive,the book is riveting and wonderful and the plot is very similar to jade island donovan book 2 elizabeth lowell is my favorite author when it comes to romance novels although jr ward jessica bird the billionaire next door silhouette special edition is a very very close second in lowells more recent books her husbands background as a crime reporter has really shown through there has a lot more information on crime in this book than her other books what i like the best about this book is that in some ways it is like a crime report the coverage of the violence and drug war in mexico is superb that is something that I have researched for school for example research on ciudad juarez and the effect on residents of el paso tx and read books about for example rosario tijeras spanish and the depiction of mexico right now is spot-on she reused the name hunter from autumn lover but the bedroom scenes with him and lina are sizzling as in all lowell books it is better than blue smoke and murder,188,1
Books,61629863,1,negative,oh my goodness what an awful book this has put me off reading any of her books ever again,19,2
Books,61629863,5,positive,this book is not part of a series but it is really a great read elizabeth lowell always writes well and when you get to the end you want it to keep going,33,3
Books,61629863,4,positive,beautiful sacrifice by elizabeth lowell was an archaeological thriller-romance read that had me on theof my seat throughout the read the romance was hot and heavy as lina and hunter yielded to their need the story was rich in mayan culture and belief and violence as blood was she had in sacrifice lowells characters were rich and well developed strong in their individual rite the story was shrouded in mystery and very intriguing as hunter and lina searched for the missing artifacts returning to linas childhood home they were met with an ailing grandmother a selfish mother and a temperamental father and a cousin lost in the traditional mayan ways of the past the most perfect most beautiful of all sacrifices was to be the mayan princess unless hunter could somehow stop the event from happening his entire future depended upon it this was a very intense read and as a result was very enjoyable lowells writing style although very informative was smooth and easy to follow,168,4
Books,61629863,5,positive,elizabeth lowell once again has lived up to her thrilling books i kept wondering what could possibly come next and it did great read,24,5
Books,61629863,2,negative,i reviewed this book where did the review go i do not see it listed anywhere i could never duplicated that review,22,6
Books,61629863,5,positive,absolutely an outstanding story a page turner that keeps you guessing till the end as you read you are learning about the maya culture which is interesting,26,7
Books,61629863,4,positive,this book is about a woman with an archeological degree whose roots are myan she gets pulled into finding ancient items which were stolen by tomb robbers and got confiscated by police then poof they disappear again from the concrete jungles of houston to the green jungles of the yucatan this was will keep you page turning it is a little difficult to follow in places but a good read nonetheless,70,8
Books,61629863,4,positive,i always find something in any of the elizabeth lowell books i earned a lot about jade pearls and other precious stones here a bit of archeology a bit of mayan storyher books are always fun to read,41,9
Books,61629863,5,positive,elizabeth lowell is one of my favorite authors and this book was right up there with some of her best the twists and turns kept me guessing until almost the very end when i finally got the aha moment i loved her characters and the adventure they shared,48,10
Books,61629863,4,positive,beautiful sacrifice is a great thrilling ride through a mysterious culture intertwined with the mystery of love exciting intriguing and fascinating to read,23,11
Books,61629863,4,positive,as with many lowell books the thrill of the read gets to you and you get caught up in the mystery she is telling good book,26,12
Books,61629863,5,positive,i always enjoy elizabeth lowells books her main characters always women are believable and charming somehow they seem to get into trouble and find a strong and resourceful man to help them out this book involves archeology a subject i love to read about since that was my college major 50 years ago the story revolves around mayan artifacts and people who will do anything to sell them on the black market,72,13
Books,61629863,5,positive,will read it as quickly as i finish death echo and other book by e lowell thanks for sending it sarah boston,22,14
Books,61629863,5,positive,i have not had a chance to read it yet but i know it will be good elizabeth lowell is a great author and i will continue to purchase her novels for as long as she writes them,38,15
Books,61629863,5,positive,as usual i was compelled by the characters and the plot to not sop reading until i had finished the book even although everyday life and work kept trying to divert my attention thank you,35,16
Books,61629863,4,positive,this was my very first book by this author despite the reviews that mentioned how she has done better i enjoyed this book greatly if this book does not show the best of her talent i can not wait to read her other books-I have already ordered two more the only thing i would complain about is how the ending was a little to easy it felt rushed i think she could have done better however i would read this again,79,17
Books,61629863,2,negative,i usually adire elizabeth lowells mysteries this was disappointing the storyline was interesting but the two main characters were rather blah really lina was quite mousy in spite of her allegedly smouldering looks hunter felt like a cipher of a thousand romance heroes gone before my advice get this book from your local library,54,18
Books,61629863,4,positive,good story line for this point in time a nice quick read kind of wish it was longer i would love a second book with these characters,27,19
Books,61629863,2,negative,save your money and do not waste it on this boring book if i wanted a class in mayan history I had sign up at the local college the author gets so lost in the details of the maya that the story gets lost very low interest in the relationships and very little excitement I have read a lot of her books and this is not close to some of the others she has written,71,20
Books,61629863,2,negative,i am a fan of e lowell have almost all of her books gave this book a low rating because it did not even read like an e lowell book i feel one of two things may be at play here either el was under contractual pressure to get it published in a hurry to take advantage of all the21 2012 hoopla or it was mostly written by a ghostwriter if not and this el book is simply a result of the inevitable i am running out of inspiration and enthusiasm for writing syndrome then a loyal buyer through the years like myself is certainly entitled to rate it low if the next book is as disappointing as this one it wil be the last el book i purchase a sad day indeed,135,21
Books,61629863,1,negative,i read two books in between this one and usually when i do not care for a book i still suffer through it to the end eventually I am not so sure i can do that here i have not gotten very far but nothings making me want to continue so far the characters do nothing for me i neither like or dislike them the lectures on mayan civilization i can definitely do without when i pick up a book it is for mindless enjoyment if i learn a thing or two along the way great but this is way beyond necessary i do not care to learn about it and if i did I had def not read a romance novel or whatever this is supposed to be i have never read this writer before so i do not know if this is the norm and so far not sure if I had like to go back for another to find out,155,22
Books,61629863,5,positive,elizabeth lowell is one of my favorite authors i try to read as many of her books as possible great read,21,23
Books,61629863,2,negative,as a long time lowell fan i find myself wondering if her evil twin wrote this the romance was more bad first time harlequin than experienced novelist with it is wham bam thank you mam get the sex on immediately throughout and of course ending with it no subtlety sensuality reasonable build up in fact no reasonable story line toss in lots of blood and guts and the totally unbelievable plot comic book like characters and mostly tedious commentary i can only assume ms lowell is under contract to produce within a certain time frame and as she also writes with her husband as well just ground this out i can only hope she finds her muse again along with respect for her loyal readers i love mystery and romance or mystery or romance if plotting and storytelling is good i did like her characters or wanted to but they became simply caricatures i do not like writing bad reviews especially of a writer i admire but i do not see any way around this one where the heck were her editors oh yeah sitting back relying on her name I have read much better first time authors on kindle,196,24
Books,61629863,2,negative,elizabeth lowell has been on my must-read list since she wrote as ann maxwell but she is quickly starting to fade from it her latest novel felt more contrived than anything I have ever read from her and i absolutely hated the premise i am grateful that i had enough hesitation about this title that i borrowed it from my local library instead of purchasing it outright i usually enjoy her books and will gladly sacrifice a few hours of sleep to live a little longer in her worlds but for this book i had to push myself the entire way instead of closing it for the last time with a happy smile i just felt relief that it was over do not waste your money,124,25
Books,61629863,2,negative,i have never taken the time to write a review before but in this case i feel i have to let all of the elizabeth lowell fans know what they are getting into i wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing this book first of all i have been an avid fan and have most of her books even as ann maxwell i realize that her books have contained much about the mayan culture but this was overkill i appreciate learning new things through her books however when the topic becomes all about history it overshadows all other aspects it was predictable there was an over abundance of discussion on mayan history that dragged on and on which made it very hard to read this is the only book i have ever purchased that i had to force myself to finish it truly makes me question if i were to purchase another of her books in the future i would not automatically pre-order as i have in the past and definitely read reviews before i purchase another of her books i would not recommend this book to anybody very disappointed,191,26
Books,61629863,1,negative,let me start by saying i have read and enjoyed almost every book ms lowell has written until this one the editorial mistakes concerning geography are so bad they completely threw me out of the story houston texas is not a border town south padre island is not a hop skip and a jump from houston south padre island is several hours away from houston south padre island is not an exit ramp off of i-10 these jarring errors could have been easily corrected by looking at a map of texas there are no long driveways anywhere on the island which is just a spit of land the houses are not built on stilts the gulf of mexico is not usually called the ocean it is the gulf I am only halfway through the book so who know what other inconsistencies will appear okay now it is just too much have read further and hunter and lina have landed in cozumul an island and are driving to tulum on the mexico mainland please ms lowell really lost credibility with this book and i wondered how credible her other books are,186,27
Books,61629863,2,negative,i love elizabeth lowell books but this one is so disappointing i will not rehash the story I shall give you my pros and cons pros both the heroine and the hero were like able no excess baggage or games it was well written now the cons it has almost no action or plot there has one short part when something actually happens the rest of the book is about the mayans the worst part is in the author notes at the end she made up most of it if you have read elizabeth lowell before and do not want to be disappointed skip this one,103,28
Books,61629863,1,negative,yet another favorite author has been removed not only from my autobuy list but my autoread list lowells books have become increasingly terrible reads with each new book worse than the one before this book was the first one of hers i could not even finish i almost always finish a book i start but this one was so bad i could not get past more than 50 or so pages before i gave up on it no continuity facts and characters just tossed in with no real connection to the story no flow to the story just got tired of trying to keep up since it has been several books since i found one of lowells books to be an interesting read I am just taking her off my list of authors to read in future seems like elizabeth lowell is just the latest in an increasingly long list of authors more concerned with pushing out yet another book as fast as she can instead of crafting a well written story that her readers will enjoy,174,29
Books,61629863,1,negative,i realize that was not to be st kilda but did it have to be this off the mark the book was written like a text book leave out the romance and your there the st kilda books were short on romance but you always knew the people were attracted to one another and cared she did not finish the st kilda books before she moved on it was a bad mistake I shall be more careful before i spend the money buying a first edition I shall wait for the review i have never done that before,96,30
Books,61629863,1,negative,i was excited about lowells new book even although it was not about the donovans or st k however i was only a few pages in before i started skimming and skipping pages i thought the set-up was ridiculous the background ridiculous and the dialogue especially ridiculous i think this is her worst book and it does not even compare to her best I am not sure what happened but I shall be waiting for the next one,74,31
Books,61629863,1,negative,as a avid lowell reader i could not wait to start this book from front to back i felt like i was reading a documentary on the mayan culture very little depth on the characters boring and very disappointed,38,32
Books,61629863,2,negative,i normally love elizabeth lowell novels but this was definitely not her best work the plot was thin the characters shallow and the flow was pretty bumpy it seemed to jump around a lot for no particular reason it sounded like a good premise from what i read before the book came out but i was pretty disappointed,58,33
Books,61629863,2,negative,longtime fans of elizabeth lowell might be happy with her latest work it seems like a book she wrote a decade ago left forgotten in a drawer and published in 2012 the story referenced the mayan calender event of 2012 but it was frequently marginalized as peasant superstition the story was interesting with mayan mythology but it overwhelmed at times the villain was predictable from early on and was too over the top to be believable at the climax it had one redeeming feature the main characters they were wonderfully written and had nice depths they were the only joy in the book the plot line was predictable and pedantic i have been a devoted fan but i found myself disappointed and let down thankfully i did not pay hardcover retail prices if i had i would have returned the book,141,34
Books,61629863,4,positive,beautiful sacrifice takes the story of the 2012 maya prophecy to new heights dr lina taylor is descended from the maya and spanish who conquered them she is the daughter of two very strong and complicated people and the current heir to the reyes balam lands in south america she has studied the maya on digs with her archeologist father and now teaches about the complex culture when hunter johnson formeragent and a sometimes student comes to her with photographs of stolen artifacts she is drawn quickly into the hunt and into the treachery and fanaticism of those who worship the ancient maya god kawail whose nature and rituals are shrouded in mystery bodies pile up as the blood of sacrifice rains down because a power-hungry entity known as ' el maya wants to usher in a new world order with the maya as victorious this time plot twists and heart-stopping action entwined with a developing relationship are masterfully rendered by ms lowells hand while sometimes surreal each discovery and person fits seamlessly into the story giving it a real-life feel as we come inevitably closer to december 21 2012 and it is myriad possibilities,196,35
Books,61629863,1,negative,i have been reading elizabeth lowell since her loveswept days and she was for years an autobuy then she got away from any romance in her books given that they are supposed to be romantic suspense that is part of what you should be able to reasonably expect from the book in this book she goes back to having some fairly hot romance and it almost got me to finish the book but the research / droning on and on and on about the mayan history was sooooo boring I am sorry I had rather reread any of the books she wrote 20 years ago for the 10 time than finish this book,106,36
Books,61629863,5,positive,talk about a book that keeps you hanging on to theof your seat this one is it in all areas i was lucky enough to win this book from a goodreads contest and i hit the jackpot the writing style is perfect ms lowell takes you on a ride of your life this book was such a pleasure to read i could not put it down i found myself cheating at work and reading in when i was suppose to be doing my job i was so hooked on it wanting to know what happens next luckily i get to keep my job the story surrounds around december 21 2012 artifacts are missing and lina and hunter are looking for them what they find is not what they were expecting a friendship blossoms and fear follows as the relationship grows is there an end before there is a beginning for them you will not be able to put this down it is going to follow you in your dreams at night until you finish great story ms lowell thank you for writing it for us,183,37
Books,61629863,1,negative,i have read elizabeth lowell / ann maxwell since the beginning of her career she has had good very good and excellent tales this book is so bad that i would throw it in the garbage if i had not ordered for my kindle please do not buy this book there is no substance it is boring,53,38
Books,61629863,5,positive,elizabeth lowell has surpassed her personal best with beautiful sacrifice positively riveting this is not a who-done-it novel to speed read your way through laze away take your time reading enjoy every word every emotion every setting every character and the situations that only el can bind together so effortlessly highly recommend whether you are a fan or a new reader,61,39
Books,61661287,2,negative,marianna rode on the coat tails of martha stewart for over 20 years any other average human being that wanted to be treated like a puppet or a second class citizen could have riden along for the ride as well I am shocked and saddened that marianna ignored all the rudeness ugliness and made excuses for marthas behavior can you say bury your head in the sand most of us would have punted ms to the curb years ago but i guess if you wanted to visit all those exotic places and meet the rich and famous you could not possibly stand up to a ms and not pay the consequences please where was mariannas backbone,113,0
Books,61661287,4,positive,i enjoyed the book i doubt that i would like martha as a friend but i sure like her taste,20,1
Books,61661287,4,positive,very interesting things about martha i was not aware of for sure I am glad that i bought the book easy read,20,2
Books,61661287,4,positive,more of a self-examination of one womans tendency to allow herself to be abused and denigrated both in public and private in order to enjoy the privileges of knowing the friends of the super rich i found this book to be very interesting a genuine peep thru the curtains of an extremely private sad using survivor of abuse who seemed to be unable to commit to anyone or anything from house to house to house friend to friend to friend we follow her with marianna who is too caught up in the glitz and material gains her association with martha brings her to stand up to her rudeness smack her hand when called for or leave her in midstream even when the safety of her own children was involved i wish them both well but what sound and fury signifying nothing,142,3
Books,61661287,1,negative,I am a fairly fast reader and normally breeze through books this one took me three weeks to finally finish 395 pages of self-congratulating name dropping and hermes-wearing she leached off of martha for over 20 years and her final parasitic act is to write this boring one-sided account of a so-called friendship filled with metaphors flowery prose and way too many quotes from others,64,4
Books,61661287,1,negative,expertly polished in cover girls nile red trembled as i turned fascinating page after page of this tome in a non-perfect world or as mary worth pointed out a less-than perfect world mariana pasternak stands head and shoulders above lesser mortals such as you or i like a nova a glittering shining star bursting and twisting into the black ink of the solar system past a multitude of stars or in the words of carl sagan billions upon billions of stars our heroine takes it on the chin from the abusive and dismissive stewart reading this story i was reminded of my youth long winter evenings spent dining at a private table in my college whatsamatta u cafeteria frozen peas boiled potatoes mystery meat under glass and of course a flute of sprite to wash it all down and listening to hall and oats maneater while wearing a superb ensemble of dress barn evening frock fashion bug ford pinto faux red alligator bag and payless stilletos watch out man she will chew you up yes indeed,174,5
Books,61661287,2,negative,obviously ghostwritten you never have the feeling that you are reading the writing of a romanian exile paskternak comes across as pretentious and disingenuous she is also very disloyal although she sings regular hosannas you can can feel the venom beneath just plain jealous i already knew that martha could be a witch but i still admire the wonman you do get a view into her lovelife you get to see where martha is vulnerable i came away admiring her even more i rate the book a 2 but martha gets a solid 10,94,6
Books,61661287,1,negative,the best of friends martha and me what has happened to loyalty mariana pasternak as well as her daughters have been the recipients of the generosity of martha stewart in numerous ways without her ms pasternak would not have had the exposure to opportunities and the finer things of life i question anyone who makes herself out to be a saint while tearing down her best friend every story has two sides and i would love to hear marthas i believe highly creative people can be demanding and difficult but ms pasternak does not show any of her own personal warts or weaknesses i disliked this author immensely she is self serving she is not authentic or believeable and is trying to cash in on her relationship with a celebrity friends with mariana pasternak no thanks,139,7
Books,61661287,1,negative,while it started off fairly interestingly it did not take long for me to start asking what marianas problem was she repeatedly let martha walk all over her but then came back for more time and time again it does not sound like the sort of friendship i would want to be involved with it is obvious that mariana stayed friends with martha over the years in order to take advantage of the social and travel opportunities afforded her by martha but mariana then has the gall to complain about all of them she tries to paint martha in a negative light by saying that she is first and foremost about the almighty dollar but mariana proves herself to be just the same mariana certainly did herself no favors in this ridiculous book,131,8
Books,61661287,1,negative,when i read all the negative reviews i thought perhaps those were written by loyal friends of martha and i was curious to read the book after reading the book i have increased admiration for martha stewart her energy drive generosity adventurous and positive spirit and her vulnerability while conversely nothing but the lowest opinion of the author summarized in one word contemptible anyone with the least shred of decency would not stab in the back a friend of 20 years much less in public and for profit no person with any self-respect would reveal private information about another such as this author does furthermore after all those years the author really has to sift and stretch to find any dirt to dish and if martha is not an absolutely perfect person well guess what neither am i this mean-spirited attempt to smear martha just ends up revealing the author for the mean-spirited snake-in-the-grass that she is ps the book describes the sneaky deceitful cruel way that andy stewart left his wife and marriage of 27 years the very definition of weasel,186,9
Books,61661287,5,positive,well written interesting author mariana pasternak is very intelligent and i learned a lot vacationing vicariously through her book,19,10
Books,61661287,2,negative,i am about to give up on this one i am a third of the way through on the audio version not unlike her friend martha mariana is extremely self-serving she goes on and on about her life which is not why i bought this book her references to martha are filled with backhanded compliments in truth these two are too much alike to ever be real friends i admit it i bought it for the dirt i am not a martha fan and feel that much of her fame comes on the backs of those who work for her she is famous for taking credit for what they do and they are all too afraid of her to say anything this book is badly written and disappointing the reader sounds like she is talking to a class of pre-schoolers another real turnoff skip this one,147,11
Books,61661287,5,positive,this book was well written and super interesting it all read as perfectly true to life and insightful easy to see how a regular person could be caught up in marthas world but not being martha it could also be difficult to be exposed to that grand life without the cash to fund it plus martha did not seem too inclined to share or even too generous the only part that seemed a little hazy was the legal wrangling at the end somehow none of that rang exactly true to me the author remembered theof the ducks on marthas socks 15 years before but could not remember who said what about the stock deal i read a lot and this book had me rushing home from work to read the next chapter it was a fun look into an interesting life,141,12
Books,61661287,5,positive,highly recommended helps you to understand what drives martha stewart and the sad consequences of how money and power can in my opinion and what appears to be a little mental illness drive away even those friends who did not care about your wealth in the first place just goes to show as well money can not buy love or true happiness a very big must read for martha stewart fans,71,13
Books,61661287,2,negative,this book actually made me like martha stewart which is amazing because i always assumed she was just a rich obsessive-compulsive diletante but no she travels in her non-existant spare time to places like peru where she visits a guinea pig farm and eats guninea pig with her traveling child realtives telling them it is chicken fricasse she hails transport on her own in egypt with more child relatives in tow gets abandoned by said transport and partakes of a meal and makes friends with a local woman in her humble home there are a lot more such stories i was impressed i travel a lot but i tend to be careful about what i eat the woman who wrote this book is truly annoying what female can not relate to the pain of a backstabbing jealous former frenemy read it but do not pay for it check it out at the library in a few months,154,14
Books,61661287,5,positive,this honest well written memoir is more than a book about martha stewart it is a travelogue a social diary and a story of women friendship this page turner is chock full of intimate details and entertaining glimpses into the lives of the rich and famous although these two best friends seem to have it all in real life they struggle with the same issues all other women worry about men family and career through hilarious stories the author offers us a look into the real martha stewart sharing secret hopes and disappointments passions and vulnerabilities every woman will find herself in this cautionary tale of female friendship loaded with historical and literary references everyone attracted to marthas life-style will feel as if living the pulse of marthas world women who like to travel will follow dream-itineraries women who love entertaining will devour the nuances of martha dinner parties and women who like to decorate will enjoy the bargain hunting and antiquing tales whether you are a martha fan or not you will be absorbed by this captivating tale,180,15
Books,61661287,5,positive,even if one did not know who martha stewart is this book would be fascinating due to the authors knowledge of literature art history design and international destinations some of which of course was gleaned from friendship with martha the style is intelligent with many references to the source vivid descriptions and celebrity tales most people know perfectionists and their behavior in many ways this book demonstrates motives for the dominant and submissive manner in relationships and shows how everyone uses everyone else,83,16
Books,61661287,4,positive,i thought this was a well written honest look at a friendship between 2 women i do not really understand the extreme negative reviews i felt that mariana was freshingly honest in her look back at both of their lives and how they related to each other she never asked for anything other than friendship and paid her own way with interest on the many trips they took together mariana lost her livelihood her home and many of her friends when she told the truth at marthas trial again i do not understand how people can accuse her of riding on marthas coattails for 20 years are these marthas friends or employees writing this i have also felt that martha was a driven person who sometimes probably did not understand how her actions affected others and this book confirmed that i pass no judgement on martha she has flaws just as the rest of us do and as mariana does I am sure but it is certainly interesting to take a look at her life her homes and her relationships by the way i listened to the audio book of the best of friends which i thought was excellent the narrator was a joy to listen to,203,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,you can get the import of tpd which is only a few bucks more and includes the original as the sixth track after watching lost highway there has no way in he shall identification want the soundtrack,35,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,if tpd is a sign of things to come for trent reznor then I am just blown away and anxiously await his new album this fall the perfect drug is a tour-de-force of drum n bass electronica and reznors traditional harsh metal / industrial inspired angst i think he has lightened up a bit too which is also a fresh change,57,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,the perfect drug has overdosed how they absolutely managed too slaughter an otherwise good song with these less than stellar versions well trent knew how too create it so it is obvious he knew how too destroy it too he still laughs all the way to the bank avoid unless a collector 25 for a rating i was forced too give it a full star,65,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,when i first heard the perfect drug i was blown away it is an amazing song so i of course snapped up the lost highway soundtrack and then this cd when it was released to my complete surprise the perfect drug was not on the disc in it is place were 5 unrecognizable remixes sub-par at best this release was a great disappointment and while the remixes were not all bad they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song and that is unforgiveable so needless to say this cd single is best avoided unless you a fan of the remixers or a nin completist,102,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i loved the original version from the lost highway i only found out that i had to buy that soundtrack to find the original version not featured on this overwritten piece to make a long story short buy the lost highway soundtrack,42,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i am going to get straight to the point if you are not a huge nin fan nor are you collecting all the singles and albums i would not recomend you purchase this cd it does not include the original version of the song which is the only good version i have heard only the japanese import includes it as a 6th track i purchased this cd when it came out 10 years ago and i was disapointed the mixes are long drawn out and just do not catch your ear but like i said if you are a collector of nin cds it is essential just like everything else so for that matter it is worth the 6 bucks but if your not a huge fan i would not buy it,132,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,just buy the perfect drug versions and the original version is on itunes lost highway soundtrack or one of the we are in this together singles these all all great songs would be nice to have them all in once package,40,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,absolute rubbish not even close to the brilliance of the original recording if you loved the original like i did you will hate this,23,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,one of my personal favorite halos i think some of the haters have their collective heads up their butts when they say this and fixed are too weird come on get out of your parents dank and dingy basements and live imitation is the greatest form of flattery,48,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i was dissapointed when i listened to this cd all i wanted was the original version of the perfect drug this cd only has the remixes so if you are buying this cd for the original version you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the lost highway instead,49,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,not what i thort it was gunna be not that good,11,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,this remix album is very interesting featuring 6 remixes the first 2 are amazing and the nin mix is great also,21,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,ok people stop bitching about there not being the original version of tpd you all know you already have the lost highway soundtrack anyway so what has your beef and if you do not go get it it is fantastic with or without trents contributions ok I shall get straight to it this was the first nin cd i bought i happened to decide to go to the record shop the very day this puppy was released and picked it up for a song loved it from the get go this was the cd that made me fall in love with nin if nothing else it introduced me to four other amazing artists-luke vibert jack dangers spacetime continuum and orb the only mix that is less than superb is the orb 5 tracks 4 great songs pretty easy to score do not you think,139,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,this is one of the first cds that introduced me to remixing and is still one of my favorites this is remixing how it should be it bends the limits of the original work and creates something utterly different and brilliant i personally prefer these versions vastly to the original which is in my opinion not one of trents better songs i was very excited to see the orb and meat beat manifesto in the mix they really brought out the finer and more subtle elements of the song and really made it their own the only nin remixs that i would reccomend more than this would be the telefon tel aviv remix of where is everybody which is absolutely incredible i reccomend it to any nin fan or ttv fan who is open minded and willing to hear what sounds more like a collaboration than a remix a final note to all you so-called nin purists out there who did not like this project because it did not sound enough like the original try making your own remix and see if it comes out even close to any of these maybe then you will change your mind,194,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i do not know why this ep has gotten bad reviews no the original version is not on here whatever if you are a hardcore nails fan you have already got it on the lost highway soundtrack this is definitely one of if not his absolute best remix album every track is absolutely bitchin good for driving and those late nights and wee early morning hours of twilight unless you absolutely hate drum n bass / jungle / techno stuff it is a remix folks you will love this album dammit,83,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,do not get me wrong i think perfect drug is one of the best songs to ever come from trent reznors nine inch nails outfit but this cd single is for die hard nin fans only who do not already own the original song featured on the lost highway soundtrack there are five tracks of remixes one of which done by reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song the other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring these remixes really do not hold a candle to the original and your better off getting the lost highway soundtrack considering this single does not even include the original song all in all this halo is for die hard nin fans only,134,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,okay so usually i can be open minded about too many singles filled with too many remixes and not enough original material but I am throwing objectivity out the window and letting fly on this piece of sh te 5 boring and repetitive remixes of the perfect drug and the original version is not even on here get the day the world went away pt 3 and consider yourself saved f ck you reznor,70,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,so many of y all might love the original to death to me it is aight it is good but these remixes are even better my favorite tracks off this is spacetime continuums phenominal remix luke viberts smash and trent keiths remix i got to also mention meat beats remix thumbs up the orbs was so-so and was more annoying than amuzing but i give it a play every now and then,69,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,i guess i must have been lucky or something because when i bought this ep it had a made in australia sticker on the back and it actually had the original perfect drug on it the remixes are pretty good but none live up to the original,47,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,a lot of people probably would be dissapionted with this cd when they hear it because the original is not on here if you want the original buy lost highway soundtrackwere in this together 3or the import of this people that buy this for the original must be kinda blind or something but oh well that is your problem the original song is perfect in every way and to have a whole remix cd deticated to it is great considering all of these remixes are really good too although to have most 4/5 of the remixes buy other people is not really like nin cds it is still really good i just wish more remixes were by nin themself,113,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i remember i bought this cd hoping for the original version of perfect drug and i got 5 remixes that were odd and interesting but not the actual song i had to buy an import release that had a 6th track that included original version,45,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,wow this album really and I am highly sure trent would agree with me if you really want to hear the perfect drug buy the lost highway soundtrack because that is the only place you will find the not remixed song along with buying lost highway you will find music that will agree with you such as manson bowie lou reed and ramstein and someone who said this album is closely rivaled with closer,76,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i love the song perfect drug so naturally i bought it is ep that is where i ran into problem 1 the original perfect drug is not on the album sure the remixes are intresting to say the least but each one sans trents version get boring really quickly as they just seem to float in limbo for 7 minutes casual nin fans need not apply but for a halo collector like me well it does not really matter what has on the actuall disc,80,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,I am a huge fan of the original version of the perfect drug i love every element aspect and second of the song this ep takes each ascpect of that song and makes new completely different versions of it the meat beat manifesto version is a great way to start out the cd with it is layeryed drumming and symbols this track goes for over 7 mins long this one very song made me go out and buy some mbm albums the plug version is good as well but my favorite from the cd is without a doubt the nin version which is nearly 9 minutes long this track builds and builds and has without a doubt one of the greatest endings in a nin song closely rivaled by closer the orb version well that is the only one i can not listen to over and over it is just far too spacy overall this is a awesome cd which i listen to over and over and even got me into these other bands the only gripe is that the original version is not on the cd but with all these other excellent versions there is no need to complain at all,195,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,this is a tragic mistake most of the time trent reznor relies upon himself and a few close collaborators to work on remixing nins music the results are always fascinating and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right that is why trent reznor always refers to them as versions not remixes here although reznor has got a variety of people together to work on the perfect drug and the results are not worthy of a nin release trent reznors own remix track 3 is excellent and the only redeeming feature of the disc it is very exciting and powerful exploring the driving rhythms of the original now infected with drums and bass but the other remixes do not compare they are interesting enough but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song which defeats the point of the exercise buy it for reznors version but do not expect the same excellence from the other tracks,165,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,sorry but it is on so many other things that you can still love it there is a remix by nin and one by the orb who seem to have the best remix on here besides nin because this is more of remixes on a maxi-single then just a normal single 4 makes you wonder if you are listening to the perfect drug there is not even words get the original on the lost highway soundtrack closure and we are in this together pt 2 or you may even be insisting on finding it on the damaged box set since it is the witt singles plus things you would not regularly get but still get this,110,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i love nin i could not bring myself to give this disc less than five stars but the only reason i bought this was to complete my collection only the german and australian imports have the original song on the single which mystifies me so do not buy this expecting it to be on there like i said if you are a diehard nin fan and want to complete your collection or if you want to hear the remixes by all means go for it if not buy the lost highway soundtrack or the we are in this together single i do not remember which one it is on there are three we are in this together singles yellow green and orange infrom different countries with different track listings or buy the single for into the void,133,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,okay so I have read that this would be a great cd for serious nin collectors of course if you already are are a serious nin collector then you would have all these tracks already would not you even if you did not own lost highway the original version of perfect drug is on one of the wittn discs 3rd one i think anyway this release has irritated me as much as the last one into the void as it only has pre-released material and before that i had to buy 3 discs for a couple weak remixes trent i love ya man but come on here we waited five years for this regurgitated material is seriously disappointing give us something more,118,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,dose this have a halo and if so what is it,12,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,this is a fairly good cd but i would not recomened it to a new nin fan as some of the remixes do not sound like nin to much the first mix is the best i only give the united states version two stars but this england / japan import has the origional version of perfect drug on it is as the bonus track i recomended spending the extra money for this version rather than the american version,72,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i loved the original of this song and i love this single these remixes are all interesting because they take certain elements from the song and then mix them up with cuts from the vocals and their own ideas my favorite songs are the ones remixed by spacetime continuum jonah sharp this song made me buy a spacetime continuum cd and the one remixed by the orb i like the piano they included in the middle of this remix the two parts i like best in the perfect drug are the piano and the drums this single is good but i recommend the lost highway sdtk especially if you like nine inch nails because it has 2 other songs trent did,121,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,first off if you liked the original song the perfect drug from lost highway then do not but this it consists of trent and 4 bands making strange otherworldly mixes that are almost but not entirely completely unlike the perfect drug if you like interminable incoherent mixes la meat beat manifesto you might enjoy this cd but do not expect it to sound like nin even the reznor / hillebrant mix sounds very little like nine inch nails if this cd included the original unadulterated version of the song it would be worht buying but as it is it offers very little to the nin fan unless you are one of those nuts who absolutely must own every halo it also loses a star for having an ugly purplish cd,129,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,when i finally noticed that on the front cover camouflaged with the colors there was the list of the bands that performed each mix when i saw the name meat beat manifesto it made me wonder then when i heard their version of perfect drug i had different feelings for them i love the deep bass in the first track 720 min version by meat beat manifesto listening to that track alone is well worth the price and the reason to buy this certain disc,80,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,do not expect to get the original song here you will get cool re-mixes that is it if you want the original song buy the lost highway soundtrack the first re-mix on this single is by meat beat manifesto it is the best one well done the rest are good too but buy it only if you like re-mixes or if you want to add it to your halos,65,33
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,the reason that many are disapointed with nins cds is because they buy it expecting what they get other places music written for radio and to sell cds sure trents music is written in the hope that people can appriciate it but it is not meant for it the singles and remixes are no exception and in fact they are even more geared towards hardcore fans but i will add if you really want the single for this that you heard on the radio get the import version of this cd it is the version that contains the singles that make everyone love a band till the radio likes something else,111,34
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,if anyone is a true nin fan they will greatly appreciate this album it is not supposed to be a pop cd or geared towards comercialism as many people expected rather it is an experimental work as are all nin remix albums an expression as art if you appreciate music that the rest of the world will never hear that has some artistic integrity some creativity and ingenuity get this album do not expect however the original or songs oriented towards a pop culture,82,35
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,there are more then a few nin fans i know who do not like this cd but i guess that could be expected this is definitly off track from most of trent reznors other work none of these mixes are really very close to the original either i would recomend this cd either for people who are interested in electronic music drum n bass especially or who do not mind hearing trent doing something different i agree with the other reviews although you should not own this cd without also having the original version,92,36
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,this is not the song from the soundtrack and i do not care who remixed it the whole cd sounds like you are playing the soundtrack version while flushing your toilet continuously sorry i usually love anything trent does come back to us trent ps splurge on the lost highway soundtrack instead you get the original kick-azz version of the song plus a complete selection of music guaranteed to creep you out but in a good way,72,37
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,if I am ever tired and i want to go to sleep i just pop that cd in and i crash instantly if i ever want to get pumped up to go somewhere i just pop that cd in and I am ready to go,43,38
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i enjoyed the original version better you can find it on the lost highways soundtrack plus you get songs by marilyn manson trent reznor david bowie smashing pumpkins and rammstien much better take my advise and buy that instead,39,39
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,blah blah blah cue whiny voice the domestic does not come with the original buy the import it is only twice the price blah blah blah reality check people the original version is on the lost highway soundtrack an album worth buying in it is own right the 6 more you spend on the import could be put to that and you are getting more than just one song lost highway has numerous quality tracks smashing pumpkins eye david bowies I am deranged a couple from marilyn manson and more what ever happened to practicality,90,40
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4,positive,well I am saddened to see some of the negative reviews because this is a brillant cd which i have had in my collection for a decade now and every now and then i play it just because i love it so much yes there are a couple of questionable tracks but the rest more than make up for it it is about time was practically my anthem for many years during uni and tracks like great big no into my arms you can take it with you favorite t and bigheart are just about some of the best folk pop / rock gems I have ever heard in short I am astounded when people call this a flop because in oz it was huge at least in my circle of friends it is even outlasted most of them in fact great stuff evan i really enjoy and respect your work,146,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4,positive,some brilliant three chord magic here the first six songs are some of the most cleverly-arranged pop songs you may ever hear after that it is still three chords but not nearly as inspired if you view this record like a plane crash the first six songs are a pristine take off and ascent it is about time down about it the next three or four are the plane plateauing dawn can not decide I shall do it anyway after that it is a very gradual loss of elevation and the plane begins descending finally the whole thing explodes in the end with the jello fund quite possibly the worst song of any genre ever to be recorded,113,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5,positive,with the exception of the jello fund an obvious joke come on feel the lemonheads is packed with well-crafted pop from start to finish into your arms has all the ingredients of the perfect pop single other tracks like it is about time down about it paid to smile and bigheart are as catchy as they come by this time the lemonheads were a well-polished pop unit leaving behind much of the hardcore punk sound they had started with fans of earlier lps such as hate your friends or creator may not take to their later sound but anyone with an ear for melody will find this disc irresistible,110,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5,positive,evan and his gang reached their zenith with this one it combines perfect pop power singles with quirky cool lyrics that are impossible to resist listening to I shall do it anyway catapults back me to florida turnpikes and contains the best thing belinda carlisle ever went near one of evans strengths is the quality of his song writing collaborators so it is unfair to see him as solely a one man band perfectly quotables here include being around a heartbreakingly cool rhyme of wonderous simplicity copyright restrictions prevent me or else I had reproduce it all here but the closing line I am a little grubby from just being around is so cool favorite t is nearly as good and again proves the quality of this record with these songs combined with the singles released this one has to win a place in anyones collection only the worst bigot could fail to be charmed by evans campfire song bigheart this from one of rocks greatest pinfor indie chicks of a certain age his ballad of love to julianna it is about time should be standard issue for balcony singers everywhere only downside is the drug references that signal dandos eventual decline,203,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4,positive,i am astounded at how poorly this album was received by the record-buying public in general and by so-called lemonhead / dando fans in particular after the critical and commercial success enjoyed with the shame about ray album dando again delivers a beautifully crafted mixture of tunes which range from the up-beat into your arms penned by robyn st clare bassist with defunct australian guitar / pop outfit the hummingbirds to the soulful / melancholy of bigheart and being around dando is one of the least appreciated musican / songwriters of his generations which i suspect is a result of his reluctance to sick with a particular sound or music genre personally i enjoy and appreciate dandos ability to craft and cover great tunes that range from clever pop guitar I shall do it anyway to country / parody bigheart to rock down about it and the whimsical folky sound of being around genuine fans of real music rather than the mass-manufactured fm-friendly crap than dominates westerm music charts could do a lot worse than acquiring the lemonheads final trilogy of shame about ray come on feel the lemonheads and car button cloth,186,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1,negative,hate your friends lick and creator are good cds but unfortunately it is a steep downhill fall for americas own billy idol of punk rock if ever a punk bandssinger has been marketed as a cute boy band type then surely it is evan dando as the cds come feel the lemonheads get more mellow the image makeover gos into overdrive until every am radio station or tampon company comes calling to use his sensitive adult rock for marketing purposes but let me put down my crystal ball for a moment the problem with the pretty boy stuff is sooner than later it becomes like yesterdays newspaper to be put at the bottom of bird cages or thrown out my only first hand experience with evan dando was struggling to get a coke out of a coke machine before a gig we failed evan probably has better luck with the ladies than i but i sleep soundly knowing my art work is not overtaking used cd shops at give away prices remember you can discount a crap cd but it is still a crap cd,183,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1,negative,it is a shame about ray showed the lemonheads potential potential that is saidly squandered with this most likely hurried follow-up although into your arms is pleasent it is not worth buying the whole album for save your money if you want to try the lemonheads i suggest their earlier material,49,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4,positive,this the second album from dando that i own the other being it is a shame about ray is a good pop rock albumi usually despise pop but dando gets away with it for me for some reasonmaybe why i like it so much is because of the addition of one of my faves julianna hatfield singing back-up on most of the albummy only problem with the album really is the jello fund can somebody explain why it is even on the album otherwise the album is very goodthe lyrics sometimes are a little less to be desired but than dando redeems himself with songs like bigheart so if you are a fan of it is a shame about ray this album should not come as a big disappointment as it is not as great as that one is but is still a good album nevertheless,135,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5,positive,come on feel the lemonheads everyone has their heroes and evan dando has got to be one of mine this is still my favorite lemonheads records maybe a little sweet and poppy but the quality of the songs of awesome and very easy from great big no to into your arms and the awesome bigheart it is about time and down about it it is all so much fun to listen to a really funny song is being around great even after 12 years,84,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5,positive,this album totall rocks my socks this is bright n light 90s bubblegum pop at it is best if you are looking to be depressed go buy some nine inch nails this is not what this album is about if you are feeling nostalgic and want to take a trip back down memory lane get this album,53,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1,negative,this is not very good the lemonheads was turned from a gritty but funny / slapstick punk band to an awfully happy pop band i am surprised that the new kids on the block are not singing in the back in some of the songs this album is filled with way too happy songs-it just does not fit the lemonheads image into your arms is probally the best song on the album but still it is way too cheerful people often say that you can not change a person at all i do not agree with them it has happened to group of people and it was the lemonheads major record label success changed the lemonheads how sad,110,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5,positive,great album lots here for fans of both rap and hard rock i could see listening to this before a football game the only complaint is the lack of dialogue from the movie and where has steamin willie beaman,38,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5,positive,this album is a great album even although the songs are not on the movie anyone can tell by reading the tracklist but anyhow the cd is good ll cool js song is a classic and all the songs are very listenable if you like rap and rock this is a great mix of both,54,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1,negative,the artists featured in the movie need to be represented on the soundtrack perhaps this was not done because some of the best songs are already on soundtracks for other movies and this cd was meant represent a more diverse group of artists who knows fyi the touch-football beach scene with the girls in bikinis features comoby one of los angeless best bands ozomatli look for their new album later this summer and you can find them on the ed tv never been kissed and very bad things soundtracks and of course on their own album,97,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1,negative,after seeing the movie i was eager to get ahold of the soundtrack boy was i wrong this soundtrack captures only a few of the songs that were actually used in the movie i was extremely upset at what was a clear attempt to market this soundtrack as a rap / hard rock album than what it should have been a soundtrack that stays true to the movie what a commercial sellout by whoever put the soundtrack album together i heard several songs by moby and other dance / techno artists throughout the film but none of their songs were included on the cd if you are a fan of rap which I am not then I had recommend the album if you saw the movie and liked the music from the movie do not buy the soundtrack,131,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,2,negative,where is all the techno / electronic music they played throughout the whole movie like fatboy slims right here right now from the opening football scene this cd has way too much rap and not the techno that was played throughout the movie,41,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4,positive,i was pretty darn impressed with this cd usually i listen to plain old rock and roll but i was persuaded to purchase this cuz of good old pod their song along with the godsmack and ll cool j tracks are what make this an excellent buy for almost any fan of music,53,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4,positive,i was wondering what that track was also mark did u ever manage to find out what it was the one after the priests speech that goes bless me father for i have sinned,34,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1,negative,this movie was full of good clips but the songs on the soundtrack are not what i was looking for it is loaded with gansta rap if that is your style then this album is for you can anyone tell me what song is playing after the priests speech the lyrics go bless me father for i have sinned i can not find anything on this one at all,68,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4,positive,dmx and ll coolj really made this soundtrack a 4star-album but still there has a missing one not on th soundtrack does anyone remember the song when they are playin the crusaders when willy throws the last touchdown pass on the game there comes out a song going do you want to revolution whooah whooah do you want to revolution whooah whooah that songs also cool but no way to find out the musician nor the title can anybody tell me what it is,80,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,2,negative,after the quick moving blood pounding way in which the music is presented in the movie i was looking forward to having this cd in my car to roll and bounce down the highway alas that was not to be with the exception of the throbbingly insistent rhythm of jamie foxx any given sunday the disc has no continuity apparently the best cuts from all these tunes appeared in the film on the cd it just sounds like a mish-mash with no purpose other than to sell these not-even-the-best-of tunes from otherwise dynamic artists,94,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1,negative,fer cryin out loud the big songs in the film are not on this cd or on volume 2 maybe there will be a volume 3 the songs you expected and paid for edition,33,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5,positive,this is the ultimate trading soundtrack the first cd is worth the price admission for missy elliots who you going to call alone a rap song sampling mozarts requiem which lent gravitas to the opening sequences of the movie actually it seems that ollie stone is discovering his true talent as a music video montage editor much of the power of the film which is fun but not nearly so fun as his first venture into jump cut-mtv era film-making chaos natural born killers came from the steroid-pumped soundtrack without a doubt one of the best movie soundtracks ever put together almost as good as raw adrenaline,105,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4,positive,i am a dj from chicago and i love the song shutem down it is a song that will get you pumped up anyone who likes rap will love that song the rest of the cd is excptional,38,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,5,positive,you can decide for yourself whether or not you like the collection of songs however if you do order with confidence that this set has quality sounding cds and full length songs in spite of the cheesy super mario brothers-like graphics on the case,44,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,1,negative,if you think that you are going to get to hear them just like you fell in love with them at the time you will be let down it is the right people but redos and live performances is what you get vh,43,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,2,negative,the cd box set is a good value for three cds however what they do not tell you unless you look really hard on the bottom of the back of the box set that these are re-recorded hits by the original artists even although they are re-recorded by the original artists they do not sound the same use your own judgement but i was disappointed myself,64,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,5,positive,you can find the artist listing elsewhere on the internet if you search for it i have listened to sound snippets and these are original versions many of these songs however were not hits here in the us they were one hit wonders somewhere in europe uk and will probably be unfamiliar to us listeners this might be worth getting if you are interested in broadening your musical horizons if you are looking for a collection of all us hits that you know look elsewhere,83,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,1,negative,absolutely horrible there is no sample music and we have nowho the original artists are do not you hate when the radio does not tell you who sang that song that just played good job,35,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,5,positive,could you please tell me if this album has this particular song and artist on this album one hit wonders of the 70s please,24,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,1,negative,remakes or performed by different artists some are close to the originals but i do not think any of them are the originals,22,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,2,negative,this 2 disc set includes songs spanning from the 50s to the 90s and after listening to the online clips i thought i recognized some good music that i might have forgotten about even although i did not recognize most of the song titles on disc 2 wrong disc 1 has the only songs worthy of any substantive hit status get a job kansas city in the year 2525 life is a rock two classic rock instrumentals the happy organ sleepwalk the weirdly interesting the rapper and troglodyte disc 2 is just forgettable and faddish sounding the last four songs are 90s street sounding hip-hop with lyrics that barely escape the explicit label separately i would give disc 1 four stars and disc 2 one star,126,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,4,positive,i mainly purchased this cd for waiting for the stars to fall by boy meets girl which for some reason is really hard to find on cd to say that this collection is eclectic would be an understatement however it is still very enjoyable buy it before it goes out of print and the scalpers start charging fifty bucks for it,61,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,5,positive,i bought this cd for one track really dancing in the city and it has some great other tracks uptown top rankin and motorbike riding are brilliant,27,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,4,positive,for too long one hit wonder compilations have focused on the 60s 70s and 80s this one brings us up to date by showcasing the musical flashes in the pan over the past 25 years best of all these are the versions of the songs you remember unlike some of those horrible re-recorded versions you will come across on compilations from time to time this 2-cd set is guaranteed to have 2 or 3 perfect songs to include in your next party mix for laughs if nothing else however there are definitely are some that will get some booties on the dance floor,102,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,1,negative,the reason i purchased this cd was specifically to get the original tarzan boy by baltimora this is a hard-to-find piece of music not available on itunes or other services the version provided on this cd is not the original hit release rather a re-make by the group that adds a carribean steel band sound that makes the cut very different from the 80s hit the other songs on the cd sound to me to be the original hit releases so i got hosed on the one song i wanted from this,90,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00008WT18,2,negative,rerecorded hits by the original singer age makes a difference most of the songs are almost unrecognizable from the original hit,21,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5,positive,i first heard hawthorne heights ohio is for lovers on the radio and i decided that i would take a chance and buy the cd which is something i usually do not do it was the most worthwhile music purchase of my life from the first chords of life on standby to the haunting chords at the end of speeding up the octaves the whole album was unlike anything else i had ever seen the vocals of jt woodruff are unique and enthralling the guitars are amazing especially in the transition and silver bullet by far the best album of the year,101,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5,positive,read my reveiw for the original and you will see how much i loved it this is even better because hawthorne heights is one of the few bands that perform live very well the interveiws make it better but the songs are the reason i bought the first one and is the reason you should buy this however the specials are extremely awesome,62,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4,positive,i loved the song ohio is for lovers and bought the cd for that track but the rest of the songs are really good cynical yes but then again most emo music is the cd / dvd booklet has info on what they were thinking when they wrote the song a long with the lyrics which are wonderful over all great album i look forward to seeing what their next cd is like,71,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4,positive,great album got it for a friend as a gift but we listen to it together and i love it great album and wonderful song,25,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4,positive,niki fm rules many other songs here are good as well hh provides lots of slow n fast hi n lo light n heavy if you are wanting deep vocals and interesting lyrics mixed with riffs and rhythmn that run the spectrum this album is for you they remind me of silverstein quite a bit I am prolly a little old to be listening to this kind of music but I am young at heart and strong of soul i say 4,80,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1,negative,first of all I had like to say that i like taking back sunday brand new from autumn to ashes early dashboard confessional and other things of that nature and still can not stomach this at all it is complete disposable trash that seems to even be soon forgotten by fans ohio is for lovers was a catchy enough tune but this music is just wayyy too suburban privalaged white kid cuts themsleve feels alienated wears black crys no one understands woe is me I had rather write 10 pages in my live journal about suicide then actually killing myself self indulgent black eyliner hot topic trl neo-goth garbage if you are offended by any of this you should check out my chemical romances album i brought you my bullets you brought me your love which i actually like because it actually more effectivly and artisiclly captures this mood all lyrical criticisms aside the music is not good either,154,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5,positive,i was sold this cd / dvd off of amazon and some loser gave me the two discs in other blank paper cases like there was no case at all it was listed as a used very goodand i really can not find anywhere to beat the crap out of this guy for cheating me i do not usually buy albums but i was compelled to buy this one just because hawthorne heights is amazing and i wanted to support them,79,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5,positive,not only the cd but also the dvd are amazing the cd includes demo versions acoustic versions and a song as a day in the life,26,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4,positive,stop the hate everybody this is an emo / screamo band I have heard this album many times before god bless mp3s and i am actually about to buy it to pass my time in afghanistan granted my favorite songs are the singles it is still a good album and just my two cents from a black kid who listens to anything from ti and jurassic 5 to avenged sevenfold escape the fate chiodos rise against 3 of 4 albums thursday tbs to the forecast and billy talent check these two out i definitely would say if you want to rock out give this album a shot everybody loves a lil bit screaming mixed with depression,110,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5,positive,i love these guys ever since i saw them at house of blues here in myrtle in 05 my favorite i am also a huge senses failed and sum 41 and unwritten law fan i saw them all together 2 years ago since then i have bought all 2 cds yes there is 3 they had a band before with a difference name before they signed with new label i have seen them in concert 2 times i also play guitar and am in a band and i love the hard hitting riffs and picks scrapes and mutes they really give the songs meaning i love thesingers voice to it is great for this type of music i would reccomend to anyone who is into any kind of rock to pick this one up,135,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1,negative,my girlfriend bought this when it came out and unwillingly i have listened to it nonstop since my opinion is that this is nothing but a bunch of depressed emo whining about ex-girlfriends if a girl gets you that depressed you are a dam fool who should just off yourself the whole emo scene just pisses me off all they do is whine and complain i like my music with a positive message or a socially aware or a pissed off message like madball vision of disorder hatebreed biohazard stuff like that albums that people should check out instead of this would be biohazard urban discipline madball set it off madball demonstrate my style vision of disorder self titled,119,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,2,negative,very very very cliched emo / screamo the guy that tries too hard to scream is ugly which kills a percentage of hh every song sounds the same very slow with crappy lyrics transition blue burns orange and niki fm are the only decent songs ohio is good but very played out and hh playing on trl killed their trying to be hardcore image sorry hh but now i know why ohio has hardly any rock bands,73,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1,negative,ok first of all i hate emo music i hate punk rock and now i get the opportunity to hate this band too a buddy of mine recommended this cd to me he said it is awesome they really are good i promise you will like them they are soo hardcore being the idiot i was i actually believed him and bought it i listened to about 10 seconds of every song speaks for itself all i have to say is that this is the most expensive frisbee i have ever bought but on the upside since my friend lied to me i get to kick him right square in his gooch if you like this then try slitting your wrist with a rusty soda can you would probly like that too that is if you have not already from exposing yourself to this joke of a rock band,146,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,2,negative,the stand alone album gets 3-stars in my book but the live material which you are paying extra for here features some rather badly done vocal work by the band i even felt emberassed for them the first time i watched it the acoustic versions of the songs are nice but nothing to write home about also the albums jacket has a new feature which has the band systematically explaining the meaning behind each of the songs and even addresses ohio is for lovers infamous so slit my wrists and black my eyes line which is more of a figurative comment than a literal one in either case the album is medicore at best there are a handful of catchy songs like ohio is for lovers the transition silver bullet and orange burns blue but there is not anything terribly engaging here the entire time i felt myself longing to switch my mp3 players album selection to thursday time and time again I am not sure why although i think thursday has a more refined sound or something i can not quite put my finger on it,184,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1,negative,no I am not kidding somebody actually had the nerve to call hawthorne heights a modern hardcore classic yeah you just keep thinking that okay meanwhile the rest of us will stick to the real modern classics like thursdays war all the time underoaths they are only chasing saftey or emerys the weaks end modern hxc classic ha that is funny,58,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1,negative,i have to admit this band is a good introduction if your not used to screaming however after you have heard one song from a good band like silverstein from first to last alexisonfire ect ect you should never ever listen to this cd again the songs are all very basic and the lyrics are all very repetitive when your trying to act like your a decent screamo band and the majority of your fans are 13 year old girls who are all like oh my god i 3 hawthorne heights ohio is for lovers roxors then you have got a problem anyway if your a 12 - 14 year old girl this is the album for you if your a guy and you like this album give it time you will realize just how absolutly piss poor it is,133,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this is the best piece of work you have ever put out and i have been listening to your music good and bad since 1969 tasty guitar chops and music with a groove,32,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,do not expect ercic clapton guitar god on this one pick up from the cradle journeyman and more if you are looking for that eric the eric on back home returns to the classic laid back feel displayed on 461 ocean boulevard slowhand and more this is a catharthic experience for clapton and his soul cleansing comes through in an honest and soulful way listen to say what you will and run home to me and you will hear it first hand there are also some excellent covers of love comes to everyone g harrison and love do not love nobody spinners pick this one up and sit back and enjoy your visit to ecs home you might not want to leave,114,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,although i may not have been born when during claptons heyday i am definatley a huge fan this album being his first album of new material in 4 years is definatley worth picking up clapton covers everything from r b tunes to reggae to classic clapton blues definatley one for fans of the 90s clapton although the rest of us can still appreciate it it is clapton after all I shall see you all on his 2006 world tour,77,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,eric clapton is a great guitar player but he has been making the same album over over over againvocally i are not never really felt him too muchthe songwriting is alrightthe arrangements overall musicianship here is real polished but is lacking any feeling on a whole eric clapton found a niche a while back stayed with it has worked for himbut it just makes for another run of the mill album,64,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,as a fan of he shall bent ear splitting raging guitar i can certainly see why some people would think this is not a fine production from guitar god eric clapton but those people are 14 years old and wrong this is a fine cd with a range of music on it including gospel reggae ballad good old rock n roll and more it is quite clear from reading ecs book and listening to this cd that clapton has indeed found himself a home he is comfortable with as a man and that has led to his mellowing as a musician do not get me wrong i love claptons strung-out-I am-a-junkie stuff the same as the next guy there is not a piece on this cd with a guitar solo that holds a candle to the solo in badge for instance or crossroads there are however some soaring moments where he rips it up pretty good and i think every song on it is good some even great do not let the fact that you will not instantaneously love every note on this cd prevent you from buying it it is definitely his best effort in years,188,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,this is the musical equivalent of having to look at photos of someone elses kids it is nice that life has improved for eric he has had very rough times in the past so he deserves it and he obviously loves his children but great music usually comes from hungry tormented artists the giveaways string arrangements the kiss of death for any hope of edginess in rock jazz or blues despite the all-star line-up of great musicians including robert randolph john mayer and the late great billy preston this album is about as interesting as ansalad sandwich,97,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,i have about everything eric clapton has recorded and some of my favorite songs are on this cd this is a more laid-back reflective clapton similar to his pilgrim reptile and unplugged cds it reflects the other ec that some of his long-time fans like me treasure along with his blues cds there has not as much sizzling guitar here although you might check out one day to hear the master playing blues guitar as good as it gets but there has a lot more depth perhap it is because I have heard after midnight cocaine layla and more about 100 times more than i needed to or perhaps it is because I am about his age and and past needing adrenalin rushes but i like this eric clapton a lot he has more subtle thoughtful and blues-y he has more of the ensemble musician he always wanted to be ec grew up deal with it,147,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this is good stuff his cover of love comes to everyone led me to buy the george harrisons original only to find out that eric plays the opening riffs,29,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,for about the first time I have found amazon out-priced this cd is available at best buy for 1399 i do almost all my shopping here but from now on I shall be more careful with comparison shopping before placing an order,40,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,the lyrics might as well of come from a pleasant housewife shortly after digesting a particularly interesting issue of people magazine this album is squarely for people who enjoy pasteurized reggae pat boone soul and musak blues the production is glossy unbearably plastic impersonations of lively musicianship in short the album has no soul this music is best enjoyed while chatting with your elderly aunts and uncles over crackers and cheap imitation cheese avoid at all costs and enjoy your shopping experience,82,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this is a different clapton album it is not string bending blues but it is good music so he decided to do something different if you want crossroads buy the record i have been a fan since i was a teen a while ago and i dare say i have every ec album this guy has been around for more than forty years and he is like fine wine he just keeps getting better he is happy he has a family he is sober what is wrong with that doug mizell,91,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,i give it two stars just because it is clapton but this record is a cure for insomnia in short this album is one of claptons worst ever,27,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,some people have a problem with eric claptons solo career because he has a habit of releasing lots of uninteresting laid back music back home has a really good song called revolution that is groovy and influenced by reggae it is worth owning for this song alone,45,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,the sound of this album is very relaxed and joyful eric looses his shoulder round into a comfortable slope it is nicely laid back yet has some vitality,28,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,clapton has evolved and is writing good songs that reflect maturity both musically and personally i have seen clapton live and it is this newer material in which he shines and plays the most passionately this album is mostly soul / blues songs mixed with a few acoustic numbers all are well written and claptons guitar comes through distinctly and soulfully the best songs with classic clapton guitar solos are one day and run home to me for me i like to hear lyrically soulful songs reflecting something real like longing and family and then have clapton apply his guitar expertise bringing these songs to an emotional head for those longing for the old clapton it was and is great material but the man has evolved,122,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,clapton took a beating for this cd it was given mediocre status at best by critics and fans alike why do we want our artists to be sin eaters clapton happy is clapton happy are not we happy for him okay fair is fair the opening track is a little self absorbed and weak the musicianship rocks but the lyrics are trite the second one is not much better after this although the cd really picks up the songs are well crafted the lyrics do not swerve back into limbo territory piece of my heart is better than any sway love song I have heard in a while although we are not living in romantic times back home the finishing set does confirm that clapton has been on quite a journey but he has ready to put aside the weary journeyman in favor of the settled stable soul what has wrong with that this cd is not erics best but it is also not a throw-away open your mind and let clapton open his heart,171,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is not it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and claptons comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is not one of them I am glad clapton is now in a happy place and deservedly so but this cd just does not do it for me,98,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,i find this to be a very good album the first two songs are really wonderful and clapton also does a great cover of george harrisons love come to everyone the song revolution is also among the best tracks here i really do not understand all those negative reviews must clapton remain in a narrow musical niche and always give us the same as before clapton wears his maturity well on this cd as this time he offers us something a little different from straighforward rock reggae or blues I have looked forward to playing it every day since i purchsed it to each his own,105,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,what is the joke how are coffee and eric clapton alike they both suck without cream well i do not go that far eric has made some really great albums primarily in the 1970s but still this album is such watered down and contrived garbage that it is impossible to listen to without getting I shall primarily because the man behind this music is so talented and capable of so much more i actually took this to record store to sell and the guy passed saying they had too many of this one stocked,92,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,that is what i feel after listening to this album blah i tried very hard to find this records groove but easy listening music is not my thing ec the guitar god is most certainly alseep if not totally dead the few times i heard his stratocaster come alive the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference the music itself is lackluster and uninspiring there are no stand-out tracks and every song sounds like it could have been written by any amateur songwriter with such a great backing band and top-notch guests this record should have caught fire and burned strong the only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production to me it looks like ec has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing very sad,141,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this cd is a must to add to your cd collection i own almost every cd of ecs and back home is awesome yes we will always love cocaine sunshine of your love and layla all my personal favorites but be open to his new stuff it is still eric and it is still great music,52,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this is the master at work great songwirting great music and superb performance these are songs that will stay with us and bear repeated listening the cd is filled with new classics this is clapton at his peak of musicianship tasteful upbeat and a joy to listen to forget the naysayers if you like clapton get this one,58,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,I am glad ec is happy but sometimes tragedy youth and passion is able to make music alive and meaningful with feelings now he has playing the home scene at 60 years old this is pleasant pop but not rock maybe at 60 I shall crave easy listening too it is a nice package with a 51 dvd version in a dual disc with a normal cd mix at the moment on amazon there are 158 used copies available some under 3 so what does that tell you for that price it is ok but do not expect the usual guitar licks or pyrotechnics,97,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,surprised that this is not your classic clapton but back home is not a bad disc i think that it is about time that he has taking aback from the every day stuff that is been broadcasted over the airwaves do not get me wrong i own everything clapton but it is time to let him do what makes him comfortable how many of you were not fans of his nothing but the blues personally i thought that was the man doing what he loved best playn the blues so if you do not care for this one pull out an old commercial airwave tune and enjoy ec is still putting out the tunes,107,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,eric clapton is 60 something let him the alone if you do not like his output here go listen to wheels of fire for the zillionth time and pretend that half of it is not dated and boring listen to the album in it is proper context he has earned the right to make the music that he wants you have the right to take it or leave it he has not doing another layla ever and he does not have to do one the music here is good period enjoy it if your head is not messed up on clapton mythology,98,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,it is true eric claptons best performances are when he is singing and playing the blues his cutting guitar licks and passionate vocals on previous releses like disraeli gears layla and other love songs and from the cradle are certainly great a performances however back home erics newest release evokes a different side of the man the mood is a jovial one with some spunk and spirit thrown in for good measure some folks say that erics guitar is quite muffled i partially disagree as such songs as one day and lost and found feature some good guitar embelleshments i appreciate several other tunes that show eric in a happy go luck spirit maybe this release is not quite erics best material but i have to say that it is nice to see a different tone to this true legend of contemporary music,141,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,with back home eric clapton has released an easy listening album the question is why would anyone listen to eric clapton for sappy pop music his talent is his guitar not his voice if i wanted pop i would listen to paul mccartney erics voice is okay but not great and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here it does not compare to his better cds in any way i know that clapton has nothing against pop he has played with every one of the beatles at concerts and is featured on george harrisons solo albums with george and ringo however he can not sing a pop song like george can and on this cd he does not play the guitar as well as george and eric did on their classic collaborations like while my guitar gently weeps and badge i hope his next studio cd is a cream re-union album like the recent cream re-union concert perhaps going back to playing the guitar while jack bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut,177,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,before this album came out eric said he wanted to make a rock pop album i thought he might have done something along the lines of his first solo album from 1970 that was one of his finest this one is a pointless stinker no inventive guitar playing or memorable songs two stars because he is clapton but no more than that,62,27
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this album is very journeyman-esque another brilliant effort by one of the greatest guitarists to ever grace this earth there is nothing here to criticize,25,28
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,i think this album features some of the best music he has ever done it has a smooth sound smooth blues i would like to see more music produced like this,32,29
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,this is not a rockin eric clapton cd but it is an excellently sung listening cd eric claptons singing will surprise those who carefully listen to this very personal cd it is eric claptons vocals that highlight this work eric clapton lists his influences in the cd booklet and states that these artists have taught him to listen from the results in this cd we hear that eric clapton is an excellent listener eric claptons guitar work is exeptional as always but does not stand out like his vocals mr claptons playing is very good as always,97,30
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,claptons inspiration has been replaced by some new boring forgettable elevator songs I am sorry to say that reptile was a very good soft album for me this one not i can not imagine clapton playing these songs on stage hope the set of his 2006 tour will not be only based on this album maybe this time you should try a cream reissue show on dvd,68,31
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,i have collected most of claptons albums for the past 20 years and believe back home is one his best ever there is wide diversity in the genre not just blues which I have come to expect and enjoy but a mix of reggae stevie wonder influences and just generally upbeat tunes the guitar solo on one day is awesome and his tribute to george harrison is reminiscent of the layla episode recommended without any reservation,75,32
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,I shall sum all these back home supporters andsayers if you liked reptile then you will like this i put them in my cd player and play them one after another like a two cd album and it works i like them both not five stars because a lot of his acoustic and electric guitar work gets drowned out by background singers and production if you do not have a good stereo system most people do these days you will miss the suttle strings,80,33
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,eric clapton is a true artist singer songwriter and above all guitar player art is in the eye or in this case ear of the beholder i would not want my clapton music to be the same thing over and over that is what acdc u2 and rap music is for this artist is worth every bit of the hype and myth that is ever been told and this cd is as good as he has ever been do not listen to the whiners get this cd and enjoy something different and good,91,34
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,while being a perfectly decent workmanlike little collection of songs some even written by himself there is absolutely nothing special about this disc nothing to recommend it he is for quite obvious reasons a guitar icon so you always have to tune in just in case but this I am afraid is not going to be the one to break the somnambulistic spell cast by so many of his recent efforts,68,35
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,it does my heart good to see clapton enjoying life and this release reflects just that do yourself a favor pick up this disc listen without prejudice sorry folks this is not layla and enjoy life with him you will be glad you did god bless you eric,47,36
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,after one listen particularly after the jigging so tired i started liking this album immediately it is an easy-listening / bluesy album about love introspection back home comes to mind family and belonging i do not understand why people only listen to just eric claptons guitar and not his vocal the singers vocal as well as his / her instrument is what sets the mood for the song just like that saying in death of a salesman it is not what you say it is how you say it and here eric clapton says it well he has happy he has living life to it is fullest and he wants his audience to know it a person does not always have to be depressed in order to make good music eric clapton is one of thee best musicians that have ever lived next to bob dylan give the man a break,140,37
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,i have been a fan of eric clapton since he was in cream and have every one of his cds i think that mr clapton has earned the right to let his fans know that he has found love and happiness in his beautiful wife and children i think he has accomplished that without being untrue to his roots i for one and happy that he has found happiness and i am enjoying this toe-tapping cd,76,38
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,hey everyone even eric is allowed to make a buck after listening to this disc that is the conclusion i came to i can only speak for myself but i do not listen to eric to hear him sing i listen to hear him play his guitar the guitar playing is almost non-existent the mix on the vocals and other instruments drowns him out when he does play the songs are ok but none of them really stand out if i could return this disc i would i know i will not be listening to it i was glad when i heard eric was doing something new and not just another pale imitation of robert johnson but this has no bite i just can not believe that when they listened to this prior to releasing it they thought it was good i guess I shall just have to listen to the beano album,148,39
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,the brown shoes should have been enough of a give away ec phoned this one in,15,40
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,while listening to this cd it becomes obvious that mr clapton is in a much happier place these days and I am honestly happy about that although that can influence some guys to write great music it seems to not be the case with this one at this point in time i bought this without hearing it first a major no-no of mine for obvious reasons and once again i have been taught why that is never a goodif you have enjoyed bluesy guitar heavy tunes of erics in the past you will not find even one of them here the guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out in my humble opinion with the exception of the first song the entire thing well stinks i wish him the best with it although maybe it will strike a chord with somebody else,145,41
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,eric clapton is my favorite musician period so needless to say i always look forward to a new ec album it seems however that after winning a million grammys for unplugged eric has forgotten how to rock do not get me wrong i love some of erics acoustic work unfortunately this album sounds like something an artist puts out when they are contractually obligated to put out so many albums and the record company is pestering you for something and you just want to get them off of your back hopefully the recent reunion with cream will inspire ec to return back home to rock,102,42
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,if you wanted something like unplugged for goodness sake do not buy this album it is just not wonderful i think that i will give it away if i can find anyone who wants it,34,43
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,i have to admit i almost completely stopped listening to ec about 30 years ago there have been moments of excelence me and mr johnson riding with king unplugged and just one night however after ec first solo cd things went downhill and have continued to slide ever since eric needs to play the blues to sound good not 461 ocean boulevard or the other nonsense he has recorded over the years this cd is no exception it fits in with the majority of his past work i used to think clapton really appreciated the blues if you want real blues go buy john hammond or charlie musselwhite john lee hooker and more and as far as clapton being the god of guitar open your ears to sonny landreth al dimeola john hammond ry cooder jeff beck and the list goes on and on sorry eric glad i just listened to this and never bought it,152,44
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,a few decent tracks such as george harrisons love comes to everyone however for the most part ec sings to sub standard r b ballads which may work for some but not for slowhand in addition the first track slowly ends with a baby crying back home is a long way from 461 ocean boulevard eric you can do better than this,61,45
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,if you buy this disc buy is used get it cheap because its booooorrrrriiiiinnnnnggggg this guy used to be god now it is very sweet very nice songs about sweet nice things and no guitar that is like watching shaq bowl maybe it peaks your interest for a second but it is not worth much energy to pursue i kept waiting and waiting for something akin to guitar buzz rifts something nope not here let us go bowling i can not recall being this disappointed in a disc cepting for santanas new one which is even worse retire gentlemen let someone else play they may actually want to,113,46
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,I shall be brief and blunt the new ec disc is slick clean and rather pedestrian i have been a loyal follower and fan of ec since first hearing cream on los angeless first free-form fm radio station in the mid-late 60s i believe he has always been and is now a stellar artist so it is not without some perspective that i opine on this recent effort the references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album on a record album i think no after realizing that what i heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix i really had a hard time going through the remaining material it is a little too sappy it is wonderful he is happy and i suppose for some many it is pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music I shall lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier no i do not believe his material has to be dark or that he has to maintain the tormented artist persona but this is a bit too far up on the happy-meter,187,47
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,it sounds almost like clapton woke up in the 70s when he made this album and not the 70s according to eric clapton and cream but the lame stereotypical 70s i love much of his stuff but this not so much,41,48
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,i never thought i would write something like this is a very nice album about eric clapton however it really seems as if he has found some peace and some sense of home and family as usual there is excellent production and musicianship but as others have noted his guitar playing takes a back seat this go around eric has often changed direction style and challenged himself to bare his feelings and this album is significant in that it displays where he is as a human being today the fact that he played again with john mayall and regrouped with cream shows that he has come to termes with who and where he is as as a musician and is not content to just put out expected product not for everyone but great work as usual,135,49
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,eric the singer takes precedence over clapton the magician guitarist and what you get is an extremely ordinary set of songs thar eminently forgettable sorry eric but the intensity that blackie had is entirely missing from this new album,39,50
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,it is hard to improve on clapton but he has managed to out-do himself with this one the music and the story line of the songs go rightthe heart,30,51
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,eric clapton truly has a golden voice and is one of the tastiest guitar players around but this cd with lots of horns added electronics and backing vocals sounds like a good r b album for music on hold elevator music there is one good song on the album one day eric clapton needs to get some sleep and do an album by himself i think this album would have been much better and most people would have enjoyed this album if it was just eric and an acoustic guitar on it,92,52
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,sixty-year-old eric clapton is rocking a little harder again he hardly rocked hard on 2001s reptile this album features one track personally penned by clapton another was written by his late friend ex-beatle george harrison some songs clapton wrote with simon climie who both collaborated on 1998s pilgrim one song has an unusual key change it goes from c to d flat then b flat in certain aspects some songs are similar to those on reptile very good album although hey ec fans would be surprised to know those who did not that clapton reunited with jack bruce and ginger baker for several concerts in may the threesome is known as cream who had a string of hits between 1966 and 1969 cream disbanded in 1969 due to the strain of all three members being major stars individually the reunion concerts inspired the recording of an album and a dvd counterpart those who read and understand music would immediately figure this out,154,53
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,something new from ec again mellowing with age he always comes through,11,54
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,in classic clapton fashion mr guitar god has done it again this album delivers more of the proved formula delivered in recent albums like reptile and pilgrim in there is a mix of pop sounds with some blues for us blues hungry i must say i am entirely satisfied with this latest delivery now i can only expect the next which i hope will be another blues cd,68,55
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,why bother to record stuff he most certainly makes up as he goes along jamming where are the songs and if you do not have any songs why the super laid back delivery this record makes me want to go to sleeeeeeep last album mr johnson was all that this album is not this is not back home that was the last album the new one is back in reverse,69,56
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,as a lifelong eric clapton fan I am dissappointed in thie effort or should i say lack of effort eric must have owed the record company an album so he gave them this eric is at his best playing blues because that is were his heart is eric follow your heart,49,57
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,i find this to be one of erics most unique soulful works of all time it is filled with the type of love songs that he admired george harrison for those simple from the heart love songs about what has most important in his life I am a die-hard fan so i had some trepidation too as I have heard from others but it is quite refreshing to hear this side of him and the dvd side of the dualdisc gives you anabout what he was thinking when he wrote the songs i recommend you buy that version who would not be happy for him i know i am i find myself anxious to listen to this album again and again,118,58
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,while i would be willing to listen to clapton play twinkle twinkle little star in the blues mode i find this album is a little more pop than blues or rock i prefer the straight out old fashioned blues guitar from clapton but this is definitely an enjoyable cd,48,59
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,if your a clapton fan you will not be disapointed,9,60
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,if like me you found mr clapton sublime and in the pocket with unplugged me and mr johnson and riding with the king his duet with bb be careful before you purchase this album this is an imitative pastiche of recently fashionable pop cliches 20 years ago for some and 10 years ago for others aside from a couple of nifty flourishes nothing distinguishes this album it sounds like clapton doing kareoke he even cops a lionel ritchie / soul chick groove on one song it is horrible even although his pipes are up to the required high notes so you might want to sit this one out he will be back,109,61
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,having read the reviews i have to say that i am disapponted in how much the reviewers are ripping eric clapton if they are true fans then they ought to realize that clapton is probably the only artist not content to stay within one genre of music he can move easily in and out of reggae blues r b and others i think this album is a very strong album it has some great tunes like one day love do not love nobody and heaven on revolution calpton has been able to duplicate bob marley and the wailers not an easy thing to do so when you listen to the album please keep in mind that clapton wants to show how happy he is in his life and that he is not content to be a one trick pony,137,62
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,unfortunately i have to agree with all the other reviewers have had to say i have been an eric fan since the start i even went to see the graffiti you know the one this is not the worst eric cd but only because i can not bring myself to making it his worst like others I am glad he has happy at last but this purile stuff is not what the fans want i really do want to hear the strat scream just one more time please god let the albert hall recordings do the job,94,63
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,his weakest cd yet in my opinion maybe he has just got tired over the years very slow and toned down i hope he gets back to more blues type music a little disappointing,34,64
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,a very poppy cd with the girl singers back unfortunately sounds more like his early 80s stuff which i found back then to be his worst stuff i guess eric can not please everyone but this cd is a real downer very little guitar solos however erics voice is great,49,65
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,this album is pretty damn good it may not be up to claptons standards but it is near impossible to overcome his stuff when he was in his prime this album would be good and rated highly if it was released by any other artists today but the artist is the factor that changes the grade please judge my music not by the artists past click yes if you agree with me no if you do not please be honest,75,66
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,this is the track listing on ecs home page 1 so tired 2 say what you will 3 going left 4 love do not love nobody 5 revolution 6 lost and found 7 heaven 8 love comes to everyone 9 one day 10 one track mind 11 run home to me 12 back home track 7 on the cd being sold is incomplete and track 8 is not the same title,70,67
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,diet pop corn is the best way to describe this cd it has nothing sweet sounding is made from hot air and is corny it is almost like clapton is the saturday morning cartoon version of himself i understand the song subjects are important to him but it is tiresome and boring and is not worthy of such a legend the first song on the disc so tired pretty much sums up the rest of the cd either he has tired or just damn lazy if this were a james taylor album i would say it is pretty good but as an eric clapton album it blows,103,68
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,a great contemporary recording of todays themes as expected i felt cheated when eric and bb got together to do covers i expected the greats to come up with new and improved old blues who cares about slow hand or 461 ocean blvd or layla or cream or blues breakers when it is already out there to savour and enjoy we want new and improved old blues and this is what back home is all about being awe respect combined with talent and wonder again by a classic musician and his electric and acoustic guitars great comeback,108,69
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,he has played for decades and this is his 20th or something solo album after the supergroups of yardbirds bluesbreakers blind faith dominoes and cream he has told stories through his songs like layla tears in heaven circus and more and back home album is no exception clapton penned opening track so tired fits this personal stories list as well as the rest of the tunes on the album musically it is soulful than ever with traditional sounds and instruments like guitars hammond organ horns and so on covers from george harrison spinners and stevie wonder blends in and the playing is sharp and a joy to listen this album continues the feeling of recent albums reptile and one more car with the same musicians and a laid-back electric-unplugged like clapton himself described reptile sounding tunes,120,70
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,very disappointed in this effort by clapton painful listening I shall take his blues efforts anyday this is as boring as it gets,22,71
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,yes i am a diehard clapton fan and i too was hoping for a bring the walls down rock and blues album but this is an excellent piece of work vocally ec is at his best the variety of styles keeps the album moving i was actually surprised each time a new track started because each song was so different the lyrics are beautiful as well as meaningful the guitar work although subtle most of the time is still excellent if you do not like the soulful sound of love do not love nobody then apparently you just do not like music I am going left is also outstanding no need writing about each song it is a great cd with maybe 2 weak songs the limited edition dual disc is well worth the money the ec interview adds insight to the album,138,72
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,crap without inspiration and repeats themes and musical patterns built by the record industry,14,73
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,what is goin on here thank god i did not buy this pitiful attempt of music my poor friend did buy it and asked me to listen i told him it might serve better as a coaster for his beer glass so his wife does not get upset for leaving rings on the furniture what is clapton doing i believe in the past ten years he has been steeped in banality but this offering is horrific please listen to the bluesbreakers with eric clapton for a true understanding of this mans brilliance layla for some of his best songwriting and vocal phrasings i never thought i could ever think this let alone express it but mr clapton please put away your guitar until you once again discover inspiration you are embarrassing yourself and tarnishing your legacy it breaks my heart to make these comments but at least my friends wife will be happy peace,152,74
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,has the man who blistered our ears with mayall and cream both the original and the recent reunion shows who stood toe-to-toe with duane who shared the spotlight with the lesser-known-but-perhaps-more-talented albert lee and with various authentic bluesmen and who is capable of so much more than just mailing in stuff like this listless set of elevator music fallen under the spell of a mind controlling cult has he been seen with tom cruise surrounded himself with too many yes men and women or simply gone over to the bland side a fate worse than the dark side and a place where rock and blues have been eviscerated by a music industry that shares more than it might imagine with factory farming where animals live short miserable lives cannibalizing the otherwise unusable scraps of their predecessors,136,75
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,when i was introduced to clapton through from the cradle my jaw dropped that was the kind of blues that my soul melted under unfortunately back home is not even 1 of what from the cradle was i was so disappointed when i listened to a steady stream of happy go lucky bouncy tracks that it reminded me when someone somehow slipped me one of his early cream creations and me thinking that i was about to listen to an early blues band i hope the next record he releases will have some b ls,94,76
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,when back home was released music critic stephen thomas erlewine sarcastically remarked that the album is just about being home which if the center photo of clapton at home with his three young daughters and wife is to be believed looks alarmingly similar to the set of thomas the tank engine complete with a painted rainbow shining through the window that just about says it all eric clapton is a highly professional musician backed by a competent band you can put this album on and not one of your guests will be offended chances are they will not really notice it at all this is slick nondescript and utterly harmless pop music and if that is your thing go get it right away just do not confuse this man with the eric clapton of the 60s and early 70s the eric clapton who played the blues and lamented the fact that his voice was not loud gruff and whiskey-hoarsened like howlin wolfs stop quoting stephen as if his opinion holds alot of weight any one that gives 4 and 5 stars to the likes of ashlee simpson is an idiot and that is what erlewine did he is a moronic reviewer,195,77
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,back home finds eric clapton espousing on the joys of being at home with his family while he deserves domestic happiness the album harkens back to his worst commercial instincts sounding very much like the mor sounds of his worst efforts like august and pilgrim the album has a professional and over-produced sound that is perfectly made for adult contemporary radio the one highlight is the thoughtful and loving cover of mr claptons good friend george harrisons love comes to everyone it is an obscure album track from 1979s george harrison album and mr clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to mr harrison too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore,124,78
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,let us face it you purchase a clapton cd to hear him rip away with some blues but alas on this cd he tries to do much and that leads him astray from his roots the result is a big dissappointment i would much rather have had a cd come out of the crossroads guitar festival dvd then this and i am really looking forward to the cream reunion cd that is scheduled to come out next month skip this cd and buy just the good songs on itunes,88,79
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,eric clapton is not just a muscian he has my friend for over 30 years his music has formed much of the soundtrack of my life from the angst ridden power of layla expressing my own pain with unrequited love to the generational passion of fathers eyes precisely describing my feelings as both a son and a father of two sons in back home we find an eric clapton who has found joy in family and as one friend to another i say good job and thanks for letting us share that joy the first release revolution has a feel similiar to i shot the sheriff and the george harrison love comes to everyone brings to mind the stage full of incredible muscians that was the concert for george but the best songs of the cd are the title track and run home to me sounding like river of tears it is packed with emotion and again as a father i can not help but wanting to remind both of my sons that they can always run back home thanks eric for sharing your life with us the pain the hard journey and now the joy,192,80
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,it seems that eric clapton has been working more in the past several years than most veteran rock / blues musicians of his generation rather than resting on his previous success all this and with a rather young family on back home clapton shows us just how versatile he has become switching from playing old blues songs as on his two previous releases to more modern current trends in music like on back home i enjoyed the variation of material on this disc his guitar does take a back seat to his vocals but his vocals are in top form throughout the disc the band and the recording mix is supurb since i like his vocals as much as his guitar playing i rate this disc a winner,126,81
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,anyone who has followed eric claptons career or seriously collected his music knows that this is an artist who faithfully follows his heart his body of work spans musical styles and every human emotion his 1998 album pilgrim was an entire album about heartbreak and lost love back home is a joyful upbeat album about found love eric is finally at peace and content in his life and his latest album reflects that as much as i admire eric clapton the blues interpreter and rock guitarist i deeply appreciate eric clapton the loving father and husband and musical craftsman back home is a rich and fulfilling product of the latter the songs on back home are exquisitely produced and energetic many of the tracks include memorable hooks and melodies something sorely missing from modern popular music and there are intimate lyrics that lie bare the heart of the artist ultimately this is a very courageous album to produce will love and joy sell to eric claptons audience maybe maybe not but as the songs on this album attest the most important things in life can be found back home and that is where eric claptons heart is today,198,82
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,message to eric clapton you are still one of the greatest rock / blues guitarists to ever grasp a pick we do not buy your music to listen to you sing melancholy love songs we want to hear you play the guitar with some grit and gusto i can not wait to purchase the albert hall reunion dvd to see you at your best,59,83
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,I am a big big clapton fan and i have to say this is a totally forgetable album of muzak eric where has the,23,84
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,hey I am from dallas tx and have been a huge clapton fan ever since i was 5 years old in 1990 i think that this is an absolutely wonderful album highlights for me include so tired love do not love nobody love comes to everyone one day lost and found and back home all the songs are great and I am really glad that claptons singing happy songs because he has in that part of his life right now and i really admire him for wanting to be with his family he deserves that but I shall be glad when he goes on tour for this album because i want to hear these songs live anyway I shall close now by saying that i love claptons music and hopefully I shall meet him someday,128,85
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,3 stars for the album and 4 1/2 for the dvd side high resolution audio not one of erics best efforts but a very comforting album mostly dedicated to the songwriters he admires most over the years and to his family if you are a clapton fan and have learned not to expect too much you will enjoy it i bought the dualdisc version and am very impressed with the audio quality on the dvd side which for once is in real dvd-audio both 2 channel and 51 surround using 24 bit sampled at 48khz this is so welcome since most dvd sides on dualdiscs only provide dolby digital sound which is way too compressed,113,86
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,after buying back home i was somewhat dissapointed after a first listen i loved claptons me and mr johnson stuff and I am the first one to jump on his derek and the dominoes cream and blues stuff this cd does not represent that side of him however after a second listen through i realized that there is much to love here if you are a soft rock clapton fan this cd is very eclectic jumping from reggae and soft rock to r b and blues many sweet sounding songs that work well together on the album definately worth a listen and i think I shall like it even better a third time through,112,87
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,clapton is out of his melancholy mood here nice backup musicians too i enjoyed it the first time i listened to it,22,88
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,eric clapton with his usual fine entourage of studio musicians has given us a real mixed bag of material on his latest release back home i found it very uneven with clapton sounding like he is lost in this musical maze having been a fan of clapton from the start of his career i always got the impression that his comfort zone was as a session musician a member this release has some fine moments but in my opinion it is a mediocre effort from an otherwise great musician and his talented crew,86,89
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,eric claptons new cd for about a month that is all i thought about and when i first heard the song revolution i knew this cd was not gon na be like his early stuff it would appear as if the rock out guitar soloing days are over but that is ok with me in his interviews he talks about how he has really happy right now with his life any fan of his would know that that is all that matters he has playing how he feels and it makes me wonder why all these people are complaining about it being to pop and stuff he has writing about he feels if u just really do not like this album maybe you should think are you really an eric clapton fan now with all of this that i have to say why only give it 4 stars because i do not think it is his best but it is up there there are many enjoyable songs on here at as much blues as some of his other latest cds but again i sure do not mind,174,90
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,clapton is one of my favorite artists primarily because of his blues background which is a strong influence on his best albums with the outstanding recent robert johnson sessions i was expecting something exciting but this is not exciting or for the most part even interesting it is okay but not good if you are a clapton fan you may enjoy it or at least a couple of the tracks all in all it is a bit of a dissappointment too michael boltonish a little sappy your mom would probably think this was a pretty good record i look forward to the next clapton release,107,91
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,I am a clapton fan because of his blues / rock background the songs on this albums are not even good pop songs i was totally disappointed when i listened to this album because i listened to it objectively if you did not know it was clapton this cd would not get any 5 star reviews the ec fan club might enjoy it but do not buy this album thinking it will be anything you would want to listen to more than once,75,92
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,i agree with the guy who said this simon climie messes up everything just listen to pilgram it is not very good as soon as i saw his name i thought another album ruined every once in a while clapton turns out a good album from the cradle journeyman money and cigerettes and more the day he decided the guitar would not be the main focus things went south he is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs great singing and super guitar riffs and solos pick up jimmy thackerys sinner street drive to survive or healin ground this guy is in stevie ray vaughns league the old clapton dominoes cream mayall will always be one of my favorites but i just do not want to hear sappy crappy bull and boring guitar,132,93
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,I have been a clapton fan for many years he is one of a handful of artists i buy regularly because I am interested to see what he has up to now i love this cd while it is similar in some ways to pilgrim and reptile the major difference between those albums and back home is that overall back home is a happy upbeat solid effort which definitely makes it worth a listen and a purchase artists will never make all of their fans happy all of the time the only person they really have to make happy is themselves i think each of erics musical styles are represented on this album in one way or another and he does sound happy and content i was pleasantly surprised by back home it is a great cd,133,94
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,i really hate to give this record only one star like one reviewer just said eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good robert johnson record and tour and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years reptile pilgrim this record makes those seem energetic let us face it eric is a great talent but people should know where their strenghts lie songwriting was never a real strong suit for him we all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues none of these are present on this disc his tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing i know that people are so tired when they have kids every parent knows already what we need is to be uplifted and this record falls way short,149,95
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,are you the same person that you were 40 years ago then why should eric clapton be,17,96
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1,negative,ok first of all i am a huge clapton fan i have most of the records seen him a ton of times and was excited when this cd came in the mail after listening half way thru i was very upset the music is garbage i mean how can you go from the cream reunion and sessions for robert j to this smooth jazz pile of rubble not even guest shots from winwood and robert randolph can help this thing out clapton scatting is not myof a goodi will say revolution is a great song if the whole record had more of that vibe it would have been a good addition in my opinion this is worse than pligrim thanks to simon climie for screwing up claptons career,131,97
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2,negative,this is not the usual ec album it is all pop music except for one track there are no good guitar solos it is all really happy for the blues fan i would highly recomend that you do not listen to this album if your a pop fan then you will probaly like this because you like crappy music this is a horrible cd and whoever told mr clapton that it was good should be punched in the face,77,98
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,identification hate to say it but i will this is a decent album i am a really big clapton fan and it hurts to say that i guess if you are looking for another from the cradle or journey man you will not find it in this album this blues man has aged and so has this taste this album shows he has matured i went on release day to grab this album and i enjoyed listening to it but i still love the classics and this cd will probably not get as much play in my cd player if you love clapton and his ever changing ways then i say snatch this album up but if you are looking for his earlier days of classic rock or blues you will only find traces,132,99
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,eric clapton is quite a guitarist his new album is real solid great songs to sing along too I am going left is one of his songs that is a big sing along song before this album was released one track mind and revolution was released on itunes as singles if you like eric clapton i would say to get this album,61,100
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,like van morrison many of us have a nostalgic connection to eric clapton dating back nearly forty years we hope that each new record will catapault us back to the emotional sunshine of the 60s and 70s a return to those days when the music was new and ground-breaking it is not to be because it can not be new anymore but it can be refreshing this the case with back home eric clapton has gotten back to combining blues reggae and r b into catchy tunes that leave you satisfied perhaps not in a league with journeyman back home does enter that territory although pilgrim was excellent musically it was a very difficult record to listen to because of it is themes and therefore had a limited repeat-listening lifespan reptile lacked punch the return to his catchy pop sensibilities is quite welcome we probably will not experience the oh wow of a 461 ocean boulevard again but this is a fine reminder of how it used to be this is a fun record and recommended,171,101
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,when i heard jada was going to do metal i thought what on earth is going on then i saw them at their uk gig and i changed my opinion jada is a good musician and so is the band although I am not into heavy metal,45,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,whoever is the oblivios knock this job well done down well stink finger wet willie that because um kittie was thee best female led band but uh guess what jada gives me the willies and with just her and four men this group just took over the rock scene with flovors of everything i still hold my favorite balacne equal substitute please but excuse me from preventing you from kickin dust and throwing bones while they wicked wisdem rules the world of music for a while lift this blessing up let it rise let is rise let it rise post this hold your own keep to your roots and basics audioslave be yourself peace love respect and understanding I am out,120,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,2,negative,if there has any good thing at all about this it is that you can sense some musicianship from some of the instrumentalists in the band the guitarist and drums sound okay but the choice ofsinger is poor at best and obviously either a hobby for jada or a ploy for more sales through name recognition jada sounds absolutely horrible no rhythm no melody to her voice no vocal skills she should really continue to pursue acting instead where she has much more potential as a metal fan I am frankly insulted that she thinks this screaming howling and cussing so much for all her husbands promoting clean music and not having any need for bad language would actually pass for metal music anyone who really appreciates metal would probably hate this album i understand why grocery stores would have run out ofwhen ww was in town,145,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,2,negative,i was surprised to hear that jada pinkett smith was in a metal band i thought to myself wow pretty cool so some time ago i heard this cd i was somewhat impressed but still i feel it fell short the band has a lot of potential with the right producer someone like bob rock metallica motley crue songs like bleed all over me have a lacuna coil type sound to them while others are reminiscent of the now deflated rap metal or nu metal scene jada has the potential to be a better singer than what she has delivered she needs to really push her boundaries from what i hear on this cd she does not really push her vocal ability much and i mean by singing not growling or screaming this band can do so much more with the right producer bringing out that heavy sound a la sevendust keep an eye out for wicked wisdom because i am sure we have not heard the last of this band with tons of potential i gave them two stars because i believe they could have done a whole lot better that is my opinion thanks,191,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,1,negative,listening to wicked wisdoms self-titled debut it is clear that frontwoman jada pinket smith has talent as a singer however it is everything else about the band that is not as talented they sound too much like rage against the machine which was not a very good band to begin with one thing the bothers me when jada sings about being in pain are we really supposed to believe her i mean cmon she has married to one of the highest paid actors in the world her words just seem false to me i think the band would be alot better off if they would just slow down the pace a little bit i give it one star for effort if there is another album hopefully it will be more creative and original but regardless i will not be buying it bottom line if you like rage against the machine then this is the album for you if you do not like rage then do not waste your time or money for that matter,165,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,yes i know this a nu metal band but they have a decent singer and a good guitar player so they make a great nu metal band bottom of line 90/100 if you want to remeber nu metal buy this album best songs bleed all over me set me free something inside of me,51,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,i bought this just to add to my celebrity song collection and would not you believe it there is actual substance to this album i came in half expecting something akin to a celebrity book 75 ghostwritten / assisted but i was wowed by the amount of heart and effort by ms smith the rigors of rock n roll life may not mesh well with la vida hollywood but maybe this band can get by with minimal touring steely dan is a good example of a studio band that does not really need to tour the track that stands out is something inside of me this album is light years ahead of body count,110,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,firstly i can not think of any other metal bands fronted by a black woman so kudos for that i may be wrong who knows people are just dissing it because it is big willies wife you do not know what she has into she might have the biggest metal cd collection in the world and she could afford it too this is for fans of otep early kittie tura satana and my ruin if eighteen visions were fronted by a woman they would sound similar to ww her vocals are great there has some brilliant druming and guitar work on here if you are a fan of any of the above bands ignore peoples jealous remarks and check this out,114,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,what is up with all the dissin jadas voice is strong and who would have believed it from such a small package she can rock and anyone who does not think so does not know metal when they hear it something inside of me is the best,45,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,2,negative,for those of you unaware wicked wisdom is fronted by jada pinkett smith wife of actor / rapper will smith for some reason whether her husband or someone else gave her thethat she should form and front a heavy metal band tjis disc is the sad sorry resuklts of what happene next jada excorcises her demons on this album but not very well the music is mid paced metalcore / grindcore kind of reminding me of crisis but the music is actually the highpoint on this entire cd the unbelieveably low point however is jadas vocals it is like she tries to rap and scream at the same time and it does not work and she does not have a good clean singing voice period maybe jada and the band should have taken the hint from all the ozzfest fans that booed them off the stage on a regular basis and leave the music making to her equally talnetless husband,157,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,i think that everyone else who rated this album were extremely harsh and a little rude give her a chance she has potential and it is awesome that she has into this genre of music she breaks the stereotypes and i think that in itself is a very bold and brave move on her part i think it sounded great regardless of how weak or whatever everyone says her vocals are lots of people have first cds that are not so great but that does not mean there has not room for improvement apparently they were good enough for a record label to sign them rock on jada,103,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,1,negative,someone made a formula by adding flyleaf and suicidal tendencies it did not work out very well this will be in the 99 cent bin in a week,27,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,1,negative,this is the worst cd I have heard in a long time evertthing about it sucks the vocals are horrible jadas a good actress but she has the worst singer I have ever heard this is not worth the money,37,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,2,negative,sounds like a below average rock band that got signed on the merit of will smiths wife 1 or 2 tracks are decent otherwise it is kind of contrived,28,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,i bought thisas soon as i had heard it was released i was really curious to see what jada could bring to the musical world with a band to back her up I have listened to the cd several times over and have come to appreciate this album very much although i am a big fan of female vocals my opinion is not biased jadas voice is very soothing and rich and quite beautiful tracks like something inside of me allows the listener to hear her sweet voice just like any cd there are going to be tracks you do not really care for but overall it is a definite must-have it reminds me a little bit of the bands kittie sevendust slunt and more they are definitely worth listening to please check it out,131,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,jada pinkett smith doing metal i was like what in the world is metal becoming but i was actually quite surpirsed when i listened to this cd there are hard driving grooves hellish drum lines and a sick bass line the vocals are something to be desired but you can certainly tell potential in this group i think with a couple more years of developement and practice this band could be something great if jada just keeps working on melody and forcing a scream to be more gutteral i think that this band could get some much needed recognition the music as a whole is what i rated this 4 out 5 stars the band is really talented the only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the rookie vocals of jada do not judge because of the whole will smith at ozzfest thing this band is really surprising if she would just leave her unjiggy husband at home while she has on the road jada and the rest of wicked wisdom would get some street cred i would say buy this album especially if you like grinding metal with melody,190,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,1,negative,hahahaha as i lay crying that is great high quality esp when the kid sees it and is like no no you are not saying it right oh my god anyway this band is terrible run you can even watch them on the ozzfest 05 dvd which is probably cheaper than this cd and comes with a dvd and a live cd of ozzfest bands and see how the crowd is basically scratching their heads at this music jadas repeated screaming of you can not handle this just feels like nu-metals modern answer to vanillashe has right i can not handle this it is too awful shudder just do not bother please,105,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,i think they have done a very good job considering they are new although they seem to know which direction they want to go i recognized the sounds of other bands in them for example the song titled do not hate me reminds me of evanessences wake me up i did like the second song something inside of me because jada sounds like she really means what she has saying i myself feel that way about psychopaths preying on young girls some of the songs sound a bit contrived but i think if they stay true to who they are they will do fine i love the music in forgiven because it shows they have a sound of their own i tink they are awesome and deserve some credit,123,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,5,positive,exackly I am not really a fan of heavymetal but when i heard this whole cd i was blown away by their rhythem arrangments the vocal abilities everything about the group is awesome initially i bought her very first cd that had her back-up singers good cd and when this heavymetal tune came about i was skeptical this cd is worth your hard earned dollars they really got me into heavymetal music,68,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,i just watched this band play live yesterday when they opened for nonpoint and sevendust and they did a really good show truth is i did not expect much from them because i like to judge a book by it is cover and although jada is one of my favorite actresses mainly because of the matrix sequels i did not think she would be able to hold up to any kind of metal the stage show was great and the band definitely knows what they are doing the vocals were a little more raw than the rest of the bands there probably because they were one of the newest bands playing i would bet that the cd is near pristine although i ordered mine today nu-metal may have died 6 years ago or whatever but so what there is still a huge fan base and i think that it is all the much better that a band like this can exist right now amongst all the metalcore posers that all decided to jump on the hardcore bandwagon these guys might not have been incredibly original several years ago but right now they are a refreshing new sound,192,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,4,positive,okay i can honestly say that it is not bad and with fish on drums it is worth the purchase for those of you who do not know fish in one of the founding members of the nutmeginous bands in the world fishbone jada do your thing and the rest of the band sounds good i think everything deserves a listen and i found myself listening to the single something inside of me and it reminded me of sinister dane living colour but a bit heavier her vocals are not the strongest but the end results was convincing enough for me to buy the album if you are looking for something different to listen to with great musicianship and some catchy melody then buy this album and do not think of jada pinkett smith when you listen to it open your mind a bit and think of it as a band and you will enjoy the experience more,153,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E8JO1E,1,negative,i saw this band live a few weeks ago with sevendust and nonpoint and i use the word band losely the band it self was good jada on the other hand was not and jada just because you start to scream into the microphone will not make you any better stay away from this at all costs the only reason i gave it one star was because it did not give me an option for pure s,76,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4,positive,as another reviewer said this release is better than the first which i also liked but did overrate initially because the focus is on popular music associated with halloween rather than on scary classical music the amount of vocals works very well it must be kept in mind that chip davis actually got his first big break through novelty country songs and so it should not be surprising that he can do great steamroller arrangements even with fairly straightforward vocals some tracks are better than others again i have to agree that the davis originals are among the weakest although the trafik techno remix of creatures of the night is fantastic but overall it is a fun halloween party album listening to the sound samples should tell you if this will be your cup of tea or not just keep in mind this is designed for a fun halloween party rather than as something to scare you,157,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1,negative,why does chip davis refuse to produce his music on a more regular basis granted we now have music for each season and now every holiday known to man thanks in part to chips newest release halloween 2 halloween 1 was quite enough i give him kudos for his effort but there are so many other beautiful songs he has yet to add his steamroller touch to hopefully one day he will wise up this album sounds as if he has totally lost sight of his 18th century rock and roll base and has gone for more 21st century midi trash on top of reissuing music that we have enjoyed for the past 20 years his fresh aire series was wonderful as are chips other albums yellowstone saving the wildlife but has the steamroller run out of steam as a diehard ms fan i was shocked and appalled that he ventured yet again into halloween with less attractive results he should give us what we really want more christmas music and new material with the steamroller sound we grew to love and adore,181,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4,positive,hahaha what can i say chip davis and his cohorts make music fun christmas halloween or mello me out after a rough day mannheim steamroller knows how to hit just the right buttons the mix of music and sounds made for laughs and giggles from the trick-or-treaters who came to my house,51,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2,negative,the songs are not spooky nor are they up to par with my halloween liking i may have been expecting something more scary,23,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5,positive,we bought this and 2 other cds great for all ages putting these on outside during trick-or-treating really livens up everyone is spirits even in the middle of the week,27,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5,positive,perfect music for the halloween party manaheim steamroller produces great music for whatever season that needs to be very good music,21,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4,positive,this collection features three discs when i ordered i thought i was getting three cds of halloween music that i can play in the car or in my boombox instead i got one cd of halloween songs one of halloween sounds and a dvd of such songs as creatures of the night the songs were refreshing retakes of older songs such as black magic woman psycho monster mash the theme from the addams family as well as new titles such as trick or treat all of these songs show characteristic mannheim style and were enjoyable to listen to even although there were three cds i think it was a good value for under 20,114,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1,negative,i got this because i was looking for something new for halloween and i saw they had covered the dark shadows theme and the dr who theme and it came with a sound fx cd and a dvd then i listened to it the out date keyboard sounds most likely a roland d5 and their love of turning everything into techno made this beyond wretched the fx cd was just more effected 80s keyboard sounds and the dvd was nothing but goofy self aware music videos of their songs oh I am sorry and a dance instruction video let us not forget the asinine tag on the back of the package over half million dollars in video this is exactly what is on the back of the box i have nowhat they could have spent that much on they got ripped off and so will you if you like these guys and their dated techno sound then this is the album for you however if your under 50 and want a competent halloween soundtrack run screaming from this abomination,179,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1,negative,if you are looking for halloween music that you grew up on this is not it i love manheim steamroller but this does not ever come close to what i was expecting,32,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4,positive,bought this cd for a gift person loved it lots of music for the price,15,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2,negative,there are three cds in this package but they are not identified as 1 2 and 3 so it is easy to mix them up each has some good music and some hokey or kinky tracks it would have been much better to deliver the good classical stuff on one cd so it would not be interrupted by the less attractive music i like about one third of it but it is mixed throughout so i probably will not listen to it often,81,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5,positive,i always expect the best from manheim steamroller but this surpassed my expectations it is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to listed to you will love it,31,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2,negative,this just does not sound as although mr davis had his heart in it or put much effort into it the songs covered tended to have parts chopped out of them and for tv themes there has not much one can afford to remove the dr who theme is by far the worst example only a couple of bars of the actual tune survive the rest is large quantities of unimaginative padding heavy on the drum machines for example the repeated tonic / sus4 that leads into a mutilated superstition will drive you batty hey maybe that is the tie-in with halloween please mr davis get your muse back you can do better than this,109,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5,positive,my husband wanted this cd because of the monster mash song and listens to it all the time halloween or not a great cd,23,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5,positive,for anyone who has not heard it you are totally missing out these guys have done it again sheer brilliance the songs just totally get you in the mood for new the season and are great to listen to while decorating buy this cd,43,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,somewhere between nickelback and linkin park you will find the band saliva and their fifth studio effort blood stained love story save for the somewhat overdone ladies and gentlemen bsls is cut for cut a solid record old-school fans of saliva may be put off by the lack of heaviness but those who looked away after 2003s survival of the sickest are invited back instantly via accessible matured song writing at under 40 minutes in length bsls has no room for filler and thankfully there is not any although as mentioned earlier ladies and gentlemen may take some time to grow on you fans of alternative metal nu-metal and medium heavy rock will more than likely enjoy blood stained love story,119,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,this appears to be the saliva ballads cd the band from the first couple cds is long gone and a pop band with a ton of slow ballads has taken their place great band in concert but this does not represent the band at all check out the new fozzy all that remains reloaded cd if you want to hear an incredible rock / metal cd with zero ballads,65,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,i have been a fan since every six seconds i saw the video for your disease and i was hooked this cd is different but it has alot going for it sure they are leaning towards a more mellow sound at times but that is just the nature of growing up critics write off 90 os the rock bands that have ever recorded this cd is cool it is fast slow in between sad happy and pissed off all at the same time i have met the band twice and to meet them is to understand their music even more they have a way of singing what they feel and not worry because they know people will relate to them best tracks ladies and gentlemen black sheep going under,129,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,this album is poppy whiney and overall a catastrophe i was utterly surprised to see that only about 2 or 3 tracks rock and the rest is mainstream sounding garble i agree that saliva should have changed and evolved their sound from their previous albums as the rap / rock was getting outdated and overplayed but this was an extreme case of the woaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhs skip it,64,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,every once in a while a band releases a cd that is great from beginning to end saliva did that with blood stained love story although my first experience with this band is on this cd alone and i have not yet had the pleasure of experiencing their previous works i am looking forward to enjoying their other efforts as well i am not one of these people who expect a band to have a similar sound throughout their careers to me that shows no artistic venture so when any band releases a new cd i enjoy it for the fact that it is a new production whatever it is that they saliva have done in the past will be enjoyed as the separate works of art they have produced for my listening pleasure blood stained love story is a great introduction to salivas music for me and i look forward to their future works as well,157,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,two and a half years since thier last album and worst the boys from memphis are back with a decent album better than their survival of the sickest 3 stars but not as good as every 6 seconds or back into your system both 45 stars the main reason to me anyway is the growing amount of slower songs the groups puts out shorter than their other albums with only 10 songs 1 is almost a classic 1 i skip 5 are good and the other 3 are ok while it is a decent album and a good one for their fans i prefer their earlier work more 1 85 a nice upbeat track not much lyrics although 2 85 3 8 4 95 my favorite and another upbeat one 5 8 6 7 7 5 8 7 9 75 10 7 check all my reviews,155,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,every song on this cd sounds as although these guys sat down and listened to other bands and then tweeked the tune a little the second song on the cd sounds like animals from nickelback if you know who galactic cowboys are then you will recognize ladies and gentlemen and more the best song might be blacksheep but every song on here got copyed from someone,64,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,oh wait it is just saliva like this band was original anyways just take every six seconds and mix it in with back into your system and you have this just another generic radio rock disc if you dig other atrocious a rock artists like puddle of theory of a nickeldefaultcreed you will eat this up me just give me origin and informis infinitas inhumani,64,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,I have been listening to saliva since every six seconds came out i love just about everything they have done and i think they are just about the best hard rock band out today coherent lyrics with great hard hitting music each album is different but it is the same saliva always evolving never reinventing i love survival of the sickest and blood stained love story is not quite as good overall all the songs are good with one exception and they have a few great songs on this album ladies and gentlemen broken sunday and king of the radio couple decent ballads but who loves them for the ballads however I am glad I am not the only person who heard twister and thought who the he shall is this that song is crap but the rest it still great saliva if you liked any of their previous albums there has no sense in not buying this one i just hope they stick around and the next album leans more to their hard rock roots they need to stick with what they are good at,176,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,bought the cd today and feel like i wasted money not as good as the other cds weak is a good word for the cd,25,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,it is sad how after they had one hit click click boom that was featured on every single soundtrack known to man that they would make an entire album and have every song sounding almost exactly like that one hit and if it did not sound like it they were sure to mention it somewhere in the song i do not know although there were one or two songs that were decent but i was not crazy about this album,76,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,what an awful album thank goodness i listened to tracks online before i went out and bought this junk,19,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,blood stained love story is excellent saliva is one of the best rock bands ever track listing 1 ladies and gentlemen 2 broken sunday 3 never going to change 4 king of the stereo 5 one more chance 6 going under 7 twister 8 black sheep 9 starting over 10 here with you,52,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,i have to admit that i jumped on the saliva bandwagon when i heard click click boom but once i was on i never had a reason to get off even although their last effort seemed stale in areas it was still a good listen with blood stained love story a natural progression is happening and it seems to suit the band well the album takes a trip in a softer direction at times but still goes through the old neighborhoods that made the band so appealing to me in the first place,93,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,i like the album because iam a saliva fan so buy a copy an listen for yourself only you will know if you like it or not,27,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,i enjoy listening to the evolution of a band and this is what we are getting with saliva speaking of the evolution of a band check out porcupine tree it is an album i truly enjoyed from beginning to end if you like music with and without the hardif you like music with great variety then go buy this if you just want to stay in yesterday well just stay there that is alright too,73,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,i am not a big fan of modern music the tunde down drop f bombs and have the cookie monster sing i overlooked saliva when every 6 seconds came out i likers superstar and click when i would hear it on radio but did not jump to buy it i picked up every 6 seconds in the 200 bin at a used cd place and really liked the band they rocked hard but had a good melody to their songs there was that primal side but you could hear there was something more than just power cords i bought blood stained love story the day it came out and listened about 8 times i really like it there are all sorts of moments here fast and hard and cool melodic even with some leanings to pop this is one of the new bands that i see with staying power and I am even glad to say they did an awesome cd with no f bombs these guys are at the top of my list for favoriate modern rock bands that is a small club for me a rocker over 40,189,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,this album is not the saliva i know i loved survival of the sickest and this album is not like that at all with the exception of tracks 1 and 8 the rest must have been someone else,38,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,if there has one thing you have to say about this album it is that it is very varied there are many different types of music on the album from straight rock similar to every six seconds to more poppy music similar to back into your system some of it is even reminiscent of their first self-titled album saliva however i can not give the album five stars on principle i agree with other reviewers in that black sheep sounds exactly like animals by nickelback if only a little slower not cool guys not cool other than that a great album you should enjoy if you like back into your system and survival of the sickest,112,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,tell me no one else has noticed the similarities between animals by nickelback and black sheep on this album it seems to me saliva slowed it down to try to get people not to notice it besides this the album is mediocre compared to their others ladies and gentlemen definately rocked the res is ok,54,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,when i heard ladies and gentlemen i was excited i thought here is going to be a great saliva album instead what we have is another daughtry cd i loved the first saliva album the second had some bubble gum but still some rockin songs the third was raw and a bit immature but still good this album is pop i thought saliva of all bands would not try to be nickelback but the nickelback album at least rocked a little i am very disappointed if you want click click boom and great rock anthems listen to old saliva if daughtry is your thing then this is for you me I shall listen to ladies and gentlemen until i wear it out then I shall move on,124,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,being an owner of all of salivas albums i am very impressed with this latest effort from the guys from memphis it is a more polished and mature album however that is not a bad thing it is still hard-driving rock with some good power ballads thrown into the mix as has been stated the song twister is strange to hear from saliva but the rest of the album makes up for it besides what band does not try out different genres of music with varied results there is still plenty of kick-a material to satisfy i would highly recommend this album to anyone whose voice has stopped changing,109,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,well although i agree with some of the other reviews saying saliva has slowed down however they do have a few that are still hard but the things is that the slower ones are amazing they really are very good i think the only stupid song on this album that did not make me want to rewind the song was twister i hate the freakin sound however i think this album is defenitaly worth buying and giving it a shot if u like always and weight of the world and even a fan of rest in peices u will love this album,101,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,i own all of salivas cds and was stoked to purchase the new one ladies and gentleman is a cool different style of rock song broken sunday is a great track and king of the radio features some old school raprock so to speak that i love to hear from josey there are some soft ballads on here but I have listened to them a few times since i got it yesterday and they are definately startin to grow on me the song twister is completely random and definately does sound pop-rockish it is just completely wierd to here that from saliva they will probably play that one on 965 the buzz here in kansas city anyways i like it overall but survival of the sickest was my favorite album so far but of course i love all the older stuff he shall click click boom was my favorite song for probably around 2 - 3 years,151,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,i first listened to this cd while at the gym and i was pumped while listening to ladies and gentleman then the wheels came off what happened to these guys other than track 1 and 5 this was dissapointing and the twister song i could not force myself to even finish listening to that song as with all bands maybe it is time to hang it up boys you are definitely scratching the bottom of the barrel here what a shame atleast your other cds rocked and I am off to the bargain bin,89,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,as a proud owner of all salivas past work i was very excited to purchase the newest release yesterday as the album began i was pleased with the opening track and eagerly anticipated more gritty southern rock however much to my dismay instead i received dose after painful dose of soft poppy hook ladden top 40 / american idol-esque songs with the exception of one track near the end the rest of the cd belongs in the easy listening section not rock / metal although i must admit some of the chorus lines are a bit catchy i was hoping for another cd to blast at the gym not fall asleep to this disc now belongs to my girlfriend stocked away next to her chris daughtry kelly clarkson and kelly pickler cds very disappointed,130,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,this is salivas fourth major label album and definitely much better then their last album survival of the sickest which seemed rushed and shallow this album is more in vein with their first two albums both of which went gold it has traces of nu-metal and monster ballad in it but that is works my only problem is track 7 twister the band should be named all-saliva rejects because you can tell this song was written to appeal to the all american rejects / emo punk crowd i think they kinda alienated their fan base on this track very fake very with the times josey scott sounds least to say ridiculous on this track and i think he knows it anywho this is a solid album and it is a great pickup especially since many other similar artists have gone by the wayside saliva continues to make driving hard rock that is radio friendly check out tracks 125 and 10 35 - 4 stars,160,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,wow first off so excited to see josey and the boys out with such a great new cd i agree with those that have posted before me this cd is a great first for a new saliva fan heavy enough for the old school fans and with the radio friendly ballads easy to listen too i have all their other offerings totally suggest back into your system as well buy it these songs were meant to get into your head the bridge in ladies and gentlemen is killer do you want it do you need it yep,90,27
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,honggang ma is exactly right i saw this product in a store loved it is simplicity 31 mpixels for an incredible price i thought what has the catch then i asked about the type of memory the store clerk had nohe climbed a ladder to find the box and still we could not make heads or tails of the info i used the web to find all sorts of reviews nothing specifically mentioned the memory then i found the previous review here at amazon great reviews this settles the issue for me what do you do when on vacation and you simply must buy another mem card with this camera nothing if you are not concerned about this issue then definitely buy this camera you will not find a higher resolution for the price be aware although this is a point and click snapshot camera only,145,0
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,the main reason i bought this camera is because it has a sd / mmc card i looked at the more expensive dx-3900 and counted it out it did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me i own a palm m505 and want to have compatibility with that and my mp3 player even although the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed i think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds i purchased a 64 mb mmc chip at amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm the mp3 player and the kodak camera go figure at least kodak gave us the option in the dx3700 others should but the dx3900,127,1
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,i did a lot of comparison shopping before eventually deciding on the dx3700 the price of this camera is awesome considering it is in the 31 mp range i was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards my fears were quickly subdued when i did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new mmc cards as for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards these prices came directly from kodaks web site a 16 mb compact flash cost 2599 compared to the new mmc at 2699 also comparable were the 32 mb cards with about a two dollar difference in price I am sure as more cameras begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also this camera was extremely easy to use i was taking pictures about five minutes after i unpacked it and the picture quality is unbelievable,172,2
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,the pictures are excellent in fact they are among the best for 3-mega digicams this is where the virtues of this camera end the 3700 uses an sd or mmc card that is hard to find once you find them in some retail stores they cost 3 times more than their compared to counterparts sd or mmc are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization yet this camera is bigger than kodak 3900 an excellent camera that uses compared to card therefore this card format does not make any sense another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the sd card is 64 mb as compared with 512 mb for compared to card since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution i tried to order a 64 mb sd card the price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more now i have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever i go the purchase turned out to be a disaster,172,3
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,first kodak makes you buy aextra 80 bucks although this camera does take good pictures when daylight is sufficient this camera lacks features and with problems no zoom no timer of course no video which is ok here are some real problems 1 this camera makes dark pictures when there is not ample light yes flash is on regular 35 mm even those made by kodak cameras can do much better than that 2 battery life is short do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good you will run out after taking a few shots if you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours 3 upload from thesometimes give mysterious i / o errors frustrating you may have to try a couple times,146,4
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,we received this camera as a gift and like many other reviewers have had horrible experiences trying to get the batteries to charge customer service replaced and recharged the battery but to no avail it is sitting and gathering dust do not waste your money,44,5
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,this is a great little camera that gives quality photos the only dislike i have is that there is a slight delay once you take the picture before it actually takes the shot so sometimes i have to shoot and reshoot to get the shot i want,47,6
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,my wife and i bought this camera about a year ago right from the get go it had problems we bought it on line so there was no recourse from the dealer if you buy a camera go to an actual store there are real people in case you have a problem kodak customer support is a joke if not down right rude and offers no help the problem withthe camera is that the batteries last for only 3 or 4 shots if you buy the kodak lithium cell 2000 it lasts for about 20 shots if you do a little research you find that the camera requires 33 volts at up to 25 amps no combination of aa cells deliver 33 volts rechargables deliver 12 volts per cell and even lithium cells only deliver 16 volts and anything south of a d cell will not deliver it is rated voltage at 25 amps for very long the long and short of it is that the dx3700 was a defective product from the start and short of fabricating an external battery pack with d cells you better look for another camera,187,7
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,this camera is great for everyday use the 31 megapixels effective make it a worthwhile buy definitely a graet camera,20,8
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,i have a different model kodak camera however they all use the same easyshare software running windows xp i could not get the software to work properly after several hours on the phone with kodak tech support they could not get it working either they said they are aware of the problem on some computers running windows xp it is now several months later and they still do not have a fix they do not really seem to care either it might not be a badto consider other brands instead of kodak since if the software will not work properly then what good is the camera,104,9
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,please do not waste your money on this camera it uses a set of batteries about every 5 - 10 pictures the docking station is a joke as it only works part of the time and has never charged the camera it has been back to kodak but they did not do anything but put in new batteries and send it back the few pictures that it does take are good ones but it is not worth the hassle and please do not depend on this camera to record an important event because i can bet you will be disappointed,95,10
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,not much good to say about this camera complained to customer service with no resolution awkward styling eats batteries cameradosent charge batteries software lacking in features do not buy it,31,11
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,things started out alright but the led screen burnt out and then the camera stoped transferring pictures to the docking station so far the camera has had more down time then up time,33,12
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,this is a nice camera for the price 31mp and takes good pictures with some practice be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics although also there is no need at all for the docking station the camera plugs right into any usb port and shows up as a drive on the computer you can then just pull your images off without having to use kodaks software as far as recharging the batteries i picked up some ni-mh batteries and a portable charger and I am good to go I had also recommend getting an additional memory card,101,13
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,i have upgraded to xp however the software does not work with xp i tried to download new software but i had problems doing so i wrote an email to kodak but they would not send me new software and did not really care seeing that insead of fixing the problem they tried to sell me a newer camera in addition the battery life keeps getting shorter as the camera gets older it is also very diffucult to get a shot of something in action since the camera takes about 2 seconds to autofocus i would reccomend a different for people serious about their photography,104,14
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,this was not my first experience with a digital camera after receiving the kodak 3700 i thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on the main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas unless very close the picture was very dark just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program the delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired the final reason for returning the camera was the incompatibility with the latest mac technology just released when all returns are cleared i am going to opt for a canon 110 or a20 or nikon coolpix family members and friends have these and are very satisfied,123,15
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,i purchased the dx3700 somewhat out of desperation many models sold out but was intrigued by the high resolution i also purchased athe sd card was sold right alongside the camera and was not a price or availability issue i took the camera on a trip and had 56 high res photos on the 64 mb card with room to spare i thought the camera was a bit bulky and was not thrilled with the battery life but decided to wait until i saw the picture quality when i downloaded the pictures to my laptop i was pleasantly shocked by the beautifuland detail of the photos and the macro close-up shots were excellent pros low price for 31 megapixel camera ease of use quick battery recharging less than 1 hour great picture quality excellent macro shots decent if slow software consmore or less required so-so battery life somewhat bulky,152,16
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,i am extremely pleased with my purchase of the dx3700 even those it uses the mmc cards i do not care really I am sure a higher mb cards will be coming out soon reading the other reviews i realized how much people are upset about that aspect but you must remember every time something new comes out it is this way they will constantly improve the product and the price will go down right now the highest mb card is the 64 mb which only allows about 75 pictures for a 31 mp camera but hey who needs to take more than that unless you are on vacation and do not have access to a computer which i do not worry about i did not care about the optical zoom which this model does not have the model that did have it was [ amt ] more now with technology constantly changing it is better to be on theand in a few years when I am ready to upgrade i will not feel like I am losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment this camera only cost me [ amt ],175,17
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,this is my first digital camera i purchased this camera so my wife and i could take picture of our grandson this was a christmas present for both of us i have had trouble finding memory card for this modelbut plan to put it to good use i picked this camera because it is user friendly thanks charles mclendon,59,18
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,the dx 3700 is very easy to use and works well with windows xp qualtity is best for the money it compares to expensive digitals with qualtity that matches if not exceeds the only negative comment is that a docking station is a must that sales people do not tell you about to keep batteries charged and transfer images to your computer,63,19
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,i have been putting off buying a digital camera for months i was debating on the sony mavica but the pixel quality just was not there 31 pixels for such a low price true it does not have all the bangs and whistles that other digital cameras have but it has the most imortant feature oustanding pictures it does not have an optical zoom but i seldom use that anyway the camerasold separatly is a must a simple push of the button on the docking station and the pictures are in your computer ready for emailing or printing what more could you want for so little money,106,20
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,the sound it produces has low quality i bought this and a panasonic at the same time the sound of the last one is incomparably better i do not recommend maxel headphones at least this one,36,0
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones are comfortable but the volume is low even on the highest level compared to other headphones i have used,21,1
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i know these were cheap but with the brand name i expected a little bit more poor quality for sure not even worth the 3 i paid for them just wanted some back-up headphones I had say they only seem like they would be worth 150 at best can not believe maxell would even put their name on them,56,2
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,they are made of 100 plastic the right side did not work on first use they also feel very delicate in my hands like they are easily broken but for the price hey i might have a different opinion if they worked out of the box,44,3
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,nothing special about these headphones cheaply made with pool audio quality i bought similar items at our local discount store for 5,22,4

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,they work well they are kind of tight on my head,11,8
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i wish i could give this a negative 100 stars i got it for a big surgery so i could sleep soundly to my favorite relaxing tunes the 1st night it worked great then the entire right side speaker went out never to be heard from again,47,9

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,very good headphones sound is very clear highly recommended,9,13
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,great for small children but the size is a bit tight for someone with a larger head,17,14
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the foam covers on the headphones came off the first day granted they were used by teens but we got other similarly priced headphones which have lasted,27,15
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,i teach 6th grade and bought these for my classroom they are a little small for my students heads but adjust to fit ok works well enough and we managed to afford a full class set,38,16
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,tiny like they were made for a doll very very quiet as well could barely hear anything at full volume did i mention they were tiny,26,17

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,can not be beat for the price respectable brand name and functions as expected not anything to write home about as far as sound quality but they serve their purpose as cheap semi disposable headphones great for people who constantly lose and misplace headphones,43,24
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very cheap one of ear pieces was already broken off in the sealed package when received,17,25
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,arrived on time i bought these for use at the office to drown out the sounds of my office mate singing along to the radio and to discourage him from engaging me in conversation it does drowned out the singing but some people can not take a hint,47,26
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,ear piece is too tiny not very usable,8,27
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,for the price these obviously will not be the best mega-ultra-bass option for listening to music at high volume but they are great for podcasts and audio books you can fall asleep wearing them comfortably enough which i can not do with earbuds or the giant beats style fashionable headphones that are all you can find these days,54,28
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,lightweight and durable enough to utilize in classroom each day,10,29
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,horrible it did not work at all the box is open so i can not send it back just horrible,17,30

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect for use at school where headphones are constantly broken or lost so far neither has happened,17,32
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,you get what you pay for i need a more expensive pair of headphones,14,33
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,the maxell lighweight stereo headset has for the time i have owned it proven to be the true lightweight good performer that i was looking for others that i have found on the market are cumbersome and provide distorted sound the maxell is the lightest that i have found and provides true clear sound without weighing down the head,59,34
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,we bought two of these one for my mother in law and other for my father in law after hardly a month the fabric from the ear parts started to come off sound started to go dim and then do not remember right or left ear side totally stopped working elderly people were using them with as much care as it was possible even then they hardly worked for such a short time one positive thing about these are that they are very light and do not burden ears,89,35
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,great sound but very small and the so called padding on the head phones are very uncomfortable cheap material and painful on the ears,24,36
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the side strings keep coming off sound quality is good although,11,37
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very bad reception the sound is like a tin can and breaks up a lot,15,38
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,good sound quality ear sponges a little too thin already breaking through,12,39
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,this headphone set is really small better fitted for a kid,11,40
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,should have purchased a more expensive pair got what i paid for headphones were broken within a week due to the thin plastic at the headband-earphone connection,27,41
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these head phones are not worth buying they do not work at all and are a waste of money,19,42
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones work ok but when i extend the ear pieces to fit my head the plastic pieces that are part of the extension mechanism end up pressing on the sides of my head it is a design problem stemming for the manufacturers apparent attempt at saving a few pennies on each piece i do not recommend these headphones,59,43
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i was not expecting these to be of super high quality because of the price the problem i had was when i opened them up and realized how narrow the space was to fit around your head as i stretched them apart i thought i was going to break them do not buy these if you are looking to use them for an adult,64,44
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,I have tried numerous headphones for my daughter after a series of purchases that i was not thrilled with i decided to just buy the cheapest pair i could find they are not fancy they do not fit great there has a weird plastic piece near the ear that rubbed against my head when i tried them on but they work they have already lasted longer than most of the other pairs I have bought for her,71,45
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,my son wears hearing aids and prefers these headphones to my panisonic headphones these sound much more tinny or have much more treble than i think most people would prefer for music but the treble amount is easier to her a person speak or figure out lyrics if wearing hearing aids,51,46
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,wanted a lightweight low cost headset and this was exactly what i was looking for,15,47
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my kids need headphones in a ziplock bag for school ear buds do not work for them these were small enough to fit in the bag and are working well after a few months of use also light and comfortable not too tight on the ears price was decent too do not know why you can not find these in the stores,58,48
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,listening to my oldies on my tablet with hearing aids these work great,13,49
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i bought these through my school for my classroom i bought three pairs my first graders have trouble using them as they are so small 4 days in and one set is broken i guess you get what you pay for,41,50
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,they sound terrible very tinny no bass i suggest for a few dollars more buy the panasonic on-ear stereo headphones rp-ht21 those are decent for les than 10,28,51
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,hurts my ears when i wear it does not fit close to my ears and makes the volume low,18,52
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect for my 2nd grader that needed headphones for school i expected them to break so i purchased 2 pair but they seem to be able to take the torture a 7 year old can give them very satisfied,39,53
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,only one in a pack good for quick use at a low price,13,54
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,cheap but work great for my 6yr that is constantly losing or breaking his headphones,14,55

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i wanted cheap headphones for a work project and i got what i paid for is that a bad thing no they did a great job and have continued to fit the bill for the last few weeks i have had multiple people use them daily for projects and none of them have given me any problems the sound it great they are very lightweight and have a great range in size they can fit a small head to a quite large one i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a cheap headphone to get the job done,100,57
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,light weight that is the best i can say broke it in less than two weeks ok but delicate take care of it works,23,58
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,fine quality for the price my 8 and 5 year old use them to play on the ipad let us me not listen to minecraft videos which is a blessing worth far more than what i paid kids like them just fine no problems not super sturdy headphones but again for the price they were well worth it,58,59
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my spare pair which i have not opened yet but which i will when my current simple headphones gives up the ghost,22,60
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i buy these for my kids because they are cheap and expendable they sound cheap they feel cheap they look cheap and they are cheap bump up a whole 3 to the panasonic on-ear rp-ht21 headphones for a significant boost in sound quality build construction and aesthetics,47,61
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i do not like these it feels like they were built for a little kid the sound is good although just not a good fit for an adult head,29,62
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these are way too small for an adult and should be clearly marked as child headphones even my 10 year old daughter complained about the size arrived in an opened and poorly re-sealed package,36,63
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,for a cheap pair of headphones for a kid you can not beat the price,14,64
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,looked used and out of package when arrived,8,65
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,thank you for making this available the price was perfect,10,66
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,bought for working out will not stay on ears and have to turn up volume very loud to use and still hard to hear have had to replace,27,67
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these headphones are pieces of crap they fell apart within the first month of course it was just after the return period ended the sound is terrible and they are really cheaply made i had purchased another set for almost the same price by jvc and they are 100x better,50,68
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i have bought these headphones 2 times they are too small for the adults in the house but work great for my 4 and 6 year olds the first pair were stepped on and broke so we bought another pair obviously not a product issue but a little kid issue the 2nd pair is still in use when the kids get some vegging time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows esp my daughters favorite you tube videos which can get annoying since it does not fit our heads i do not know how the sound quality is or how loud it can get but my daughter has some audio sensitivities and she will use them so it must not be too bad,131,69
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these headphones were a waste of money the sound quality was very bad always sounded too low them the cord from the right side of the headphones fell out so now it is total garbage these did not even last 6 months i have a pair of panasonic headphones i purchased from amazon in 2013 that are still working very well i expected better from a brand name like maxell i might as well have bought a generic pair from my local drugstore,81,70
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,can not beat them for the price but keep in mind less than 5 many times better than what you would get at dollar store but if you are a stickler audio file might want to try higher quality,37,71
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,cheap and foam on earphones wears out quick,8,72
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,fabulous sound super lightweight i really like them great price too,11,73
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,after using these headphones for a short time i can only hear out of the right ear there are better choices for the cost of these headphones,27,74
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,super fast shipping and arrived exactly as expected,8,75
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i know i should keep my expectations low given the price but these are probably the smallest least comfortable and lowest quality headphones I have ever had spend an extra 2 and get a better pair,35,76
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very comfortable horrible sound quality i could not return them after tossing the box so they went in the trash,20,77
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i bought these instead of other ones I have purchased for my classroom in the past these when my students pulled the foam off the ears had wires exposed at least the other cheap headphones i had were just exposed plastic speakers when the foam came off i would not recommend these to anyone,53,78
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,foam is really thin and flimsy very uncomfortable for my students,11,79
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i actually ordered 5 pairs for my father he uses headphones every waking moment especially on the weekdays with his news talk shows on the radio so he goes through headphones a lot either they get worn and the speaker goes out in either side or one of our 3 cats get a hold of it and chew it to pieces dad cracked up at the fact that i got him so many because he knows how much he goes through he loves them,84,80
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i bought these for my three kids tablets you get what you pay for these were the cheapest pair i could find and they are made just that way cheap they serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on i heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side he has to do that every time he puts them on i guess I am going to adjust them to his 9 year old head and tape them my younger kids have the same problem,112,81
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,cheap enough for a 4 year old when they break your are not out a lot of cash,17,82
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these are worth exactly what we paid they are cheap and will not last long but totally functional,17,83

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,if you are looking for inexpensive lightweight headphones these work well i just needed a pair of very lightweight headphones to listen to am talk radio and i did not want to spend a lot so i bought a couple of these so far so good i have other mid to heavy duty headphones when i want to listen to music and want the sound to be higher quality i have been using one of the pairs that i bought daily for the past several months and it is holding up well,92,85
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones sound fine but came with a wire protruding through one of the ear pads i was able to bend the speaker wire back into the plastic covering and hold it in place with hot glue the price is great since they cost less than some places charge for ear pad replacements,53,86
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect cheap retro headphones for my halloween costume sound is adequate too,12,87
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,i work in a middle school special needs classroom we have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various childrens movies and tv shows they usually watch the same clip over and over and over it gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously they were using ear buds when watching their clips but those broke before the holidays after a week of no headphones i decided to order these for them i actually ordered 3 pairs one for each of our classroom computers these are not super high quality headphones but they are working great for our students yes it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice padded over the ear earphones but we do not since these were purchased with my own money this was what was in my budget I am not sure i would order these for myself but for the students they do the job,163,88
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,not too expensive so not such a loss when kids break them at school i bought some others that were almost 10 each and was really upset when they did not last more than a couple of weeks,37,89
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,it is not good buy panasonic volume is lower they are smaller and fragile they fit any size head but they are small and too flimsy pictures make em look bigger,28,90
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,cost ok fits flat on ears with wire to left side one wire a good thing reasonably thick with good male plug wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement sound is not loud and is not as good as my other cheap memorex padding is thin foam which probably helps by providing friction to keep the speakers in place on the ear,89,91
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,the sound is not good and it is too small and tight do not feel comfortable when you put it on,20,92
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,works well for the price do not over-drive them and they will last you a while good price and performance for a cheap headset,22,93

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these will be used in the car for grandsons portable childrens dvds lightweight and work well,16,105
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i have already written a review for these little headphones they are small and you get what you pay for i love them because they fit my pea sized head they are also cheap enough that if i sit on them or they do break i can replace them without tears the sound is not incredible but definitely okay i use these more than the more expensive pairs i have bought they are small enough to fit a child and if you are hard on your headphones these are a great little extra pair to have around i really enjoy mine,101,106
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these headphones were defective when they arrived only one side was working and the volume on the other was very low amazon replaced them but the replacement had the same problem,31,107
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these do not fit tight enough to really hear the music,11,108
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i know i did not spend much on these headphones but they are incredibly flimsy bend easily and do not stay on,20,109
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,love these yes head phones wear out and break but these last pretty well and are light weight,18,110
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,these are in the goldilocks zone just right-just right-just right they are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old both of whom have breakable tendencies six of these lasted 9 months an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets i was buying based on an assumption of robustness these are just right so that they can be hauled around dropped kicked jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back it takes quite a lot to do them in and in the meantime blessed silence since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house does not have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end a lifesaver on a plane roadtrip and more for ears too small to accept earbuds these are the perfect compromise the sound is tolerable for games or light music listening not a lot of dynamic range for this price point but that is not what I am praising them for,173,111
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my son got this for christmas and loves it it is very lightweight good buy,15,112
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,great head set for the price I am not suggesting that they are pro level sound but work great and have good sound quality i also like the single cable as they stay out of the way more you can not beat it for the price and if you have prime you are almost getting them for next to nothing thanks amazon,60,113
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,great product buying process was smooth and easy shipping was fast a pleasure to do business with i would recommend this company to everyone,24,114

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i like these headphones lightweight i am ordering another pair and the price is reasonable,15,116
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,cheap cr p you get what you pay for the chord is short the sound quality is atrocious the snap that holds the moveable part broke in a month,28,117
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these were great headphones i am on the phone most of the day and these headphones are so comfortable i can hear the customers crystal clear,26,118
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these headphones were great for the money i use them to run of course the sound quality is not great look at the price i broke them the other day and was not even angry because at this price i can just get another,42,119
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,good sound fit nicely kids all loved them better for your ear s then the ear buds for sound and for comfort,22,120
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,big disappointment with maxell they should sell these at the dollar store this is one of those products where you wonder why did they even bother,26,121
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,warning maxtors warranty claims that they are not responsible for any data loss experienced by using their software to upgrade to the new drive translation after having my original functioning working win2k sp4 system corrupted by the maxblast 30 software following all instructions maxtor has refused to respond to my complaints in a satisfactory way the total cost was 20 hours of my time completely reinstalling my system and programs suggestion do not use the software provided research other hard drive vendors who make similar products but have better warranties,89,0
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,first thought no one should be able to write a review on a hard drive until it is a year old if that were the rule you would see almost no positive reviews for these new maxtor drives purchased 5 drives over a one year period and have had three fail maxtor replaced those without any issue except that the replacement drives which were refurbished also failed within 3 months quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data btw each drive had dedicated cooler fan and pcs were onso there are not any excuses there has a reason why these drives have one year warranties beware,111,1
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,I have been buying maxtors for years now and have had them come through earthquakes in ca a move half way across the country and being carted around in two hurricane evacuations other than during severe weather they run 24/7 and are usually retired because of size not failure i know nothing of maxtors customer support as I have never needed them this one is running like a champ quiet and fast seems to run hot but pretty much every computer component these days is putting out a lot of heat good ventillation is a definite must,95,2
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,if you like to fryon your hard drive use maxtor if you do not like the heat get out of the maxtor kitchen and get yourself a real hard disk like seagate or wd i work in the it field and can not count the number of dead maxtors I have seen over the years i doubt very much that maxtor uses tqm six sigma or the toyota way to produce their inexpensive hdds,73,3
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,what an awful experience I have purchased five of these drives from three different sources not a bad lot or anything within 15 years three of them have corrupted data I am tremendously lucky that I have got them in a raid-5 array and never had two fail at the same time i was only able to get two of them replaced on warranty do not touch this drive or probably any other maxtor for that matter with a 10-footyou will get burned,82,4
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,i have had three of these hard drives so far one is years old and works fine the second lost all data and will not work the third i put in a computer i built by myself it worked flawlessly for 6 months then would notthe os properly it is final day in my computer it lit on fire while my first one has had zero problems the second is a fancy paperwieght and the third is useful for lighting candles buyer beware,82,5
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,learn from my mistake do not buy a maxtor drive do not buy anything thru amazon their shipping is horrible i was not in a hurry so i did not use expedited shipping maybe if i had it would have taken less than three weeks but i would not bet on it being less than twothe drive did not come with the ata card as advertised and it is already making strange noises after just 2 mos be wise i found a 200 gig seagate at wal-mart today for 70 and tax no shipping and it has a five year warranty,96,6
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,this drive was too good of a price to pass up when i needed more room for pictures and videos i was actualy a bit leery about this purchase given the size of the drive at this price but i have been very satisfied the drive installs easily enough for those not afraid of taking the cover off the computer and should work with most computers,66,7
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,some one has their facts wrong i have used maxtor drives for years without issue,16,8
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,i would not even give it one star but that is the lowest score possible this is the second maxtor drive that failed after just over a year you think that i would have learned by now after crashing a couple of times already the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash of course as another reviewer noted the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive this may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run i would not use a maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time i spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups never again maxtor,137,9
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,i bought this drive at staples 130 less 30 instant discount and 30 mir thus costing 70 it did not come with a card but my new dell 4700 can handle drives larger than 137 gb capacity i put this drive into an external usb 20 / firewire case i bought from cusa for 40 after connecting the usb cable and flipiing the power switch to on it was recognized instantly by my win xp media center dell 4700 pc i used software it came with to set up the drive and it was ready in less than 5 minutes total formatted capacity 203 gb so i have a 200 gb external drive for barely 110 less 12 staples customer appreciation discount this week,118,10
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1,negative,drive was slow to open and got the click of death after 13 months maxtor only warrenties for 6 months seems they know something you should know,27,11
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,was concerned with the specs listing a drive that would not fit my computer did some checking and this unit is a standard 35 inch wide drive so bought it installation was quick and easy to do necessary to point out that one does need to first verify what is in their unit by using information from systems device match the drive you need to the drive interface that is in you unit to avoid problems,77,12
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,I have owned this drive for many months and it has performed flawlessly it like other large and fast drives gets pretty warm after running for a while if you just make sure your case is well ventillated you should not have any problems I have built many systems with many different hard drives and have only had a couple fail they were not maxtor but it just as easily could have been if you value your data either back it up or go with a raid system failures can and do happen no matter what brand of drive you buy as far as the whiners that gave this drive poor marks what can i say looks like instead of rating it on the merits of the drive itself they took out they frustration because of either poor marketing or an obvious case of not reading their own system manual before making the purchase make no mistake this is an great drive for pcs built in this century and when on sale offers ample room for drive hogging chores such as video editing and archiving i highly recommend it,185,13
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,and this one is no different i had purchased a 160 gb samsung to start building my new pc i took this drive home only to find that their partitioning software that you have to download from their website did not even work instead of searching the internet for third party software to do this i took the drive back to the store and got the 200 gb maxtor instead installation was simple i just popped it into my pc and it was recognized immediately i installed the maximum blast software and the drive was partitioned formatted and ready to use in less than 5 minutes note your registry has to be modified to be able to recognize drives larger than 137 mb but the maxtor software does this for you i will always buy maxtor from now on great products with no bs,142,14
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,I have had this drive in my system for about a year to store mp3s and videos i should have backed up all of my files because my old harddrive has failed and with 200 gb of storage you will not run out very quickly mine came with the ata card and it was easy to install it has worked fine and quietly ever since and i am pleased with the purchase,69,15
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,this is a great drive it is fast about twice as fast as my other 2 and 3 year old 7200rpm drives and it is silent and seems to be reliable it is also at a great price for the capacity and it is maxtor a trusted name in hard drives i got the ata card with mine but i used another silicon image card i purchased previously it has the same features but gave less problems my computer took longer than it should to start up with the maxtor ata card the maxblast software worked perfectly and never gave me any trouble all those giving bad reviews because of the software or lack of card need to stop complaining the point is the actual hard drive is great and you will not go wrong purchasing it i like it so much i decided to purchase the 160 gig version to replace two of my other hard drives,153,16
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,i figured an amplified antenna would be better than a regular one i was wrong the unamplified antenna i have produces the same quality picture or better for half the price very disappointing,33,0
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,i was putting this together when the antenna just broke off they have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off this also has a huge clumsy ac plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space when i returned this to the store i saw another person retuning this exact same model also ge has a much better model that i bought instead that does not break and does not have any ac plug which works wonderfully do not waste your money on this rca antenna i give it zero stars,96,1
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,i bought 4 amplified antennas to test which one worked the best for my home this was the least expensive it had some shadows but it also had up to 2 channels as good as cable i had to changing it to get a good picture but not bad audio was good but so were all the others i almost kept this one it would be a good buy,69,2
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,it actually made my reception worse the amplifier in the back distorted my picture to the point where i saw nothing but snow who actually wants to put 39 inch antenttas in their house i know i do not want to look at them espeicially since they did not even make my signal come in any better this is funny although having the co-axel cable just hanging out by the window not only was more attactive than the 39inch flag poles but gave me much better reception i would not recommend this product,89,3
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,was trying to get a tv station about 27 miles away with no luck so it requires going to cable,20,4
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,the antenna was new and a quality product the cost ratio is very good i would recommend buying this antenna to anyone interested in buying a very good reception product,30,5
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5,positive,well made just follow the instructions to the letter and you will agree it is a five starenjoy recommend to all,21,6
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5,positive,i bought thisalong with the rca dat-800b1 tv converter box this review is for both items if you live in a metropolitan area you will have no problems receiving over the air television stations and watching them on an analog tv both items were easy to set up and use i purchased these items because i was tired of paying for most of the things i did not watch on cable i can get all of the major stations so when news and weather is a must have it is all right there if you feel you do not need cable tv and you still have an analog tv set you do not want to through away thisand it is companion will save you money and extend the usable life of your old tube tv set one months cable bill will pay for both items as for internet i use dsl it works good enough,154,7
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,i have not used the current purchase but have on bought several years ago so i could get local channels whenever the satallight service goes out because it eventually will for periods of time it has always worked fine so recomment it,41,8
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5,positive,i have had this antenna for a couple years it does a perfect job bringing in all the local channels for my hdtv i undoubtedly benefit from living within 3 - 5 miles of all local broadcasts if you live any farther away i suppose you will need to rely on other reviewers it is a little bit of an eyesore like almost any indoor antenna but I have managed to discretely stash it near a window the low price is also an obvious plus given my experience i would definitely recommend the antenna to anyone living near local broadcasts who is looking for an alternative to cable,103,9
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5,positive,I am addicted to tv so while I am at work i like to listen to my favorite re-runs during the day my office does not have a window so it is really hard to get reception with the converter box and an antenna I have tried 3 other antennaes that only provided partial channels for some reason this is the only antenna that brings in all channels for me this is the second time I have purchased this one i used the first one for so long that it burnt out for my situation it is the best,92,10
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,this antenna has served it is purposed well for me watching basic stations like fox nbc abc and cbs it has trouble picking-up pbs sometimes which really annoys me it was an improvement over the previous antenna i had that was meant for analog signals however i bought a 20 ge flat panel antenna at target and it worked much better than the rca i find sometimes i need to adjust the rca for it to get a signal it also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room no problems with the ge i even attached a signal amplifier to it and it did not seem to help much i would just get a another antenna for a little more money,123,11
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,i got this antenna when i bought the digital box converter thing at first i thought i lived in an area of bad reception i could only get 2 watchable channels and 2 with really bad reception so for 4 months i had my antenna connected directly to my tv getting regular analog signal after reading the reviews which are better of the passive rca antenna that is basically this one but withouth the amplifier i decided to connect it back to the digital converter without plugging the antenna into the power to my surprise i am know getting 20 perfectly clear channels can not believe but it is true go for the unamplified rca antenna which is cheaper,117,12
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,great for the converter box the powered antenna boots the reception to view more avilable channels,16,13
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,i purchased rca ant301 to replace the old one also rca bought 5 years ago that has one of the rods broken however the new one is worse than the old one even with a broken wing the screen becomes blurer with many flies flying all over i have to replace it with the old and broken one i do not know which of rcas is worth buying for the old one is now obsolete,75,14
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,purely all-around awful performance this rca antenna looks like it is supposed to do something metal poles ring that goes around in circles wire jack electric plug and little dial on the back but any spare piece of wire stuck into your tvs antenna jack will do a significantly better job than this horrible rip-off I am embarrassed to say that i bought it in good faith from a big box store it should not be for sale anywhere boo hoo my poor dollars went pay for this swiveling piece of crapolla what has the point of plugging it in and turning some little gain knob when all it does is makes the picture worse than if you had no antenna at all i can not say enough about how terrible this is and how ashamed i think rca should feel for pushing this on distributors i will not buy anything made by rca in good faith again because of this stupid product,160,15
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5,positive,this was the third antenna i bought in attempt to get an hd signal in my apartment i was unable to get a solid hd signal at all with the first two after almost 30mins playing with each however with hardly any fiddiling at all this one worked great picked up all my major stations with maybe 5 mins of moving the antennas around,64,16
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,this antenna is a huge waste of money i live in a strong signal area 5 miles to the towers on an analog tv this antenna produced an extremely noisy picture due to the poor amplifier without the amplifier this antenna did not produce a picture on a digital tv this antenna did ok however a cheap pair of rabbit ears with a uhf loop greatly outperformed this antenna both on digital and analog tvs i would not recommend the rca ant301 to anyone even if were free,88,17
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,i am about forty miles from the broadcast towers the ant301s uhf reception was very good but vhf reception is poor it picked up one of the five vhf channels in the area i disconnected the power and there was no difference in signal strength so it is no more amplified than a normal pair of rabbit ears if you are looking for an inexpensive amplified antenna the rca ant1250 is a better choice,74,18
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,i was trying to get local hd channels added to my dish network setup i tried a directional nonamplified antenna and after 30 minutes of fiddling for the best angle these are the signal strength numbers i got fox 68 cbs 63 abc 59 fox was the only one that was watchable at this strength i bought the ant301 and plugged it in and after about 5 minutes of fiddling here are the new strengths fox 78 cbs 83 abc 73 all three channels are watchable now with no issues i would recommend this antenna if you are just within range of your hd channels and want to get a better signal it will not work miracles but it does improve the signal over nonamplified antennas,131,19
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,i decided to get rid of cable too expensive living in downtown milwaukee i should probably get many channels with an antenna one would think unfortunately i didn have one so at first i hooked up a two three foot coax cables to a splitter to create a dipole type thing and i hooked this up to the tv i got okay reception from this time to pick up an antenna i just bought the 301 from best buy the sales dude said it was the best on the market and he had no complaints or returns hooked it up in place of my coax cable contraption it faired just as well if not worse i am returning the antenna and getting the 25 channel cable plan for 1300 the one they do not tell you about,136,20
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5,positive,I am using the v400 on my g5 desktop comp at work and i love it it tracks well is a perfect size and feel and is lightweight i also love the horizontal scrolling highly recommended,35,0
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5,positive,works great with vista really good cursor focus works good on textured surfaces,13,1
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5,positive,this product have a very good grip and handle the size it is correct and they function bottoms are good the usb connection work propertly,24,2
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,i had this mouse for half a year i suffered from this mouse a lot first of all the battery will not last for a week if you keep mouse awake i am using rechargeble battery sanyo ni-mh 2100 mah i also have a microsoft mouse even although it uses two battery instead of one as v400 the battery can support me for half a year second the focus of v400 is not good sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement these days i found a new big problem the mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up i thought it was xps problem eventually i figured out it was my v400 mouse i had a very good impression with logitech but this time i will double think when i buy anything from logitech,138,3
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5,positive,what can i say i bought this mouse from amazon under the new and used category it came in the mail i opened it put a aa battery in plugged it into my macbook pro and it worked right away the product did not come with mac drivers but they were easy to find on the logitech website i installed them restarted set up the two extra buttons the way i wanted used expose functions so it is pretty much like a 30 dollar mighty mouse the only thing that I have have problems with is that the side-scrolling can not be adjusted and it is really really slow I have gotten good and just clicking it over to make it go faster but otherwise the tracking is amazing the scroll wheel is really nice the buttons are great it is perfect size very portable good mouse,141,4
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,i did not experience tracking and long wake up time problem as other user has reviewed i tried some different types of mouse pad and i think it is doing fine however i think this mouse is too small I am used to use large mouse when i use it i feel more tired than use large mouse and I am not used to the back / forward button position,64,5
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,logitech so far always appeared to me as being a first tier supplier of quality mice i am shocked how logitech could dare to release such a product they are actually back to the good old days where users would need a mouse pad in order to get proper performance the v400 does not work well on dark surfaces it does not work well on light surfaces and it does not work well on tablecloth i have actually bought the v400 because i did not like the scroll panel of the v500 to my surprise the v500 with conventional red led works well on all mentioned surfaces where v400 is a nightmare it is a darned cheek when logitech claims to have introduced the v400 all terrain laser tracking technology,131,6
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,like most other users here the tracking problems I have encountered have been aweful light or dark mousepad or not two different pcs latest setpoint driver software it does not seem to matter also by comparison i have the mx500 corded optical mx700 cordless optical and mx1000 latest cordless laser on various machines and all work perfectly on the same mousepads and surfaces upon which the v400 fails the mx1000 works perfectly on the same laptop with the same setpoint driver software on which the v400 fails bottom line it is definitely the the v400 the v400 mouse will work fine for a while then if you stop to type something like the paragraph above then go back to the mouse and move it the cursor just stays put you have to move the mouse around quite a bit to get it to recognize that it is being moved clicking the mouse seems to wake it up immediately but of course that may not be appropriate depending on the application you are in as far as I am concerned i have loved everything logitech that I have ever owned until now in my opinion the v400 is a piece of junk,195,7
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,i just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now it works well as a mouse but it is very uncomfortable in my hand having to use your index finger for the forward and back buttons is awkward it also does not fit your hand well i would not recommend this unit i am returning the v400 i originally had a microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use but i was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward and back buttons the v400 seemed a gooduntil actually using it I had love a smaller version of the mx1000 note the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward and back buttons to work with the mozilla firefox browser you have to download a 47 mb update from the logitech support site,147,8
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,this is the only 5 button notebook-sized wireless mouse i can find and so i gave it a shot besides the fact that it does not work on a glass table this mouse delivers the tracking is in fact very good on most reasonable surfaces money well spent,48,9
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,I have had the v400 for about a week now and I am generally pretty happy with it the ergonomic design fits my hand well and the rubber grips make it easy to hold the addition of the back / forward buttons is nice although their placement means that you need to use your index finger to use them another minor complaint is that they are not two separate buttons rather the two buttons are part of a single rocker that tilts back and forth making it slightly more cumbersome to use that said I am happy they are there at all as most notebook / travel mice I have looked at do not have these additional buttons aesthetics are subjective naturally but i prefer it is clean simple lines to microsofts blobby I shall-defined but otherwise comfortable notebook mice regarding tracking I have noticed that the v400 is stymied by darker surfaces and textures dark wood and granite are two surfaces where it seems to get easily confused however on lighter surfaces the majority of the surfaces i use tracking is flawless i docked a star from the review because of this caveat not really the all-terrain performance as promised on the package,192,10
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,hi all i have both the v400 and the microsoft 6000 the v400 has many problems seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go the tracking is awfull constantly stopping and restarting the precision also is too bad is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse more if you try with cad applications any person even the basic pc user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism is true is a nice looking mouse i have many logitech products that are really good from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one this v400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had kinda disappointing I am uploading pictures of my mouse logitech v400 orange so if you want to have a mouse to look and show the v400 could be a museum object but if you want a extreme machine the microsoft 6000 is the one to go greetings sergio claver from lima peru,165,11
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,i tried using this mouse for several days thinking that i would get used to it i bought it because i liked the usb that snaps in i tend to lose things easily the extra buttons are a great feature i also thought the laser would give me better accuracy well I am not a fan the accuracy is not good compared to my cheapo logitech optical mouse the tracking is awful plus it is not very ergonomical my wrist started hurting after only 30 minutes i returned it,88,12
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,i do not use mice everyday instead preferring to use a drawing tablet mainly i use this mouse when with my laptop i am probably not a picky about mice as the other reviewers that said i have not had any real problems with this mouse it has worked great for day-to-day tasks and the extra buttons make it little nicer to navigate on the internet on the downside it is not a sensitive as i would like for detailed tasks like drawing and photo editing i do not think i would want this as my only mouse / input deviece considering the amount of graphic design work i do but it is great for word processing spreadsheets and web browsing for everything else I shall stick with the tablet on my desktop,126,13
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,i have the same problem others reviewers write down here before me a pitty i did not listen them before the accuracy is terrible awfull many times i move the mouse and the pointer star to move erraticaly or does not move at all no precision and do just the contrary that the add says all terrain i have many friends that have the microsoft mouse for notebook and they no have problems where i have the relatively good news is that with time if you play a little with the setup you reach an acceptable beahvior but nothing compared to a normal old logitech mouse eduardo,106,14
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,warning do not buy these radios i have alot of experience with two way radios i live and work in the mountains of montana and i know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios I have had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers anyway i feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking it is slight but very noticable with regular use i feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can not be certain in addition the sound of the audio is horrible i was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply is not worth it the sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe motorola should recall this product it a serious dissapointment from a company who has name typically means quality these may be the worst radios i have ever owned sorry folks this pair of radios are not worth the box they are shipped in,194,0
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the product worked but only about 500 yards this may be due to trees and more i suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation,27,1
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the ordering and shipping on this product was super fast i received it a few days after ordering like the product plan on using it for outdoor activities would recommend this product and it is cheaper than i saw advertised anywhere else,42,2
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios it was frequently very difficult / impossible to understand what the other person was saying confirmed in both directions this was not an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such simply it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded i have an fcc license and have owned numerous motorola radios over the years this set was a real disappointment a radio that can ideally communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can not understand what the other person is saying even from a very short distance away furthermore the housing of these radios lacks durability the rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone just cheap-feeling plastic now,128,3
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the motorola 9500 was strongly recommended however the set that i received turned out to be a piece of junk very poor voice clarity and quality we depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor to the point of just not using them which put us in a very unsafe position at times i did call motorola and was informed that i was past the warranty time and they would do nothing my recommendation is to buy a set of midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators,108,4
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the first pair of two-way radios i have used they work very well voice is clear i tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user we kept talking until the signal began to break up which was about 7 miles your mileage may vary this was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees these units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation,74,5
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,used the motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip great communications with day long battery life and swapping in aa batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions great radios a good buy at a great price,42,6
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,product is extremely easy to use used while on vacation in the islands on a cruise it is an ideal method for communiction when you are with large parties clarity is not bad but not great worked better in open areas,40,7
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,this radio has adequate power and the audio to get out i highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors rather than weak 5 watt frs radios i found them larger than many in this class and a bit under powered at only 2 watts maximum but ok however it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the remanufactured sale list quite often i suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on or it could be something else if lots get returned and resold it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process in any case buy with caution,118,8
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despacho eficiente y en los tiempos de entrega considerados en cuanto al producto es un buen juguete para los nios tiene sus limitaciones en alcance,25,9
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,pros used with other motorolla and non motorolla radios and the sound quality was good battery holds charge for several days in normal use cons 25 mile range is bizarre because the most that i got was about a mile and a half,43,10
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,it is a great product especially for the price amazon offers it for stores sell the same two way radio for the same price but does not have the 25 mile capability it was a great deal,37,11
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not tested these for their full 25 mile range but they seem to work well enough around the office complex and at the park the 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right i might have actually gotten more than two miles but i also live in los angeles where we do not have very many tall buildings overall they work well enough for casual use but i would not consider them for more critical applications,83,12
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not had much chance to use it as i purchased it for use as an emergency preparedness block captain in my city we have practiced using it but i will not really know until a disaster of some type happens i am pleased to have it for that purpose,51,13
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despite the problems some other reviewers have reported i have not seen them myself the radios could be more durable but for the money they seem like a good value some friends of mine recently took them beach camping and said they had no trouble with the signal although the users were never more than a few miles away from each other the kids liked the interchangeable covers,67,14
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,the motorola t9500xlr seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment once out of the packaging the 2 units are charged via a cradle i have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well first off keep in mind these are not professional level radios they are merely entry level units for home and family use they are ideal for road caravans amusement parks shopping malls cruise ships and more as other reviewers have mentioned the voice over the speaker is tinny and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible the range is definitely nowhere near the claimed 25 miles in a typical setting you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country just remember these radios cost around 50 for the pair and you simply can not expect professional quality at this price point the noaa radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle overall i wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature,182,15
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,this is my second pair of two-way radios the first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise wind staticbut this pair worked much better and was clearer we used them for two days my son and i to try them out at the beach at home and at a big park once we found the right channels they worked perfectly all places i did try to test the distances difficult while walking but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine there was a bit a static at the beach but not too much they are not as clear as your cell phone but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child they will work fine,129,16
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,although the radios had some good features the bad sound quality trumped all of them i had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad even at close range i do not know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing there are other radios for under 10000 that work much much better i just returned the t9500xlrs,75,17
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,these radios have worked well for what i use them for and they keep there charge not more buying batteries they work well,23,18
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,got these so that we can tell our 9yo to come home works with other brands too uniden for sure so he can also communicate with his friends who have other brands while they are playing,35,19
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,for all of the features and capability they put into these radios motorola forgot one key element sound quality other reviews that mention can not understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away are not referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers with only a passing knowledge of audio electronics it would seem that motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker as the sound is very clipped sounding and horribly distorted they could also use a modest compressor on the input as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker for a radio that is marketed as a family product they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk after 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it i still could not get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out these are getting returned unfortunately as they seem to have all the features i want we will try again with midland i think,183,20
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i love these walkie talkies the sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand i have not had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees,51,21
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,motorola has done it again these radios work excellent and i would not buy anything else,15,22
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,do not buy the motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection even with the vibrate alarm our employees were often missing talk requests with the clip on speaker and microphone the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier the radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back,80,23
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the original units would not work right i called morotola and they said those were the deffective ones they sent me new ones that work just fine i sent the old ones back so they could experiment on them motorola provided post paid return envelope a good final experience it pays to go with a name brand that has service department and cares about their customers,64,24
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the second pair of radios i buy so that each member of my family has one products works very well and is very useful for our family vacations both at the beach and at the mountains,38,25
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,wow what junk these worked fine for about two weeks then worked intermittently and are now dead now comes the hassle of sending them back to motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones these never should have made it off the drawing board,49,26
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,after owning 2-way frs / gmrs radios by bellsouth cobra and motorola motorola radios were always the highest quality they may not have been the best in every area but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked the last 3 models I have owned have all been motorola i purchased the t9500xlr their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio the other day to replace my t4900s i was appalled at them the sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older cheaper t4900s and worse yet the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually at any range and at any transmit power whether in the next room or half a mile away the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out no settings affected this i ordered a pair of midland gxt710vp3 radios instead they are way better they are what the t9500xlrs should be,147,27
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these to replace my aging t7200s but there is no comparison the 7200s are far better the 9500xlr have very poor sound quality very tinny like talking in a can the volume does not go high enough and the reception is poor i spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately i am happy to say that amazon accepted my return do not make the same mistake i did look for a different model,84,28
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this has been very useful not just for fun but at remote locations of work related business i would suggest easier menu layout the ability to silence ptt confirmation better clip design recommended overall best buy considering what is out there,41,29
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,do not like thisdo well to get 2 mile range can not understand what other person says 1/2 mile away,20,30
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,we bought these for christmas and they were hours of fun the entire week afterwards the boys especially love to use them for air-soft wars because you can wear earphones with them and turn them on vibrate the only complaint we have is that they do not seem to work long-range we had them on vacation took one for a drive in the car and left another at home we lost contact in about 1/2 mile i will say that we did not play around with that feature too much so maybe there is something we could have done to get a longer signal do not know but they are great fun for around the neighborhood,116,31
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,the audio quality is really poor compared to other manufacturers you can not understand other users even over quite short distances and this not helped when the signal keeps dropping in and out whatever you do do not be beguiled by the motorola name and do not expect any support from motorola regarding this problem they will not do anything about these poor quality products i complained to the uk and united states offices of motorola and both fobbed me off i have some really cheap uniden radios which have a superb sound compared to these you can expect better quality from two tin cans and a length of string than motorolas t9500xlr radios,116,32
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i got these radios because i own two talkabout t5950s i figured that i would upgrade to a newer better model was i wrong they do transmit farther than my prevous model but you can not understand what is being said i am a loyal motorola fan but they had betterup the qaulity i will be returning these radios and i will go back to the old stand-by for another year,72,33
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,this was a real bad decision when people say it all in the name they do not mean motorola t9500r,19,34
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,great price and loaded with man features hard to imagine not going with motorola,14,35
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,these radios are the worst you can not hear anything it does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet they look nice but that about covers it i have nowhy they are still being sold and have not had a recall on the up side i called motorola and they are aware of the problem they are sending me new ones and a different better model they are also sending me return postage so i can send them these awful things back i will let you know how the new ones are,101,36
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,purchased two twin packs of the t9500r radio and the sound quality is so poor they are absolutely useless for transmitting i can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios do not purchase,40,37
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i bought these because the mini club i drive with use 2-way radios for communication the came with headsets and either with or without them it was almost impossible to hear what people were saying range was poor too save your money and buy something cheaper these just do not live up to their claims,54,38
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,they work well are a relative bargain and are nice and small the preferred radio for mt biking,18,39
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations until now I have been very happy with many different motorola and midland models the t9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable,40,40
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,we use 6 8 handheld radios at our business to communicate across multiple floors and buildings we have gone through two generations of motorola talkabouts with this line being the third these are the worst of them all the last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad with several ceasing to work within days of purchase and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up of the 6 we purchased 5 did not have adequate sound transmission cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all these are junk do not waste your money my one star is because they are attractive to look at,116,41
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them the voice clarity does not exist no one is able to understand anyone it cuts out sporadically i would say that the distance is terrible also but i can not tell if the radio is cutting out or i just can not understand anyone called moto and they actually confirm that there is a problem with this and another new model they recommended that i get the sx800r model at first they would not even take it back oh the noaa channels are great and clear design is also good,103,42
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,wow have walkie-talkies changed in four years these are packed with some pretty sophisticated features including noaa weather alert and are very user-friendly strongly recommend,25,43
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,as many people have noted the audio quality of these radios is terrible i also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when i had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again,44,44
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1,negative,as the other reviewer stated if you mountain bike anywhere there are bumps roots rocksthe mount is just too weak to take the stress i had less than 50 miles on the first one and the interlock snapped off thinking it was just a faulty unit i order a replacement and gave it a second try after 20 miles the second one did the same thing ram needs to abandon the swivel option and design a more secure fixed mount if this is to work with any mountain biking none of this mileage was over any hard hitting drops gps resides in my hydration pack now until i find someone thing more secure,115,0
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1,negative,I am a fan of the delorme earthmate but this bike mount is worthless unless you plan on riding exclusively on paved roads or groomed dirt trails unless they have recently improved the mount which i doubt it attaches to the handlebars with zip ties this alone was a red flag you can not get the ties very tight and the thing wobbles around and will not stay put i outright snapped zip ties twice due to vibration from a rocky trail this was moderately annoying but on another ride again on fairly technical rocky terrain the plastic bracket that attaches the unit cradle to the handlebar mount snapped it is also incredibly bulky compared with garmins low profile bike mount seriously guys can not you come up with something better,125,1
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2,negative,this mount has a very poor design where it attaches to the handlebar moderate jarring caused the gps to vibrate so much that within 5 rides it broke there is a warranty but it is a hassle and not worth the cost of postage to get the same thing back save your money and keep the gps in a side pocket on a hydration pack,65,2
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1,negative,arrived with parts missing and there is no clue on how to contact the seller for replacements buy locally and examine at store to assure that you get all the required parts,32,3
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,gps unit fits in real tight i do not think i have to worry about loosing it bouncing over trails very happy with it,23,4
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2,negative,just received it is ok but only marginally so issues only mounts permanently mounts via plastic ties rubber strip missing from package I shall keep it but would definitely not recommend it main picture in listing is the 44 version detail pictures are of this product,44,5
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2,negative,does not mount tight to handle bars with the zip ties making the mount move also the 4 prongs that snap into the bike mount will break only lasted about 8 months,31,6
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2,negative,the mechanism by which this mount attaches to your handlebars is two zip ties give me a break,18,7
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,i bought this for my new pn-60 i guess it used to attaching using screws and a clamp but now it uses zip-ties so it should attach to just about any diameter handlebar the gpsr is held tight in the bracket so tight in fact that you will want to remove the lanyard before you put it in the bracket is easily removed with a simple twist but it stayed in place even over rough roads it works great for me when i go out cycle caching the pn-60 will even calculate a road route to the cache update the little plastic pins that secure the gpsr holder the bike mount tend to break off that means it does not last too long if you go on rough roads I have had to buy two more mounts it is still useful but it needs a redesign to make it last longer,150,8
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,4,positive,very well built bicycle mount i was disappointed when i saw that the whole thing was mounted to the handle bars by zip ties this part could stand to improved but once mounted it hangs tight and works very well i like the quick disconnct makes it fast and easy to remove and snap back on,56,9
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,i planned to buy one of these handle-bar racks when i bought the pn-30 gps handheld i received the unit and made sure that it would do what i intended and within a day i ordered the handle-bar mounting kit and the carrying bag as well the handle-bar mount is a universal fit device it clamps to your handle-bar by the use of heavy-duty zip-ties and delorme provides a self-stick rubber sheet that you wrap around your handle-bar before attaching the unit while it is a primitive design it works flawlessly and i tested it on some rough road before i considered writing a review of the product it has not slipped at all and the pn-30 is held securely at just the right viewing angle for me i would love to see delorme modify the mounting kit to make it easier to put the gps handheld into the bar mount but it is so secure the way it is designed so i am pretty sure they make it the way they do to prevent the unit from accidently coming loose if you are mountain-biking or riding a rough road like the pan-am highway,194,10
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,i took note of the reviews cautioning about the lack of instructions and the limit on the handlebar diameter supported but i bought it even although i have a thick handlebar i am glad i did right on the front of the packaging it says new ez-on attachment fits multiple handlebar sizes sure enough there were clear instructions and an attachment kit using zip ties and form fitted parts that would allow for any diameter handlebars installation was easy and seems very sturdy do not hesitate to buy if you have a pn series gps and want to cycle with it,101,11
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,4,positive,does what it should but bulky there are better mounts out there and when i find it i will buy it,21,12
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,it are not that hard to figure out without directions there has only four bolts two nylok nuts and four plastic molded pieces i do not know what kind of plastic this material is but without too much effort i had no problem prying apart the handlebar clamp but i can see where it might be too tough for some believe me if this clamp got stressed to the point of snapping you would know about it the handlebar bracket was a sloppy fit but wrappng a few turns of black electricians tape around the circumferance of the handlebar between it and the clamp took up the slop no slop after i tightened it solid as a rock now my handlebars are only 22 mm diam close to the brake cable mounts and then it flares up to 25 mm in diam towards the gooseneck so now you know what to expect i agree they should offer a larger diameter handlebar clamp and print a diameter spec to go along with it,168,13
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1,negative,i ordered this for a new road bike and was disappointed at the lack of documentation and that the cheap plastic bracket almost snapped when i put it on my handlebars the handlebars were way too thick for the screw holes to line up even with a longer screw as the previous reviewer noted there are no dimensions listed for maximum handlebar thickness yet there needs to be as newer bikes are larger,73,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2,negative,i order these often and they are usually fine but today when they arrived i could not help but notice the bag barely weighed anything compared to my other bag of 2 lb of grapes it looks so empty weighed them on the scale and it was just under 1 lb where is the other pound,52,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,sweer and juicy with a crunch ate them all in one day,12,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2,negative,we have ordered these twice and both times the grapes came browned and moldy in some areas were these frozen and then thawed out,23,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,the quality of produce has gone wayyyyy down since i started using amazon fresh and these sad excuse for grapes are a prime example of it they are almost bare branches and some are rotting most edible grapes are visibly yellow amazon fresh is not worth it anymore to me identification rather brave the masses at the grocery store than get the kind of produce they send,67,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,looked brown and tasted yucky not fresh at all,9,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,i t was so juicy and sweet sometimes they are too tart and not sweet enough not these they were really delicious,22,5

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,the grapes i received were not as fresh as i was expecting they were withered and a good amount of them were on the verge of turning to mush ended up throwing them out since i could not use them in my lunches disappointing but a good lesson in what not to purchase from amazon fresh,55,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,best grapes i have ever tasted in my life,9,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,they arrived brown not able to eat them,8,15

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,grapes arrived literally with white fuzzy mold all over them amazon fresh is great but produce is hit or completely rotten beware amazon is always great about helping solve the issue although,31,17

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2,negative,amazon fresh is usually pretty great with fresh fruits and produce but this bunch was bad i had to throw it,22,30
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,whoever packed my order at this location thought it would be a swellto drop two heavy icepacks on top of the grapes yeah not so much last time it was four cans of progresso soup on top of a tube of quaker oats which had been packed on it is side at the bottom of the tote that was fun to clean up wasting food is not myof a good time get it together springfield,78,31

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,these were good and lasted a long time,8,33
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,using amazon fresh was a pleasant experience for me with the exception being these grapes one night in the fridge and half the bunch turned brown,26,34
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2,negative,tough skin and has seeds not what i was expecting,10,35

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,4,positive,this was my first amazon fresh order so i did not know what to expect in terms of the fresh produce the grapes i got are about the same as what we have in local grocery stores at this time of year smaller a little tart crisp thepacks in the delivery totebag kept all my produce cold I shall probably still shop at my local markets for seasonal produce but this was a convenient option and the quality of the goods was fine,83,41
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,fresher than the bunches in stores stayed fresh for 2 weeks,11,42
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2,negative,you could tell the grapes were old half of them had mold on them,14,43
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,my kids and husband love mio but it is so expensive that i was hoping that this vitamin squeeze energy drink would be a better alternative it is not from the moment they all took a sip i could see that it was going to go into the garbage pretty quickly all of them said it tasted kinda like kool-aid but then they all grimaced and got went for the water they all said it had a weird aftertaste the 8 year old said her mouth tasted funny and that they did not want any more of it or to finish the glass they had so yeah mio this is definitely not,109,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,this is the easiest way to add nutrients to my bottled water and to help me get the daily intake of water that i need I am not good about drinking plain water each day and this little squeeze has really helped me to drink what i should great taste great product,51,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,I have have tried the citrust acai grape pomegranate and the fruit punch they all have great tastes if you are looking for a drink that does not taste overly sweet than this is it a quick squirt in a glass of water was perfect it reminded me of a blend of propel and a vitamin water I am not a big fan of sweet sports drinks and often water down my gatorade or powerade because it is too sweet this is a perfect option for someone looking for a great tasting drink with good flavor that is not too sweet,98,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,great new product i have tried 3 of the 4 flavors tropical citrus acai grape pomegranate and energy peach green tea i work in a high school and i am always getting sick i have been drinking vitamin squeeze for several months now and have not been sick once this is the only thing i have done differently i do not like the taste of the tap water at the school so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water finally a truly great drink which is much better than mio and half the price of vitaminwater all it takes is a little squeeze for me vitamin squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products 0 calorie 0 carbs 0 sugar love it my teens think the tropical citrus tastes like tang or a creamsicle i am headed back to safeway to get more i highly recommend this product,164,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,ever since i saw mio i thought it was a cutebut why do i really need flavor i prefer function and vitaminsqueeze fruit punch is my familys favorite and get the flavor for free great taste my kids definitely prefer a small glass of fruit punch in the morning over a gummy vitamin anyway great new product i recommend,61,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,p product tasted great and i initially thought the bottle was great squirt a few and you are good however i left it standing as you see in the pic and came back with product leaking / leaked out so that was not good i like the taste and am in the camp that no matter how healthy we eat we need to supplement with vitamins / minerals be it in pill powder or liquid form your choice,72,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,this stuff makes your water taste somewhat like koolaid but i would not consider giving it to kids we need to eat and drink more natural foods not stuff like this,30,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,this taste like kool-aid with a hint of cough syrup i hate cough syrup and the kids here did not like the taste either it also contains caffeine so you can not give this stuff to kids all day thinking that the vitamins will be good for them too much caffeine makes kids go hyper active if you dilute it a lot it does not take like anything except for a kool-aide / cough syrup after taste the bottle is pretty large although and will last for weeks if you enjoy the taste,88,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,the taste is so gross that i can not even finish it i would not waste my money on this i would rather have an energy drink and take a multi-vitamin everyday if i needed caffeine,34,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,i can not say how much energy this drink supplement will give you but i do enjoy the taste it tastes like hawaiian punch did to me as a kid but without the sugar you just squeeze some into some water and you have a healthy drink without the carbonation or sugar of soft drinks i like it it is a nice break from lemonadetea and other such drinks and it makes water taste good,75,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,the flavor of this product is good a bit too sweet but that is par for the course with these sort of things it is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day it is not as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market which means the bottle is really big it may sound like an unimportant thing but it is harder to toss it in your purse when the bottle is so large but that is my only real complaint otherwise this product is pretty good,99,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,i am used to the powdered packets that crystal light offers and i think i could go either way the nice thing about this is that you can add as much as you like until the taste is as strong as you want it to be i have no clue if the vitamins are doing any good but as far as the taste goes it is not bad,67,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,i thought this might be a good way to get the best of both worlds water plus vitamins however the taste was so awful i could not do it it tasted like bad kool-aid i tried it four times just to see if i could get past the taste for the benefits but it was a no-go and on the fourth try i squeezed the vitamin mix into my water and the vitamin bottle started leaking all over my hand and the counter i did not get it all wiped up and it dried super sticky makes me wonder just how much sugar was in it i think I shall go back to the old fashioned way of taking vitamins,117,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,this is a good sized bottle and it lasts a long time dollar for dollar and taste for taste i would rate this over mio any day it had a better flavor and no snails-in-the-mouth feeling it is very easy to mix just take a sip out of your water bottle to make some shaking room squeeze in less than you think you will need shake and taste the flavor on this builds up very quickly so start off light unlike mio it does not go from zero-to-nasty in a hurry so you have some room teens liked this better than adults of course i did not tell them it was a vitamin drink,111,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,we all tried it 2 parents 13 year old and 10 year old nobody liked it older child said that it tasted like chewable vitamins adults did not think it was that bad but did not like it either net result is that after everyone tried it once it sat untouched on the shelf in the pantry for months nobody wanted a second glass it can not deliver the vitamins if nobody drinks it,71,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,this adds vitamin c and caffeine to your water which is great for people who are looking for that caffeine may boost your workouts and is the daily drug of choice for many of us but watch out for side effects and do not over do it the deal breaker for me on this one was taste it tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch kool-aid with a pronounced aftertaste i strongly prefer optimum nutrition essential amino energy fruit fusion a powdered caffeine add-on or some of the mio products,91,15
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,1 I am definitely a fan of the powdered drinks and recently noticed the craze surrounding the concetrated liquid formula bottomline the taste is fine and i can see the benefit of being able to fine tune the taste for varying sizes of cups h20 but in the end i was put off by the fact that you have to keep this stuff in the fridge and depending on how you squeeze it it is inevitable that you are going to make a mess here or there i think it is much more versatile to utilize the powdered form at least for me,100,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,not that great of a set because it is overpriced for one and there has almost no down in the comforter you are better off going to walmart or some place like that and buying one very disappointed,35,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,i bought this comforter set in hopes it would fit in my washer it is the first king size comforter i have found that i can launder at home i wash it on delicate and dry on low heat it has held up very well to weekly washings so far all stains from baby formula to ink have washed out i am pleased thus far and considering buying sets for the kids,72,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,great quality comforter set only purchase for light summer use not ment for heavy winter use,16,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,it was soft and great right out of the bag however the 1st time we washed it feathers were everywhere by the time we washed it the 2nd time it was not more than just a piece of material and had to throw it away the tag said machine wash this one must have had a flaw in the material or was just cheaper made i bought one just like it 6 years ago and it looks as good as the day i bought it after multiple machine washings i was very disappointed in this product,95,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,what a remarkable value for the low price i was not sure what to expect but it is a lovely set at twice the price all pieces are well-fitting comforter is warm yet lightweight and an added bonus it is even reversible now i regret not getting a couple of other colors as well because they are all out of stock in cal king now,61,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,so i read the reviews but recongize that some people have unreasonable expectations you get what you pay for but this set is amazing and for the money fantastic i saw that people compained that the feathers came out i have never seen a one it is very warm yet is not too warm when your heat is up i have slept with the windows open and that soft cozy feeling is amazing i bought the khakiis very soft and feels like a super high quality set it comes with pillow shams and skirt you will just love it and do not be scared of the other posts,107,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,love theand how it keep you warm but a problom with the feathers comeing out the faethers is over every thing,24,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,this comforter set is okay if you do not mine wearing feathers all day long or seeing them all over your bed and room I have on had the comforter for about 3 weeks and feathers are everywhere even getting all over our clothes my husband is sick of it and just said yesterday that he has planning to take it to the salvation army and just buy a comforter from walmart the style and look is nice but the feathers coming through the fabric is insane,84,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,i was excited to receive this set because i love there d and really wanted to try a down comforter i slept great the first night and i loved the microsuede fabric i did not like however how each time i touched it the feathers would come flying out each time i fluff it to make my bed there are feathers everywhere i hate that it is perfect as long as i do not sleep on it,76,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this purchase the quality far surpasses what i expected it is warm comfortable and only a few feathers seep out when i make the bed,29,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,what a dissapointing purchase the material is very thin the feathers are coming out everywhere and it does not provide any warmth i have a down comforter that is over 10 years old and it is much better than this new one now i just use both of them on the bed i should have returned it but did not,58,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,i have this on my bed right now it is warm soft and light enough we do not roast to death but heavy enough to keep us warm it is really easy to clean we have taken it to the laundro-mat and washed it in the huge washer using the huge dryer adn tennis balls to make sure the stuffign was dry i would buy another for our daughters room but she has not decided on her colors yet,75,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,i would not recommend this comforter to anyone from the time i took it out of the bag it came in feather have been everywhere it only gets worse as time goes on it is comfortable and warm and it would look good if not for the white feather all over the place,53,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,this comforter set arrived to me in a huge box i was like oh yeah until i opened it there was more paper in the box than comforter the comforter bag was so small like it was a sheet set i can not believe that there is no down in the dame thing i wonder why they only want 3500 for it because your getting a sheet set with 1 feather in it and called it adown comforter i read other reviews and they said that feathers are everywhere but i do not see how that is possible if it did not come with any feathers unless they some how lost the feathers during shipment laughing out loud or mywas bald go figure,123,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,it had very little to no down it looks like there is some filler it the photo but when i received it the comforter had no fill somehow it got passed quality control with no down in it,38,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,i purchased thisand sent it back after opening it the seams were coming apart and it was really thin i did not expect anything great but this was a lot less than i expected,35,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,i love theand texture of this comforter however as mentioned in previous reviews it does not take long before the feathers start to come out i thought for the price i would try it and hope for the best unfortunately my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out this is not just an occasional feather either it started out that way but after a week or two it is all the time i especially notice it in the stitching areas disappointed,98,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,i love my new comforter it is deliciously soft and comfortable be warned it is much too heavy for year-round use but perfect for a freezing winter night theis oh-so-slightly less vivid than in the picture but it is still a beautiful addition to my bedroom i would definitely order this product again,55,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,the microsuede is incredibly soft the pillow covers are great but i have feathers everywhere they come out very easily and make a mess of the entire place,28,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,this comforter was definitely worth the money i could not believe the quaility for the price i lost a few feathers but it is great,24,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,it is well worth the 35 bucks it is not too thick which means you can actually sleep with it and not sweat to death,23,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,for the 3500 i paid for this set it was well worth the money it is so warm so cozy so soft yet it looks very high-class it is not as poofy as the pictures make it look even after giving it a big fluff-up but it really does add a touch-of-class to our room and i wish i would have gotten the red set too for our other room the only problem that I have had is that the feathers / down come out a lot not really at the seams so much just at random places all over the comforter it is a little annoying always vacuuming them up but other than that it is been great,113,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,the comforter is soft and pretty however it is not very full and fluffy the worst of it is that the down feathers fall out of the comforters thin material and make a mess in the bed we are not able to use this comforter at all,46,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,no problem with the shams or bed skirt and i loved thebut the feathers in the comforter started coming out very quickly it really looks like i plucked a chicken on my bed i was less than pleased with the set but for the price i guess i got what i paid for,55,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,great deal for the price the stitching is very weak and has only one stitch accross each pattern if it breaks and there were breaks then it breaks loose it is not 100 down it says 75 on mine yet the ad says 100 eachhas a different feel to it and it is noticeable having said all of that i gave it a 4 because for the price you are getting something worth what you pay for it is warm and maintains the warmth not like the true 100 down comforters although,93,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,light soft warm good quality overall and i got it with extremely affordable price everyone loves it in the family,20,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,poor quality feathers everywhere i normally do not write reviews but i strongly suggest you do not get this,18,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,pros comforter is warm and you get a good night sleep cons you may get a good nite sleep but when you wake up you will find feathers allover the bed the feathers keep coming out from comforter cover i used this for a week and have thrown this i do not want the hassle of removing feathers from my bed every day can i get a refund on this,72,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,comforter slides off the bed not a bad thing since the feathers stab you in your sleep did i mention 100s of feathers come through the comforter and get everywhere got a deal but never expected this amazingly bad quality,40,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,i have been pleased with my purchase of this comforter set it was not as puffy as i was expecting but it definately keeps us warm my only complaint is that it does she had feathers which show up against the darkthat we ordered,44,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,love the comforter it is so soft and very very warm better than the one i paid lots more money for so glad i jumped on it and got it when i did they went fast,35,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,the comforter is very nice and warm my only negative comment is that the feathers come out from time to time i am quite satisfied with it especially for the price,31,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,this was wonderful much less expensive than in the stores and good quality very happy with it,19,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,i was extremely pleased with this comforter set it is very very warm even although it is not a thick comforter lightweight and warm that is a plus i have a cat that loves to lay on it and it has been the easiest to clean the hair off of that i have owned with a lint brush which makes the entire comforter look very nice love it,66,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,ordered this set in navy loved the look until i opened it white feathers inside the comforter would poke through the exterior top of blanket with debris it looked amess and very unattractive bought a lint brush to attempt to wipe off the feathers but that did not do anything i removed the comforter set from the bed within two weeks of having it i do not recommend thisat all maybe the lighter colors would work better but i am not willing to find out,86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,several years ago i purchased a comforter and shams as a gift it was three times the price of the one i just bought from amazon yet identical in every way with the exception that the amazon purchase also came with a bedskirt it is lightweight but warm has a good loft while still being flexible the filling is actually down and not the pin feathers that tend to crackle and end up poking through the fabric other reviews I have read on this product reflect disappointment that the shams are thin well they are shams you know it is the pillow within that gives a sham life honestly i did not expect this kind of quality for the price i paid very well made excellent price perfect purchase thank you so much,126,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,the comforter is very very soft and holds heat very well the only complaint i have is that the down feathers seem to be coming out but I am sure this would be solved with a duvet cover as i do not have one,42,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,this is a great product for the price i have it on my bed now and looks wonderful,18,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,i was not very satisfied with this product it is very thin and do not feel like a down comforter i guess there is little down fill in there i did not want to deal with the return procedure and pay the shipping to send it back so i end up kept it to use on the sofa,56,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,i am from arizona and wanted a light weight down comforter did not realize it came with shams and skirt best buy anyone could fine nice quality and fit,28,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,this is a good comforter for the price amazon is selling it for i wish the microsuede was on both sides because you can only feel the softness if you are sleeping on it it is also kind of short for a queen bed,43,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,we got a great deal and worth the money it does have a luxurious feeling it does it is job well keeps you warm,20,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,the price was really good however it was very thin and not very warm i would have to however that the worst part about the blanket is that it sheds feathers all over the place basically rendering it useless do not buy unless you like feathers all over your pajamas and floor,52,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,this is just cheap all over but i guess for the price what do you expect i now use it as a pillowtop for my mattress and it is fulfulling that duty pretty well,33,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,if i had known that down fill means feathers i would not have brought thisfeathers were everywhere i would not recommend thisto no one only if they like feathers very dissatisfied,35,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,i like this quilt because i do not have to worry about the cover twisting around but i have had it for a year and it is not going to survive much longer it is losing feathers at an alarming rate,38,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,this is a nice warm mild weather comforter it is soft and comfie but suffers from a common failing it leaks a few feathers now and again,26,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,i got one of these and after a few days feathers are coming out everywhere looks ok and feels nice but not worth the mess it makes pulling feathers out,31,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,when first opened was thinner than expected was able to fluff up by washing it very warm and comfy,19,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,we just recently bought this comforter set off amazon for a great deal we were pleasantly surprised when it arrived and found it to be of great quality and extremely soft it is replacing our old down comforter that we loved so much and i can honestly say that this one is just as good as our first one that we paid lots of money for so if there are any available definitely buy as this is a great comforter set for the money and would make great christmas gifts my husband loves it too,94,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,i really love this comforter set i read a couple of reviews before i purchased it so i knew what to expect it is not too big and fluffy which is fine for me because I had rather wash it myself than send it to the dry cleaners it is very soft and comfortable and i complimented it with some nice throw pillows so it looks awesome,64,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,i ordered this down comforter set in brown for my 13yo son i just love it and more importantly so does he he has never had a down comforter before and could not believe how warm and cozy it is the brown microsuede is an impressive and durable fabric just before writing this review i asked him what his review would be his reply was it was sent straight from heaven yeah a little dramatic but he really loves it the reverse side of the comforter is a cotton or a cotton blend that is slightly lighter inthan the microsuede i will be using the bedskirt to construct some box pleat valances for his room just because with everything on his bed it was just too much brown i am also going to be ordering this set for my youngest sister who was jealous that a 12 year old had this nice of a comforter set she thought it was a 200 set,164,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,my boyfriend and i just bought a new house and now that we are unpacked we finally have a chance to start decorating the house is very modern so we are using a lot of black and chrome for our accent colors i was a bit impulsive when purchasing this set however the fact that the duvet is down and that it came with a matching dust ruffle really sold me the dust ruffle brings the entire set together it provides a much sleeker look i was hoping the down duvet would have been a little thicker but overall i am very impressed with what i was able to get for the money in addition i thought the pillow shams were perfect usually shams are too thick and bulky so i do not put them on the pillows i sleep with however these shams were thinner yet elegant and very soft / comfortable enough to place on a pillow you will be sleeping with not just for decoration great buy excellent value,168,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,at first i was not that thrilled i thought it would be fluffier / fuller and the shams looked really cheap however i went and checked out some other down comfronters and realized that they were the same fill as mine and they were 6x the price after a nights sleep i was in love it was soft soothing and warm the next day i matched it with a bright pink 300tc sateen sheet set from amazon and it really made it pop the next day when i came in from work i felt like i was in a new room it even looked as if i spent much more than i did it is a great buy the shams are still cheap looking but you can dress them up with extra pillows from the money you save,134,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,3999 for a great little comforter set got the chocolate brown one to put on bed in our lake cabin and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality very warm soft and nice looking comes with comforter 2 shams and bed skirt we got free shipping so even better deal,50,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that i saw before i purchased one i thought it was going to be real light but when i received it it was definitely a heavy weight lid for 10 it was a real bargain they must have made it heavier since the one in the article do not buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch it is excellent,85,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this lid with it is double-ply construction is much better than those available locally in the kitchen departments of discount and hardware stores it has no sharp edges it arrived a little bent but was easily straightened it would have been nice if the description included the fact that it was aluminum this should not be assumed,55,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this thing is tiny too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan guess i should have paid more attention to the dimensions into the trash it goes,28,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this and it was all scratched up and look used do not waste your money,16,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,sad that a made in united states item is so flimsy was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes prior review that mentions not good for covering 12 pans is misleading it barely covers a 10 1/4 8 griswold ci frying pan,50,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,have a number of odd-ball or miscellaneous pots and pots you want a lid for it but it either never came with one or you have lost it your savior is at hand i have been using mine for years and is pretty beat-up and abused the fit is kinda awkward for smaller pans the fit is usually rather loose plus it will not fit 12 inch skillets still i love mine and would never give it up you might want to consider another brand that will cover a 12 inch pan,92,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i wanted something really light weight to keep in our rv and this one does the job perfectly it is very light weight and it would honestly be easy to bend but it is perfect for what i wanted it for,39,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,perfect for cooking bacon hamburgers or anything that splatters it is 10 in diameter and can fit all pots for that size i highly recommend this cover,27,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say these work and are cheap,9,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,very good for different size saucepans but be warned as the lid may become very hot,16,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,very nice do you have a smaller one for a small fry pan,13,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,bought this as a replacement lid for my wax pot sturdy and easy to clean great buy,17,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,it is a small cover what i expected,8,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this arrived bent and it was flimsy and pretty much a piece of junk unfortunately i needed it immediately so i could not return it while i did not expect it to be a stellar piece of equipment i did expect it to be a little bit more substantial than the lids on my grandsons toy cook set would never buy it again,64,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,way overpriced poor quality something you would find in a dollar store,11,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,arrived quickly product was just as described not heavy-duty or for everyday use but works great as a universal pan / pot lid for occasional use it is a bit over-priced,28,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i like the lid but the ridges are hard to clean guess i should have expected that,17,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,the cover is pretty thick but it came bent the black handle also does not sit perpendicularly to it is base not worth the 14,24,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,it is ok matetial is not the best but still use works,11,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,this was a very great find the lids fix any and every pot love them thank you,17,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,flies just as good as the real frizbee dang near cut the clothes line with it,16,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,lighter weight than i expected and the handle was not screwed on tight when it arrived it did arrive in 2 days as promised so kudos to the shipping dept,29,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,is actually rather small did not fit the big pans i bought it for but does fit our smaller pots and pans okay nothing special,25,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,good everyday cover that fits a variety of pots it did warp a very little either in transit or it was shipped that way,24,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,complete crap the lid is very thin and does not insulate the food when it is cooking it was already slightly bent when it arrived but i was able to bend it back straight again most importantly it does not fit all pots well at all the handle on most pots is angled in a way that it does not let the lid lay flush on top so the whole reason for having a lid is lost do yourself a favor and skip this product,85,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,pen was not the right size i needed a university cover that was larger it did not cover my large teflon skillet was two inches too small,27,25

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,the lid is not as wide as i had thought so i can not use it on very many skillets this is my fault as i did not measure everything but it is a good product for the money,36,28

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it works as it should i did end up flipping the knob to the other side so that the lid would not be resting on the handle of my smaller pans it is a bit overpriced seems like something you would find in a thriftshop for 50,45,42

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this works well for me it is not a perfect fit as other reviewers have noted but with the graduated sizes you move it around a little to find the best fit for your pan i just appreciate it stops any splatter most importantly amazon has fixed the problem of these lids arriving dented with airbags and in a big box my lid arrived in perfect shape,69,52

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,lid arrived with dents all over it and with the black top / handle missing from the other reviews this is a habitual problem the dents were so bad that the lid would not collapse properly the lid itself is also extremely flimsy i returned the lid right away and would not advise anyone to purchase it,54,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,so many skillet sets come without a lid this lid is perfect for the 2 pan set i purchased for my college son in his first apartment,27,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i love this pot cover the handle does not get hot so i do not have to find a pot holder to pick it up it is very light which is great with my arthritis it fits beautifully over my medium size omelette / fry pan i can place my favorite ingredients for a vegetable cheese fritatta withwhites in the pan cover it with this 10 cover turn the burner down to very low and wait until it hardens into a perfectveggie pancake then i quarter it 4 wedges and have 4 breakfasts ready to go when i am in a hurry i like that it does not fit so tightly that it can not breathe a little it does lie flat and that is good enough for me i also bought the same pot cover in a16 size to use in my very large fry pan for poaching salmon also very slowly in 1/2 cup chardonnay water to cover 2 - 3 pepper corns lemon juice bayfresh parsley and a slice of onion only takes a few minutes on low once it boils both covers are the ones i use the most in my kitchen,194,61

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i needed a lid and here it is after having accidentallky burned up the one i inherited from my mother i whined and moaned until i found this one of course it is not as good as moms but it gets the job done,43,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,these items are pices of crap all you get is vapor and water all over stove thought these lids were retrackable,21,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,arrived bent badly so soft i could easily bend it back with my fingers only marginally more effective than foil returned at once,23,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say about a well priced product that solves the problem and dose it is job i like it,20,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,very poor quality grooves are two shallow and it foes not stay on my pan and pots securely it is better than no cover at all although,27,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,must not be exactly 10 inches did not fit pot too small for a 10 inch round pot flimsy material,21,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i like this a lot originally i had no covers love the face that i do not have a dozen lids floating around on the smaller side than expected but still a good buy,33,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would like this same lid in a 12 version it works pretty good for 10 skillets it makes a good spare for my dutch oven that shares a lid with one of my skillets,35,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I have had this lid for years and although i still used it the handle was loose and it was so old i could not tighten the screw when i saw these i ordered myself two use them every day they are light quick fit well in dishwasher and they fit most anything love this reasonable lid,55,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i use this pan cover on my 10 frying pan and on my 8 pot lightweight easy to clean aluminum top good value for money,25,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,the first time i used and washed it it got discolored also it did not fit the large pan i bought it for it was too small cheap looking also,31,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,not worth the price a rip off probably worth a 150 but no more i would not recommend anyone buying this,22,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,fits all my pots and pans had one but had given it away glad i was able to get another one,21,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,looks great and fits my pan thank you very much i have larger pans that i could use a bigger cover for 12 inch,28,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i wanted a replacement lid for a 10-inch dutch oven and was trying to save money by not buying a glass lid one amazon reviewer said about this fitz-all lid i love mine and would never give it up that was a great endorsement so i bought one it is 10 1/8 inches in diameter the aluminum has a concentric circles design with a very slight concave to the underside the lid sits flush on top of my dutch oven with no lip orto keep it from sliding no problem although and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size my dutch oven is cast iron inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches which works fine with this lid i have not tried it on smaller-sized pots / pans yet but that is supposed to be one of it is advantages handling a range of sizes,175,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this is a joke it looks and feels like the toy pots and pans sets we used as children it is not big enough to cover most pans and it is too lightweight and cheap cheap cheap cheap do not waste your money,40,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the lid was already bent when i got it just a bit but just taking it to the kitchen using it the first time it was all bent out of shape from being thin soft material so it did not fit the pots tight went to wal mart and came across a really good one that is half glass,59,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,these covers are flimsy thin but it would have still serve the purpose i had intended for them if they were smaller i did not realize that they were so big i needed smaller pot covers so these are just not suitable,41,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,it looks really ugly and is very small for even small pans i do not recommend it to any one,20,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,can cover something will simmering then use same lid for another fry pan or pot less clean up just are very useful product,23,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the first time i used the cover it warped now it does not seal thebetween the pan and the cover the steam pours out it was a cheap product at a cheap price,34,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i was super angry when my pot lid shattered into pieces most other replacements were super expensive and this one is cheap and affordable and gets the job done it will not be a snug fit on your pot but i did not need it to be so it worked great for me,51,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,my own fault that i did not measure my pan but other than that this works a little better than using a plate to cover your pan because you can grab the knob and not burn your fingers mine came with the knob sort of bent and a small dent but I am quite sure that was because of poor packaging shipping was quick although,63,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,i was trying to save some money on 8 - 10 in pan lids as a result I have wasted my money on these very poor quality not safe around the kitchen they get so hot in instant if you missed the handle you may get burnt easily go with the real glass ones 3x/4x more expensive although but in a long run it is totally worth it,65,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the picture appeared to be a pot and pan top of quality very low level of a top i would not recommend to purchase does not hold head well when cooking does not clean well,35,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this full of dents with a screw and no handle the only reason i am not returning it is because it will cost me more to send it back then what it is worth i have been looking for a cover for months then found this and thought it was the end of my search forget it a peice of crap do not order this product,70,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,as others have mentioned it is made of aluminum and very big on small pots and pans still it meets the basic need,23,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,my boyfriend and i have all sorts and brands of pans from over the years and have misplaced lids this works well on all our pots thanks,27,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this lid is flimsy but better than nothing it also does not sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot,23,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,great for those lidless pots it fits any pots up to 10 only drawback is that it does not fit my largest frying pan which is 12,26,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i use this lid every day it replaced one that was years old the size is perfect it fits every pot I have set it on,25,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,when i received the package it was already bent up probably because it is not made very well the metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it will definitely bend i suppose it is good for your most basic needs but other than that do not be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid,59,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I am not sure what lid the other reviewers received who said that theirs was flimsy because the one i received is very strong it would be hard to bend or dent this it is small but it is perfect for small pans i like it,44,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it does what i need it to do it is very light weight and would be easy to bend out of shape but it is the answer to a need i have other pots and pan lids are just to big,39,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the description says that this lid fits all but it does not and the material is so cheap i needed it for a casserole that i have bought from goodwill but it did not even come close and it is a 16 casserole,41,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids i agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy which is why i gave it four stars instead of five mine had a teeny tiny dent in it but really no biggie not as good quality as the old one i have but useful nonetheless as i need one for home and one for the camper,86,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,there has nothing wrong with this lid other than i did not think it through in terms of size before ordering this is not big enough for a large fry pan I shall keep it anyway since it is a decent lid or other pots but if you need it for a large fry pan you need at least 12 1/2 lid and this one is only 10,65,100
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,i just wanted a simple inexpensive vernier caliper that works and this is it the markings are engraved not printed there are cheaper calipers where the marks are printed on the edges are a bit sharp but not exceptionally so and the finish quality is adequate no instructions are included about how to get the measurements down to 01 mm or 1/128 inch but google how to use a vernier caliper and it is pretty simple to figure out no markings about where this thing is made it works perfectly fine,89,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,you get what you pay for i m not sure about the accuracy of the instrument but the finish was very bad looked like a one that had been used for 3 years buy a goof n then given,39,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,while not having the refined finish we have come to associate with british new england and japanese tools this is a serviceable and accurate instrument,25,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i bought this because it looked sturdy and did not have digital readings because i worried that the battery would be dead with infrequent usage this would probably work fine for carpentry or mechanical usage it moves easily and measurements can be taken with one hand for measurement of human anatomy however it has sharp edges that could cut skin,59,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,i received the caliper shortly after ordering and the caliper itself seems to be pretty solid i have no reference gauges with which to test it is accuracy but it does appear to be possible to calibrate the caliper however the specific caliper that i received appears to have small specks of rust on the jaws and some scratches in addition the caliper actually shipped outside it is plastic and foam case the shipment was well packaged so there was no damage to the caliper but it seemed like it would have been safer to put the caliper inside the case perhaps i received a returnedrather than a newgiving 4 stars because i think the caliper will serve it is purpose well despite these minor issues,127,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,i had received the gauge a little while ago and in my initial review mentioned the case arrived broken without contacting anyone from jacks tool she had someone contacted me and immediately sent me a new case thank you for the excellent service and i look forward to dealing with jacks in the future,53,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,it is not the ultra-high quality product all the edges are too sharp but it is solid construction and I am pretty happy with it i recommend it,26,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,junk does not measure properly due to shifting marker plate,9,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,they are pretty crappy quality but they will work for what i need if you need any type of accuracy buy something different,23,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i buy a lot of products on amazon and never really had a problem therefore i did not open the box until now which is several months after buying it the product itself is not that bad but as far as i know i have ordered a new caliper this is not a new caliper it clearly has been used the caliper i received is covered in greasy fingerprints scratches and dents it also does not feel and sound to smooth i guess it is not bad for the price but when i order something new i do not like to receive something heavily used,101,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,it does the trick but is very poorly made i doubt it will last long the fine adjustment wheel is fake and just for looks,25,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,best for setting to acceptable maximum or minimum diameter measurement and checking batches of parts i use a digital caliper for other measurements older eyes struggle with reading vernier quickly,30,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,have not used for actual measurement yet but out of the box this instrument is of very poor quality unit was scratched badly on back and slide does not move smoothly the slide also had a large grinding scar on the face where the measurements read this may be fine for limited use but do not make the mistake that this is a quality unit although the price should have made that point obvious,73,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,not bad instructions would have been nice but i will live,11,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i wish i could return it butis non-returnable,10,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i use it for 3d printing and stuff good product,10,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,not worth the 10 you spend dirty scratched and measurements are practically invisible to the eye do not buy,19,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,it is not good but not bad with this price,10,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,all divisions are the same length not easy to read,10,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,well made product i am sure i will get much use out of it,14,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,this tool was not zeroed properly and the slide was not smooth may be a hit or miss with quality but the one that came to my door was poor quality useless if not zeroed correctly because the tool is supposed to measure to very small tolerances,47,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,good for the price i needed a simple metal caliper,10,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,wanted to return it to buy a better digital model and it is not eligible for return,17,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,do not buy thisit is garbage from the plastic case that broke apart the first time it was opened to the three screws missing where the holes were misaligned so they just left the screws out to the set screw that stripped out after very limited use to the very hard-to-read scale if i could give this a zero rating i would buy a plastic toy and you will get much better value,74,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,hey it is better than a tape good for the tool box not a precision instrument but does the job needs oil and tlc to work,25,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,we ordered these as a christmas present for my father they were very cheap quality our dogs destroyed the christmas wrapping while we were out but the silver lining is that once we saw these calipers we were thankful the dogs misbehaved i would have been embarrassed to gift these to my dad,52,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,this is a very badly made product the machining is awful and measures 005 mm in the completely closed position,19,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,great product fast delivery and service followup thanks,8,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,very cheap chinese manufacturing the screw on the side does not work it just feels well cheap,17,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,it is a very good product considering the price in adverse lighting conditions it is almost impossible to see the magnitudes because the grooves are very superficial,28,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,love it very accurate till 005 mm it says nobelium coated but as far as i know it is only theas nobelium is radioactive and it would not be good for measuring tools,34,30
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,received the product 3 days late due fully to usps incompetence product appears as depicted on line however my big oversight was this caliper measures in 1/128ths of an inch increments totally useless what do you do with a measurement of 2 and 71/128th inches also manufacture details are poor inch increments are not possible to distinguish all lines are identical baffling i can not even give this thing away use this review as a guide shop wisely i did not,81,31
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,very nice quality for my home work shop came in nice protective plastic case,14,32
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,the wheel shown is not a wheel just looks like one,11,33
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,great i would order more things from this vender,9,34
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,perfect for my jewelry business sizing gems beads findings and more,10,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,not recommended for extreme precision work for it is price it is a fairly accurate and a very good product for general use,22,36
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,very poor quality unable to read the scales returned the unit immediately,12,37
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,junk screws falling out terribly graduated i got exactly what i paid for,13,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,cheap chinese poor quality just by having it in your hand you can tell it are not worth it,18,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i use the tool in wood working for accurate measurements and it works great this is not a highly precision tool not for measuring in the thousands of an inch but works very well for my purpose,37,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,I have had one of these before and really did not like it when i lost it or displaced it this has been sufficiently accurate for my purposes and it is a great price the case on the last one seemed a bit flimsy but that is acceptable,44,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,good for the price i only use it top measure slack on my motorcycle chain,15,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,works well for the price got some friction here and there although wonderful if you need calipers here and there for small things not very good for very accurate work,30,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,excellent transaction product as advertised on time hassle free,8,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,this caliper works fine for measuring outer diameters inner diameters are a little off the teeth sit a mm apart when the caliper is fully closed such that if you measured a 5 mm identification tube the device would read 6 mm roughly,41,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,used it like it good enough for what i do at home,12,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,these may be great calipers but i will not be using them they do not measure in thousandths but in fractions of inches,22,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,was of extremely poor quality the teeth for measuring inside dimensions does not zero out and gives measurements that more than 3 mm off also very poor finish edges still have burrs which because resistance when using the device i would definitely appreciate if they could send me a product of better quality assuming that this one is a dud,60,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,do not buy i got one and it seems that everyone here is getting a different items mine had metric markings the measurements oscillate when tested against a trustworthy caliper the markings for measurements are very bad they have an indication for 1/16th inch shorter and 1/8th longer but if that is it making it very hard to read accurately any measurements at a glance without counting marks or grabbing a sharpie and annotating the scale the moving part has a wee bit of wiggle which means any 1/64 in precision measures are going to be way off worse of all the measurement is off i know a man with 2 watches can not tell the time but i was measuring some pipe fittings and tried this caliper directly against another one i have i trust and readings would oscillate over and under what the other one says,152,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,good tool considering the price it is just perfect no problems with mine it works great for me,17,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,my students are grateful to be able to actually use a caliper and a nice one at that,18,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,a present for my son who studies for engineering he told me it was very helpful for his projects,19,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,great tool for the money i use it as a hobby tool and it works however the made in china logo does not make it very dear to me,28,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,the measuring instrument is very well made i wish there were more specific instructions on care and handling of the product,21,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,recived on time it is what it was promised,10,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,total junk but you get what you pay for,9,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i got my vernier too late today i am sad because vernier does not have inch graduation also the threads of fixing screw on top side are broken so you do not buy it,34,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,not very precise adjustment in the moving parts very poor finish would not recommend it,15,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,they only have a metric scale i picked them for a based on the description and picture i read a review before i purchased them that said no metric scale which would have been fine by me,37,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,nice steel construction and consummate finish it is been interesting at having to convert from 128ths but i like the quirk,20,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,good quality considering it is so cheap but is not the same quality as a really nice expensive pair acceptable for what i need it for,26,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i am a student of goldsmiths and was looking for this tool and it really is good i recommend it the seller is excellent,24,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,fairly decent especially for the price they were not too expensive and do the job on simple projects nothing too fancy,21,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i do not have the money for the more expensive calipers and these are built to similar quality as the more expensive ones i have used the materials they used are great for the price and i compared my measurements from this one to my schools more expensive dial calipers and they are just as accurate also it has measurements for millimeters / centimeters as well as inches,65,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,it works perfectly and I have used it many times and still good this good quality for the price i paid,20,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,this replaces one that i lost at work i liked the way the adjustment worked on the one i lost but this one works just fine i am not interested in the digital calipers at all i like things simple this needs no batteries,44,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,the title of this product is incorrect the product looked like it had been previously used when it came out of the package i will be returning the product soon,30,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,this is not a high quality version but if you do not need it to do more than basic measurements than you will probably get the desired results i did not need anything as nice as some of the otherwise more expensive cousins this caliper is perfect for my needs thank you grace marketing hi,55,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i was expecting something a bit more substantial but for the money i guess i should have not expected a great tool,22,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i would not have given any stars but the seller tried to make it better the first one was not steel but aluminum and very poor quality at that the seller promptly sent me another you can keep the original one they said i kept it in the trash the replacement was nice but with no inch 16th 32nds markings how does that happen caveat emptor,65,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,the mark is not on zero when i do not place anything in it when i do not place anything in it the mark is about on 03 mm so if i put something in it and the reader is 15 mm that means it actually is 12 mm 15 03 12,52,71
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,it is difficult to figure out what the actual measurement is no pointer or other marking indicates the measurement reminds me of a toy slide rule the best i could do was to measure in mm and convert them into inches and fractions of inches with a calculator very disappointing,49,72
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,great deal i wanted a vernier caliper because the cheap digital / dial calipers seem to be unreliable it might be a bit too much effort to read the fine markings if you are using this all the time but if you need one around the house / shop for the occasional measurement that requires high accuracy or the benefit of the caliper jaws to get a valid measure this is a great option,70,73
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,received caliper on time that is goodlooks nice the problem is that it is not stainless steel as advertised it is aluminum the acurracy will be good for very short time most people who buy this should know the difference,42,74
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,excellent tool that can not miss in any toolbox and at home inexpensive and quite accurate for a price in line with expectations note for very demanding and professional do not use this tool see comments from people who talk about imperfection in the measurements and it is obvious it is not a tool of more than 100,59,75
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i love that it has a screw thing to keep it in place i have used ones that do not and you have to keep checking them to make sure that it has not moved,33,76
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,i ordered this from micro-tools via amazon at that time it was 3 or 4 cents more than the cheapest vendor but they had better reviews ymmv i was specifically looking for a non-battery caliper while a digital readout is certainly simpler the thought of a dead battery really bugs me especially since this is not something I shall use every day and so keep spare batteries around a dial caliper is simpler but more money than i wanted to spend if you have never used a vernier caliper I am sure there has a tutorial video on youtube box arrived with a little oil stain on the corner no big deal i did need to wipe the oil off the calipers after opening the box they do not have the smoothest sliding action but it perfectly acceptable for my needs general measuring and woodshop use unless you are looking for nist precision i think you will find these perfectly fine and quite a bargain,160,77
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,this is not comfortable to hold or easy to operate with one hand it is too cheap to bother returning so i ground the tips round and will use it as a gauge for lathe turning spend a few more dollars for a nicer caliper this one is kind of junky,49,78
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i recieved thethe quality is not so good but considering the price it is barely acceptable for the job,20,79
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i needed this to take measurements of the casters on some office chairs and i am sure i will find some other uses for it it is made very well and will be handy when needed,36,80
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,this caliper i passed up buying these many times from harbor freight store the ad says sae and metric should not be advertised as any thing standard american equivalent standard scale should come first then metric scale as the ad states should not be unit-ed-stated,47,81
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,i loved the product this is very useful for me i liked the product i recommend to all because the product and quality,23,82
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,comes in a plastic case with foam in a plastic bag oil coated all edges are precision cut there has a locking screw and the slide moves easily some of the small screws on the back needed tightening and this seems like it would not hold up to very heavy daily use however light or occasional use this is your tool and the price is right for that,66,83
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i was in dialogue with the companys president i thought i was purchasing a 12 mm product but on my calipers purchased through you it only measured 10 mm come to find out i was wrong because my calipers completely closed would measure minus 2 mm 2 mm instead of all the zeros in alignment when completely closed and the company president was using digital calipers that cost probably 600 my only disappointment with amazon ever glen,73,84
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,eliminates guess work on which drill bit to use well made very easy to use a person who is new tovernier calipers may want more directions,26,85
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,1 when you close it you can see daylight at one end and not other meaning less than precise at measuring2 it does not open all the way not machined properly 3the handle on the moving part not glued on correctly4looks like as another rev iewer put it cut with a bandsaw worst caliper ever wasted my money and time would not advise to buy,64,86
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,the case was broken by the time it got to me but whatever i did not buy it for the case otherwise it is a great caliper i have not put it up to the test against something i know is accurate so i do not know how accurate this one is but I am sure it is pretty close great cheap caliper,57,87
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,i bouhgt 4 of these for my father and he is satisfied he tested them and they are are all good,20,88
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,the finish on this appears as if it were done on a grinding stone the etching for the numbers and line increments are so faint they are barely readable i wanted a caliper without a digital re-out but this is so poorly crafted i really do not trust it is accuracy,48,89
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,i bought this caliper in a bundle along with the recommended digital caliper and micrometer i thought i could check myself with the digital caliper to see if i was reading it right i got relatively the same measurements with the digital caliper and micrometer but for some reason this vernier caliper was coming up twenty thousandths short on the same measured object anyone else encounter the same problem I had like to know,73,90
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,I am a bit of a nerd and do a lot of work on my bikes so i wanted a more reliable measuring tool for dropout spacings and more i also have a background in chemistry so I am familiar with calipers these despite being cheap are indeed stainless steel and seem like they will last me forever as long as i do not abuse them they look a teensy bit cheap and feel a teensy bit cheap but only because I have seen very expensive sets of calipers these are good and from what i can tell accurate to the nearest millimeter at least I had certainly hope so based on my measuring of things I have measured with other calipers they were able to measure my 125 mm dropouts easily and have helped me in deciding on how to rebuild the drivetrain on my fixed gear I had recommend them based on their perfectly adequate functionality inexpensive price and solid-looking construction again mine are kinda cheap feeling but not to the point of it being a significant flaw they just do not look like you paid 50 for them more like 20,183,91
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4,positive,every now and then i need outside measurements of things i definitely did not need dial or digital readers and not even that much of an accuracy because i always double check with my ruler hopefully this is real stainless and not the chinese version of stainless,47,92
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,this is more a a review of the vendor hobbytoolsupply than the actual product the caliper received had no metric markings it was a different model from the one pictured the description states features both sae and metric markings,39,93
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i ordered thisa few weeks ago and received a digital one instead a regular one like the picture shows,21,94
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i bought this caliper some time ago and just recently had the occasion to use it the accuracy is just plane bad if i measure something with it i have to then measure the jaws of the caliper with another measuring instrument it is passed the return date so i can not return or get a refund it was cheap but who needs to pay for scrap metal i had to give it one star just because they do not have a no good indicator,83,95
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2,negative,the quality is poor enough for my use but not very precise,12,96
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,i was looking for a replacement caliper that read in inches all the marks on the inch scale are the same size they are 1/16 apart even the 1 marks are the same size you have to count each mark making it impossible to read,45,97
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,the price is right but the markings are impossible to read the markings are so faint and similar also it is obviously intended for primarily metric use,27,98
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,this says a 6 inch measuring range but it is metric,11,99
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1,negative,very poor quality tool the cinch bolt does not work the whole unit is poorly constructed,14,100
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5,positive,I have been looking for a caliper without a digital or analog meter i like this basic version and it is a good quality one,23,101
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,this is bigger than most trunk jack stands i bought this for my mazda 6 2008 does the job good price soild metal,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the crappy little jack that came with my prius fell over when lifting the prius on the flat street in front of my house when it fell it bent i went to replace it and discovered it was 179 or something like that this looks have not used it yet twice as strong,52,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,thiswas just as described in the ad and arrived on time it is nice to get a great deal,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the jack i ordered was not able to lift my car and was slightly different from the product advertised the company responded with several different options to meet my needs and included detailed information about the replacement options along with pictures i still do not know of the replacement items will do the job they have not arrived yet but the company gets a gold star for working hard to help me,69,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,i used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer i had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my rv they are sturdy and work well for my purpose if you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire i believe they will suffice the maximum height extension is limited about 18 20 so keep that in mind,71,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,it is a car jack after all and a good one it does it is job well and it is easy to use no complains about this product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a car jack,41,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well it did fit but it would not lift a 1000 lbalthough rated for 4000 lbs the screw was well lubricated with grease but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank it was cheap but still not worth the little money i paid,63,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,cheap fell apart after 2nd use i was lifting my golf cart and it got stuck about half way through the lift i kinda worked with where it was when i was done i went to lower it and noticed it bent with such a littlei bought two of them the bent one went into the recycling bin and other is a garage paper weight,67,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,this is a substitute for my 2500 and horse trailer jack works well too,14,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,very poorly constructed rated for 2 tons but would not lift 1 tire of my 3000 pound car also it arrived damaged the put the jack in a box too small and simply punched holes in the end of the box for the two ends of the jack so of course both ends of the jack were damaged by the time it arrived,62,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i am not putting this in my wifes car that is what i bought it for but after opening it and extending it out i could see that the metal arms were loosely put together and rickety the screw mechanism is good and smooth but i do not trust this thing to hold up 4000 lbs without creaking one way or the other returning for sure I had rather hassle with sending it back and buying another one than worry every time i crawl under the car i recommend avoiding this jack,90,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the threaded rod or screw was galled up right out of the box was unable to even open it up all the way until i put the jack in a benchto hold it in place why i used a crow bar to work it back and forth 50 times to get it to free up at least they should test this piece of crap before they ship it after working on it for two hours i finally have a jack i can use,85,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,jacks situation here in the us is a mess have to use a combination of jacks to change a flat scissors jack is just one that i use,28,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,like someone else said it is a car jack what do you expect it was not built to lift the world,19,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the jack i received was somewhat different and had a different crank than the one pictured it was not possible to lift my car using the crank so i am sending it back,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,my son used it 3 times to change a flat and 2 rear tires on my 97 ford probe and it worked great a little awkward turning but did the job perfectly otherwise the only kind that fit and was sturdy enough,42,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,i like theit work really well i have no complains i paid 19 dollars for this so to me it is a good value,26,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,just received this jack went outside and tested it out worked great lifted my 1998 chevy blazer with no problem the jack was able to lift my truck high enough that i could get a jack stand in and change a tire no problem i will be keeping this on board since i do not have the spare tire jack,59,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,what a piece of junk do not purchase,8,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,looks good hope i do not have to use it,10,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,in my opinion these screws are not very good the philips head strips too easily while inserting into wood tried 2 different size bits,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,good screws they can split the wood more then some others,11,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,way to long foredge guard and fillips screw to shallow,12,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,tested them out by using a magnet on them not like the home large supplies sell you can pick their up with a magnet not these,26,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,package came with opened package missing some screws for the price you pay for these items you should get all you pay for thanks,24,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,cheap screws heads stripped very easily had to drill all holes before putting in screws to prevent head stripping out could not remove without pliers softest stainless screws ever go get screws somewhere else high priced junk,39,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,these would have worked better on myif i was willing to pre-drill the first and only i tried to screw into my docks pressure-treated boards stripped the heads almost immediately i had to use a wrench to reverse them out i went to the local hardware store and bought screws that worked much better i ended up putting around 200 screws into myhaving to pre-drill would have been crazy,73,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,used these screws in the installation of ourbumpers and am very pleased with their performance,17,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,worked great with pilot holes stainless steel is usually softer so some issues associated with it are expected,18,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,if you apply pressure and use 2 philips bit you will not strip the head for hard surface drill a pilot hole great price did the job fine,27,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,as others have observed the heads strip very easily the phillips socket is too shallow and the metal is quite soft so even when exercising great care they are prone to strip driving them into southern yellow pine not particularly demanding fairly soft wood several that did not strip instead twisted off right below the head again the metal used just is not up to the task save yourself much frustration and find another option,74,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,screw heads easily striped with a power drill need a stronger steel or better yet a tork head,18,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,phillips head seemed to strip out too often even changing bits out,12,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,they are ok but the heads do strip fairly easy as other reviews suggest if you are carful they will do fine,21,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,these screws worked great to install bumpers on mythe package includes 80 screws so there are plenty,19,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,screws were of high quality and worked as expected,9,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,these screws were awful the heads continually broke off going thru aluminum for everyone that worked i broke two going into wood they worked fine,25,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,very soft heads which means these strip very easily,9,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,too bad handi man has a good name even in soft pine these very soft screws strip immediately count on losing half your box trying to use pliers to twist them out and start over too long for your regularbumper you need maybe half the size i was working all day trying to drill pilot holes should not have to then stripping almost every other head used multiple bits drills and drivers not my fault go look for stainless steel screws half the size and with good solid reports see anything that says these strip then stay away sorry but our time is worth more than a faulty made product,112,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,junk very soft strip out as soon as they meet resistance in the wood do not use without drilling holes,20,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,phillips head screws just strip out way to easy,9,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,good screw did drill holes as we were putting these into pressure treated lumber but not a single one stripped or twisted off still have half a bag of them to use on other projects and will not hesitate to use them on our boat trailer good product,48,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,used these to screw onpiling caps pre-drilled for them husband wishes they were star-head but with the pre-drilling they worked fine and were a good price,28,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,inexpensive screw worked fine if you pre-drill yourcone and piling,12,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4,positive,these work fine even with pilot holes sometimes they strip phillips head against square or star bit i would choose square or star,21,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,2,negative,i drive a mobility scooter and wanted these to improve the safety of me scooting around on our streets granted the strips are highly reflective but when hit by the sun they fall off and when i picked them up i got sticky goo on my hands which was very difficult to remove,53,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1,negative,the strips would be great but the packaging was bad they folded the taped in half to fit into a package and the tape has a permanent crease in it you can not get this crease out matter what you do so it ruins the product unless you cut it out which means you have smaller strips so not satisfied with this,62,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5,positive,i used these on my helmets they are matte black and they make it pop and at night they stick out,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4,positive,a very good product i will be using this when i drive my motorcycle have not used it yet but will soon,21,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4,positive,great for what i needed if for used it on a loadingfor trucks at night to see where to park trailers against doors,25,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4,positive,you can trim the strips to put them on tricky spots i did this for my grandsons stroller the bad news is that they do tend to turn up slightly around the edges especially if the surface is slightly curved i recommend that you use this reflective tape only on flat surfaces that are not porous flat metal yes cloth no,61,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4,positive,i bought it to tape onto my motocycle luggage very reflective but adhesive is next to useless started to peel the next day i superglued them down it has been two months so far so good,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1,negative,it is very sticky but it pulls away fro plastics and metal after a few days after this i pulled the rest off plus i received some that was from a old lot you can tell it was made a long time ago i think there trying to liquidate there supply,50,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5,positive,i bought this to keep my trash can from becoming an unwilling accessory in a hit in run on the night before trash day it works,26,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,2,negative,sticking on surface will not work real good on corner,11,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1,negative,i used this on my dogs harness but within a day it came off and made a glue mess on the fabric,22,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1,negative,do not expect this to adhere to fabric for even ten minutes i bought it for my backpack and ended up having to sew it on it was a mess with all the glue which is sticky and messy but not adherent also it comes folded in thirds which creases it horribly and causes the glue in the bend to stick to itself and come off the tape if you are doing a backpack or jacket I had suggest non-adhesive tape and a needle and thread,83,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4,positive,very reflective but not terribly sticky it is still on my shoes but i have to push it down periodically,19,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5,positive,order was on time and all was great,8,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1,negative,did not stick to my coat folded plastic tried to hold it shape,13,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5,positive,they really are super reflective great for bicycle night time riding safety,12,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5,positive,the product is just that reflective strips and i chose thisthe adhesive is very sticky and i cut a piece of it and placed a little square on the back of my shoes my shoes is made where it can hold this type of product i walk a lot and sometimes when the sun goes down you want people to see you walking with little light two strips came just like what the package stated,77,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2,negative,shrunk considerably with just one washing before wearing way too small now very disappointed,14,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2,negative,just received these so i can not comment on quality yet but as i ordered two pairs at 30x30 and both are labeled as such on pair is a good six inches longer than the other so as far as quality control they are a big fail,45,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2,negative,beware thissays natural white what i got is labeled natural and it is definately not white i need to see if i can return this for something that is actually white these are beige and i am very disappointed,46,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4,positive,just received the pants a couple days ago and took him to work they feel really good they are comfortable when i receive them there was a couple of stains but i do not care because they are going to get dirty the stains were caused by the metal in it the zipper and button there just a green tarnish but like i said they are going to get dirty so i do not really care,71,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5,positive,fit great comfortable better than i expected double knees fit knee pads even although that is not labeled here will buy again,21,4

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1,negative,horriblewas not blue or white bad fabric felt like it would tear the moment i moved stiff and fit horrible i would have returned but should have known better than to order something cheep and expect something more,40,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5,positive,these are great work pants at the right price i would buy them again for my spouse,17,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2,negative,we ordered 2 pair of the rugged blue pants without the reinforced knees and they worked great so we decided to order 6 pair this time this time we ordered with the reinforced knees and although my husband loves the deep tool pockets and the ability to put knee pads in for comfort every pair ripped in the seam below the zipper i was able to sew them again but next time i will go back to the other style,80,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5,positive,nice pants but i seriously had to learn to defend myself against all of the women who now attack me when i wear them I have never had that problem before even in speedos pros they are tight and white women love them cons it is tough to get anything done when having to beat women off of you all day,59,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1,negative,awful product design the front pockets are very narrow barely accommodating my cell phone the inseam is not big enough and this caused them to rip after only wearing them 3 times also there are very deep pockets in front of the knees which serve no obvious purpose,48,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5,positive,they wear well and are made very well only thing is the front pockets are on the small side not a lot of room for keys and more,27,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1,negative,thin material double knee opens to top and the crotch is a mile long very high waist line,18,13

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4,positive,they look fine and fit well true to size the fabric is very light which is nice for hot weather but probably not super long lasting great bang for the buck,31,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i can confirm that the advertisement is accurate the focal distance is a few centimeters out to infinite the image quality is good 640x480 using an adapter i was able to plug this into my samsung galaxy s4 active with a webcam app i downloaded the camera head is under 6 mm i measured it with a dial caliper the wire is flexible and will not hold shape very happy with my purchase update i bought this for work at my shop and recently used it to inspect a combustion chamber in an engine i was impressed with image quality the convenience of using my smart phone with it was great i was able to capture the image of the piston damage and quickly email it I am going to buy another,129,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,actually does have infinite focal length i tried other borescopes that you could not really see anything farther than 6 away i plugged this in to my android with a micro usb adapter and had an instantly portable borescope setup awesome,40,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,not 55 mm the diameter of the scope is 85 mm 35 inches which means it will not fit into the bore of most rifles worthless for bore inspection,28,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,pretty decent picture for a reasonable priced endoscope you need to look at several aps to find the one that works the best with these and one that works great with this one does not work well with the short one i have,42,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,did not fit in 22 cal as advertised,8,4

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,works fine for the price software that came with it is a bit sketchy set off my antivirus software however connected fine with windows 10 and did not need the software that came with it,35,10

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,pretty much useless i bought this to locate something that fell down into a oil pan on a car understood this is not a big dollar hd camera but it was totally useless it does have adjustable led lighting which helps but the images are so bad you still will not know what your looking at i purchased the phone adapter and that was even worse do not bother there was a glimmer of hope using a laptop but no i do not mean to leave a bad review but it is not the tool for automotive use i suppose it might help looking behind drywall but most likely not it was shipped fast and arrived in great condition but all it will see is the trash can after trying to use it,130,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,came in on time and use this alot for my installs will be ordering again thanks,16,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,these guys all lie about the resolution tiny picture,9,15

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i did not think this would do the job for 15 you should not be able to get an endoscope a few years ago this would have been seriously expensive we use this to run down rifle barrels it does a very impressive job,42,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,worthless i tried looking into a cylinder on my diesel could not see a thing looked into a sewage pipe and again could not see anything,24,18

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,if you want a picture perfect nikon quality photo look elsewhere this product seems to be well made and is handy to have around if you get into a jam you can not go wrong for the price,37,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,worst instructions ever only a few sentences by somebody who is not too familiar with english software is windows only,19,23

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,worked on windows 10 image quality is just ok i use it to verify that a piece of plastic filler spout had gone down a catepillar oil filler spout if it had not been bright yellow i probably would have missed it,41,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,i was shipped a look alike product software was in chinese absolutely useless,13,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,you get what you pay for and in this case that is very very little trying to get anything in focus is virtually impossible and as a bore scope it is worthless,32,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,the pix are clear only if you have additional lighting in dark places the light provided by the built in leds is woefully inadequate the software to run the camera is dangerous you can not select where it installs and it self installed on my recovery drive which would have ruined it but finally was removed with much effort and sweat as it turns out i did not need their software anyway my computers built in camera software ran it just fine it recognized the usb camera and allowed me to select it and do much more with the images,98,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,definately worth the purchase windows application provided with the camera is easy to use and comprehendsive in terms of functionality applications for this 5 meter long canmrra with sufficently bright leds to illuminate the picture,35,30

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,it looks like it had been previously used by someone else box was obviously opened as well as the plastic bag instructions were old and dirty,26,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,could use a higher resolution camera would work better if focusing were closer for the money i feel ti to be a great buy,24,36

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,bad manufacturing quality usb connector wobbling in it is casing stopped working after using it a couple of times,18,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,picture is not crystal clear but works very well anyways used for vehicle mechanical work to see into small areas you can not normally see and brings the image onto our laptop,31,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,excellent product my husband is a mechanic he says that this really helps him he does not have to completely disassemble something to see what is going on inside a great time saver works great with a laptop or a smart phone with adapter the one down side is that it is incompatible with the kindle for the money you can not go wrong,62,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,camera quality too low to be useful does not work with a mac,12,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,the usb endoscope arrived promptly and was easy to use the camera requires no special or proprietary software and gives a clear image inwith a usb adapter for a tablet it can be used easily it is tricky to control the camera position the farther the came a is pushed away unless being used down a pipe or other object to stabilize the shaft image is clear and in,73,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i bought this for checking the barrels of rifles that i work on great picture and it hooked up to my lap top and was working in a couple of minutes,31,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,can not find an app to use with phones several apps tried none successful please advise,15,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,went out and got an adapter to use with phone / tablet at work thing will not work at all the usb casing broke and had to be glued back together too poor quality pictures just all around junk,37,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,you get what you pay for not high quality video not a bad product,14,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,camera works well instructions were written as if by a martian cd did not work at all had to download driver from internet,23,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,camera does not work without software but software disk is so loaded with viruses and malware that I am not about to try running any programs on it norton blocked 4 viruses before i even tried to install the drivers do not buy this product,43,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,needs ability to select focus point instead of fixed focal point at 3 - 6 inches,14,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,needs more lighting but the small head makes it great to get into the small areas i attach another small flashlight to the head nice clear video,27,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works fine my only complaint that it needs a cd to be installed could not use it with my smart phone or a tablet tried several apps but none of them worked,31,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,no way to get a driver no site no brand name forget it,13,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,took a long time to find an app that works with it but i did finally get it to work occasionally on my phone the picture is very coarse and unfocused i do find it somewhat useful in very small spaces but if you could fit a larger camera i would look for a 7 mm or 8 mm one instead this will fit the barrel of a 22 rifle,68,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,not impressed at all i would have to rate the quality of the image worse than the camera from the first camera phone,23,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,this works well as a bore scope to check the condition of rifle and shotgun barrels,16,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,not the resolution it claims to be false advertising,9,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,i am happy to say that this endoscope / borescope works with my note ll it does get hot when in operation so my remedy is to use it only for short periods at a time for the price i am content with the low resolution and actually it is not that bad,51,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,needed this forwork inspection but the focal length of the camera is 5 to 6 feet away like a cell phone or usb computer camera so anything within 12 - 24 inches of the camera are out of focus it is really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long usb cord attached to it adjustable leds work fine except you can not completely turn them off even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like ai assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded but that totally negates it is use as a scope in a reflective environment maybe i just got one that did not have it is focal point adjusted correctly or something but as it is it will not work as advertised one plus is that it would work on my cell phone with a 3rd party app and a micro usb converter but i had to send this one back in favor for another from ebay,187,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,it is great for what it is i used this in combination with an usb to usb otg adapter and webcam software to turn my smart phone into an inspection camera does everything i want it to do and best of all cost less than 25,45,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,plugged it into my mac laptop worked great via photo booth for about 20 seconds then the usb connector hardware literally fell to pieces another piece of chinese junk my friends buyer beware,31,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works great the image is zoom in a little to close for my needs,14,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,works pretty well and is a lot of fun the end gets warm to the touch as my teenage son realized trying to stick it up his nose priceless,28,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i work as a plumber and this is a wonderful tool to use to actully see the clog on my tablet it is awesone works well nice andclearthe cable is long enough to see the problem and also as an auto mechanic it is great to as with these new cars today it is hard to see anything by the naked eye this tool well let you see everything you normally can by eye excellent tool i recommend it to everyone to see things you thought possible great beef in get yours yours today very happy customer john h noone,98,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,do not work no detection by the pc soft installed j tried with other soft it is a hardware problem,19,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,excellent for the price i used this endoscope to help fish wires out of the wall for a surround sound speaker setup i did a video write up on it here [ ] fast forward to 830 for the actual video footage if your interested cons i did notice reduction in frames per second and clarity in low light conditions even with built-in light the light only works well in confined spaces where there is very nearby objects for the light to bounce off of inserting the endoscope inside an acoustic guitar sound port for example yields poor visibility,97,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,did not work with samsung galaxy s3 tried camerafi and mscopes apps with no luck,15,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,it is too flimsy to be able to direct the camera through pipes beyond 3 feet can not easily control it is direction of travel and orientation light gets hot quickly,28,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,wow so useless light did not work very well could not see down into a cylinder head on the car which was why we bought it,26,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,only got about 15 minutes use out of it it got wet but was not underwater at all in the middle of looking behind firewall in vehicle for rain water it just went away ms windows no longer recognized it tried it on different pcs running windows10 and vista while it was working and when i tested it things were great image was clear and adjusting the led lites worked fantastic i am not sure if moisture got in the camera head or the usb plug and lite control went bad the plug end was extremely sloppy and loose if i get another one i will seal around cable / camera connection and beef up the usb plug no problem getting refund so that was nice too,124,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,timely shipping excellent product and most importantly very easy to set up and use,14,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,this product worked easily i have windows 8 and simply installed the software on my laptop camera worked well the only reason i did not give it five stars is because the image it provides is a little soft resolution wise but other reviews mention that plus the light is not strong enough to site down a five foot cavity to the end would i buy it again yes,68,71
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,plug and play with photo booth on a mac great resolution,11,72
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,exactly as described not the highest quality picture nor the brightest leds on the end but for the price it works fine i was able to peer into the cylinders through the injector hole of my 30l mercedes diesel to see the valve stick in the piston now if only this thing could pull the engine for me,59,73
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,works great if you do not have a integrated camera on your computer if you do it gets all screwed up and only brings up the computer camera,27,74
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,small form factor and real easy to use however the camera has very poor resolution i would recommend spending a little bit more money on a camera with higher resolution rating,31,75
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,broke less than a year picture is not very clear I am not sure how it is 720p the leds are not bright enough to illuminate a dark space because the camera has a long focus length,35,76
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,I am using this camera on my macbook os x 1011 using photo booth as the viewer the picture quality is not great as expected with a cheap device but it works perfectly you can use it to tease your cat or look in your own eye or many other things,50,77
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,the camera and lights is not centered inside the case,10,78
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,exactly what i expected works well and good clear photos and videos until camerafi quit working on my android i hope they will fix camerafi soon,25,79
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,could not get the camera to deliver an image to the computer could not take a picture or video waste of money,20,80
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,gave it 4 stars for great value for the price quality seems pretty good resolution decent if you understand the limitations of what you are doing software is ok at best can easily view on laptop screen picture capture still eludes me beats the heck out of tearing a wall open to see in was able to easily observe outboard cylinder condition although spark plug hole which is why is chose this one over one with a larger camera but again it is not a miracle and you need to be slow and patient i have not yet tried to attach to smartphone,102,81
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,kind of hard to use make out images as a mechanic get a better one,15,82
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,after reading reviews i was not sure if this would work or not but i gave it a try after plugging it into my usb port the leds came to life i did not want to risk installing their software so i looked for an existing program to display the video i found that i could use the play capture device setting in vlc to stream the video on my windows computer with no issues overall I am very happy with the camera i used it to track a cable through a wall the small size helped the camera is tiny as i could easily fit it through the existing access point the led brightness control worked as expected and allowed me to get a good image i was very happy with the focus range it was definitely a lot more than a few inches which seems to be an issue on some of the other similar cameras i used a coat hanger and later a fish tape to direct the camera where i wanted it to go this was not the easiest task but it was rather fun like playing a video game,190,83
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,i had no luck with this product my laptop running windows 10 would not recognize the compact cd i tried everything i could think of to get it to checked the auto-run it was on tried to access it through the file explorer nothing worked i really wanted one to go with the laptop i returned it,57,84
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,did not know i needed until i bought it windows 8 and above works right out of the box no software necessary software and drivers for windows 7 and earlier included whether you want to see what has in that smellyor that mole on you back this adjustable lighted endoscopic camera fits the bill,54,85
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,piece of junk i could not get it to work with my dell laptop windows 2009 macbook pro or 2015 macbook air,21,86
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,the image went solarized after a few minutes of use i tried it on several different phones and tablets so it was definitely an issue with the endoscope,28,87
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,after very little use several times the lens fell off and then the housing came off and then the connections broke very useless it is a nicethe lights need a little bit of work brighter but it is a fantastic size,43,88
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,it worked once than died i gave up and threw it away,12,89
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works great could be a little bit brighter light otherwise no troubles good video pics,15,90
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,for what it costs and for checking out things like the condition of a gun barrel or trumpet leadpipe it is what the doctor ordered it will even enter a 22 barrel most of the time some 22s have a tighter muzzle for some reason the image quality is somewhat uncertain much of the time but there are some adjustments in the program that comes with it that helps that problem,70,91
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,i purchased this to allow me to inspect the inside of my chimney it worked ok but not with the clarity i was hoping for i think the problem was a lack of light because before and after the camera worked fine also the diameter of the pipe may have also been a factor i will find other uses for this around the house so i think it is worth the money,71,92
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works as advertised low resolution can not see very far from end of camera no control over where it is pointed but expected that,22,93
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works well although i hardly use it just a one time purchase to help see the inside of a wall,19,94
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,this is a great way to see where you can not go investigate small openings in parts and more a friend of mine used it to investigate a boat cooling heat exchanger and it works zip tie it to the boat hook and inspect the prop or the hull,47,95
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,the 55 mm diameter gets this into lots of places and the longer length goes even more illuminated so it works excellent for any inspected,24,96
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,the video / picture quality is very poor it is really grainy there was malware embedded in the software do not but this product,20,97
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i love that i can buy a fiber optic camera like this for 20 it came as described and works exactly as i expect when a product like this can be delivered right to my house for this price I am amazed yeah we do not have hover boards or flying cars yet but we definitely are living in the future,59,98
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,do not waste your money no support,9,99
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,installation disc was blank have been unable to use,9,100
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,two drawbacks no focus adjustment and driver is windows only not compatible with mac,14,101
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,the led lights up the computer see it but no picture,11,102
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,the included software amcap would not install on win 7 using the setupexe on the disk it would just crash the installation software but you can just copy all the files to a new directory on your hard drive and run it from there apparently it does not make changes to the registry file just make a shortcut to amcap executable file and put the shortcut on your desk top it works sort of it will not go to resolution of better than 640x480 i do not know if that is the fault of the camera or the software i might try some webcam free ware see if it will get better resolution i also intend to run it on a tablet i am waiting for amazon to deliver a usb to microusb converter i hope the resolution will be better than 640x480 on the tablet that is a little too primitive and not what was promised,155,103
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,stop do not purchase this product it is very poorly documented and one can not reach the manufacturer to discuss means for getting it to function,25,104
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,really a nice product for the price does get warm / hot after a bit on the end due to the light,20,105
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,view can be blurry have to get it in just the right place that is understandable for the small diameter size which we expected served purpose used it to view inside car valve cylinders and to check metal roof for leaks,41,106
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,great bore scope fit down 22 rifles and capture video and photos shorter version would be better for me butthis works well,22,107
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,not the greatest picture quality but it helped me run a new water line for my fridge so I am happy with it,22,108
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,i expected more cuality maybe is good for plumbers o people who search in a small holes something and have a portable computer with cd s reader on it to me is unpractical but i have it now and maybe i will use some day for something that i do not kow yet,51,109
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,works fine where there is light in a tight dark space of my boat the view was pretty useless might be good for a rifle bore or something close up,30,110
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,excited when it came installed software worked great until i bent the flex wire and shorted out the camera light comes on but camera now does not work overseas no recourse no warranty,32,111
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,works perfect i could not complain at all,8,112
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,worked pretty well for looking in the cylinders of my old john deere needed the mirrors to do 90deg that it does not come with,25,113
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,it met my expectations for the price it is worth it the resolution is somewhat limited,15,114
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,worked great bought 5 more for friends that i showed,10,115
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,piece of garbage it broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box definitely want money back,20,116
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,i does not do any good what seller says video is very poor even in enough light conditions cd driver is damaged so you need to figure it out how to use it without it and overheating is another problem you need to handle,43,117
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,worked great image quality is not anything to brag about awesome price for what it is,15,118
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,edit 8/30/15 i tried just about everything to get this to work with a tab 2 including different apps and rooting the tablet and changing the os i finally gave up and bought a galaxy tab s and it does work with that so i can now give it 4 stars works with laptop but disappointed it did not work with a samsung galaxy tab 2 tried connecting with an otg cable and camerfi app but can not get it to work,81,119
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,good value only getting 640x480 resolution from motion software have outside watching a robin nest and it is working well you may want to mark the top with a piece of tape or dot of paint i found this to be helpful for how i use it,47,120
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,performed bettert than i expected for this price worked well with both mac and pc field of view was great and the integrated leds were super worked as well at 3000 bore scopes i have used in the past,39,121
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,two of the leds were dead and when it went down into the cylinders i could not see anything i have a 3 minute video of nothing but darkness when it was supposed to be checking piston carbon build up,40,122
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,extremely poor viewing quality no focus to identification much of anything not a good purchase i m not happy at all can not recommend it to anyone sure would be happy with a refund,33,123
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,get what you pay for i tried to use it to inspect a clogged pipe all mediocre reviews are correct the picture quality is poor not even close to what would be expected from an hd camera focal distance is very short and led lights are barely sufficient to illuminate subject within focal length the view angle is also narrow so narrow that it will not cover inside of 1 1/2 pipe with in the focal distance of the lens the usb connector is so flimsy it rattles and i used electrical tape to hold is together so that it would not fall apart when plugging it in or worst unplugging i was able to use it for my need but barely and with great disappointment i can see it performing better in other situations but fo pipe inspection it was just barely adequate if you do not expect much in first place would not recommend it,156,124
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,worked with an app that came with the pc not your high def camera but the picture is ok for viewing into inaccessible areas overall it works well for me,30,125
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,the lens was scratched out of the box the leds glare on the lens slightly washing out the picture on all brightness levels even on the highest brightness setting the leds do not put out enough light to illuminate an object from more than an inch or so away if it is bright enough to see it is too close to get good focus and detail on top of all that it is not 720p it is 640x480,74,126
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works with my macbook using photo booth but the image is mirrored for some reason easy enough to mirror it back when editing but a little disorienting during use my mbs fairly old so i do not know if newer models have the same issue dimmable leds are a nice touch,50,127
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,hd l-o-l not funny it is not hd however focus is the main issue with this unless there has distance from the object so it is in focus if there has something in front it will be blurry like fk you have no ideak what the fuck you are looking at,47,128
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,this would be 3 stars but the price is just so great i was in need of a scope to check a cylinder on an engine most of these run upwards of 200 however i thought for the price i would give it a try the video clarity is not the best i am sure there are similar products that have a higher quality however at this price point it really is hard to beat if you are looking to read fine print inside of a dark hole this may not be the best but to get an eye on the inside and to do it quickly and at a low price point it can not be beat since using it on the engine i have used it around the house several times by hooking it up to my laptop i am able to get a very good look in small openings gun barrels drain pipes even inside the wall running wires,160,129
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,be very careful with it easy to break the usb end,11,130
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,640x480 resolution but for the price it is amazing built in illumination 15 feet long can be hooked up to a samsung galaxy s4 for use on the go sam fisher would be envious,33,131
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,good for the purpose i use to see down gun barrels for cleaning inspections is not as good lens quality as others but good enough,24,132
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works well just the usb plug is loose,8,133
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,better then expects this camera has great resolution especially close,10,134
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,poor resolution and no focus not usable as otoscope,9,135
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,the quality of the image from the camera and craftsmanship of the product is not 5-star but for the price i considered rating it a five instead of a four i used this to check for an obstruction in one of my pvc vent pipes found the birds nest and got it taken care of money well spent i connected the camera to my fish tape and it was rugged enough to be fed into the pipe i also used it to check one of my sinks the led lights at the end are not super bright but bright enough to illuminate a 1 to 4 or so pipe there is a little luminance adjustment on the usb end of the light to control the brightness i can confirm that this works with windows 7 and fedora 21 64-bit,139,136
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,one led was not working so i returned thethanks again to amazon for the simple return also the image was not as clear as my first phone camera ten years ago i was very disappointed in the resolution of the image and do not recommend this product,48,137
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,work for two days then the lights stop working not happy,11,138
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i downloaded a driver that allowed me to use my andriod phone as a screen helped find ain my hot tube also used this to insoect and repair a tub drian in my home,36,139
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,software is not compatible with windows xp and 7 no instructions on finding drivers or how to install software,19,140
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,not quite what i was hoping for i was not expecting great image quality from a 20 borscope but the real issue with thisis the focus distance the minimum focal distance for this unit is about 3 cm anything closer that that is blurry this works ok for some applications but in tight spots it is no good this also is a problem with the lights on this camera they are not bright enough to light up dark areas more than about 5 or 6 cm away but when you get close enough for the lights to work you are too close for the camera to focus the software that comes with the camera works fine but i was not able to get it to work with some other applications that i have used in the past,138,141
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,to me it is amazing the picture quality is grate the lights work do not know how waterproof it is yet the cable is more than i need i got it for work unable to use it yet can not get the software toon my amazon fire,46,142
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i am a professional technician and this borescope worked very well for me i use it with my phone,20,143
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,it works hope it was a little more stiff,9,144
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,junk did not even work1 1/2 led out usb end started to come apart would not advise to buy,17,145
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,great endoscope for the price it has a usb interface you can use the camera to view record or capture images the light intensity is adjustable on the usb connector,30,146
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,did not work for me because my computer not working and can not use it on anything less it has usb i gabe it away,25,147
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,i purchased the usb endoscope because my wedding ring fell behind the backsplash on my kitchen counter i tried looking with a mirror a camera and flashlight could not see anything the small endoscope camera with leds was perfect once i figured out which program to use on the computer i put it behind the counter and it did not take 30 seconds to see my ring the image is reversed so it took some concentration to snag my ring with a hooked piece of wire but once i did it came out fairly easy well worth 20 as opposed to a hasty kitchen remodeling project if you do engine work or musical instrument repair this would be good for that too i looked inside a guitar i recently bought the camera has a good picture and the adjustable leds are bright,140,148
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,as stated in previous you get what pay for a 20 dollar camera great for minor look in the hole jobs i love it for what i need it for which is to check the bore on my rifles now if your looking for small detail in firearms this not for you however if you just want to check for debris and pitting or light rust in barrel this is good enough to check all bores down to 22lr and 556 yes it just fits with a little wiggling but be careful also play with settings in the software for a better picture,103,149
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,main purpose is to look down shower / sink drains i hooked it up to my android smartphone via micro usb to usb adapter image quality is like most others say good to acceptable not great but for the inexpensive price that is exactly what i was expecting the led is also poor to acceptable in illuminating the shower drain my next use for this is to drill a hole in the wall to check if the shower is really leaking or if it is just my imagination although due to it is lack of holding shape I am going to have to plan this out first,101,150
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i like it it does what i need and more tks ozzy,13,151
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,brought a micro usb adapter and use it with my phone very handy tool to have around good picture quality too,21,152
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,video quality is very very low res looks like an oldprobably not even that good i have ear tubes i had one blow out while i do not expect to self diagnose myself i just wanted to be able to see if they are in place the last time i went in to thehe showed me my eardrum and it was plain to see there was a big prob so i got this camera with this camera you just can not see much detail when looking inside something it is just very low quality video in general at the same time what can you expect for a 20 endoscope i rolled theand it is not so hot my bad i will not return it it is 20 worth of endoscope I had suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube videos showing the video quality this one is just not worth even the 20 because you just can not see anything clearly so it is kind of useless yes i cleaned the lens i have many cameras gopros and many other electronics all my life I am the guy everyone calls to help or fix their stuff trust me save your money,204,153
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,worked perfect for my needs i was able to get it into an attic that has no access to allow viewing i will be using this on our boat,29,154
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,simple software and great equipment although lacking in strength i just used sturdy hanger wire to snake it through not back at all,23,155
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,after testing this unit i am very pleased with this device works as designed great picture quality i use it for inspections,23,156
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,camera is low megapixels led is not as bright as i hoped with 6 leds,15,157
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,i buy several different models of inspection cameras and resell them at snowmobile shows and swaps they sell themselves i sell them to repair shops and to people who work on their own motors they can look inside the engine for damage without disassembling it first i have used one to locate a problem inside the third door on my sons 2003 chevy s-10 it would not open i located the problem and fixed it what a wonderful tool all you need is a laptop computer,85,158
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,for the money this is a phenomenal product it took me a little while too make it work with my s4 smart phone but once i found the app it was easy and versatile usb camera is what the app is called great buy would recommend highly,47,159
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,2 of the 6 leds are very dim but it still works well the real test will be how long it last scott,23,160
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,works pretty good software that came with did not work got other software and everything works good the picture is a little blurry sometimes but these usually are,28,161
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,it is nice small and compact has a preset focal length if you want to view something up close sol software supplied is generic common found on other scopes,28,162
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,very impressed with this camera bought it to inspect some ductwork under my house the camera worked great and focused to infinity as promised just used an adapter to plug it into my android tablet and with a webcam app it worked perfect never could get the pc to read the little cd but did not need it this thing must have 20 feet of cable con the adjustable lights worked as advertised but are so small they are not much good trying to see more than about 4 - 6 inches since i needed to see further in the dark i taped a bright key chain type light onto the camera that worked pretty well but then it was hard to orient the camera so i knew which way was up ended up taping the whole thing on the end of a flat stick i could push along knowing how it was oriented i think it is a great buy,158,163
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,it worked for a while under windows 8 no need to use the cd that came with it as it self installs and the win 8 camera app does the basics for you the picture was pretty grainy and washed out but probably acceptable for most applications after dipping it in my pool water to inspect a pipe it died within 60 seconds assuming that it is a typical chinese quality control issue I am going to return and order another one hopefully i will get lucky and the next one will actually be waterproof as the description claims,98,164
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,in a bright lite room it gives a good picture but in a wall cavity the 6 leds are useless and you can see nothing a total waste of money,30,165
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,for about 20 this was very worth it mine came without a software disc but i did not plan on using that anyways still the description says it comes with one so that brings the product down to 4 stars usbwebcamera on the google play store worked just fine for my purpose along with this i purchased a 4 usb otg adapter so i managed to connect this to a galaxy s5 essentially i now have a 720p camera with a 0217 55 mm diameter at the end of a 16 cable connected to a pocket size hd display for 25 my wife uses it to check for ear infections / inflammation so the small diameter really helps we also have one that has a 0276 7 mm camera that will become my work one now because it is just a little too big to shove in an ear the leds are pretty bright and do not make the end too hot the adjust-ability is also better than our other scope even although it has a noticeable jump from medium to high intensity the focus does seem to be infinite but it seems at any distance things are a little fuzzy still for what it is I am happy,202,166
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,only issue with this is that it is not android friendly,11,167
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,the camera is very small 5 mm and has a narrow field of view this is adequate for it is function looking into small spaces that are difficult to get to i am planning on using it to view my hvacwork using a fish tape to get the camera into thework the included cable is too flexible to force the camera anywhere a good thing as it increases where it can go the image is inand detail is good you will need video software to use it my laptop could not read the included cd and i could not find a manufacturer site to download it i was able to use movie maker win7 to view the camera i have the 15 m version and purchased a 15 m usb extension to attach to the cable should i need it i do have a concern for the lens on the camera it is exposed,159,168
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,this seems to be a bargain for the price i expect you could find a scope with better overall performance but the price would reflect it so far so good still trying to figure out how to save images,39,169
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,it would get 4 stars but the disk did not work with windows 8 i did use it on my galaxy s5 active with a adapter and a free app that was pretty awesome,34,170
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,i needed to use the included software computer did not automatically turn on pre-loaded webcam software installed the camera no problem magnet wire thing included are helpful for pushing it along i would like a bit more stiffness in the cable to be able to push into ducts farther away without curling up on itself,56,171
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,connected to my laptop running windows 81 and used the camera app that came loaded on the computer picture quality is as good as to be expected from such a small camera it got the job done,37,172
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,you can never be 100 sure where viruses come from but i am almost positive this camera installed a trojan horse when i used it,25,173
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,this thing is total crap no where near 720p and the lights make everything you view either washed out or gray with no contrast the dial to adjust the led is not linear there is a large amount of adjustment that occurs on the first 1/5th of the dial the rest of the dial is basically useless i am returning this because it is useless for my purpose buyer beware,70,174
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,focus and clarity is not what i expected maybe at this price you should not expect more but i would not recommend,21,175
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,junk in my opinion the image was terrible,8,176
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,the borescope works as intended and i do like it the only drawback to my order was that a set of 3 borescope mirrors showed up as being compatible with this scope but they were not would not fit and not for this particular scope the mirrors that showed up are yunanwa supereyes borescope side view mirror set 30 45 60 degrees for borescope endoscope n005 n013j n015 series so if you order this scope and see these mirrors listed as being a good add-on to your order do not get them as they do not fit this unit,99,177
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1,negative,you have to spend money to get a good camera do not waste your money you are not going to be seeing jack,21,178
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,works great until you smash it between a piston and cylinder head,12,179
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,this was a gift my son liked it no details,11,180
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,it works on my mac with no problem,8,181
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,i curl my eyelashes on a regular basis and wanted something to help the corners where my eyelash curler does not reach thisdoes not curl at all i gave it time and tried many times,35,0
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,i enjoy using the mini heated eyelash curler after I have applied my mascara it helps to hold the curl too,20,1
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,i hardly ever wear mascara because i have short heavy sparse and very straight lashes mascara looks good for ten seconds and then the lashes just droop gave this little mini heated curler a try and by gosh it actually looks like i have eyelashes now a bit of an upward turn which lasts for at least part of the evening I am not talking long lush curly lashes here but certainly better than before i think if you have good lashes to start you would look great with this curler i curl the lashes before applying mascara put a light layer of mascara on and curl once again worth the money for me,112,2
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,i have tried everything for curling my eyelashes and nothing seemed to work i had never even heard of a heated eyelash curler but once i found out there was such a thing i ordered one and i love it it curls my eyelashes in no time and you do not have to worry about the heat burning your eye you can not even feel it i love it and wish i had heard about this a long time ago,78,3
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,I am sorry but it did not work at all for me in all fairness maybe it is because i have very straight eyelashes I am not sure i read all the reviews and some were good and some were bad so i went ahead and bought this but wish i had not now for me it was a waste of money,58,4
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,this is a really nice little curler the heat is soft and warm no clamping necessary just a few up-strokes this curl is a soft one so if you are looking for a tight curl you may want to use regular curler and it eats batteries so be prepared,50,5
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,it does not work as stated in the description,8,6
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,this did nothing for me i have pretty long eyelashes so i do not know maybe this is only supposed to be used with short lashes,25,7
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,I am not a big fan of this heated eyelash curler the very very small amount of curling it does does not last and I have tried both with mascara and without multiple times cutebut definitely a waste of money using my hair dryer to heat up my regular eyelash curler works much better,53,8
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,loved this eyelash curler until the case cracked no longer connecting the source of heat from the battery to the device such a bummer,24,9
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,it is the perfect temp it does not burn but seems to sooth i am still perfecting my use of it,20,10
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,did not work at all battery got stuck in side,9,11
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,i like it my boyfriend told me that he does not want me to wear fake lashes anymore so i purchased this and every time that i use this he asks me if I am wearing fake lashes i just wink at him and say no it is my real lashes,48,12
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,save your money this did not curl my eyelashes very well i use curl my eyelashes and put on waterproof mascara before-hand and i can barely tell a difference product feels very cheaply made as well you would think with a price like this that you would get a well-made product that works well,53,13
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,it is my first time using a heated eyelash curler and i like it more than the manual clamp it works better once your mascara is on I have only used it a few times so I am just getting used to it nice and compact too I have only tried it on my top lashes i cleaned it with a tissue afterwards so i hope it does not get too gloppy,67,14
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,this is fantastic for those of us who have brittle or hard to curl lashes it is link a mini curling brush for your lashes it works better than any traditional curler I have ever used,34,15
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,i used to have great natural lashes with just the right natural curve 2 years ago after a rapid and drastic weight loss my lashes went completely straight absolutely no curl at all i stopped using mascara altogether when previously that was the number one product i used the one thing i wanted even when i was in a rush and did not have time for anything else this curler when used together with a traditional clamp curler is an absolute make-up godsend clamp curlers have a tendency to make 90 degree angles in lashes which is even more unattractive than no curl at all this curler takes the fold out and smoothly sweeps the lashes around and up until they look completely natural took a little practice but now i can get my lashes looking great in under 5 minutes works like a charm excellent value for the money love it love it love it,159,16
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,i have long full and straight eyelashes so i thought this highly recommended heated curler would do the trick since regular curlers do not seem to do the trick for me i returned this after 2 weeks because 1 it no longer heated and 2 when it did heat it did not curl my lashes i do not understand why it was on the recommended list total waste of money,68,17
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,wish i would have tried it earlier i love this use it after applying a light coat of mascara hold in place for a few seconds or use a sweeping motion no eyelashes are crimped or falling out a life saver for someone that wakes up with her eyelashes going all directions i do not have to depend on my eyelash curler that damages my eyelashes anymore,65,18
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,i have had about four of these curlers the design is great and the curler was recommended by a well-known makeup artist i find they stop working in about 4 to 6 months i contacted the company several times about this problem but i never got an answer one great feature is that when you put the top back on it turns the switch off,65,19
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,it is not magic and it definitely takes patience but it does make a bit of a difference it says to use the product after applying mascara but because i would rather not risk getting it caked with mascara i choose to use it before i apply it takes some several strokes to see a difference it also does not get very hot so it can rest on your eyelid and not bother you that said i would not be concerned about the heating feature i get the best results when i comb my lashes out first use this heated eyelash curler second then follow it with a clamp eyelash curler directly after this process i apply my primer and then my mascara and my lashes look big and flawless the process is not fast it does take about 5 7 minutes i would recommend turning on the curler pushing the switch up so that the little red dot comes on at the beginning of your makeup routine so that when you get to your lashes it is already warmed up and ready to go fyi it does not come with a battery,190,20
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,does not curl my lashes at all i was disappointed in this purchase,13,21
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,1,negative,stopped working after less than 10 uses worked well when it actually did work although,15,22
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,the battery does not seem to connect too well in the product it is always a hit or miss when trying to curl my eyelashes with this in the mornings,28,23
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,5,positive,works great gets the clumps off with ease,8,24
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,2,negative,battery needs to be replaced every week at least i never dropped it and the battery compartment is cracked so sometimes it is not connected and it is not warming up when i think it is with a fresh battery i do love the results but the product itself could use some tweaking,52,25
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,honestly i have nowhat this is supposed to do for my face in the long run i take care of the problem areas of my skin with other products so even if it did some small thing I had never know what i do know is the superfine mist feels awesome when my skin is overheated or tired during the day which will be a lot during the summer the mist is cool and slightly moisturizing without any daily long-term effects like greasiness or astringency I have been using it a couple of weeks and had no breakouts which means it passed a major product test for me in winter i would probably call this more of a luxury than a necessary beauty product but as we go into summer and the hot damaged skin season it seems more like something good to have on hand as a treat,149,0
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i do not see any benefits provided by this spray the stars I am giving are for the great design of the bottle i wish i had a bottle like this for all my sprays it is right between being a mist and a spray so it layers on your skin nicely but I have used this on myself repeatedly now and see no benefits or any kind of difference on my skin i do not recommend it seems like a gimmicky waste of money,80,1
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i do not really get it I have been using this product for a few weeks and I have not noticed any benefit my skin does not feel or look different i can see where a mist would feel refreshing after working out or during the summer i think it is important to moisturize right after washing my face with clean water to help retain the moisture it is also my understanding that under most circumstances minerals and other nutrients work from the inside out not sprayed on top just to evaporate I am not sure what i was expecting with this spray as mentioned this will probably be refreshing on a hot day but I am just not seeing any other benefit,115,2
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i have a condition called keratosis pilaris on my legs and my face i have tried many products to help with this some work and some do not i have been using this for about a week and i am pretty pleased with the results first of all parts of my face are extremely dry while other parts are somewhat oily i find that this spray works well for my combination skin it feels moisturized but not greasy i wash my face with a charcoal soap then spray this on and allow it to dry naturally and apply my makeup as usual i also use it when i need a refresher midday and before bed i love it,118,3
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,this is a lot like the previous vichy product i tried vichy puret thermale 3-in-1 onemicellar cleansing water but the application process is quite different this is a product you just spray on your face i kept my eyes closed when i did this and tried to keep it out of my hair i left the spray on for a couple of minutes the directions are vague in this regard the product felt a bit sticky as the previous product from vichy did but in this case the directions said to dry my face off after that vague amount of time and that helped with the stickiness the application was a bit off-putting for me i did not feel like it gave me enough control over how much went on my skin and where it went even after using it for two weeks i never felt completely comfortable with it it did not irritate my very sensitive skin and the stickiness was removed with wiping it off but the application oddness and the fact that this product did not do anything to improve my skin means i will not buy it,190,4
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,my wife will not put any chemicals or weird things on her skin she sticks primarily to pure oil products that do not contain things such as alcohol or preservatives she has tried vichy a number of times after bathing and found it pleasant but she feels inconclusive on it is benefits it is always difficult to determine whether certain products are really having a positive effect this would include things such as skin care products vitamins and food supplements it can only be judged on a subjective level which is prone to all kinds of variables unless something has immediately caused a bad reaction or problem tough to tell it seems that there is nothing bad in the vichy which is why she agreed to try it so far she says it is nice,131,5
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,testing this as a free product from the amazon vine program this is a very nice and easy to use product that has become part of the daily routine fine mist spray that moisturizes withour ever feeling greasy or like you are wearing a mudpack so easy to spray and go let it sit for a minute and gently dry time will tell on the results but my skin feels great the research backing up this product seems credible after an internet search,82,6
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,my wife has used this for three days after washing her face she sprayed it on then dabbed it off after it had been on for a few minutes then she said her skin felt soft and smooth the softness she noted lasted all day much longer than when she used lotion unless product is extremely expensive it looks like they have got a steady customer one note my wife does not use makeup we do not know if her highly positive reaction would be less or perhaps even more dramatic weee she one who did,95,7
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i am familiar with vichy products and have always had a positive experience with products from this brand i was not sure what to expect from a can of expensive water the bar was low for this unfortunately i had a skin reaction to a food allergy and my skin was dry irritated and a bumpy broken out mess having previously dealt with this condition i know that it takes about 2 weeks to completely heal the vichy mineralizing thermal spray water arrived on day 2 of my reaction I have used it daily for the past 5-days and the bumps / irritation has almost completely disappeared the skin that I have used it on is no longer itchy or dry i have no new bumps or dermatitis I am sold on this product,128,8
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i love thismy issue is how it was packaged and arrived the ttem arrived unsealed with a cracked top with a large hole in it the rest of the top is not in the box so it appears it was packaged broken also it feels lighter than 10 oz bottle sounds half full when shaken like it may have been previously used I have ordered a bottle of this previously with no issues it was sealed and the top was unbroken and securely on,85,9
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1,negative,the product receive is fake not authentic i been using the vichy thermal water in the past and has a different consistency the one receive it just plain water no mineral fake product so disippont,35,10
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,this is a nice mineral water spray it is unique in that it contains salts in amounts you can taste some may not like that but i find it soothing for eczema prone skin,33,11
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1,negative,i purchased this product in september and by mid-november it was clogged to the point that it would not spray anymore i am very disappointed in the efficiency and usefulness of this container i probably used less than a 1/4th of the bottle,43,12
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i feel so refreshed after using this spray after using every morning for over a week i could see a difference in my skin much softer and smooth,28,13
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i guess that i do not have the sophistication to appreciate a 18 can of mineral water that has 101 ounces in it i used this product as directed and nothing it is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean but i think that i can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good old american mineral water i am not sure why the french mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to 18 i think that i will buy american mineral water i am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out you can spray the entire can on your whole body but if you have not put fluids inside your body it is not going to do any good my entire family gets together on the 4th of july for a pool party and i plan to use the vichy spray to keep me cool while I am sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated,198,14
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,in comparison with other anti cellulite massagers this one does it is job the suction is very good and i see improvement i use maximum speed and maximum suction because light level would not work for me as for device itself i give 5 stars but I am not agree with instructions how to use cream the massager does not work without cream indeed as the surface of the skin should be slippery but the machine suck it out of from the surface of the skin and i have to put cream again and again what a waste of product and money i decided to put baby oil work with the machine and after i put cream this way i get even better results the machine slips better but this is just my own experience and of course i agree without diet and proper exercises none massager is going to really help by the way regarding excersises i may suggest really good dvd to fight cellulite that i use myself along with the massage it is lower body workout from ballet body bysarago you can find it here on amazon it is challenging and very effective,194,0
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,I have been using this tool for three weeks now and i can totally see the difference in the appearance of cellulite and fat my skin feels so much tighter and smoother now of course it does not make any miracles however if you combine it with regular exercise and diet the results can be great i love the suction and the pulsation that it makes leaving your skin red which you can see it working deeply just be careful with the suction power because it can pick in your skin and it hurts also always apply fat girl slim before you use it so in love with this machine I have always dreamed of something like that i can use at home because doing treatments at spa such as endermology or vela shape can cost a lot of money highly recommended,140,1
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,I am loving it the suction power is definitely strong enough and you can feel it even at the lowest level the size of the machine is very good to use and too keep at home at the first day it was not so easy to use but now i got used to i can not say yet if it is effectiv because it is my first week using it but i can say the feeling is so good,74,2
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,this small thing feels like a professional machine very powerful,10,3
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,ok so i raved in my last review about how great this product was it was actually that great a bit painful but great nonetheless and worked until it stopped suctioning 2 weeks in what a disappointment i teetered on the verge of just trading it in for another one since it works so well but due to the fact that most people who have a problem with it complained about it stopping suction i figured it would only be a matter of time before the next one stopped working so i sadly it turned it back in if it could have at least lasted 6 months it would be worth it but 2 weeks is surely not enough for the money spent on this product,126,4
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,returned it did not see visible results after suggested use,9,5
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,this machine can succionar your skin and you can feel how works desapearing the cellulite i ove it,18,6
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,this is not worth the money it barely sucks and does not seem to do anything,15,7
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,honestly thishas so much potential but the company bliss has done a terrible job bringing this concept into fruition the lipomassage unit worked awesome for three weeks but has lost all suction power i can not even use it now i did everything as instructed i may look into replacing the battery maybe it is a cheap battery please do not waste your money,63,8
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,this machine worked well once i used it twice the night i got it and the morning after i loved how it worked i tried it again two weeks later i can not get the machine to turn off the button to turn it off does not do anything it stopped finally when the battery died there is also no suction whatsoever the vacuum part stopped working after just two times do not waste your money the product in theory is a good concept if only the machine worked more than a total of 10 minutes before losing all suction,104,9
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,this is a big waste of money the suction is very weak the machine is very heavy and very hard to use my cheap cellulees md does better job and much stronger suction than this piece of junk i bought it because i thought it would be made of better materials than the cheap celluless md blastic since it costs 145 i wish there was no star option shame on you bliss,71,10
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,bought at my local make-up and skincare store crappy product suction was intermittent sometimes worked sometimes did not when it did work even at the lowest setting the machine would latch onto my skin and refused to budge even if i pressed the suction release button but most of the time no suction at all i tried the cream that came with it and my own lotions checked the filter to make sure it was clean noadd to all of this that it is louder than my vacuum cleaner all in all hated it and returned it a few days later,101,11
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,do not buy the concept works but the device does not,10,12
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,it was wonderful for about 2 weeks then it stopped all suction and thus useless way too expensive of a product for the amount of time it will last disappointing to say the least,34,13
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,terrible gave black and blue marks all over my legs did not work at all i wasted my money and would never recommend to anyone,25,14
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i have been using it for 3 weeks at least once a day sometimes twice a day and using it with both the fatgirlslim cream and what actually works better with it is the fatgirlslim six-pack abs gel i also use the scrub with the slimulator every day too i have not changed my diet or exercise and i am not overweight i have a bmi of 22 but have some cellulite on my outer thighs using this well using all the products combined with this really made the skin in my outer thigh absolutely feel tighter and firmer and mildly reduced the look of cellulite not a huge difference but there definitely has been a difference i am going to keep using it and hopefully have more results,128,15
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,I have been getting professional endermologie at 50 a pop for years now with some good results but was considering buying a home unit wellbox for 1500 when my friend told me about this wonderful little machine needless to say i was pretty excited about the 145 price and decided to give it a try I have only had this thing for 3 days now and used it more then once a day each day with nivea gel and let me tell ya it feels just like the professional machine at my salon the suction is just as hard and the results are just the same as in noticeable right away of course these are subtle results but i can definitely see a difference in my thighs after just 6 or 7 uses,132,16
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,quit working after light use contacted bliss and was told to contact seller who has policy is a 30 day return which is no longer valid in my case i told bliss their product states a one year warranty and i did register online and now i understand what others are saying about the machine losing all suction function which makes it useless i believe there is a mechanical defect according to other reviews and i hope bliss stands by their product and issues a refund or exchange I have called them twice and was told someone will get back to you shortly i had high hopes with this little machine for treating minor skin uneveness on my upper abdomen my weight is 118 lbs and i only used it on a small area for just a few weeks worth each session about 10 minutes i bought it through amazon and was shipped to me by skindirect i also sent them an e-mail asking for advice we will see if they do call and issue me a refund because the customer service rep said she will have to talk to her manager because i did not buy the machine from them directly,199,17
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i am very frustrated i can not speak to efficacy because the machine broke and i can not get any feedback or help from bliss i used the machine for 2 weeks and then it stopped working I am a petite person i used it only a couple minutes every day but it broke even at the highest setting the suction barely pulls now i emailed their customer service did not hear back so i called and a rep said i would receive a phone call and email within 24 hours it is been 4 days and I have heard nothing i would love the opportunity to try this out for a couple months but bliss has been very unhelpful and unresponsive,116,18
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,this works but honestly i must be a bit of a wimp as i find it a little painful as it sucks up the skin and rolls bit like pinching so have only used it a couple of time,39,19
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i do not like this machine it is more like a fischer price toy definetely disappointed with this product,18,20
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,wife likes it it works but takes some time be ready for some black and blues,16,21
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,definitively great i have two week using it and the changes are inmediatly the cream very little but i use other anticelulite cream,23,22
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,while nothing but weight loss will help the appearance of cellulite long term this does help circulation so i bought it for my diabetic mother to use on her legs and after regularly soaking in lavender chamomile and using the massagingmachine her feet and calves look completely normal again,51,23
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,this was difficult to use and not worth the time i felt it was either killing me and sucking too hard or it was not sucking at all and i was getting nothing out of it,35,24
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i do not recommend this product it is not worth the money the lotion is very bad and cleaning the machine too my advice save the money and get a better machine,32,25
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,a little more difficult to use than i thought it would be but is okay for an at home treatment,20,26
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,not worth the money it has poor suction,8,27
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,fair amount of suction i had to pry a cheek out of it a time or two you will see results if you keep at it diet and exercise also helps,31,28
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,could not get this to effectively work for me a few friends with different body types tried too but with the same results not much suction set at any setting and it would not roll over the skin it is also quite noisy I have heard great things about this little machine from massage therapists just could not get it to satisfactorily work for me,62,29
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,meh a lot of work and pain for me lost interest after the first few times did not see any results expensive lotion i tried my own brands that worked but were messy I shall give you mine if you want it,41,30
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,it works but you have to use it weekly and exercise and eat fresh and clean foods,17,31
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,it really helps but you should use it every day i love this machine,14,32
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i get endomologie treatments after my plastic surgery and i use this in between treatments daily it works just like the machine which for anyone who does not know what endomologie is it disperses the cellulite so you do not get lumpy after lipo the suction on here and the pulsation obviously is not quite as strong as a professional machine that cost 50000 but it definitely works and helps just as well i did not have an issue using it on my butt either just turn on your side and bend your knees these reviews that say it is hard to hold or hard to maneuver around their butt are either not flexible at all or they are not very clever can not reach the back then stand up,123,33
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,love this product used to get endomology treatments but this is a much cheaper and effective alternative only reason for 4 stars is that i am not a fan of the cream i would recommend using a cocoa butter instead which helps the machine glide better i have definitely noticed a difference in cellulite on my legs and use the product daily,62,34
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,it is hard to hold it because it is heavy for one hand only and i have been using it every other day for a couple of weeks now but still did not see any changes it is only good to use in the legs not so good for stomach and not made to use in arms and butty,58,35
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,it is been 2 weeks and i do notice a nice difference i use the machine everyday i use the lotion every day sometimes twice a day the lotion clumps up and is sticky with clothes on so i only use a little bit i ended up using aloe vera gel with the machine and if i have time in the morning i will use it with the lotion and then shower i also have been scrubbing every morning with coffee grounds and use a handle held percussion massager everyday i will update in a few weeks,96,36
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i really have noticed a difference on my thighs i think this product seems to do what the description says it will do so far so good,26,37
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,looses suction after a few sessions and really need a friend or partner to help i like the feeling but no results my husband used it every night on me for 6 weeks and i was just left disappointed,39,38
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i use this 3xs a week and have seen some slight improvement i started with the settings at the lowest and worked my way up eventually i got to the last setting and am hoping i can still see some more benefits but i may have reached the maximum still trying although coconut oil works good if you do not want to keep using the fatgirl cream,66,39
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,great product i use it an i see good results an i will continue to use this an get other stuff for it,23,40
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,this little machine works well at first it hurt a bit until you get use to it the cream is a piece if crap it dries fast i use baby oil and it slides better the shipping was very very fast I am very happy with the purchase,47,41
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i think the bottom line is that nothing is going to take away cellulite exercise diet strength training are the best you can do i saw no results with this,30,42
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,it takes a while to get use to using it but i can tell it is working slowly although the cream does not work that well it dries up quickly and so i use palmers oil instead,36,43
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,you can feel hardness to use themachine yourself alone it would be better someone operate it for you,20,44
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,overall it is a good product it definitely works but it is heavy bulky to hold and hard to move up and down if your skin is not very lubricated it is also very painful for me i have a low pain tolerance but i think it will take some getting used to for anyonemy skin is very red after i use it but that means it is working it is a good product if you have the time to use it consistently,76,45
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,I am not convinced this did anything for me but add some vericose veins the lotion products needed to operate the device are stupid expensive,24,46
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,it is hard to use my hand get tierd tring to left that thing on my leg i did not see much diffrence i stop using it while ago what waste of money i think using the plastic bruch around my leg is better,44,47
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,the product burns and is not very good i should have done a better job on research before i purchased this,22,48
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,I have been using this machine almost daily for about three weeks and definitely notice an improved appearance in the surface of my skin less dimpling smoother husband says it feels smoother to his touch also i train hard 6 - 7 days a week have a really clean diet and am verybut at 40 the dimpling is there even although there is not much fat i doubt this machine will help you if fat loss or a change in your bodys actually shape is your goal i think it is well suited to someone who just wants to change how the contour of the skins surface looks,105,49
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i only used it twice and it worked for me the cellulite on my arms is barely noticeable for me it works and i will continue to use it i did search online for reviews and one person said she uses nivea cellulite gel cream instead of the fatgirlslim and that is what i did the niva is absorbed into the skin and it is not messy so nothing to clean up i did go slow over my skin and the areas turned red from the machine which they said the machine was doing it is job i think it was a good buy for me,103,50
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,not much suction hard to use on buttocks area not happy can i return or is this non refundable,21,51
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,i bought this machine because it replicates the velashape concept i had success with the velashape and thought that it would be more convenient and cheaper to do it myself wrong it is very awkward to hold especially when doing the back of your thighs and the cream you are instructed to rub on your thighs prior to using the machine wears off fast you have to keep reapplying so that the machine can glide on your skin and the bottle of cream is so small it fits in the palm of your hand unfortunately i would rather pay the extra money for velashape,104,52
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,this device really works well despite some criticism the trick is to use adequate amounts of cream and oh boy the suction rivals any spa machine,26,53
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i bought this product about a month ago in hopes it would help with the puckering on my buttocks and thighs i started using a firming lotion in addition to the cream supplied and keep it on the highest level can hurt a bit and noticed a big difference already i would recommend it just be patient and keep up with it and drinking a good amount of water exercising and eating sensible,73,54
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,I have been using themachine for 5 days now and have noticed a decrease in the appearance of my cellulite my husband has also noticed i am 52 130 lbs i am fit and exercise a minimum of 5 days per week but i am plagued with a large booty and cellulite on the back of my legs hips butt and quads I have noticed the most change in my hip area thus far but do see changes on all parts of my legs the product does take some getting used to i normally lay on my back and extend my leg into the air to get the back of the leg especially where it connects to my rear i use just a bit of the fat girl slim and then use another layer of oil almond / jojoba blend to make is glide smoothly overall i say this product is a hit it does reduce the appearance of cellulite and it is a great leg massager after a hard run worth the money,173,55
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,wish i never spent the money does not work with any ease at all i find myself just masssaging in the fatgirlslim lotion vigorously to stimulte my legs,27,56
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i really like it it feels like it works when it used because it massages and and has suction at the same time i like that it has different settings my legs look smoother the only problem i have is that it is a little hard to get the back of my thighs with it all in all it is worth it although,61,57
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i used my friends machine she bought it at sephora you really se that machine works on you and gives you a really nice results but that one that sent to me is definitely broken,35,58
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,the machine is cumbersome to use and the suction is barely felt on the majority of areas the cream dried and balled up as i massaged over it immediately also it hurt my wrist and hand as i used it on my thighs,43,59
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i recommend it but when i bought it it was not clear that the fat girl slim cream was included luckly it was maybe it should be more clear about the products specifications,32,60
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i tried this machine for several weeks and i think it is a waste of money not only is it time consuming painful as it suctions your skin in some cases very hard but really did not produce any results i am of average weight and relatively fit and i thought this would help but all i can say is do not waste your money,63,61
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,trying to be consistent with my use of this product i do think I am seeing results thank you very much,20,62
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i like this machine it is everything it is cracked up to be try it out today it is worth the bucks,20,63
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,great purchase very easy to handle it is lightweight and amazing suction it does help a lot with cellulite you just got to use it at least 3 times a week personally i use almond oil the machine roles better than with lotion the other days of the week i do not use the machine i do use anti cellulite lotions when i started this whole process my thighs had a lot of visible cellulite after 6 weeks of constant use i can totally see the difference I am very happy with the results i will give this product more than a 5 stars,101,64
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i had high hopes not that it would totally eliminate cellulite but that it would even somewhat help well it did not the machine is cumbersome and it would be very hard to use it enough where it might actually serve a purpose i think the main objective is to increase skin elasticity and circulation and thus to plump up the skins appearance i find dry brushing and some of the caffeine skin smoothing creams more effective and user friendly,78,65
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,this machine really works well I have been using it for a month now starting week 1 i can already see result the skin is tighter the dimples are less noticeable even my husband can tell the difference money well spent,40,66
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,i love this product it worked changed my shape reduced cellulite on the first use the only down fall was I am in australia so i needed a conversion plug to charge other than that i would recommend to anybody love it,41,67
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,bought this seeing reviews were pretty positive i found it to be a waste of time money and pain it made it look worse i guess if you have a dimples or 2 i can see it work but if you have celliute a lot do not waste your money i had high hopes and sad to see it failed to help n made it worse,65,68
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,like the machine used only on one side of body to see if it really works it does it is just a matter of finding the time to dl it it does take more that the time they say it does,40,69
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,it does not vibrate nor suction even after using more cream would not recommend it to any of my friends or enemies,21,70
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,i really wish i had not dished out so much money on this device i clearly had a moment where i was not thinking straight to start this little machine is hard and awkward to maneuver you need so much oil to keep it rolling along smoothly the lower suction settings feel as if they are doing nothing the higher ones actually left bruises on my hips and thighs however i persevered and used it as directed well my cellulite starting looking worse still i kept at it thinking perhaps this was all part of the process frustrated with the fact that my cellulite was even more noticeable i started reading up on cellulite and discovered that devices like these can actually make the problem worse the skin in the areas where you have cellulite is often already very fragile and thin and suction can further break down the collagen and connective fibers according to what i read i would not recommend this machine and wish i could send it back it is essentially a 140 pos that is now retired to my bathroom cabinet after a very brief life,186,71
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i bought this little wonder a couple of months ago and let me tell you guys it works you have to be very dilligent and patient and do it every single day my skin improves a lot when I am using it the back of my thighs and inner thighs feel tighter and the skin is more supple and soft than before the machine works perfectly the only thing that bothers me is the little filter mesh that you have to clean everytime you use the machine i used it so much that i finally lost the little filter and i could not find where to buy the same one so i basically got a piece of cheesecloth and shaped it so it could fit and voila it works awesome it is an expensive machine so if you are not going to do it everyday do not buy it oh and do it with the fatgirlslim cream i have been trying several creams with it and that one works the best good luck ladies,158,72
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,i acknowledge of this wonderful machine reading one of my favorite magazines during a trip at the first opportunity to search the web i did my search read reviews and bought it i have been using it almost every other day although not time enough some subtle results noticed with this brief experience thus i an fascinated,57,73
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,I have been using this for three weeks and saw smoother results on the 2nd day you have to keep up with it to see results this is not a weight loss product it just smoothes things over i pair this up with pilates / light cardio and my legs are starting to look great i also like the lotion it comes with it has a light smell and makes my skin soft for a long time one thing although warn your husbands / boyfriends about this if you do not hit the release button soon enough it can leave some hickie-like bruises on your legs and that can make for and awkward conversation,108,74
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,works awesome i had dramatic results in under 2 weeks and saved a ton of money by doing it myself love it love it love it,25,75
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,the machine works as advertised the suction can be slight or excruciating it is up to you the only bad thing is it was difficult for me to move it back and forth maybe it had to do with the amount of suction i had set I am able to move it one direction in one long strip and start again in a different area or the same area i hope to see some results soon,74,76
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,i like bliss products but this is hard to hold and handle over all it also takes a lot more time than estimated by the company it also caused me pain fairly frequently just not worth it in my opinion,40,77
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,this is a powerful little machine i never put my hand in holder i usually use both hands on side of machine and pull away lifting my leg to a 90 degree angle and resting my foot on my bed i love it i see a huge difference but then again i use it almost every night before bed and I have been using it for more than 1 month now also i only use it on my legs it helps with cellulite not a weight loss product people worth it thanks,91,78
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,noisy and very bulky not comfortable to hold cream which include in very small jar not oily enough for massage,20,79
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,the best product ever just love it i was looking for something like this and finally got it the machine is small and very comfy comes with a cream but i prefer to use more effective cream that i also bought from here eveline cosmetics this company has different kind of cream and very large variety I am pleased with the results it worth every dime,65,80
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,worked well the first tjwo times i used it i thought i had hit the jackpot it lost all suction power to it this was in the third day of use i am trying to order a battery for it me thinking well maybe it sat on the store shelf for a long long time can not evan get to an 800 number for help i know i can go thru amazon but to order one and just to get a wrong fit wow i need to invest more money fine but give a number so i can call and get the correct battery should of known it was to good to be true if any one out there has ordered a battery help me out with the link or number please,131,81
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,did not really help with my cellulite has a strong suction got a few bruises using it,18,82
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,do not get this product it caused more spider veins with the sucking of the machine i used everything as directed and ended up with spider veins and the cellulite still remained,34,83
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,it worked really well until it stopped working entirely,9,84
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,love it love it love it I have definitely noticed a difference in addition to exercise and diet,17,85
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,bought this for my daughter to help with mild cellulite on the sides and back of her thighs we saw little improvement after consistent use after 30days she used it every night for about 2 weeks and then about every other night after mainly because it was time consuming and worked better if she had assistance we feel like some of the other product out there that use massage as the main source of bringing circulation to the skin would work as well or better she is in good physical shape about 135lbs and very active just recently noticed the dimpling after she had gained about 8lbs probably heredity but I am sure it did not hurt to try and improve smoothness and firm the area around the thighs just not worth the money for us,134,86
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,for something that makes such a fuss when you have it turned on there should be that much more suction power this machine is so loud i rather try and use my hose attachment on my vacuum cleaner and attempt to suction my cellulite away that way instead i used it four times the fourth day of using it the machine started emitting this plastic burning smell i regret wasting my time with this and this time i really should have heeded the other reviewers warnings thank you amazon for your excellent return policy and letting me return this seriously disappointing product,102,87
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,I am shocked at the outcome it is very inexpensive for gel polish and was a little thick when applying but it is awesome thechange is amazing and I am totally ordering more,31,88

Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4,positive,accurate but a little clunky very sharp i have an older model which is more compact,16,8
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2,negative,so disappointed on it is quality and it is really hard to handle it i had an old pair of zwilling ja hemckels nail clipper for more than 10 years in different model and i loved it so much for it is quality this particular model has no comparison to my old one after few uses i think the only way for it to work well is to clip tiny piece by piece very frustrated,72,9
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4,positive,i had one of these before and i can say they changed something in the manufacturing before it cut no problem i lost the original one i bought and ordered a replacement that works meh still it is the best but you have to put a bit more effort into it,50,10
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2,negative,nail clipper is sharp enough blade built after the shape is not good,13,11
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1,negative,a truly stupid design the plastic handle flexes which means they simply do not cut,15,12
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1,negative,a truly stupid design that should never have been released to the market the plastic handle flexes which means they simply do not cut these have gone in the bin I am off to the 2 shop to find some that actually cut,42,13
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5,positive,very comfortable to use cuts nails very well,8,14
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4,positive,the head does rotate and that is great but the width of the clipper is narrow making it more appropriate for children than adults,23,15
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2,negative,it is too big gigger than other nail clipper and the head is not fixed often turning but still sharp,19,16
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1,negative,these are the worst clippers i have ever used they are dull and the swivel does not work as well as one might think definitely not what i expected from this company,31,17
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5,positive,love these clippers sturdy easy to hold especially love that the clip part swivels to make it easier to use right or left handed,24,18
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4,positive,i like this clipper even although the handle is a little odd shaped,13,19
Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5,positive,i love these clippers since i was diagnosed with ra eight years ago I have really struggled with finding clippers that were small and easy to maneuver but also easy to hold the rotating head makes cuts possible from any angle and the large plastic handles are easy to grip i love these and am already planning to give them as gifts to my family this year i know that sounds strange but trust me my family goes crazy for things like this easily the best pair of clippers I have ever owned,91,20

Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5,positive,great product packaging for this product although i liked the stick this is just as good,16,0
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1,negative,something is wrong with the formula or storage they are grainy beads in both the tub and tube love this stuff but it is become unusable as this point super sad,30,1
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,2,negative,has anyone found a replacement for this product the tube form was all i used to use and while i bought my years supply of this already i have to apply it 5x as often and still have dry chapped lips plus this product comes out of the tube gritty not lovely until it literally melts i would love to find a new tea tree oil lip balm that is good if anyone has any suggestions,76,2
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5,positive,i have used this product for years and i love it,11,3
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5,positive,very healing if your lips are dry or cracked it has nice tingle from the tea tree as well glossy and shiny so i do not need lipstick or gloss with it,31,4
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,4,positive,i love epicuren and have used several of their products for years this balm is one of my favorite epicuren products and i recommend it to everyone it is a little slicker and oilier than other lip balms and is very hydrating and the hydration last the whole time i am wearing it i actually started making my own lip balm after i could not find epicuren when i moved however i recently rediscovered it and now it is in every bag i find many other lip balms to be drying or waxy after awhile so i only use epicuren or my own i recommend this to everyone i know absolutely worth the price as i have thrown away many other more expensive lip balms because they hydrate for a little while and then are very drying 4 out of 5 stars because i preferred the older packaging twist-up tube for application but understand why they switched to a squeezable tube,158,5
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,2,negative,unlike the epicurean lip balm in the small container this one is too much in liquid form and is not long lasting i will not buy this again,28,6
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1,negative,this used to be my favorite lip balm i used the one in the little pot or chapstick form for years i loved the old version because it did not have a sunscreen taste or smell just the tea tree smell i dislike sunscreen taste / smell in products but you got to use them it was smooth and really moisturized my lips it was my go to always and kept me from getting burnt lips at the beach but this new version is terrible not only is it sunscreen tasting it is feels different and i do not like the tube still searching for something as great as the old product,107,7
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5,positive,most amazing lip balm i have ever used it leaves a very alive feeling i only wish they sold it again in a tube roll on like other lip balms,30,8
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1,negative,very disappointed the tube version was my very favorite balm ever can not get it anymore tried this makes lips more chapped had an off texture of clumpy little balls wish they made the balm chapstick tube type again i would buy like 10 tubes,43,9
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1,negative,not the same as it use to be very poor quality,11,10
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,i have not noticed any results here and the creme is really thick so does not spread easily over the skin theis overpriced for what it had turned out to be just a lotion,34,0
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,waste of money does not help skin just greasy,9,1
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,container seal broken and product solid and very hard to use left skin feeling and looking greasy / shiny,17,2
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,it is ok but it was not the wow i expected after watching the ad on tv i did not notice any difference of crepe help around my neck and more i think it is an ok hydration product but not for this price set on amazon,44,3
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,save your money a heavy moisturizer can do the same I have used it as instructed for 1 week and saw no difference from other heavy moisturizers this is a thick cream and you have to take more time to rub it in your skin if you did the same with another product you could have similar effects i felt it was misrepresented saw infomercial on this at thought it was worth a try would have been happy to pay full price if effective,83,4
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,this stuff really works unfortunately i am allergic to something in it so i passed it to a friend,19,5
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i have to say I am pretty picky about what i put on my body i tried this figuring here i go z again blowing money on the next best thing I have been using it for about 2 months now and am sold my skin looks great fine lines are gone and it looks and feels more healthy i recently went on a cruise with my husband and got a little burned on my back i asked him to rub a little in the burn when he was done he used what was left on his face and went to bed swear to god in the morning he was astonished at the change it made he has now taken over my supply so here i am buying more for us both I am not sure how it will work for you but it is working for us good luck,146,6

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i was surprised to see such negative reviews for this but everyone is different my skin loves this stuff and i have noticed a big difference I have been using it faithfully for about 4 months and see a huge improvement especially on my decolletage area and my upper arms love how it gives my legs a nice shine whether it is just temporary I am sure it is like anything else you have to use it faithfully it is time consuming but to me it is worth it love how the polish makes my skin feel and even if i miss a day it still feels soft I am sure there may be other products out there that are cheaper and may do the same thing just do not like to waste my money on something I am not sure of this stuff I am sure of everybody is skin is different people will have different outcomes i guess for me it is worth it,153,10
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,i did not see much difference after 6 weeks am over the counter cream i buy at sams with retinol has given better results really not worth spending money on,31,11

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,my girlfriend loves this stuff that is why i have already re-orded it for her,14,20
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,this product works well and even helped my super cracked dry heels,12,21
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,this is the only product I have found that gives me a lasting moisturizing effect i have eczema and I have tried every eczema product out there none of which has a lasting effect this stuff is great it really is more of a treatment than just a lotion and helps my eczema a lot I am 62 and i have noticed quite a difference in my crepey skin as well just like any product the more disciplined you are with using it the better the results i highly recommend it,88,22
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,the nothing i followed the instructions to a tee there was no noticeable change in my skin waste of money,21,23

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i love this product been using for about a month and it really works,14,27
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i for one loved the product especially the scent i suffer from migraines and i loved that this scent was light it smells like limes oranges and lemons i wanted a lemon shake-up all day when i use this product the only issue i have is that my nipples became tender however i have extremely sensitive skin from the top of my head to my nipple area so i took that with the grain of salt figuring it was just my skin being my skin i have to use fragrance free perfume free detergents i have gluten issues so therefore i took it as i stated earlier with the grain of salt try it and enjoy it i love it and everything gives me a migraine i am not over exaggerating but this did not i only use these two because i am extremely faithful to my meaningful beauty products from cindy crawford that i have used since the day it came out love it as well,167,28

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,this was a gift for a family member she loves it,11,37
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,i used it once and had a reaction to the fragrance i can only wear channel 5 and the rest causes sinus and headaches and breathing problems i returned it that being said i could tell that without a doubt the stuff would work on my neck and chest and arms if you do not have issues with fragrance this might be the stuff for you i wish so much that i could use it now i have to research again to try and find something i can use,88,38
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,used all of product without any change noticeable at all,10,39
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,returning for a refund the exfoliant does not work at all the lotion is not miracle that is for sure,20,40

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,do not waste your money i have used this as recommended and it has done nothing to improve the look of my skin very disappointed a lot of money for nothing,30,42
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,does not work the way the information they say on the direction on package big disappointment wood not order again,20,43

Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,disappointed in the crepe erase it helped some but not worth spending this much money to use it again,19,47
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,using any good cream is working just as well,9,48
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,made my skin really smooth after one day of application,10,49
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,i felt that a lot of the before and after pics used lighting to fill out the skin my mother used this for 2 wks and found no improvement it is a good moisturizer although and I shall be using it as that,42,50
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,product does not work any better than a good moisturizer it said money back guarantee i am extremely disappointed that i went on to try to return today and it said it had to be returned by june 1st it is the 5th i never had issues like this from an amazon prime product before,54,51
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,it is improving my wrinkles on my neck chest and arms,12,52
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i have not used it long but helps my knees and elbows i do really like it i am an older woman and it has helped my wrinkles,27,53
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,over a period of 2 weeks my dry skin particularly around my elbows and shins smoothed out ordinarily i wash with soap as i do not lik the chemicals used in many products this product was nonecabrasive did not irritate my skin and the creme applied after the scrub was non greasy and dramatically fragrant i used the creme on my face at night some dry areas as i have combination skin next morning i noticed the drt areas were much smoother and would last the whole day without much additional moisturising,90,54
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,I had been watching the infomercial with jane seymour for quite awhile so i was excited to try this I have noticed crepey skin in my d collet area when leaning over I have used this consistently the past 2 weeks and have noticed no change at all in my skin this product has an obnoxious scent that makes me cough is a lot of work that needs to be kept up i think that my d collet area looks even drier now than it did when i was using a simple inexpensive facial moisturizer in that area the same results can probably be obtained by buying a gentle drugstore exfoliator along with a moisturizer for a lot less cost,115,55
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,this is a good moisturizer and exfoliating product but no where near the miracle worker it claims to be and you might expect from the price i gave this to an older relative to try and she found it to be a pleasant enough product to use but way overpriced for the tiny amount you get and what positive effects there are unfortunately only last for a short time alas this is another product that does not spring from a fountain of youth despite it is claims,86,56
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,ok so assuming money is no object this is a decent product exfoliator works well not really for the face more for the neck chest arms and body i do love the moisturizer body repair it is thick and creamy almost reminds me of my mothers old ponds face cream i will say that my skin feels great after a couple of weeks of use did not really have a crepe problem but i do have dry skin and some fine wrinkles this duo does the job however the 4 star rating is discounting for the cost this is really a trial size yet it is over 60 in cost you can do better on your own using other products i love ahava products as well as olay i say shop around a bit or wait for the price to come down a bit,142,57
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,i am 71 years old and my once-beautiful skin has turned into crepe especially on my forearms I have used this crepe erase for 2 days and the difference is amazing my skin is almost smooth and feels soft i love this product and will be using it a long time highly recommended,52,58
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,ugh as i get holder my skin has more sag even although i work out a lot and am a normal weight my skin just looks looser that is a part of aging i was interested in trying this product combination to see if anything could be done about that crepe looking skin while the crepe did not completely disappear the appearance is less why i like this product it has a very light pleasant scent so many products these days have heavy artificial scents and i just can not tolerate that the moisturizer really moisturizes without feeling super-greasy it is heavy enough to do the trick but not so heavy that it feels like you want to wipe it off the exfoliating gel feels good i was a bit concerned that this would be too drying for my skin but i am happy to report that this is not the case if you are looking for something that might just help your dry and aging skin this might be for you please note no miracles will occur with the use of these products your skin might just look a tad better,191,59
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,i do not have a problem with crepiness but i am beginning to see the very beginnings of something resembling it under my upper arms like yuck aging really sucks naturally I had be for anything that would forestall it i was glad to try the crepe erase two part system despite the name which gives me the heebies the moisturizer is ok the scrub like most average scrubs so all i have to do is use a scrub and moisturize and it will all be fine because regardless of what the company claims after several weeks i see zero change in my incipient underarm crepiness if this product is supposed to make a difference it is not doing a thing i can see two stars because the products are not horrible but minus three stars because i do not see that they do at all what the manufacturer claims you can get a similar result a lot cheaper with almost any moisturizer and sugar scrub for a lot less pass,165,60
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,does very little to help my crepe skin on my arms i will not purchase again,16,61
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,softens the skin to eliminate the appearance of old age skin,11,62
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,too gummy i do not know if it is effective because it was so thick it was uncomfortable to apply,18,63
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,i believe this product is working is it an overnight remedy no but i can see small changes will continue to use,22,64
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,do not waste your money it is just expensive cream and does nothing but moisturize,13,65
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,1,negative,this is completely awful and a total waste of my money the cream was hard and dry when it arrived the first time i used it i got a red rash on my arm which lasted about 48 hours i never used it again it appeared very old and dried out and had an unpleasant odor complete waste of money and disappointment do not buy this product,67,66

Movies_and_TV,6302250161,1,negative,this was obviously a foreign made movie the dialogue made no sense it was made in 1976 so i presume that is why voice overs are nothing like the tv series I am just glad my granddaughter had bedtime half way through which by the way is when the first smurf shows up in the movie if you select this movie for the kiddies leave the room you will go mad and stare into the abyss,75,63

Movies_and_TV,6302250161,1,negative,if you are looking for the movie you saw as a kid in the us this is not it even although all the packaging indicates it is the movie you know and love it is not after i bought this for my wife and she was extremely disappointed that it was not the same movie i did some digging apparently the company that remastered the dvd used the united kingdom dubbed version this changes the names of the characters the character voices and the music not sure why the company used the uk version or why they just did not give you an option for having a language selection for us against uk my guess as to why anyone who gave better than 2 stars for this movie 1 never saw it as a kid 2 saw it in the uk and never in the us 3 just simply does not remember anything about the movie so if you have no care about those things then by all means purchase away at least the story itself did not change update i had heard that a canadian company had a us version of the movie i ordered it and saddly not true they also had the uk dub,202,110

Movies_and_TV,6302250161,2,negative,we love the smurfs and have been waiting anxiously for the magic flute to come out having remembered seeing it on tv years ago we were very disappointed in the movie because the voices of the characters were not the familiar ones we remember and they were definitely not the same as the cartoon episodes that were recently released why would the voices be changed it really ruined the movie for us if we had known we would never have purchased this movie for me sound is very important and not only the voices but the music as well was not the familiar tune or arrangements the sound quality was fine but we did not enjoy the new voices and music,121,113
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,2,negative,was so excited to get this video and then i started watching it with my kids i was upset the voices were all wrong and the songs were wrong and they called peewit william the whole movie it was not till later that i learned this was the uk dub version i know my kids will not know the diference but I am really upset with it and i will not be able to watch it really thinking about sending it back very upset and sad,82,114
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,2,negative,this is a great movie a few spoilers warnings yes it is more johan and pewit than smurfs this is befor smurfwtte or baby smurf joined the family nor is gargamel anywhere near it i had it onand watched it recently the voice cast was changed i guess they thought the high pitch voices annoying but i grew up with it now it sounds like they are mumbling worse yet pewiys voice is very much like johans that is not an ugly voice just all wrong for him i think I shall give the dvd to my godson and stick to my,102,115
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,5,positive,created by belgium cartoonist peyo in the late 50s this comic book was first made into a feature in the late 70s i had to get this for my nieces i remembered this film from my time growing in europe and bought a copy for my nieces they loved it although the smurfs do not appear on screen until 20 mins into the film this did not detract from the overall enjoyment good family entertainment,76,116
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,2,negative,this is not the american english dub if you were hoping to get the american english dub you will be sorely disappointed with this release because this one is the united kingdom english dub which is terrible in my opinion the voice acting ranges from passable to terrible and the songs with their lyrics are not as catchy as the american english dub version I had give this one a serious pass unless you are that desperate to own a copy of the movie an important thing of note is that imavision a canadian video distributor also released this movie in north america with the english and french voice tracks and that also has the united kingdom english dub which is how i first came to know this problem,125,117
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,4,positive,this is one of the movies that i grew up with i remember watching smurfs and the magic flute on cable showtime in the 80s only problem with this movie is that smurfs only come out in the movie maybe 20 the rest of the movie is about pee-wee and yohan and the king but still the movie is great i ordered this movie as soon as i saw it on amazon but when i went to target today the movie was only 999 amazon charged me 1357 from now on I am going to check target first before buying any movie from amazon the four stars is for the movie not the price,113,118
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,4,positive,i loved the smurfs when i was younger and i love how they are bringing them back to life on dvd we actually watched this movie as a family and my boys thought the smurfs were so funny i will say they were a little anxious and disappointed that the smurfs did not appear until after 30 minutes but when they did it was smurfing-fun if you are looking for a strictly smurf movie then this may not be the right one since it is only half-smurfs and i do not remember some of the popular smurf characters like smurfette and gargamuel being in it either but it is a classic cartoon movie and entertaining in itself we will be watching this again,122,119
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,5,positive,i was lucky enough to be able to review this before it was released and i have to say that this was a great dvd that brought back my memories of sitting and watching this great cartoon on saturday mornings when i was a child the dvd was a great movie and my kids loved watching it with me as well ever since they saw the the smurfs two-disc combo blu-ray 3d blu-ray dvd ultraviolet digital copy they have been hooked on the cartoon so having this new movie to share with them just solidified their love of the little blue characters the artistry of the film and the cartooning was amazing outside of the movie itself although the bonus features on this dvd were so much fun and you will leave watching them so much more in the know about smurf lingo my favorite as well as character guide a close 2 that will leave you knowing a bit about every smurf overall this is a dvd that any smurf fan will simply love,180,120
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,4,positive,this film has to be the strangest adaptaion og mozarts classic classical music compostions we go from tamino and pamina to pee wee and yohan what is up with that i think that gargamel would be a good monostatos but azrael would be an unusual soroaster by the way are the smurfs supposed to replace the three lads which i guess correspond to the weird sisters in macbeth so i do get this film and i even speak german and it does not do any good to make sense of it all,91,121
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,5,positive,i loved this movie it is totally smurfalicious i loved every moment of it i was taken away by it very enchanting the only thing different would be the absense of gargamail and azreail oh well great movie anyways you will be swept away by this wonderful epic totally for smurf fans,50,122
Movies_and_TV,6302250161,5,positive,this movie is not one that gets forgotten if you have seen it once you might just want to see it again sorry to disappoint the hardcore fans but gargameil is not in this one great movie and cute theme watch as the little blue guys smurf themselves into your heart,48,123
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,I have been playing shakuhachi pipe flutes for about ten years now and am now able to produce tones that sound pretty fair but please be aware that it took months of casual practice before this was so with this style of flute you are essentially making your mouth be the mouthpiece the technique is not unlike getting a tone when blowing into a jug or glass soda bottle your mouth needs to change shape some for each note as well i like this flute and take it with me when I am out and about by itself or in drum and hand instrument circles it sounds quite nice i got applause from the other musicians last time i had a little solo with it this flute can be surprisingly expressive it is also priced such that if something happens to it it is no big deal,143,0
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1,negative,you can not call this an instrument do not waste your money on this a plastic flute sounds better then this just horrible,23,1
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5,positive,great price great value i received it in record time extremely fast shipping would definitely purchase from them again,20,2
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,greatfor students or beginners very playable binding may not be green as shown mine came in ugh pink,20,3
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1,negative,I am not an expert and know very little about the shakuhachi but i did do some research and I am convinced that the utaguchi the place on the instrument where you breathe is too large I have read articles commenting on this that it is common on cheaply built instruments i would compare pictures with the more expensive ones and you can see the difference anyway do plenty of research before you purchase this one,72,4
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,shakuhachi is hard to play but it helps if you have experience with other wind instruments i was making decent tone within 15 minutes and by the end of the evening can play an expressive range across 3 octaves the tuning on this for the low c is good but the minor pentatonic seems a little off as you work your way up the scale and is exacerbated in the higher registers so i think some of the pythagorean intervals could use some work or maybe it is just my western ear but it works i would definitely call it a beginner instrument but the tone is strong and beautiful and definitely musical,113,5
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5,positive,for it is price it is perfect with practice you can make very smooth and clear sound i loved it,18,6
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,the company definitely delivered a high quality product in a speedy manner no fault with the company or product but only with the description this is not an easy instrument to play I am experienced with tin whistles and i could barely get a note out of it a friend with several years of flute experience did a much better job but still struggled to get anything melodic out of it for the cheap price it is worth the risk but not recommended for novices,83,7
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1,negative,it is very difficult to strike a note any note including off-key shrieking on this flute if i had to make a guess the problem is that theone blows air across is not very cleanly cut perhaps it has been damaged by handling but it just does not look very well done i can easily get a turkishto play it is played like a pop bottle the wikipedia article on shakuhachi shows an instrument with a very sharpmade on some sort of inlay the instrument i received clearly lacks this sharp,98,8
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5,positive,good quality shakuhachi i just have not been able to get the sound to work I have heard it is a little tricky but i am close,24,9
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5,positive,the sound of the shakuhachis low mellow sound is very soothing for me i love the sound of the shakuhachi,20,10
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,4,positive,i found this product very helpful when our jug band needs more cowbell it is an interesting addition to a childrens rhythm band also,23,0
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,5,positive,another revenge purchase this goes to my one year old niece and her big sister got a huge drum i love getting back at relatives with the most passive aggressive gifts available,32,1
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,2,negative,poorly made this should not be sold as a party accessory because a child will have great difficulty making any noise with it i had to completely rebuild the clapper to be able to use it at all i would have thrown it in the trash and found another but i was pinched on time sorry for the poor rating but it is just not of selliable quality,66,2
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,1,negative,theof the cowbell is darker than the one on the website it is a deep purple cowbell not a purple pink one after holding it for an hour my hand was tired the handle cutes into your hand the cowbell was not very loud either we will have to buy a different one,54,3

Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,5,positive,i never saw a purple cow but if i ever do these cowbells will be just perfect,20,5
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,2,negative,this is a descent little cowbell although it is very small the metal is very weak and i had to do some modifications using a soldering iron to have it make the sound i was looking for over all do not buy it not even worth the 11 bucks including shipping,50,6
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,1,negative,i wanted a cowbell to call the kids in from outside unfortunately this broke by the second day needless to say i was disappointed but i guess i got what i paid for,33,7
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,1,negative,i guess you get what you pay for i got this to cheer on some runners in a marathon first ringing of the bell it hurt my finger the metal is so thin i was able to bend it to make more of a loop for my finger a short time later i had a blister then the bell does not have a bell knocker inside but a giant paper clip it makes noise but it fell off mine from me ringing it so much so it is a cheap price but beware of the quality,96,8
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,4,positive,i ordered this cow bell for field day at the elementary school where i teach it looks like a cow bell has that authentic cow bell sound and held up an entire day with about 500 different students ringing it it is a functional bell at a good price,48,9
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,5,positive,as described if you want a small purple cowbell,9,10
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,1,negative,very cheap made light weight and the metal cut my knuckles several times,13,11
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,5,positive,needed a purple cow bell for my sons lacrosse games and this one is great nice and loud sturdy too,20,12
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,4,positive,the little swinging part needs to be a little heavier to be an effective bell but for the price it is pretty good,22,13
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,2,negative,the bell on the inside was stuck and we had to take it off and fix it,17,14
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5,positive,this is a great keyboard stand for the price it is very sturdy for my 61-key casio keyboard was easy to put together even without instructions thank you thomas j smith for your tips love that it is very height adjustable and i can screw my keyboard onto it so i do not have to worry about knocking it off like on my previous x stand best part my knees no longer hit into it like they always did on the x stand I am very happy,85,0
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1,negative,this is a very small and unstable stand that could probably work for a very small keyboard no way it would hold an electric piano note the questionable link from amazon reviews for the yamaha p85 i am now waiting to see if emd would get it back without their crazy shipping fees the amazon people who ordered thisalso ordered this is misleading there should be no link between e-piano and this stand,75,1
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4,positive,i am very pleased with the stand it is easy to put together if you follow the pictures on the amazon display for thisit comes with extra screws so do not worry that you left some off my only complaint it adjust up and down bt you can not adjust the with,54,2
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1,negative,from the picture posted here this stand looks sturdy and pink not only was it not pink when we opened it up but it smells of gasoline we have tried putting it together and wiping it down but the smell stayed we were willing to overlook thenot being right but the stand is not sturdy at all and adjusting it comes with hurt fingers not theor quality we thought we were getting best part is when we emailed the seller we were told that the picture was black and we got the right one a two sentence email we would love to return it and get our money back but we are getting a hard time,117,3
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,2,negative,i needed a small keyboard stand but this was too big my keyboard is very short and this stand did not work at all was not great quality eitherwas returned and refunded,33,4
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4,positive,this stand is great if your piano or device is lightweight this stand will not support any equipment over 50 pounds it works great for the piano / synthesizer that i use it additionally comes with screw based attachments that will secure your keyboard to the stand to reduce movement good price good deal,52,5
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5,positive,fits my roland sh201 49 key perfectly sturdy no wobbling z-tytpe stands in general are pretty cheap and break / bend which i knew before i bought this works for me very pleased,31,6
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1,negative,factory defective2 threaded holes for screws were of the wrong size and seems like they were stripped,20,7
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,2,negative,it buckles under the weight of my privia a keyboard known for being extremely lightweight it also wobbles during practice and the parts do not fit together well it feels like it might come apart at any moment I have decided to return it only moments after putting it together,48,8
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5,positive,so dope fast shipment way cooler than a conventional stand,10,9
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1,negative,complete garbage super lightweight not stable inadequate for a kids toy keyboard no instructions for assembly poorly threaded screws not worth shipping to send back garbage,26,10
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,2,negative,there was no instructions oto put it together,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4,positive,it is ok i guess it came in an unmarked box other than the shipping label and some of the cross-beams were bent either on arrival or during manufacturing oh and no instructions honestly i was surprised that everything was there i bought it for my novation impulse 61-key midi keyboard but my keyboard does not come with predrilled holes underneath so i have 2 extra bolts from the stand i do not use just be aware that it is flimsy and it does wobble a bit i think i would have given it a 5-star rating if it was more sturdy,98,12
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5,positive,as the description states this is a lightweight stand i would not recommend it for anything above 30lbs however it is stable with my m-audio 88 keystation,27,13
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1,negative,i hate this stand the cymbal is always tilting to the side or some thing the boom has two grips at the bottom so you can not do alot with it she came in fast but will not last spend 10 more bucks on the others,44,0
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4,positive,i bought two of these stands they look really new but their construction is very basic such as on the boom arm connector there is no spring inside the joint just a wing nut and a screw i have not played seriously with them yet but so far they seem pretty strudy and stable,53,1
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5,positive,i purchased 6 of these stands I am going to get another 6 my drums are played at home so i do not know how much these stand would hold up to real world use but for the money they are really good,40,2
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5,positive,the boom stand is exactly what i expected quality is very good for the money i am happy with my purchase,21,3
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4,positive,it serves the purpose nice for the price i would buy another when i need anotherdo not hesitateit is a nice stand to own,21,4
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5,positive,great stand for the price lightweight compacts really tight and strong enough to hold my cymbal through my intense playing,20,5
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2,negative,i got what i paid for a cheap piece of junk that will break as soon as i put the least bit of pressure on it i just hope that it will hold a small cymbal at all,38,6
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5,positive,this is an excellent product shipping was as always extremely fast assembly was non-existent very heavy duty for the price i thought it would be junk and was pleasantly surprised it could handle a zildjian 22 ride easily due to the dounterweight,42,7
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2,negative,this cymbal stand was an ok replacement it might be alright temporarily for a beginner drummer otherwise i would not really recommend this stand to anyone,26,8
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5,positive,it is absolutely incredible i bought it about a year ago and have never had a problem with the thing it started shaking one time when i first put my new 20 ride but i widened the base of it and now it does not move at all no matter how hard i hit it cheaply made yes sturdy yes buy it now yes,62,9
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1,negative,this is basically the worse cybal stand I have ever used i bought it because of the price and figured what the he shall its cheap turns out this an understatement the wing nut to hold the cymbal on is plastic the stand does not hold the boom arm no matter how hard to you tighten it I have converted it into a straight stand until i can buy a better one save your money for something well built,75,10
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4,positive,I have purchased 3 of these stands I have been very pleased with the stands i use my stands for a home kit that i have i never break them down so i do not know how durable they would be for someone who is playing gigs and constantly breaking them down for a home kit or back up stand for the road they are a great value,65,11
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1,negative,mine snapped within 5 minutes of playing literally broke into pieces i do not play metal it is a piece of crap returned mine for refund the boom part cracked in 2 places it is in the trash the weight at the end is the only part that survived i do not know why it is even on there i have a rack by them I am contemplating returning it or just use gibraltar parts on their rack boom is literally garbage unless mine is faulty i doubt it get what you pay for,88,12
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2,negative,good for cheap cymbals would not put anything expensive on them the metal rod keyholes the cymbals fairly quickly,18,13
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4,positive,this stand is and awesome stand it is very sturdy durable accessible to add attachment not bad in weight for use in travel love this boom stand not to mention easy setup,30,14
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,this product does it is job picks up quite a lot of acoustic sound i bought it for my classical acoustic guitar and tested it with my amp worked like a charm if you are on a budget and are looking for something to get you by meanwhile or just if you do not want to go all out to make your acoustic into an acoustic-electric this is for you love it,69,0
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,i am amazed this works very well for turning my acoustic dulcimer electric it will also pick up drumming reverbs through wood the djembe over-powers the amp but a board or the desk does not,35,1
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,i use this with a korg tuner to clamp to headstocks of my musical instruments it does a great job and is a whole lot cheaper than a replacement for my korg,33,2
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,i bought this to use on my acoustic soprano ukulele with a honywell mini speaker it works great but i wish it had a three feet longer cord,28,3
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,when placed on the sweet spot and out of the way of the pick and without moving around much it works,22,4
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,this littleis amazing for stringed instruments does not pick up any vocal sound which is good for what it is,23,5
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,neat pu to carry in your pocket and have ready if installed pu fails,14,6
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,the product i received broken i lost my money,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,i bought five of these and none of them worked for my schools winter concert,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,very good the cord could have been a little longer,10,9
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,very simple pickup nothing fancy i noticed if you mess with the settings on the amp you can get a nice sound i was safisfied except for the length of the chord I had recomend buying a male to female extension,40,10
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,works suprisingly well even clipped to head of guitar it is very easy to attach and remove it is small size makes it easy to carry in your gig bag or pocket,31,11
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,it dies a wonderful job at picking up my guitar without feedback i like to use it to plug into my computer and record my progress,26,12
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,this is amazing i do not have to buy an electric acoustic just to play with my amp thanks rock on,20,13
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,a page of suggestions for mounting on various styles of guitar would have been helpful otherwise it is an excellent addition to my guitar accessories should the need arrises,29,14
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,2,negative,does not work as expected mainly pick-up low frequencies end of the guitar with very week output the microphone wiring also interferes with the guitar strings,26,15
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,it just does not work i plugged it into both my amps than i tried to use an adapter to use it for rocksmith did not pick up a sound from the instrument at least if anything touches the wire that makes a loud noise do not buy,47,16
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,it works the pickup picks up a nice tone it is kind of hard to clip into the guitar but once you get it it is perfect,25,17
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4,positive,i just go it and it seem to be working on my first test i will have to test it with regular musical instrument to see the real result,29,18
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,the wire was too short so i had to go buy a extension cord other than that it was perfect for what i needed,24,19
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,it literally picks up worse than if you plugged in a pair of earbuds and used them as a mic no kidding try it the cord picks up more sound than the actual microphone it is kind of a feat of engineering to make something this horrible completely worthless,48,20
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,this does not clip well into my guitar it hits the strings or I shall hit it when strumming i do not recommend it,21,21
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,this is a piece of junk fortunately it did not cost much my mistake,13,22
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1,negative,mic has a low frequency hum louder than the sound from the guitar almost impossible to get into the sound hole in the guitar and then is way too close to the strings try the cherub wcp-60 g acoustic guitar pickup instead much longer cord no noise fits in the hole much better,52,23
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,works better than expected fun for special-effects such as clipping it to a wooden tabletop or desk drawer and then thumping the wooden surface with your hand as if it were a drum seems well-constructed the wires have not fallen out yet or anything no problems with it,47,24
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,excellent to use with a tuner so the tuner only listens to one pitch while tuning a string instrument fair price good quality,23,25
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,guitar came with all promised materials although it had some cosmetic damage to the neck of the guitar the seller did stipulate that due to the manufacture process this might occur i do not think it harms the sound quality good guitar for someone just starting out and not worried about the instrument looking perfect,54,0
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i recommend buying this for beginners the guitar design is ok but the sound is awesome i did not recieve a ebook which is ok instead i got this thing which sounds like a kazoo very low price for an awesome guitar,42,1
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,i like the guitar it is is nice cosidering how inexpensive it is but it did not come with an ebook like it claimed instead it came with a pitch pipe,29,2
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,for 20 more i got an acoustic guitar from musicians friend rogue that is much better,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,strings broke the first time i tried to play it,10,4
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,this is proof you get what you pay for the wood it is made of is basically paper thin i feel like if i strum too hard it will shatter I had say only a true beginner who can not spend more than 100 would be ok with this,46,5
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,for a cheap beginner guitar i understand the poor quality but i do not see how anyone can learn to play on this thing the strings do not even make a proper tone and had to be replaced i recommend spending 30 more dollars and getting something a bit better,48,6
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,surprisingly had a vary pretty sound but felt awkward in hands while playing and the neck snapped do to humidity and heat you get what you pay for tho good starter guitar,32,7
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,if you are thinking about buying this guitar do not its not worth it it has no trust bar which means the more you play it the more out of tune it will get i like how it looks looks okay on my wall i guess but if you want to buy a guitar even just to learn on i suggest you spend the 150 and get a really decent guitar you seriously will not regret it and you definitely will not waste your money on a board with strings,85,8
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this guitar has started to break apart and it is not even two years old very very poor quality not good,20,9
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i do not play so maybe I shall learn low low price and great for photo props some people complained about odor i had very little odor odor gone over night again great price and fast delivery,35,10
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,ok the guitar is obviously good for the price but the thing is i clearly ordered the cutaway style and i got the regular style and that 's not cool,29,11
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i bought this at the request of my daughter for her birthday she wanted a starter acoustic guitar because she hoped to learn how to play it this product taught me the value of reading amazon reviews before purchasing anything the guitar itself was scratched and banged up pretty bad when we got it the decorative label on the front is a very cheaply put on sticker with bubbles on it the case is thinvinyl like material that had tears in it and the zipper broke on the second use more importantly this guitar can not be tuned we have had it restrung and i have taken it to three different music shops and they all say the same thing worst guitar they have ever seen you get what you pay for that is for sure,135,12
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,when i opened it i had a trusted friend tune it and the neck immediately started bowing and within the next day the frame cracked not only that but you could see where they would spray painted it black in the heart of it not worth the money even as a beginner spring for a nicer guitar this one would not hold a tune for more than 3 seconds anyway and the case was nothing more than a cheap bag not impressed,80,13
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this guitar was broke right from the box the kneck was broke loose from the body would not recommend this guitar,21,14
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product it did not come with the pitch pipe to tune it it did not come with the strap it did not come with the case it did not come with any extra strings or pics it was supposed to come with all of that i did not complain because amazon is the middle man from what i understand and i had other more important issues to deal with at the time and a big chunk of wood fell out of the guitar as soon as i lifted it out of the box I am not sure if it was a piece to this guitar or from another,107,15
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,chips everywhere the only good thing is came on time would return it but by time i do it will cost me more in the end,26,16

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this product is very small if you wanted to play it or get lessons this would not be theto order spend the extra money on a real guitar,29,18

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,as the previous posters mentioned it has an odor when you first open the box it is a christmas gift so i let it air out in my work office for a week or so no smell now it was just the paint / lacquer overall I am quite pleased several coworkers that are musicians noticed it in my office and looked it over they said the quality was actually quite good especially for the price,73,23
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,good starter guitar for a bigger my teenage son needed a beginner acoustic guitar for guitar class at his high school my husband and i did not want to spend a lot of money and he ending up not liking it we thought this was a good start to see how well he takes care of the guitar before considering an expensive guitar the bag it came with was a huge joke very cheap and very thin within a week of school the zipper on the bag broke my husband fixed it but it happened again as far as i know nothing wrong with the guitars sound,107,24
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,my son is two and loves music this is a sturdy childs guitar that seems like it was built to take a beating which in our house is pretty much guaranteed laughing out loud the only thing i had a slight issue with was the guitar arrived with some chips in the finish but that may have occurred during shipment but it is merely cosmetic damage and like i said it will probably get more within it is lifetime,74,25
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,horrible costumer service my guitar had a problem and they wanted me to pay shipping to send it back it was more then the cost of the guitar bad quality never go back again the guitar is in the trash it was cheaper to throw it out bad experience,51,26
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i expected this to be a cheap guitar i expected it to smell like chemicals as other posters warned i should have read further warnings as i would have saved myself time effort and money this should not even be sold as a guitar maybe as decor i bought this for a little girl who is trying to find her niche and was interested in picking up guitar she could not even get anof whether or not she would enjoy playing since no one could play this thing with every strum it went out of tune every single strum you would play a chord three times and every strum it would be a different note as the crap pegs failed to do their job a kazoo is more of an instrument than this thing what a waste,138,27
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this was a christmas gift for my husband and for the price was any awesome deal it came fast and looked even better than in the picture,27,28
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,okay so the first thing is i received a completely different guitar i received a guitar that buzzes at the frets will not stay in tune and when we tried to tune it the last string broke 3 times the one i was supposed to get was a barcelona according to the images but i got a crescent which is a very cheaply made guitar i smelled chemicals coming off of it you can tell where paint was sprayed on and paint drippings I am sorry but i do not like this guitar i do not think it was worth it i was good at first although,104,29
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this is a classical guitar with steel strings on it does not stay tuned sounds like crap even for the low cost it is not worth it at all,27,30
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,this is a good beginner guitar dislikes the guitar is a little smaller than expected there are minor damages and scratches the delivery was late strap is a little small likes holds a pitch well many replacement strings beautifuland tone very affordable overall a great guitar for the price and would recommend this guitar to start up beginners,59,31
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,it is a nice guitar to start out i got this one for my son and he likes it he has still a bit too small for it but it will work for the time being,34,32
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the strings are to old the 5 fern it came broken so it can not be tune the seller dint contac me so now my son do not have a guitar to practice and i can buy another oneit was a waiste of money,42,33

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i bought this thinking that it would help me get used to high tension strings being a ukulele player i was excited to get one of these guitars sadly after putting on nylon strings then acoustic steel strings the neck of the guitar could not take the tension long story short the guitar broke in half this is a waste of money for people seriously about playing guitar however i did make good use of the spare parts tuners picks strap gig bag strap peg and more,84,36
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,a cutaway is used to gain access to the upper frets any child learning on this guitar will be bale to play bar chords further up the neck that a traditional guitar i thought the finish was good the guitar solid it is an excellent beginners guitar and the cutaway for upper fret access is simply a bonus,58,37
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,poor quality only lasted my kids a couple months wood on guitar is warping an the strings broke requesting refund it is junk,20,38
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,the product is good it is the same guitar that i have only mine is a sky but it appears they are made by the same folks,27,39
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,the body is too lightweight it feels like i could break it with my hands strings are cheap and the tuning screws are cheap and do not hold a tune which is replaceable except i think i might actually bend the neck with real strings and replacing t he tuning screws is too much work to be done on a finished product at least in my opinion bag is not padded at all so it is basically an oversized ziploc,79,40
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,but my daughter will start taking a class in september so then we will find out if is any good,20,41
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,shoddy manufacturing smeared glue and paint and still no response about a refund weeks after i complained about it do not waste your money,24,42

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i ordered two guitars off amazon for my daughters who have been taking lessons a few weeks with passed-down gear we just wanted to get something cheap but serviceable until we were sure they would stick with it this was the second one to arrive it was not even the guitar we ordered came in differentmy oldest daughter decided she liked it better than the one that came for my younger daughter however has a much more discerning ear and found both to have a lousy sound very tinny this model seems to hold it is tune a little better than i would have expected although one of the reasons we bought this is that it was listed for around 20 but was originally 120 so i thought it could not be that bad i was wrong i think the seller exaggerated the original price to make the product look better and then offered it at a discount do not be ripped off do not buy it,164,44
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this guitar is absolutely wonderful i have had it for 6 months and i play it all the time it has excellent sound quality and it is great for beginner guitar players,31,45

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,string broke first day and neck was cracked along with the bottom of the guitar being used for a decorative piece not a well product to learn on,28,51
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,yeah it is not the same shapeor brand as the picture it also will not stay tuned i put new strings on it and that helps the sound but it can not stay tuned,33,52
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the first time i played the guitar the string broke and when i brought it to sam ash to have it fixed they told me i could not do it because it was actually warped probably from being stored in an improper temperature setting i definitely would not recommend this,48,53
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,the guitar needed lots of tuning the first couple days but after that it was good the sound is good and it makes good guitar for my daughter make some noise,31,54
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i hate itit is was a waste of money and i had to go to another store to buy a 10000 one because even my college professor told me that i could not learn guitar with this poorly made one,38,55
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i wanted a cheap guitar to be able to carry around to beaches and overseas without fear of being damaged or stolen this was a bargain so i did not think too much it looks way better than it costsnatural and it sounds very decent i am tuning it using a simple free program it was not available when i was a kid and it sounds great the strings look fine much better and softer than i hoped for plus it comes with two spare strings e and b which is nice it lacks fret markings and the goldenon the frets is already dissipating but who cares the neck is super straight and the wood seems of better quality than i bargained for the bag is made of very thin and weak material that does not look it will survive much travel but then i am not a traveling musician the pitch pipe is useless the stripe looks strong and fine i do not know why would other customers complain about it the shipping and delivery was prompt i am very satisfied definitely more than worth the money,191,56
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,i bought this guitar for my girlfriend for christmas because she wanted to learn guitar the guitar is beautifully designed pros -beautiful guitar awesome price perfect beginner guitar cons -the strings were not on correctly did not come with a gig bag other than those 2 cons everything else about this was good so if you can change the strings and do not mind getting the bag i would suggest this,68,57
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,the sound is amazing the wood is very hard and i like it so much theis very natural,20,58
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i look for a guitar in internet and saw it it is true that it is very cheap but i expected at least functioning i should first find out that was chinese the strings are far from the neck so it is almost impossible to play the sound is bad specially one rope i do not recommend it at all,60,59
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,worth the money good for kid and teens or whom ever want to learn or play the guitar only thing you need is sheet music book just go to youtude and learn how to play,35,60

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,thecame in paint chipped off and scoffs guitar looks good until you look up close the price ok the but the freaken guitars body is up setting i expected something better,33,67
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,this guitar is excellent for beginners the only thing is that when you put it inside the case you have to re-tune it when you take it back out but that is to be expected from a guitar this cheap but i highly recommend it for up and coming guitar players who want to test the waters of this instrument without paying 100 dollars for a good one and then not liking it also another kinda off thing is that the pitch pipe is a little off key how ironic right but you can look on youtube and and follow a tutorial on how to tune your guitar there so it is not a a really big deal also i noticed alot of people complaining about a chemical smell i did not experience that i guess it has to do with theof your guitar or something and also this seller says that they will give you a learning the guitar book but it is not a hard copy it is an email so if it does not show up in the mail with the guitar case just know that it is not a mistake check your email all in all i think it is an excellent guitar for the price,203,68
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,excellent guitar for starters can upgrade if student still interested in practicing but for it is price it is hard to beat construction is good,23,69

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,this package out the box looked great and my 6 ft 14 year old son loved it and the size was perfect he was very excited to get started on his lessons unfortunately at his 2nd lesson of the class we discovered that this was just a toy and not a good guitar to truly learn the art of playing the guitar the instructor stated that the guitar did not have truss holes and therefore would not maintain the correct tune i requested to send it back and only discovered the cost to ship it back was more than half the cost of the guitar 22 return shipment now i am stuck with a guitar that is of no use,119,72
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,i bought this as a gift for my nieces birthday it is a simple guitar perfect for someone just learning my niece likes it and that is what is important,30,73
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,if you want to learn guitar this is not for you this is more of a toy then musical instrument it does not tune at all and is made with a plastic neck also i could not even attach the strap because there was nothing to attach it to do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more money and get a real guitar you buy garbage you get garbage,69,74

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this is a great beginner guitar the price is perfect especially since kids change there hobbies all the time we had ordered a different style than what was delivered and when the company heard about it they responded so quickly and sent out the correct one as soon as possible they were so great to work with and even sent a little extra gift to make up for the error,67,77
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,while i was trying to get this guitar tuned i was informed that it was broken and glued back together and they showed me where it was glued i know this was not really that much money but i would still like you guys and the seller of this product to know that it has changed my looks on this website because of this broken product,65,78
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i understand that you get what you pay for but the frets could still be in the right place it can be tuned openly but many chords sound out of tune because the frets are either too wide or too narrow,41,79
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,despite the delays the seller had with shipping i was suprised that it arrived in tact and not totally destroyed of course it was out of tune and i just got the right tuning yesterday even although the previous tuning was fine like thethough i found it plain so i kinda scribbled on it pretty good quality if your looking for something inexpensive,65,80
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i bought this guitar because i wanted a guitar that i could take with me when i go camping that could break and i would not care what i got was firewood if you try to play it anything from the 9th fret to the 14th fret is just buzz the lifts are made out of styrofoam and the tuning knobs broke after the first attempt of tuning the thing if you are thinking about buying this you are crazy,79,81

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the product picture and description is misleading my 12 year old wanted a acoustic guitar so we made the purchase solely on the picture and description provided by the seller which must be mentioned that it did come in a timely fashion with excitement pride and joy my little one took the 38 black acoustic guitar to the schools music teacher with a request to add dots that resemble the fret board that appeared on his guitar then it was brought to our attention the guitar purchased was a classical guitar based on this product picture and description we really thought we had an 38 black acoustic guitar my 12 year old went from excited to disappointed after the discovery,120,94

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,bought this package for under 25 it is a great way to get your kid started it has everything you need it is not a high end guitar it is what it says a starter once your kid gets really into it you can actually make an investment in a higher quality guitar it arrived in great condition and i have absolutely no complaints yarissa texas,67,113

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,my husband just loves this beautiful guitar he did not even wait for christmas great price for all that you get shipment was great,20,118
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,agreed that for this price we should not expect for a good quality but at least the guitar should be playable for beginners to learn i noticed the following problems which i had to fix it myself when i got my shipment the height of the saddle was to short which resulted in strings touching the neck and frets producing irritating sounds no position markers the vendor provides a belt but there were no hooks on the body to attach with the only thing i liked was it is very light in weight,92,119
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the guitar is improperly built the tuning pegs need to turn too far the neck is barely attached to the body the instrument will not stay in tune long enough to play a chord do not buy this,37,120
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i am so disappointed that my daughter spend her money on thisit was so cheap and had to be thrown away do not waste your money on this,30,121
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,same guitar as the black acoustic beginners but beginners is much cheaper 695 i had order one of each and received the same guitar called the shipper and they advised they were actually the same,35,122
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i wanted an inexpensive beginner guitar for my kids to learn on i did not want to waste money and then find out they have lost interest in guitar unfortunately once this guitar is tuned after strumming it once it goes right out of tune this would be good to purchase as a prop but not to play,57,123
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the first day that my son took his guitar to school the music teacher said it could not be tuned and he needed a new one on a positive note i informed amazon of the problem and my money was refunded within 72 hours,43,124
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,everyone bitchin about how this guitar sucks laughing out loud as soon as i opened the box i expected to smell the bad odor as everyone was complaining about no odor oh and an e-book stands for electronic book you can download it from your email i also tuned this guitar just fine,51,125
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this guitar is only for learning it is very cheaply made but works as a teaching tool i only still have the guitar because the bag was cheap and ripped,29,126
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,so i just got this guitar like a month ago and i can honestly say that i love it it came like 2 days after i ordered it which is excellent the only problems i had with thiswas trying to tune it and trying to figure out how to attach the strap i only had one peg for the strap the smell of the guitar which people say it smelt chemical was actually the smell of the wood when it has some kind of preservative so it will not rot overall i am very pleased with this guitar i really want to play it but one of strings popped so i have to wait to get new ones the end k bye,140,127
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,do not buy this guitar i hate this guitar i bought it and the sound is horrible it also has this bad plastic smell witch will not go away the strings are high off the fret do not waste your money it is so not worth it,44,128
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,the guitar is good for it is price i received what i paid for the guitar sound great as well I am happy with my purchase,24,129
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,this guitar came in pretty quickly and with all the advertised accessories but the guitar itself is a piece of crap it was manufactured in a way that no matter how much you try and tune it it always sounds off save yourself some grief and invest in a more expensive instrument,52,130
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,i was not pleased with this product because it did not come with a cord guide or dot on the instrument for finger placement,24,131
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,we bought this product so my daughter could learn to play not a goodthe guitar is so poorly made that it never got tuned she took it to a guitar place and they told her that it would get untuned as soon as she started playing and so it did the worse 17 i ever spent and i paid 12 in shipping,62,132
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the guitar is awful-it can not be tuned thebetween the guitar and the strings is too big not possible to play barre-spend few extra dollars and buy better guitar you will be able to play,35,133
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,good product and was shipped in a timely fashion the wrong product was shipped to us and there was no problem at all returning the wrongto have it replaced with the correct,35,134
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,the guitar came with all the accessories mentioned in the description and was in new condition however this guitar was made so badly that the frets were in the wrong positions some of them were a few millimeters off meaning that it was impossible to play this guitar without it sounding completely utterly horrible i was not able to play without having earplugs in my ears i did not expect much for such a cheap guitar but you should at least be able to play it this however was painful for my ears invest a couple bucks more,97,135
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,i bought this guitar because it was cheap i did review the reviews about it because i knew a cheap guitar was not going to sound like a great guitar but i thought it would be good enough for what i needed it for my biggest problems with it is that it will not stay in tune also you can not tune it against itself using the fifth fret you have to use a tuner even when you use an electronic tuner it still sounds off now if you have a kid who thinks they want to learn to play the guitar and you do not want to spend the money i say it is worth it if they love it you can always spend more of the big bucks later i bought it because i have some people i work with who might very well put a giant hole in it with no warning for that I am ok with it,156,136
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,the guitar is ok no easy tuner and no e-book as the description how you guys tall about this,22,137
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,a great product for the price i enjoy using it on a daily basis i would recommend this product it is nice for someone who is learning,27,138
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,the guitar came with a strap a pick a set of strings a harmonica a pitch pipe and a gig bag however i got the ebook the guitar itself is a great quality sound-wise the strap is very cheap looking and short which does not surprise me considering the price of the whole set,53,139
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,great guitar for learners and the price is unbelievable also was shipped next day well worth money spent might buy another one for grandson,24,140
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,wanted to order a cheap guitar for my little brother in law to start playing on because he got burned at the pawn shop on an electric guitar he spent his hard earned money on knew this one would be smaller but was not prepared for what i got it looks horrible nothing like the picture almost spray painted looking we already covered it in stickers it does play tho good for a toddler to trash not even worth the money for a beginner any older,85,141
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,i enjoyed the guitar the paint job is for quality there are noticeable paint marks on the guitar and the strap on guitar does it work you only have one clip at the bottom of the guitar for this crap and the other end of other does not have one,49,142
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,was glad to see that it came just two days after ordering when it said it would take a week nothing was broke or missing except for the ebook which i kind of expected from the other reviews the strap is kind of small but i do not plan on using it anyway all in all it is a very good guitar for the price thanks,64,143
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,it is really worth for this price i love the package so i could just start when i received it and the quality is fine,24,144
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,this guitar came with everything as advertised and an extra set of strings the guitar is small-ish but that is perfect for my small hands i got it on sale so with he total being 30 including shipping this guitar i worth well over the asking price and i am very satisfied,51,145
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,received the guitar before the estimated delivery date smelt like spray paint but not too strongly a string was broken already so i went to use the replacement strings and the one needed was far too short contacted the seller and they said they would send me new strings at least the ebook was just some pdf file from a completely free website anyone can download the ebook at any point regardless of guitar purchase [ ] the pdf explains that you now own a guitar and it has strings if you touch the strings it will make noises probably the most informative thing ever guitar is not tuned of course best to have someone else tune it for you as the pitch pipe takes practice to actually use not exactly beginner friendly sounds just fine and feels durable,137,146
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i just absolutely loved this guitar but if you are wanting lessons look here one of the best resources for courses is available at [ ] check out this awesome site for guitar players of any levels to get a href [ ] learn guitar tutorials have fun playing,49,147
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,the guitar was as pictured and described a beginners guitar the ebook took a bit to reach me but i did get it,23,148
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,first the strings was not tuned if u r a beginer how would you know how to tune them the strings r really thin which means they will pop when you do get it tuned i had so manyand downs with this gutair I am a beginner and i could not do nothing with this gutair all my freinds who have these big nice gutairs said this is a crappy gutair ohh it is falls out of tune in maybe a day or two srry but the only reason i got this gutair is because i did not know if i was going to stick with it now that I am advanced this gutair is for 3 year olds,114,149
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i placed order for a christmas delivery for my son he has been very happy with it and is picking up the guitar better than i expected it has been a very good guitar for learning it was delivered before the promise date which was unexpected due to the fact that it was the week before christmas i would definately buy from them again,64,150
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,to get my order i had to mail them so many times finally i got it but no comment because it is just looks like guitar while i was trying to fit it is string no more commentssssssssssssssss sender may know why i never will never buy any thing from amazoncom again,54,151
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,it was great until i actually put the strings on maybe mine was the weakling of the bunch but the neck and bridge broke when i tuned the guitar well when i professional tuned it with the lightest strings on possible,42,152
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,the guitar is great for what it is but i never received the instructional ebook so my granddaughter has not had a full experience with the instrument it came quickly and was packed well,33,153
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,thewas not good like what i thought something wrong with the strings i could not use the,20,154
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,got this for my 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loved it has not had a lot of time to play it yet but my husband who is a guitar player tuned it for him and he started strumming immediately we also got him some cool rock guitar song books so I am sure he will be playing in no time it is nice that it comes with the bag and extra strings because one of the strings broke when my husband was tuning it my husband says it is common for strings to break and it happens all the time when he is playing so this is not a defect or knock on the quality my husband also said that it will sound a little twangy for a little while until the strings are broken in we almost bought a 30 guitar but i am glad we went with the bigger guitar because i think the 30 would have been too small for him and he is not a big child he will be able to play this for much longer than if we had purchased the smaller guitar very good purchase for the price,195,155
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i am realtively new to online shopping and was very pleased with this experience the ease of the transaction the speed of the delivery i shop early and the satisfaction of the product purchased were all outstanding my son was thrilled with his new guitar and happy with everything that came with it hopefully with a proper carrying case we can avoid what happened to his first guitar purchased at an antique shop,73,156
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,decent guitar for a beginner i would suggest changing the strings if you buy this guitar the ones provided are not of good quality with better strings you can get a good sound from it but i experienced some fret buzzing around the 10th and 11th fret on the 6th and 5th but other than that it is something good to buy for a beginner,63,157
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this is a toy guitar no real guitar here awful smell no good termination no ebook either sounds terrible my fingers bleed when playing do not stay tuned carefull when buying this awful product yuk,34,158
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,when the product arrived at first glance looked good all items were not in the shippment and come to find out this is not a real guitar it is a toy guitar do not be fooled on thinken you are getting a good deal it is a waste of your money,47,159
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,i got my guitar and within the first 20 minutes i had broke the e and b strings while tuning it i just thought it was my inexperience so i took it to an experienced guitar player and the g string would not tune and broke while he tried we used the replacement strings to restring the whole guitar and tuned it but the d string still sounds dead and the g string still will not tune and he said he believes it is because the strings are cheap strings and it needs new better quality strings when we were trying to tune it we were using digital tuners not the pitch pipe that came with the guitar like i said the deal is a great one but not perfect the guitar is a good guitar but be prepared to have to buy better strings soon but do not expect top quality all the way around when only paying 20,159,160
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,it arrived just on time and in good condition except that the guitar strings were not tight but it was good because i tightened it myself there was no ebook in it and the guitar had a little marks of dust or paint on it but it was not visible apart from that it was goodthanks,53,161
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,this is not a full size guitar but a good starter one i bought this for my partner and she loves it,22,162
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,theis pretty decent for the price can not complain the case is pretty cheap feeling but overall not bad,20,163
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,I have got this guitar because it is really cheap and i have always been wanting one but i was really disappointed despite the cost of it it seriously look like a toy-guitar rather than a guitar I am just a beginner but the sound of it is really bad you are going to regret not spending a little more money and buying a real guitar,63,164
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this is without a doubt the biggest waste of hard earned that i have ever seen or heard i can not play anything on it have not decided if it is just cheap set of strings or it is just a worthless piece of junk i got it for someone else and imagine my embarrassment when she took it played it and out of it came the most horrible sound quality i have ever heard in my life the smaller jr guitars at walmart for 1200 have a better sound and tone quality again junk just sayin,94,165
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,thisseems to be pretty good for the price my daughter 13 will be using it to take beginning guitar next semester at school her sister has a similarfrom the same company and it is working well so far the only issue i have is the fact that the case had mildew / mold upon arrival i tried to contact the company but they never responded fortunately after washing it by hand and then in the machine i was able to remove the offending substance,85,166
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i expected standard tuning knobs and fret inlays but the guitar i received had folk tuners and no inlays worse than that the guitar is not built properly the open strings can be tuned fine but the frets are not placed correctly and chords are completely out of tune,49,167
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,i got this for my friend for christmas and she absolutely loved it,14,168
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,my son loves his guitar it is very durable,9,169
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,does not stay in tune for more than a day,9,170
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,crap do not even buy this it was bowed and it could not even be played i bought it as a starter guitar for my younger brother because i did not want to spend a lot of money if he did not pick it up it was garbage so he never played it bought him a more expensive one do not waste your money here,60,171
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,excellent pedal i buy it to use as expression pedal for line6m5 and works perfectly for wah whammy volume and other crazy effects you can set the minimum level of each parameter and tension it is very comfortable of rugged construction and pedalboard friendly and i could get it for 80 dollars for me is the perfect expression pedal,60,0
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,I have had this on my gigging board for over a year and I am really pleased with it this replaced my eb vice president jr which broke a string during a gig and in general i much prefer the dvp3 sound-wise i do not notice any difference in the swell rate but what i really like is the ability to adjust feel of the pedal and the added durability of not having a string the rubber tread started slipping off the treadle so i pulled it off and replaced it with grip tape maybe it does not look as cool but it is better than having a piece of rubber flapping around the only other thing I have noticed is that it started to squeak so i put a few drops of tri-flow around the center support of the hinge and it has been silent since after 10 years with various eb volume pedals I am not going back,152,1
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,i bought this from another source at the same time i bought the boss fv-500h from amazon the boss pedal is huge by comparison the dvp3 is a much better size for me it takes up less floor space and is very stable even although they are both essentially the same pedal component wise to me the dvp3 sounded better with less tone suck of the two this one is my favorite for either volume control or expression I am back to buy another,83,2
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,2,negative,the volume change from off to full volume is not very uniform at all for me it functions mostly like an on / off switch you can modify the taper for the expression output but not the volume output also it does not stay heel down by itself so using it to turn the volume completely off is difficult too shame because the pedal build and appearance is good and it looks like it is very sturdy i contacted dunlop about this and no response at all pedal is going in the garbage no more dunlop products for me,96,3
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,i tried a morley wah / volume pedal before this one and did not like it this pedal offers a very smooth action and a lot of travel which the morley pedal did not have it is a passive pedal but i have not noticed any tone loss also the tension / resistance of the pedal can be adjusted the pedal seems to be very solid and well-built and seems like it could take a beating it is on the heavy side which i think is a good thing so it will not be sliding around overall I am very satisfied with this pedal and will buy again,101,4
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,this pedal was great but with very little use failed i used it maybe 40 minutes and gently and it was done i would return it but by the time i used it is was past the return period 105 piece of junk,43,5
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,lasted 10 minutes and broke amazingly cheap build quality,9,6
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,be carefull buying this eventually the pot loose the grip so there s no way to keep the pedal in a stopped position the external adjustable screw does not fix that i opened and dissasembled it and let me tell you no replacements nor fixable parts inside so this pedal takes permanent damage the only replacemet aviable is buying another unit,61,7
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,came basically broken the rocker was not strong enough to hold itself up and it had an ear-piercing squeakiness will not buy this again,24,8
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,immediately lost tension on the internal hinge / pivot shaft and lost cc range foot pad just fllopped around and this is not associated with the external adjustable tension screw this is the 2 smaller allen lock bolts inside the pedal that pinch the main hinge shaft have opened twice to tighten those small allen lock bolts and it keeps happening even after reducing the external tension adjust to a minimum poor design have not even gotten to the frail mag strip this things a dog sad because it has a very comfortable throw and very useful features lighter weight and smaller footprint on the board as well against boss fv too bad,110,9
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,i really like the adjustment for tension feature on this pedal it is constructed well has some weight to it and does not feel cheap at all i would definetely get another one if i needed another pedal,37,10
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,seems to do what it need to do i feel like i want to tighten up the tension a bit as it is really almost too easy to make a change with your foot I have only used it for one show so far but I am sure it will perform as expected,50,11
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,nice and smooth feel works great use it with a kemper,11,12
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,this pedal is awesome i still have not used the exp output control i have a triple flashback tc electronics so I am planning on checking it out but overal a great volumne pedal no power required just plug in and go it also it is pedal-down resistance is adjustable which is one of my fav features along with a tuner outout big props,62,13
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,what i expected after reading reviews decent pedal like the size and feel wish it was not passive,17,14
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,i like this pedal i did have it cut out on me once i like the possibility of using as an expression pedal that is why i bought it over the silver one it is nice and big it is better than the eb jr that douchebag ambient players use be a man and buy this,56,15
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,i bought these for my wife they are defiantly not noise canceling not do they fit in your hear sound quality is average,23,0
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,pros sound was good construction was decent easy to connect charger cable included cons would not stay in my ear had to push them in so hard that it hurt to wear them and they still fell out they allowed a lot of ambient noise pass-through did not provide much background noise attenuation could not connect them properly to my pc maybe a pc driver issue but do not have the time to mess around with it difficult to switch between bluetooth sources had to manually turn one off to connect to the other ie phone and pc,95,1
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,bad experience with these they connected to my phone via bluetooth just fine but any movement caused them to cut in and out i disconnected and reconnected several times but the same result each time upon arrival one of the ear cushions was missing from the package so i had to scrounge up another one from another set of buds the ear pieces would not stay in place and fell out of my ears constantly i tried different sized cushions but it was the design and/or weight that caused the issue can not recommend these at all,96,2
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,i would not purchase these again I have only used them three times and I have experienced problems each time i have static music breaking up even when phone is on my lap and headphones are charged another issue i am having is with the left ear piece the little rubber part which sticks into your ear falls off when not in use i have traded it out with another headphones part but it still seems to not fit i would recommend looking for another brand,84,3
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,in case you only want reviews from people who have actually purchased theI am trying to figure out how to return them never felt the need to do that before one of the reasons that i purchased these headphone was they said they were also for running that is laughable they will not stay in your ears i got so angry at these things that i had to settle down a bit before i wrote this every other set of in ear headphones that i have purchased has has three different cup sizes and i have never had a problem with anything falling out of my ears neither side will stay in i was walking around thei am constructing and the sound went completely away i reached up and both were gone found them about ten feet in back of me maybe if itape them to another pair non-bluetooth,153,4
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,these are not noise canceling the volume is just set at a very high level even at the lowest volume setting on my iphone it is pretty loud i could not raise the volume higher than 25 i had them on for 5 minutes and started to get a headache i like loud music but like the option to lower it to a soft level if needed even the female voice that announces the functions power on power off and more is very loud also the keyboard on my iphone would not function when connected to these earbuds i tested these with my ipad as well same issues with volume and keyboard,112,5
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,worked great when i got it went to recharge it and will not recharge at all,15,6
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,very bad very very bad th worst headphones used,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,the fit is great the price is great but this thing seems to pick up disturbance and drops the signal a little too often listening to music on these speakers reminds me of the days when the cool kids had sony disc players with 5 sec skip protection and had to walk around like ninjas to prevent the music from skipping so long story short it seems to work ok but drops signals a lot also the cable is too long and has a rubberyness to it so it will slightly grip your skin if you turn your head the force of that grip may loosen thefrom your ear so you will have to adjust it often just getting a tie and looping the loose cable will be good enough to prevent this issue I had 100 buy again if the thing did not drop signal so much,148,8
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,they lasted for 8 runs at first songs would skip then it would turn off i thought they were sweatproof apparently they are not,23,9
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,these are extremely uncomfortable in the ear you should look at getting something different,14,10
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,headphones really work great for the price i wear them when i work out and they stay in place,19,11
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,i was not happy when i got this product because i was looking to exchange earbuds to remove ones that were on the device because they were too big i contact the seller it took multiple attempts for them to say they do not have them but the orginal product is avertised with plastic earbuds replacements,55,12
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,they get a clear signal nice sound at first i really struggled to keep them in my ear but then i figured out the rubber piece above the ear-bud is supposed to secure into the upper part of your ear since then a great experience for a low cost,49,13
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,the only earbuds that stay in my ears during my workout I am not too concerned with the quality of the sound but it seems to be pretty good i wish they would give you more of a warning when they need to be charged but other than that i love these,51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,I have been really impressed with this headset I have used these working out cycling and on the bus to work they have good range and excellent battery life they have lasted at least 5 hours in one use which is way more than i would expect,44,15
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,works very good for me the battery charge works for about 3 hours it is nice to work in the gym,20,16
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,i received the headphones without one of the earbud pads they did send a new set to resolve this issue the headset is comfortable and i liked using it the problem i am having with the headphones is that they lose the bluetooth connection even during a call,48,17
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,the best nc bluetooth headphones for the price notice i did not say the best headphones they do not cancel out much noise and the microphone is not as clear as higher end headphones also the range is pretty limited you do not want to be more than 10 feet from your phone or other device otherwise it will drop the connection that being said i would absolutely purchase these again they are good deal i have a very nice bose pair for flights with a lot of background noise and then this cheap pair for exercising and at the office,97,18
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,headphones stopped working after 40 days which is 10 days after the return policy extremely frustrated would have been decent headphones for the price if they still worked i guess that is why they are cheap,35,19
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,the device will not hold a charge also the proctor is too bulky it keeps falling out of ears with movement,21,20
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,worked great at first but thrn got caught in the rain while running lost volume and none of the controls worked put it into a bag of rice in the sun and controls came back but now every time i sweat too much on a long run the controls on the chord short out and stop working can not even turn them off,61,21
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,no bass the sound quality is poor the fit is uncomfortable i can turn the volume up to maximum and still no bass,23,22
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,i realize they are designed a little different from other bluetooth earbuds but these just barely work the sound is good although my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and i can not type anything with them connected they do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help overall i would not recommend them unless you want this very particular style they are just too awkward but are ok for cheap bluetooth earbuds if want better ones I had spend the little be extra to go aup which i plan to do when i can,124,23
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,yes the included ear tips are too big for my ears no these are not audiophile quality fit was improved dramatically after spending about 10 seconds to remove the included tips and replace with some spares i had from another older pair of earphones 15 seconds back in ears and problem solved sound quality is certainly adequate i have not been able to get a tight enough seal to really drown out other sounds and get the deep bass of a good set of in-ear monitors but for walking around cord-free the sound is far better than some I have owned over the years and i have no complaints a few years ago you would have had to spend significant for this sound quality in a cordless headphone for less than 20 they are fantastic i can not comment yet on battery life as they have not died yet after probably about 4 hours of use over a few days pairing is a bit of a pain works fine with my iphone but my laptop seems to think it is a keyboard although it still works,183,24
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,i tried it the earphone buds they give you are pretty crappy so you will have to get new ones the batter life is crap so you will have to buy something else eventually or just do not plan on it replacing your current crappy device I am staring at mine right now just sitting there waiting to be thrown away i should not be biased at first it was great i plug them in charged them up almost wrote a great review but now i see them beeping that they have low power 20 times every 5 10 seconds during my music at the gym telling me in some phony voice about battery low it is great when they say power on and power off since it is helpful to know but it is like shut up i hear you the battery is low just be quiet and let me hear my music or my phone call but then they shut off so if you want to keep the battery at full forever then great but if they are used for backup or when you need them headphones buy new earbud covers and have an extra charger cord ready for i dunno whenever you need them battery life is not very good hope that helps,205,25
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,good sound really easy to pair with the iphone 6 sometimes has issues with the volume level although it might be with my phone sometimes the volume is really quiet then i get a text message and it goes to really loud but it does not happen much and I am very happy overall with the headphone comfort and sound,58,26
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,does not stay in your ear uncomfortable and painful to wear sound quality is okay,15,27
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,this is perfect for running and i mean it it perfect it changes my keyboards i do not see predictive words when typing when paired with my phone galaxy s5 after i disconnect it everything goes back to normal i love this wireless headphone bluetooth,45,28
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,wore these on an approximately 3 hour trip on my harley was not uncomfortable and i could hear them just fine over my bike at 70 mph,26,29
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,for the price these are certainly a great deal the sound is clear the reception is good and the noise cancelling is good enough that i was able to hear my music clearly even riding on a motorbike on the highway my only complaint is that they do not stay in my ears they come with multiple earbud sizes and I have tried them all but even the one that fits the best still tends to fall out a little too often but again for the price i can not complain,89,30
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,disappointed it is fine if i stay in the same room but do not go to the next room at this price although what else should i expect you get what you pay for as the old saying goes,37,31
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,awful they fall out constantly and are huge,8,32
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,pros bluetooth setup quick and easy uses standard micro usb cable for charging included cons comes with only one set of earpieces so if they are not a good fit for you you are out of luck sound is mediocre at best volume control is flakey inconsistent they work sometimes but usually do not charging port cover is flimsy and tough to open with a fingernail even with the earpiece fully in your ear the rest of the earphone body sticks out of your ear by nearly an inch i think this is primarily why they will not stay in your ears too much leverage would not recommend poor ergonomics very low quality even for 20,117,33
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,so far these earphones arnt the best their kinda bulky and it is not a clear sound at all the base is not great either also they kinda hurt you are ears after a while but i mean 20 is kinda a lot but i would have rather invested in a better pair anyways good luck,53,34
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,product is garbage for a product that you are supposed to be able to run in i could not even turn my head without falling from position i never write reviews but this was so bad i had to do not get caught up in price thought i was getting good deal at 20 they are not worth 20 cents,57,35
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,this earphones are the best i just got them today and if the earbuds are to big you can change them,21,36
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,good for listening to music not good for watching videos or movies do to delay,15,37
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,you get what you pay for cheap quality sound does not get very loud and they slip out of the ears easily when working out,24,38
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,i use them riding my bicycle they cut out every time i turn my head,15,39
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,sound great especially for being bluetooth super affordable for workout earphones they stayed in pretty well when i ran but it was a bit bulky on the actual earbuds overall it is a great set of headphones as a backup and for doing activities i will definitely be looking into more bluetooth headphones that would look nicer for more business-like events i love these although i also received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review,78,40
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,these earbuds are pretty comfortable to wear they are very stable in my ears and does not fall out by themselves pairing it through bluetooth was easy and i did not encounter any problems the design of these earbuds are similar to a lot of other bluetooth earbuds i really like the little droplet design the added to them but thescheme is a bit dull for me sound quality on these earbuds are pretty good i do not expect them to be the best since they are bluetooth but these are pretty do able overall pretty good bluetooth headphones i received this in exchange for a honest review,106,41
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,great deal for the price i get about 45hrs of music listening charge,14,42

Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1,negative,i bought 2 of these for purposes of skype when gaming microphone 1 was basically dead on arrival would only record the faintest of sound no matter how close i was to microphone or how loud i spoke i spent waaay too much time trying to troubleshoot the problem including double-checking sound card drivers and more before just trying microphone 2 well did not i feel dumb when 2 worked just fine anyway my results with a very limited sample size is equivalent to a coin flip 2 bought i dead 1 works fine 50/50 not good enough for me i would not recommend this product as a side-note i paid for next day shipping on these it took7 days to deliver them to me they changed their delivery date 4 times what a waste not amazons fault i live 9 miles from the biggest socal amazon distribution center,148,1
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4,positive,i ended up returning this microphone although it was easy to use and good quality i bought it to add voiceover to videos but i did not hear much difference in quality between using this microphone and just using an app on my iphone,43,2

Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,love this phone if only the caller identification would work it worked fine on day 1 day 2 worked on and off day 3 caller identification not working tried moving the phone to different outlets removing the batteries and putting them back in tried new wire and more the phone works great otherwise loved the caller identification when it was working much larger than most and easy to read oh well,67,0
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason and more this is one of the few corded phones with caller identification and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless and more also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house,99,1
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,i love this phone have three of them easy to read simple to use can see caller identification easily have two on desks one on the wall they have worked for 9 months now,34,2
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling it lasted 5 months you can not get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail buy a nwb phone at your own risk i had to buy another phone at t and it works fine,54,3
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,it is a good phone that does what i need it to do nothing to fancy but just enough for what i needed,22,4
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,this matches the phone i had on my wall all i had to do was use the same hanging bracket hang the phone and go i did not have to remove wall bracket plaster wall and paint,36,5
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is a good phone that works well the thing to be aware of is the feature buttons like ringer on are all on top if you put the phone on the wall you can not see the buttons and what they are meant for i use the ringer on / off button a lot and i had to write with a marker on the front of the phone where the ringer button is,71,6
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,to me this phone needs to be off the market i have had more problems with each phone i recieved,20,7
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is my second easytouch ii i like the easy to read caller identification with option to call back once the identification is in the memory large easy to use buttons and speaker feature so i do not have to pick up the receiver if I am working on my pc,49,8
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,phone did not work at all first of all the seller did not send the ac adapter i had to order it then when it came the phone did not work at all the only thing that worked was the caller identification and that is the only reason why i gave it 1 star,54,9
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,easy to set up and works fine would buy again recommended to several of my friends especially those with hearing problems,22,10
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,i bought this so i could have a hard line for a storm i also bought it for the speaker phone and it is terrible this is a great phone if you do not mind holding it up to your ear but for the speaker phone it is horrible,48,11
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well although for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter 120vac to 6v 100ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 aa batteries it does not this one takes 4 aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for thei am sending it back,187,12
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone is very good for the price i bought this phone for someone else this is the 2nd time I have bought this phone the first time i bought this phone it was 3999 in staples everyone should have a corded phone as a back up if the power fails or power failure in your home the manufacture has this phone listed as white but the phone is a beige that is the only fault I have found with this phone,79,13
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone has no mute button which made it absolutely useless for the application intended i would not recommend if you need this option otherwise the phone was very nice,30,14
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,phone works fine i like the one touch memory buttons they would be better if there was more room to put name on each button,25,15
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,somehow i had the impression that the phone had a message waiting led indicator but what they do not tell you is that the same led is used to indicate missed calls which to me makes the led totally worthless the phone i had before used the same light but it flashed green for missed calls and flashed red if there was a message waiting this phone makes no distinction between the two i had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated i never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting issue because for stuffing the phone back into the box,118,16
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,after shopping around for a standard phone with callerid and no answering machine no power outlet nearby i came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced i like the look and feel of the phone the buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good however when the unit is wall mounted the lcd display is angled down and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it of course that depends on how high your phone jack is and how tall you are i bought two of these phones and both locations i put them were too low to see without crouching down the other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well i do not know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference i could not try that because the unit did not come with an ac adapter plus i have no power outlet close enough to reach so i had to take both phones down and put our 15 year old ones back up,191,17
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,i actually like the phone quite a bit it works pretty well in almost every regard sound quality is very good buttons are easy to find and use and the feature set is pretty good overall a nice phone and a good value however thisis advertised as having 20 number memory which is 10 one touch and 10 two touch i have not been able to get the two touch feature to work i tried calling the customer support number i could never get an answer i was always put on a queue waited for a couple of minutes and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call i left messages and never got a call back i twice tried recalling immediately after getting booted i tried for an hour no joy do not buy northwestern bell phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong,149,18
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,this is a real lemon the volume does not work properly and distorts the sound the touchtone keys stick even although i have had this phone less than 6 months i would like my money back,36,19
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was ripped off by amazons splitting shipping charges after i had ordered the tiesm as a group i was charged 3 shipping charges for 1 mechanical pencil and 2 orders ofrefills total value of product 1035 total shipping 2003 1 pencil 775 s h 505 190 s h 998 2 leads 170 s h 600 outrageous when i tried to cancel the order after it had been split up i was told it was too late never again,81,0
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the product was excactly as described the seller shipped the product promptly i would buy this product again and i would buy from this vendor again,26,1
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,thedoes erase well if you use fine quality paper it does not erase well on cheap paper i suggest if you are using these to sketch you use moleskine sketchbooks which use a heavier paper than most brands i use thisa lot and i mean a lot when i sketch it is helpful when i am laying down a foundation for character work in my sketchbook now that i own it i can not see myself not using it i can not believe more brands are not mimicking thislead thing i was able to find blue pentellon another site i wish amazon carried it,110,2
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis nice but thedoes not write dark enough nor does it erase easily,16,3
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,hard to draw with since it keeps breaking just stick with yourpencils kitties,15,4
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was expecting this to be exactly like the blackrefills only in red unfortunately it is not the same quality as the blackrefills and breaks very easily i found the constant breaking frustrating and gave up using it i would not buy this product again,48,5
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i disliked this product because it does not erase completely and it is pointless since i wanted to use this in my math class,22,6
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,received the wrongi received 07 mm instead of 05 mm,10,7
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the kids were so tickled especially our youngest to get this product they really love theof havingthat is ait works well but the novelty effect for children is even better than the product itself,39,8
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thisis uselessit snaps way too easily and it is impossible to erase do not waste your money,17,9
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i mean i got what i asked for when i bought red pencili got red pencili did not however expect such weak quality it is difficult to use for what i intended it for I am disappointed i can not apply too much pressure or it will snap which means i do not get as strong aas i was hoping for,62,10
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,easy broken colour is light and broke easily,8,11
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks at any pressure applied to the paper,8,12
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,neatbutis so soft i could not write with it at all it kept breaking thewas not very dark either great service although,26,13
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i write a lot with thisit is impossible it breaks all the time do not waste your time or money if you find a solid 05lead please let me know otherwise you jump to 07 and then 2,42,14
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,no smog on paper note make sure you have a good eraser although or be proficient in an adobe ps,20,15
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,use thiswith my pentel graphgear 1000 drafting pencil to mark up plans,14,16
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i tried thisabout 15 years ago and it was terrible i tried it again recently and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be firstly theis very light inyou can barely see it when writing on white paper it is really more of a light pink than a red as well secondly theis very brittle it breaks constantly even when writing with a light touch i can barely write a few lines without a breakage given this fact i do not think thisis useful for anything more than making check marks on papers i certainly can not do any serious writing with it lastly it feels very strange to write with it granted it is not a graphitethe feel is still unusual like trying to write with something made of wax if thiswere not so brittle and light init might be worthwhile but alas i simply can not use it,170,17
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,just got it today so i decided to try it out first off i bought this to sketch with i see many reviews on this product saying it breaks too easily from what i can tell it does not break that easily as far as the lines on paper i can sort of compare it to colored pencil like but not necessarily overall i like this product and i am very glad i bought it,74,18
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,very cheap breaks easily dony bother putting it in through the tip because it shall peel and erases terribly do not waste your money,22,19
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,it is really nice being able to use a fine point mechanical pencil to mark up blueprints all although they do not erase well at all,25,20
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks constantly so much so that is it not useable,9,21
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i use them for design drawing markups red-pencils are bolder so i keep those handy these allow me to make finer detailed notations it is true that theis softer than black leads but as long as you are gentle enough they work just fine i put a red-band of fingernail polish on my pencil so that i know which one has the red leads in it,66,22
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,breaks at the slightest pressure poor quality,8,23
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,not brightnot good for writing at all eraser can not remove this pencil so it is pretty much the same as ball-point pen not what i expected,27,24
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,thebreaks very easily however I am able to get a good range of values for sketching and it is really fun to use coloreddefinitely pick it up for the price of it,34,25
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,we use these in our inspection pencils and they are just what you expect,14,26
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,there is no such thing as redour pencilis actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon cc this is actually very thin wax the same kind found inpencils i love this it pairs off with the 5 steadler pencil i received as a gift nicely it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact you must be soft with it and use many layers one thing i learned is that you should only use about 1 mm or 2 mm ofat a time coming out of the pencil I have attached some photos of my doodles i do at work while combing thiswith graphite and sumi ink respectively,126,27
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,they break fairly easily but that is no indication of poor quality it is just the nature of coloredgo with 07 mm for colored leads it is much more durable,29,28
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,too fragile press hard enough to see the writing and they break,12,29
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,use these a lot for sketching very smooth and easy to use,12,30
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,thebreaks easily when using a steel mechanical pencil only use in a plastic one if you do not want it to break every stroke,25,31
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,good product but breaks easily going back to regular red pencils,11,32
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,these break if you even look at them,8,33
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,it is cool that it is mechanical and red it makes ticking work easy thebreaks so often although it is barely worth even trying,26,34
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,this is basically just led removed from a colored pencil and coined for writing works very poorly less effective than simply writing with a colored pencil to begin with,29,35
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,i work as an intern for a construction company and to make corrections to drawings we use red pencil and this works perfectly in my pentel 1000 graphgear pencil however if too much force is used while writing thetends to break quite often other than that this stuff works great,52,36
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks it is not a dark red and can be hard to see if not using on white paper it does not erase easily but you can erase it if you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light inand fragile than this is your pick i can not really say i have tried others,71,37
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i homeschool and was going through red pens like mad decided a pencil would be cheaper and work better so ordered these they work fine but the next time I shall probably try to get them for my 09 pencil the 05requires that you write lightly and to get red pencils to really show on students papers you have to press a little harder than normal,67,38
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,this product is exactly what i ordered and it arrived quickly thebreaks easily but is expected out of red 05 mm,23,39
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft and will break on a regular basis theis very light if you try to reduce the amount of pressure you use,28,40
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,like most i wanted to have a second mech pencil with redfor markup i do not know how hard some reviewers stroke is but these work fine for me with no breakage yet even pressing hard however they are more waxy than blackso when pressing hard they do wear quickly and they do erase but not nearly as readily as normal blackas tothese are red not pantone whatever maybe they are a shade of pink but they are red as distinguishable from black which is all i think they are meant to be,101,41
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i am a teacher and was hoping to use these for grading since i prefer writing with a pencil these did not work out at all for me thebreaks every few minutes annoying i will try a thicker gauge,41,42
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i can certainly would like use good colored auto pencils to underline my bible and supplement my drawing pads but i found this redto be a little light when drawing and i had to press harder so i like the concept but please make something with more ease of drawing and deeper,55,43
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thewas not red but a light pink thewas hard and scratchy i could neot even see the lines unless i used heavy pressure,27,44
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,took kind of a while to arrive it is a fine pentel product some people has complained it breaks easily and it does break easier than regularbut I am sure it is difficult to make coloredas hard as regular i press really hard when i write so i just had to be mindful and it was fine,58,45
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,if you have to red line or correct tests homework or mechanical drawings this is what you want to use it produces a fine accurate line for any 05 mm mechanical pencil once your peers see your handiwork they will all be asking you for a piece of red led for their correcting pencil it can not be erased like a pen so it is pretty much tamper proof red marking,68,46
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i bought the redfor correcting papers but it has proven useless theis very soft and crumbles easily while writing the crumbling is especially a pain when revising papers because i think i tend to press harder while correcting small detailed text features also theis too light and compared to regularthere is no advantage it also does not erase so clearly i wish i had not bought this especially so much of it,79,47
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft if you push out more than a millimeter it breaks i find i can not use thiswithout feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper if you advance it any further thebreaks very disappointing product,44,48
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5,positive,love this phone it is great quality heavy and precise you will get tons of compliments and if it is a gift they will love it,24,0
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4,positive,i am happy with this purchase what a cute retro phone i am a bit diappointed in the background noise slight static slight buzzing when talking on this phone the noise is not loud enough to ruin a conversation,39,1
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2,negative,i bought this phone for my retro-basment it worked about 6 - 9 months and then stopped i replaced the cord with no avail i paid 60 for it it is a piece of junk however it does look good,38,2
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2,negative,i bought the crosley phone and the crosley wall phone they look good and i like the ring but they are cumbersome to use for phone calls and the sound quality is terrible these phones are good for nostalgia and looks not for use,44,3
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5,positive,this was just what my grandson wanted for his birthday and he loved it it looks like the old phones but with a shiny chrome finish just like the picture it worked well,33,4
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5,positive,i think i had written a review saying that my phone had stopped working but i was wrong my phone still works i love this phone it is really pretty,29,5
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4,positive,this phone is sooo cool our kids think it is super cool and it is a nice land line phone to sit out the ringer is not that loud sometimes you can hear a little echo all in all i would recommend it can not believe it costs this much although,49,6
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4,positive,good value looks just right from the photos ringer is very period but not loud and jarring would buy again,20,7
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4,positive,i liked the phone enough that i am buying my second and why do i need a second you ask well that is because the cradle holding the phone and serves as the line on / off mechanism just broke without doing anything to it the cradle fell apart because the plastic yes plastic piece rod connecting the cradle to the phones interior decided to snap off all by it is lonesome so while the exterior appears quite sturdy the interior does not seem to have the same apparent durability that being said I am buying another one because this one lasted about 5 years there are not any other really nice phones stylistically speaking and it did serve well while it lasted i would like a longer cord but i do not think that is available,128,8
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2,negative,this was more or less what i expected the brushed chrome looking surface came slightly scratched in a couple of places a fingerprint magnet of course but works well and looks good my one real complaint is that while the sound is loud enough on voice calls i wish there were a way to jack the sound up slightly update failed after a little over one year buttons simply stopped working very odd and it is now useless,77,9
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2,negative,was very excited to find a replica of an old fashion phone when i rceived the first one it did not work returned for a second if I had not been so worried that the first did not work i would have noticed how cheaply made it was and how fake looking the brushed chrome finish looked sent the second back also would not recommend,64,10
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5,positive,my cousin asked for this as a wedding gift i have one in my home too and like it very much the service was fast and accurate,27,11
Office_Products,B000238C2S,1,negative,the phone is terrible it lasted one week and broke i would tell anyone not to but it go elsewhere,20,12
Office_Products,B000238C2S,1,negative,theis not solid metal it is plastic with chrome finishing for it is price i would expect a better qualitymade in the united states and not in china ringer does not sound as loud as a vintage phone would ring do not buy it it is a waste of money,50,13
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,they look good and they are relatively thick unfortunately they are extremely flimsy further the adhesive squares included for hanging them did not stick to the cork panels unfortunately they did continue sticking to my walls once the cork panels fell off now all i have is a bunch of broken cork panels they broke when they fell and numerous adhesive squares i have to pry / scrape / steam off my wall might have worked better if I had hammered them in place too late now i do not recommend this,86,0
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,when these arrived they were moldy smelling and crumbled apart waste of money,13,1
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,so these get very mixed reviews but there has a simple way to make them great i noticed another reviewer suggested using mod podge to seal them before use do it just get the matte version gloss does not look good and get your own mounting tape what comes with them is not great but the best part of these is the unique look and thickness of the tiles they are much thicker than others i did something a little different after i used the mod podge i drilled into the cork and hung them on door / wreath hangers see picture works fantastic i really really like these tiles,104,2
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,great boards but tape that comes with it does not work well buy your own tape for wall hanging,18,3
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,this product comes with adhesive strips to hold them in place i would have preferred that the adhesive had bee a bit more substantial there was enough double sided tape to put a 1 x 1 patch of tape on each corner more would have been better,47,4
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,redid my wall with these tiles and it looks great the old tiles were falling apart,16,5
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,a lot came damaged or uneven some squares were off almost an inch so they could not be used,18,6
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,the cork in the two different packages did not match and it was impossible to stick this to the wall a disaster,22,7
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love thebut sticky wall tabs do not keep boards mounted i needed to nail them on,18,8
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,horrible product the first thing i noticed when opening the package was a strong horrible chemical smell i thought it would subside after airing out but after a week it never did the dye on the boards comes off easily and the material is very crumbly,46,9
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,using for bulletin board on the side of my stainless steel frig i had to ditch the magnets works well,20,10
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,we received two sets of these cork boards the second set was clearly a return two of the tiles had stickies on the back making them stick together and break and one actually had a thumb tack stuck in it completely unusable i would like a replacement sent as soon as possible thank you,51,11
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,this board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles 4-pack 82va-4 this corkboard is wonderful i did not use the stickies that came with it i actually attached it to an old window it turned out great you have to use something like scissors to cut it heavy duty ones not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that so i used a pair of tin snips it worked great cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes but the kicker is i used gorilla glue the one where you dampen one of the surfaces i dampened the cork it worked beautifully and now i have a really cool bulletin board for my new office adding to the industrial chic decor already there love love love,139,12
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i love these cork tiles the darklooks great on my light walls and i like how thick they are compared to other corkboards i have tried in the past i put them on the walls around my desk at home to hold pictures / papers i used the enclosed sticky back tabs to put them up in sept 2013 and they are holding strong never had an issue with them coming off i also used an exacto knife to cut them to the size i wanted highly recommend,89,13
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the board did not stick to the tape provided maybe i used the wrong side,15,14
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i really do not like these they crumble and they are all very different tones so they do not create a seamless wall,21,15
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,we ordered a six sets of these for a clients home office and used the sticky foam the came with the items to install we wiped down the wall and then applied the cork to ensure the best stick after being up for just a week the client reported that literally every single piece had fallen down she tried repeatedly to re-stick them and finally used a few heavy duty command strips which finally worked for a few we unfortunately bought these a couple months before installing them and so we can no longer return them I have used these types of cork boards before with little trouble but this was just plain embarrassing we now are having to refund our client and install traditionally framed cork boards instead beware when buying this product that the sticky pads are not great quality and a huge hassle to work what the heck and apparently do not stick to all wall types,156,16
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,very nice i use them on my wall by my desk and on the fridge,15,17
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,when i received the cork squares i mounted them they did not stick well and fell off the surface when i tried to work with them to resecure they fell apart and breaking,32,18
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,cork tiles are great however the sticky tabs do not hold the cork side they stuck to the wall but the cork side is not holding,26,19
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i can see how these could potentially break apart they look pretty fragile but as i was covering these with fabric attached with spray adhesive they are just perfect for my new corkboard i especially love that they are 1/4 inch thick thicker than most cork tiles i found on amazon because most push pins are 1/4 long and i did not want to poke through to the wall,68,20
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i bought these to cover with fabric when they arrived one was already torn most of the way across they seemed to crumble as i worked with them and there was a big mess on the floor when i was done I have worked with other cork tiles before and did not have this problem,54,21
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love these i have put them up in my office the best part they smell like smoked brisket laughing out loud,19,22
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,bigger than i expected using to bring more life into a room,12,23
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,they are nice cork boards but have a strong oder to them like liquid smoke i hope it wears off quickly if it does not it will be the first purchase from amazoncom that i throw away three days later and two nights of feeling sick from the oder even after spraying them with a vinegar water mix that was suppose to help i had to throw them away plus i now have to go buy something to repair the wall from hanging them with the stickies they come with what a waste of money bummed,95,24
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,as many of the other recent reviewers stated this is too crumbly to be useful they are also thicker than other cork tiles on this site so i thought furniture tacks would work to put them up but they were too thick i tried nailing them in which is when the office became a gross cork fest waste of money and it is a shame they are really cute in the trash they go,73,25
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these do not stick no matter how many sticky squares i use the boards also crumble easily and they smell bad i wanted to hang these on the inside of my pantry cabinet door and they have been a useless disaster if i had the packaging still I had return them,50,26
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,unfortunately these arrived moldy under the plastic wrapping i had to return them re-purchased a similar product at the hardware store instead which cost me a bit more but they work fine this kind of cork can have a pretty strong smell although be forewarned i kind of like it but not everyone will,54,27
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,they are a greatfor my espresso wood in the office however they are a little messy they leave crumbs if you touch the side i think it is due to how big the pieces of cork are not a huge deal once they are put up if you do not take things on and off much,54,28
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,have not yet put them up but they look like exactly what i wanted,14,29
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,first off i was excited at the possibilities of making my own design on my wall with these cork boards that is where the excitement ended first off they smell terrible I have washed my hands twice after hanging them and my hands still smell bad I am hoping my room does not continue to smell otherwise I am going to have to remove them completely i ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles i could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke they are very fragile do not hold them on the corners simple gravity will make them snap in half i accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble the other one i held in the middle and it still broke in half they also bring a ton of cork dust when assembling simply put they are very poorly made,148,30
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love the boards but the stick tabs do not hold these up i had to put nails in each one,20,31
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,we purchased these to protect the wall behind our dart board they work fine for this purpose however if you were going to use for posting things on a bulletin board they may not stand up to everyday use,39,32
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i applied to a regular eggshell paint finish and the tiles fell off of course i did not buy heavy duty tape the whole thing just went straight into the trash and i have some of the tape still stuck on my walls,42,33
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the cork crumbles it is pretty messy does not completely fall apart but chips easily very flimsy too,16,34
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i am making several different things and gluing these to them then using left over to make a cork board,20,35
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,look good but do not stay stuck to wall and crumble apart easy,12,36
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i ordered this product to create usable space on an indoor window not subject to temperature changes the pieces were difficult to make a clean cut even with a new blade in the mat knife and within 48 hours after applying the cork squares they began to fall off of their adhesive attachment tape leaving squares of very difficult to remove white tape a real pain in the at,69,37
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,love the board and the price for the pack but the sticky backs that come with it do not work for beans,21,38
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,did the whole ceiling in my office with these now it looks good smells good and is much quieter,18,39
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,very poor quality and very crumbly we could not use them in our office big disappointment,16,40
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i have to rewrite my review i gave this product more stars in the beginning the sticky pieces wldnt work so i tried gluing the adhesive to the back of the boards i used two sets and put all 8 pieces together within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose the cork started breaking in half and my childrens artwork fell while i was gone i had caught it a couple times when i was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times i wld not recommended this product the cork is not thick enough and even adding 3 m adhesives did not keep it on the wall waste of my money i will have to purchase something else,128,41
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these boards are extremely difficult to hang i have tried several different types of hanging / mounting strips and nothing works in addition the mounting strips have stripped paint off my walls i am not even posting anything heavy just my childs artwork these have created a much bigger headache for me than they were worth,54,42
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,provided tape does not holdto the wall used command strips instead crumbles very easily,16,43
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,terrible cheap and they were all on the floor the next day,12,44
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,poor quality cork board if it is not already broken upon arrival it will be once you try hanging with the adhesive pads that the cork comes right off of walking into my office the morning after hanging them i discovered all but one had peeled away from the supplied adhesive strips the last one was about to fall and two of the other three no had large chunks broken off due to impact with the floor do not waste your time patience or money on this product,86,45
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these are terrible bought them to go behind an electronic dart board game greatbut after putting them up the next day they had all fallen from the wall and broken double-sided tape did not hold up on clean / painted wall also the boards were covered in what appeared to be some sort of white mildew inside the shrink-wrap terrible product do not do it,64,46
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,bought these to go under plants on side tables in order to protect the wood perfect for that purpose thin enough to cut easily and dark enough not to stand out on my dark wood tables,36,47
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i do agree that these are a bit crumbly but if you are careful with them it is not really that big a deal it is simply a side effect of the material they are made of they left a few crumbs out of the package but now that they are on the wall i do not see any problem and they look very rich with the darker colouring as opposed to the usual more bland corkboard squares you can buy i also did not use the adhesive that was in the packet with the squares i used command strips instead both because I am in a rental flat and also because i just wanted to give the cork squares a solid foundation they look great I had buy them again,124,48
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,horrible crumbles with the slightest touch spent nearly 100 for 24 tiles and now have to replace with another product would rate lower if possible,25,49
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,if i could rate these 20 i would i ended up just throwing them away i opened my package and they started falling apart on me i literally had cork all over the place after taking them out of the plastic i did not want something that was going to disintegrate horrible product do not waste your money,56,50
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,these pretty much starting falling apart as soon as i unwrapped them and they left a mess on my kitchen table they are not exactly what i was expecting and probably will not work for what i wanted to use them for which is an aesthetic protective covering for a coffee table i will likely shop around for something mre suitable,59,51
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the cork boards are fine but the tape to attach them was old and dried out,16,52
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,adhesive stuck to the wall just fine but not to the actual cork and they kept falling off the wall and broke into pieces,24,53
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,you are going to need some super glue to really get the stickers to stick to the cork board once you do that these boards will stick to the wall just fine if you do not use glue the double sided tape that comes with it will not stick to the cork board not for long at least,56,54
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,unfortunately these cork tiles crumble at any touch very messy and unable to be used as a bulletin board you only end up with cork dust,26,55
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i was skeptical about ordering these after reading other reviews i should have listened to what i read these are horrible quality just taking them out of the wrapping they completely fell apart i hung a few of the tiles and every time i pin something to them brown cork dust falls everywhere just disgusting and completely not worth the price do not order these,65,56
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,order one batch of 4 like them then ordered 2 more for a total of 12 individual boards the first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch so i just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional the 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum i bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1 squares of double sided tape per board any less and the board may still stick to the wall but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration the additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards the boards themselves are very nice and do look very nice too so it still gets 4 stars for that but loses a star for the lack of proper mounting material,199,57
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,would not recommend right out of the package this was a crumbly mess i wanted that cool look of spacing cork tiles out for pinning and more not the right thing for that i have it stuffed up on a shelf now should probably toss it out before it stays up there for three years getting dusty and making clutter,59,58
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i ordered the dark cork tiles in two batches they were significantly different inhence they did not match as i expected them to,25,59
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the included double side tapes are not sufficient to make the cork stay on the walls plan on making them stay a different way,24,60
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,fell off wall in less than 2 wks and all the cork chipped at corners the cork is pretty although just does not stick with provided adhesive,26,61
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i bought these for my sons room but i will not use them they are going in the trash when i first opened the package the smell was so strong that i had to leave them in the garage i had hoped that the smell would go away but after a week in our garage they are not much better then on the day they were opened,66,62
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,a little flimsy and crumbly but overall I am satisfied with these lil guys this darker brownwas a little harder to find than the standard cork and the material is a little different too as you can tell from the picture it is not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything it is more like a bunch of little chunks formed together which i think gives it kind of a neat textured look unlike a lot of other ones i looked at these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins they did make a mess when i put them up and I am not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted but oh well still worth it oh i also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares,143,63
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,these squares are a nicesturdy and look nice the major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package the instructions clearly state that 6 adhesive squares allow for the best bond to the surface but only include enough for four per square sadly i already posted items on the board only to have two of the squares fall off within an hour perhaps if i had enough adhesive squares this would not have happened,79,64
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,good size and easy to work with in terms of application and fit definitely recommend for a variety of crafting projects,21,65
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,most places sell much thinner cork than what i needed this i actually use as protective backing for the wall surrounding a metal tip dartboard works great for that purpose,30,66
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,these boards were easy to put up on the wall with some double sided tape the heavy duty kind so far they are still on the wall the thickness of the boards are perfect for utilizing them as a bulletin board i love theof them too,48,67
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,the board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles are thicker than many of the lighter cork tiles i found in stores the texture andis perfect too,29,68
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i ordered two packs one arrived crumbling and looked totally different as if it had not been pressed enough i returned it thinking it was a fluke and was quickly shipped a replacement which had two tiles with broken corners i sent them all back they are very nice looking cork boards thick and a nice darkbut go to the store to buy them so you can make sure they are undamaged and all match,77,69
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,the cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated which makes the fact that they arrived all 4 sheets in perfect condition all the more impressive their corners were squared and no chips or holes i cut them to size with a razor blade and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartments walls really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls looks professional and fantastic the provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment but if they do start to slip it is no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails the surface is somewhat porous meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully fair value for the buck which is becoming a rarity these days,127,70
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,my daughter and i painted them purple and black and made a decorative bulletin board with them the students love it,21,71
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i used this to fill an old window frame to use as a tack board works greats it does have a tendency to crumble when cutting use a very sharp blade and go slow,33,72
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the product leaves crumbs or bits tends to fall apart the more you use it does not hold push pins well,20,73
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i bought these to maybe use for an earring hanger but I am not positive anymore the four cork tiles are pretty thick and theis nice and dark it is however flaking a bit like piece of the cork are coming off like a lot of pieces they are still intact and will still be usable they are just leaving a trail wherever i take them,66,74
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,this stuff seems to be the right thickness to go behind my dart board and give the sheet rock a rest two packs did the trick three squares above three below and one on either side the mounting system of my bandit dart board still fits perfectly even although the edges of the dart board are over some of the cork it comes with a bunch of double sided tape squares i only used one in each corner just to get the squares set and then used a few finishing nails for more strength all of this and it has a pleasant smokey scent,104,75
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,I am making a largewall in my office and gluing this onto corrugated plastic panels which will be attached to the wall the highly inadequate adhesive squares are completely pointless as i want this stuff to stay attached to the wall for more than a day and the sheetrocked walls in my office have some texture I am using contact cement the edges of these squares are easy to damage and the detritus they she had is non stop i only hope once i have it mounted and framed it with molding it will cease to she had so many cork crumbs i gave it 2 stars because I am committed to finishing my project i do not like it i may hate it in the end and have to revisit and change my review,131,76
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the product is crumbly but worse all the tiles fell down and no i have sticky double sided tape on my wall i can not get off,26,77
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,it was a little messy as others have said but not overly so i used it on a floor that does not get much traffic a half bath but it was down in a day and looks good I have had it down for about a month and is holding up so far theis great and the thickness is perfect i had little cork pieces everywhere when i cut it but it cut well i thought and a few minutes with a vacuum and voila i like it,89,78
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,glue patches too small tend to stick on wall but not on the more open tile many failed to adhrere,20,79
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i built a picture frame and cut these out and glued them in works great to pin up pictures it looks great and works perfectly,24,80
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i had been searching all over for the correctand density to replace some old broken cork tiles on my daughters cork wall this was an exact match if the previous tiles are any indication of the durability of these tiles they will last quite some time the current ones have been up for i know over 12 years,60,81
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,they do not hang with adhesives provided so i used command strips they are kind of curved but that is only obvious if you hang it curving away from the wall they are very delicate if you drop them they will probably fall into pieces be very careful when handling these on a positive note theis very unique and expensive-looking it adds an artsy element to my room i use it to hang my jewelry and it keeps it very organized I have had them for a few months and so far they are still intact it is a great price so do not expect too much handle with care,107,82
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these cork tiles are a good thickness but they are very crumbly the consistency of the cork is much looser than that of a typical cork board i would love to find good quality dark cork but this is not it,40,83
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,my delivery never showed up not sure if the company or the mailman is to blame but there is no tracking information available when you purchase this product the seller did resend me the items after i called to follow up about a week later if you need them as soon as possible bewarewas what i expected when it showed up I am liquid nailing them to a chalk board if you are dumb enough to use the double sided tape squares they send you then you deserve to have them fall off your wall the company should not even provide the little squares for this use there has no way they can hold the weight of the cork tile plus whatever you thumbtack to it,121,84
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i installed these with no problem but then discovered they are too thin for regular pushpins the pushpins only go halfway in so can not tack anything to the nine squares i painstakingly hung up arrrggghh would not recommend just spend the money on a big regular bulletin board i got these from a big box store fyi,57,85
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,these tiles are good quality for the price i would reccomend buying mounting tape to hang them rather than using the mounting squares that come in the package we used the provided squares to start with and most of them fell off the wall the cork tiles are quite thin and several of them broke when they fell after buying a heavier duty mounting tape we were able to create a custome cork border for my daughters room that looks very nice,82,86
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i put this on a wall do not use the cheap double sided tape spread an even coat of clear silicon on the back and it will be fine,27,87
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,the boards are perfect for my project but the adhesive that comes with them is not great,16,88
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i bought these to install a wall of cork tile after i did some research on pricier higher-quality cork tiles produced for this type of application i decided did not want to spend the money on the pricier tiles so i opted for these the dark stain makes them look like they are higher-end than the typical square cork tiles you can purchase at the store and they are significantly thicker and sturdier I am very happy with them for the price,78,89
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,yes these are flimsy and crumbly and the adhesives do not hold the damned cork tiles up and they charge and outrageous price for shipping such lightweight materials a real rip off yet i can not find any other dark brown cork tiles out there they all apparently come from the same place and charge high shipping rates someone should manufacture a better product,62,90
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,makes a nice natural looking cork board the board is slightly darker compared to the pictures but has a nice overall tone the only problem with this product is that it is very crumbly and gets everywhere when installing,39,91
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,regular office chairs are not designed to provide back support to someone sitting upright at the computer they are also not designed for people who like to sit up that little bit higher cushions and back supports did not give me what i needed and i was uncomfortable all of the time so i took a chance on this drafting stool and I am really glad i did the back is upright and fits right in the small of my back providing very good support the height without the lower section of the central shaft is perfect and i love the foot-ring having the back support and height i need are essential but being able to use the foot-ring to change the position of my legs is a great bonus it assembled very easily and and is sturdy enough for my 180 pounds i definitely recommend this chair,147,0
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,i use this as a seat to go along with the podium in my classroom so that I am not having to stand all the time the chair comes with three cylinders that you wedge together to get it to full height however i personally found that the chair at it is full height was too tall for me to sit on comfortably I am 55 and it looked incredibly undignified to have to hop to get into this chair in front of students after a vigorous application of wd40 and a rubber mallet i managed to disassemble the chair and remove the shortest of the three cylinders which still left me with a nice tall stool and let me sit in it without needing to jump the only complaint and the reason that i knocked a star off is that i felt the price was set a bit high for such a simple piece of office furniture that being said it has done everything i need it for up to this point,170,1
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,purchased 2 chairs for a basement renovation that included a new study area office for the kids biggest question was making sure the chair would fit in our application from both a height and comfort level they have worked out great ability to adjust via optional center posts provided was the trick for us strong good quality for the money seatwas nice rich only recommendation i have is to go slow with the directions installation directions were vague and a little difficult to understand they could have been much more descriptive and clear,96,2
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,good workmanship it was delivered on time unfortunately the instruction is not very well explained i have to assemble and disassemble to find out how i can lower some more the seat height in addition to the regular controlled adjustment,40,3
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,i bought 2 of these drafting chairs for a reception desk what junk totally unstable they fell apart after only 2 days of use i called oj commerce to explain what was happening with the chairs employees falling as they used the foot bar to get into the chair having the chair flip over seat felt like sitting on a piece a plywood a real liability well their response was to bad if i could afford to send these crappy chairs back to them i would have instead they went into the dumpster after having them for only 3 days opps wish i had done a video review of them before i threw them in the trash,115,4
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,purchased 2 of these chairs for use at the front desk of a hotel the chairs are very poor quality after just 1 week of use the fabric on the seat is already showing wear the foot rest is wobbly and tipping the mechanism to adjust the height of the chair is very difficult to use we are very unhappy with the quality of these chairs when the company was contacted to request a return and refund they refused saying they would send 2 new chairs but would not accept a return why would we want 2 new chairs when the ones we purchased initially are unacceptable you can only return anif there is a part missing or damaged,121,5
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,the chair very nice and good price niceeasy to assembly the stool can turn around quick delivery i enjoy it i highly recommence it,23,6

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,came with 4 parts missing and some that did not belong to this product very poor quality control i would not buy this product again,26,10
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,flimsy seat creaks and is not level foot rest will not stay put despite repeated tightening I am going to try to take it apart and re-assemble before sending it to the landfill very disappointing although do not waste your money on one unless you are a lot lighter than my 175 lbs,48,11
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,i bought this chair for my work bench in my basement utility room excellent feel no more dead butt while sitting on a hard chair it adjusts to the perfect height for working at higher than counter height very comfortable and easy to assemble,45,12
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,looks nice couple of teeny blemishes on the cushion but overall a nice buy instructions are pretty simple but there really should be a note that you need to sit on it to make the three centerpieces really fit together or use a mallet they kinda fit if you try to do it by hand but it would not lock in until i sat on it wheels are smooth and no apparently problems since assembling and starting to use it,81,13
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,this chair was cheap once i built a brace for the footbar and welded the footbar to the base and took off the back rest which bent when i simply leaned back this was a nice stool please add a way to bolt the footbar to the frame and stop selling such a poorly designed product,56,14
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,decent chair with assembly taking less than ten minutes there are actually several configurations you can use for different heights very pleased this is actually the same chair as the model with arms even ships with the bolts for the arms and the holes are there so if i were to order again i would get the one with the arms and leave them off i could even alternate and put them on for a while and then take them off i was thinking i could put one arm on and leave the other off but i am afraid that would leave things off balance and throw the world in to chaos,112,15
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,not comfortable really poor quality do not waste your money,9,16
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,i have purchased 3 of these chairs in july the seat cushion has close to nothing in it you can feel the screws coming from the back side of it i can not find any warranty info on them i would think that these would last longer the 4 months very disappointed,52,17
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,great light-use counter chair will not take heavy daily use,10,18
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,while cheap that is what we ended up with broken back light metal bends easily would not recommend for a lot of usage,23,19
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,looked great in the picture when i received the box i opened it for assembly the directions are extremely vague i recommend using just the longer one of the tube posts because when i put both of them together as the directions showed it made the post crooked and the chair was off balance i had to disassemble the chair and use the single longer post on it is own the back support has no adjustment other than forward and backward slightly would be nice to have a height adjustment on that the seat cushion itself is not extremely comfortable for having to use this chair on a daily basis for my job i was disappointed with the final product,119,20
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,cheap piece of chinese crap uncomfortable seat rotates at an angle flimsy when extended what else can i say returning,20,21

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,this was for my wife who works a lot at a sewing machine and at a cutting table she reports that she is very pleased with the chair,28,29
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,circular leg rest will not stay in adjusted position but falls down to lowest position o matter how hard you tighten lock this makes the chair very uncomfortable when adjusted to a high position my last chair was very uncomfortable because thelift would not stay up does not anyone make a drafting chair that actually works certainly not flash furniture,61,30
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,loved this we bought two and they are great at a great price,13,31
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,this chair is very comfortable and reasonably priced the only problems i had is that the first order came in with the wrong part that mounts the seat to the base and the foot ring does not want to stay in one place other than that i love this product,49,32

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,foot ring needs to be lower slight modification and it is fine now,13,36
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,the included written instructions are dreadful worthless use your common sense instead the seat is not really stable if i were you I had look elsewhere,25,37
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,i had to do a bit of filing to get the central piece to fit into the foot piece but once done the chair is fine and comfortable shipping was timely and everything you need to put it together was included,41,38
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,easy to put together and nice looking chair padding is thin so for the price it is a good deal worth it,21,39
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,this chair completely fell apart within 3 months the seat and backrest are shaky the foot rest is a hazard and a few of the wheels came off pro the pattern is cute con unsafe and unstable,37,40
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,the footrest fell apart in the first week and pieces of the chair continue to fall off to this day it will be out at the dumpster within a week or so if i do not get hurt when it falls apart while I am sitting on it,46,41
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,thisbraked very quick i used only 5 days then after that dosnt work anymore do not buy thiswest of money,24,42

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,the back is not flexible and too upright therefore a little uncomfortable would be nice if it leaned back just a little other than that it is nice,28,44
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,the foot ring on the chair will not stay in place it also sits crooked not worth the money at all,21,45
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,i bought this chair for my office at work and the chair seat height is very tall at least 32 inches this is at it is lowest setting i measured my desk and the proper seat height for me I am tall is 29 inches so even with high heals i would have to tippy-toe to get on my chair every time instructions are one size fits all i suspect seller uses the same instructions for several chair types seems okay to me now I am not as mechanically inclined as i am computer savvy and assembled this chair by myself i wish i did not have to return it as i like the solid quality and sturdiness but it is seat height is just too tall so my search continues too bad,129,46
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,this chair is not the fanciest you will find the parts are a little thin and wobbly on occasion the back rest depends on hand tightened knobs but structurally it is very sturdy it has not tipped over once i thought it would because of it is height and it is comfortable keep in mind that it is really an average drafting chair but once you acknowledge that it is a great buy,68,47
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,this chair was cheaply priced thus it was cheaply made it does the job but it is uncomfortable and falls apart frequently spend the money on a nice chair the way i see it i am out 50 if i would have just spent 50 more up front I had have a nice reliable chair also instructions are completely ridiculous thank god for common sense other wise I had be screwed in assembling it,70,48
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,we had extra high counters put in our lab at work so we could stand or sit when doing any task these chairs were the only ones that were high enough and were delivered very quickly easy to put together and my staff was very impressed with these chairs comfy too,51,49
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,missing parts and very cheap like a beer can with legs and missing parts and not all parts welded pure junk,21,50
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,purchased this chair for my hobbies in the garage perfect height for a tall work bench and very comfortable would reccommend,21,51
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,perfect height i looked many places to find one high enough the foot rest part is very flimsy so you can not put much weight on it still would recommend it,30,52
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,i should have known not to buy a desk chair online this one was a big mistake after being nearly impossible to assemble the instructions are confusing the pieces poorly identified it is incredibly uncomfortable to sit on,35,53
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,great chair easy to put together and very sturdy it has an extender that makes the chair very tall almost too tall so i did not use the extender,28,54
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,i ordered three of these chairs easy setup and easy to switch between cylinders for different heights good chairs low price,21,55
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,horrible flimsy small seat falls over i returned it as soon as possible spend more money get better chair waste of time to me,21,56
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,this chair is exactly what i needed it is the right height and comfortable the only problem is that the footrest does not stay put it slides down to the base and i have to continually readjust it,36,57
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,my office mate and i bought standing desks and decided to purchase 1 chair for those times we need to sit this chair is rickety and made of cheap materials which i suppose only encourages us to actually stand however for the price it is ok and serves the purpose of a quick break here and there i would not purchase again,61,58
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,overall great chairs assemble very easily function very well and look very good would recommend these chairs to others,20,59
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,i wanted a tall chair and it is but seat could be a bit larger to give more stable feeling,20,60
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,the shipping was fast because i have a prime the stool was nice but the handle for height extenders was broken also the back pad base was not balanced why i did not return it because i do have studio class and i need it to i can draft it is easy to but it together if the back base were balanced over all i think it is worth 50 not 79 you can buy it but i think you need to look for something less money if you going to buy this stool,90,61
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,the chair was easy to assemble after it is assembled i find it comfortable i needed a chair which would allow me to set comfortable at a bar height for work at a computer over extended periods this chair works well,41,62
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,there were some mixed reviews on this chair but i decided to take a chance on it there is very little padding on this chair and it seems no matter what i do i can not get the seat level I am only keeping it because it is too much trouble to send it back,53,63
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,the chair itself is of fair quality and assembled with ease the problem is with it is comfort not designed for humans of average height this is by far the most uncomfortable chair i have ever sat upon within the first half hour i had leg cramps followed by lower back pain wish i had my old broken chair or even a barstool at this point,66,64
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,it clearly show 2 different height ranges but only comes with one when i contacted the supplier it was more than obvious that i was bothering them i sent the chairs back,32,65
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,good chair for the price would order if needed again easy to assemble quick shipment comfortable choice of adding an addition to make higher or leave off to make lower,28,66
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,it was the cheapest drafting chair i could find and it feels like it i have no problem sitting in it all day but it is far from cushy does the job i needed just fine although,37,67
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,i got this to use in my new sewing room because my new work table sits a lot higher than my old one when i got it all put together although it was too high no problem there are three pieces that connect the chair to the base so i took out the middle one put it back together and it is now the perfect height it was really easy to put together no tools needed because it comes with it is own allen wrench love the foot rest,87,68
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,instructions show arm rests and mysterious missing second cylinder do you see arm rests in the pic i do not think so so now i have to call or write or whatever and frankly i prefer not having to make the time,42,69
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,finally made it functional still do not know if i got it right they need far more comprehensible instructions,20,70
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,this chair is great easy to put together easy instructions nice product i would recommend this chair for sure,20,71
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,we had to improvise putting this thing together after doing so we found that it tilted forward we were able to improvise a correction for this but as much as this looks like an easy to assembleit is not,40,72
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,the shipping was fast assembly was very easy my husband is a little handicapped so i assembled it for him and it was simple,24,73
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,the instructions are sketchy i had extra parts i needed to use common sense to assemble it the foot rest is a foot rest and will not support your body weight for home use only nice product,37,74
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the chair and it is operation great buy if this meets your needs,20,75
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,I shall agree with other reviews the instructions are horrible but honestly with a little common sense it goes together pretty simply and quick,23,76
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5,positive,emerson design slimline phn emsem2116 i was looking for a simple good and ecomomical wired wall phone for the bathroom i did not need a bunch of features and this one is doing a fine job,39,0
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,it came without the cord connecting the stand to the handset pretty obnoxious,13,1
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5,positive,this phone was purchased to set up my voip obi202 phone system great phone,14,2
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,poor working of switches for ring we put on ring off and could never get it on again threw this phone away,22,3
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5,positive,this phone is just what i needed for an extra phone,11,4
Office_Products,B001308IKK,4,positive,works well enough be aware it is very light weight which works for me,13,5
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,it was a waste of 10 just glad i did not pay more apparently some people receive some that do work but this is really cheaply made,26,6
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,the phone connection remains on does not hang up when it is installed as a wall mounted device the hook switch on the handset is not depressed when it is placed in the vertical position on the base this is a design problem that can not be fixed i contacted tech support they are worthless,55,7
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,this product is the worse product ever i just wanted some kind of cheap temporary phone before i found a better deal on a landline phone cheap definitely describes this product it stopped working within a couple of days it no longer called out instead it would give a beeping tone also when someone tried calling in the person on the other line would not be able to hear what i was saying my advice even although the product is cheap do not even bother buying it,85,8
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,if you just need something as a backup phone it is okay although it is probably not a good one fore someone who is hard of hearing,25,9
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,my biggest complaint about this phone is that it is ridiculously light the base itself constantly flops around on the desk like a dead fish as you handle the handset the only way to keep it in place is to fasten it with the screw mounts or use some sort of double-sided tape second it has quite a bit of static I am not sure if this was a fluke but my other handsets worked flawlessly while this one produced an audible click and pop as i moved the unit around the desk finally it is very very basic not many features here the keypad is lit and it does have a volume control switch loud or louder but that is all no caller identification saved number features in essence this is a barebones cheap and ultimately disposable phone that you would only get if you quickly needed a device to talk,150,10
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5,positive,ok i do not give it 5 stars unless it is good does what i want tastes great or whomever i gived it to was happy merry christmas and happy new year,29,11
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,the phone works ok however it has a very cheap feel to it and i do not expect it to last very long the problem is it is so light every time i answer the phone the base also lifts up and then falls if you are going to attach the phone to the wall this phone might be ok but if you are looking for a desk phone try something with a little more weight to it,78,12
Office_Products,B001308IKK,4,positive,in a world that depends on phone mobility i still have a hole in the kitchen wall where a phone was supposed to be located well this phone fills that hole very adequately at a nice low price nothing more nothing less,42,13
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,first at the 11 x 17 size this isis floppy and flaccid and will not work for the purpose of supporting your papers while writing on them it will only work to clip papers together and hold them in place very disappointing also it arrived in it is sealed plastic wrapper with a chipped corner and looks like that happens easily,61,0
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,i did not like it i sent it back the back was to flimsy and flexible,16,1
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,it is to flimsy for what i needed and a little larger than it needed to be,16,2
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4,positive,no complaints quality clasp sturdy board we use 3 or 4 of these around the company last forever,18,3
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4,positive,clipboard is very flimsy made of thin plastic i originally bought this to use as i was moving around the warehouse but when held it just flops around i now use it to organize my 11 x 17 drawings at my desk,42,4
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,very flimsy and does not really hold the size paper it states,11,5
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,served it is purpose well for about 3 months until it slid off the desk and the whole corner chipped rendering it almost unusable i would concur with other reviews that this product needs to be a little heftier for good durable field use come on it is recycled plastic it is not like the raw material is too expensive given it is short life and cost thisis too expensive for what you get,72,6
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,i thought i was getting an 11x17 clip board not a 11 3/4x12 7/8 useless i did not think there would be fine print to read on this product as well,30,7
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5,positive,works great plastic is bendy when compared to a regular clipboard / hardboard material so if you need a rock-hard platform to do your work look elsewhere i needed to draw piping diagrams and more while standing in the field so this is not the best option it has since been repurposed as a vertical drawing holder in the office so all good,60,8
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5,positive,perfect for holding just one or many sheets of 11 x 17 paper we use them for holding drawings of construction sites while we are out taking measurements of details,30,9
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,size is good but it is too flexible to be a useful clipboard,13,10
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,these were to thin and bent to easily for what i needed,12,11
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5,positive,works great now have 2 and they work great for oversized spreadsheets would definitely purchase again,16,12
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4,positive,a little flimsy but has a great clasp,8,13
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,i left this in my car for one day and it curled up from the heat and it was not even that hot of a day,26,14
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4,positive,use this for my word finds it is nice to have something sturdy for my lap and to hold up just wish it was a little firmer,26,15
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,clipboard arrived today the good news the clip is great and holds items securely the bad news the plastic board is too flimsy for what i need it for which is writing on it while standing hint to manufacturer use a little more of that recycled plastic and make a sturdier board,53,16
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5,positive,excellent sturdy and just the right size we needed,9,17
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2,negative,it is too flimsy it gives and bends if you need something rigid this is not for you,16,18
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4,positive,the plastic backer is a little thin and floppy,9,19
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1,negative,thin and flimsy virtually useless the clip board is thin and absolutely not rigid enough to write on while holding it is not even rigid enough to used while sitting on an irregular surface the pictures are misleading and the clip board will not even support it is own weight when held from one end,53,20
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,i had one that suddenly sent my printer into convultions and it appeared that my hearty but old printer was done when infact it was due to a faulty cartridge from these guys i had bought a set of four and when i replaced it with another cartridge the malfunction stopped but suddenly there was a huge puddle of ink oozing out of my 940c this ooze is ongoing and it is very messy it left a large amount of ink inside of the printer which is hard to remove and it will continue toout under the printer thank god for cheap ink that is water soluble but none the less these cartridges are no bargain it will take days for my fingers to turn white again,129,0
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,i was very pleased with the service from this company especially when they replaced one cartridge that did not survive the mailing no protective padding in the envelope however i did not get around to installing one of these cartridges until a few days later my hp psc would not recognize it i even surgically removed the barcode from the old hp original cartridge and attached it to the remanufactured one no go bummer after looking on-line i found that the culprit was probably a missing chip that hp installs in each of their cartridges my psc is very old and still works like a champ but the difficulty and expense of finding new official cartridges makes me as angry at hp as i am with the company that sold me cartridges that do not work live and learn,135,1
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,i bought this because it seemed like a great deal 4 black ink cartridges for the price that they change for 1/5 of an hp cartridge i installed it and it has worked well so far so good,38,2
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,2 of the cartridge work 2 not the ink is dry and do not work bad experience,16,3
Office_Products,B001QIM102,2,negative,very unreliable print cartridges first two cartridges failed after a few pages,12,4
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5,positive,this is my 3rd-4th purchase of hp-15s from amazon / printronic and based on my experience with these refills i would estimate the usefulness to be 95 I have only had one that i would consider a shorter than expected life my hp 3820 still provides acceptable service and keeping my hp 3820 useful would not be possible without a reasonably reputable supply of hp-15s,62,5
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,very good value I have tried one so far and it needed to have it is contacts cleaned with a pencil eraser to make it work but one that was done it works very well it is not as clear printing as a new hp cartridge but it is good enough for my purposes mostly printing out sheet music if the other cartridges work as well this is a very cost effective replacement ink,70,6
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,i have not used them all yet but so far what i used is good theis correct on the cartridge i have in there now the black it is printing like it should with no problems so far i am happy and would purchase it again thanks,48,7
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5,positive,efficient handling of order accurate and quality products,8,8
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,cartridges are useless onlythat shows up is pink will never use you again,16,9
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5,positive,bought these for my mom because she prints a bunch of useless garbage from email and online the price is way better than buying them new from the actual manufacturer she has not had any problems with them,37,10
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,ink tends to come on a bit thick and real test will be in how long it lasts seems to be a real value although,25,11
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5,positive,works just fine in the printer would buy again fast service nice price can not think of anything else to say,20,12
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,they work good i got the 4 of them and just one did not work good but they last good and they are okay not so bad to be so cheap in price i recommend this product,35,13
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,unfortunately i had to return this product as it was not compatible with my hp printer i was so disapointed,20,14
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1,negative,unfortunately i had a very bad experience with the purchase of this product prior to a trip to the united states i bought this phone which i stated that was sent to the address where i would stay me the phone arrived the day indicated but back to my country and install the cordless charger never does not work not charge the cordless handset 2 days after i send an email to customer service stating this situation it is been 3 weeks since purchase and i have not received a concrete solution to my problem i have shown that i can to return the phone to an address within the united states however i have not received a response yet so now i can only say that my experience with this purchase has been very very bad once again i can see the flaw in that incur many e-commerce companies large error is the after sales service which is what a buyer needs to end if you have problems in conclusion when you need a solution that never appears anywhere,178,0
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,the overall product is ok the menus are ok it seems sturdy enough setup was easy the problem is the functionality the speaker phone is completely unuseable even with the volume cranked to the maximum everyone is at a whisper and even if you yell you are a whisper to the people on the other end the corded another issue hand set sits on top of the speaker and mic and you can not turn the speaker phone on with the hand set off of the cradle that right there makes thiscompletely useless to me even while using the corded hand set you have to speak louder than usual for the people on the other end but the volume if those talking to you is fine overall not good i would recomend spending a little more on another product returning this one and trying a panasonic,147,1
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1,negative,do not buy this product l512cbt i had problems with the blue tooth connecting to my cell phone the pairing went fine and all works fine until the base looses connection trying to reconnect using your cell or the base will not work you have to reset the base and repair your cell i just called motorola and they admitted it is a known problem and are unsure how long it will take to fix if ever they suggested to take it back when i asked if it is just a couple of units and if i get another would it work they said no all of them have this problem,108,2
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,a very nice phone that is easy to use the only trouble is at 9 pm cdt and at 3 am cdt the phone diconnects from the bluetooth portion with my motorola i880 happens almost everyday motorola technical support is working on the issue hope it will not be too long until that problem is repaired no complaints otherwise very happy with the product and all other motorola products i have purchased,72,3
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,could just be a defect of my phone but when using the handset the buttons seem to be very indistinct i use the cordless handset for teleconference calls and 80 of the times i have to dial and redial my conference codes for the phone to get it right for example I shall dial the buttons for 1234567899 but my conferencing center will say sorry you dialed 223457799 so frustrating,69,4
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,4,positive,i just received this phone and have no complaints with it except the instructions have images that i was unable to understand even with magnifying glasses just the same it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it by using the menu on the control panel i also like the way the handset feels in my hand it sure beats my vtech 58 that was horrible,67,5
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,5,positive,hello dear i have chosen this telephone because i liked it visually and at the same time i like the brand i like it for i am happy with how it functions nobody it was my decision,37,6
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,4,positive,the buttons on it are hard to press although have to redial numbers all the time other than that it is a pretty good value for the price,27,7
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,this phone appeared good for the price but fails to deliver on basic performance with an iphone 5s i have found that the unit will not acquire bluetooth automatically and the bluetooth connection gets dropped on it is own the whole point this is so that i can leave my cell phone put in a good reception spot and not worry about calls not ringing and maybe have the spare handset by the bed not comforting to wake up the next morning and the blue paired light is out on the motorola and i have nowhen the thing dropped my cell phone more or less useless for that calls placed out from the motorola handset are not clear there is static and folks on the other line have complained somewhat when the very same call is switched directly to cell phone the static miraculously disappears i wish i had gotten rid of the motorola but it is not really worth the hassle or shipping,165,8
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1,negative,do not waste your money on this phone like other customers i have had trouble with loose power connection failure to stay connected to cell phone clunky buttons that are hard to push and delay in connecting when you start to dial also the menu is not intuitive the whole thing is a nightmare i bought this because i liked the combination of corded and cordless i wish there were more choices of this combo because motorola did an absolutely awful job that makes me question buying anything else from them again,91,9
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,the user interface leaves a lot to be desired 1 on the main phone unit there is some sort of delay when you first start dialing it takes some getting used to you press the first four of five digits nothing happens then they all come out at once why does it need to be that way 2 the intercom is difficult to use you have to open a menu select a handset by pressing the arrow key a bunch of times then select it this is needless obviously the person who designed the user interface never intended to use it themself 3 the message waiting indicator if you are using phone company voice mail is really small and hard to notice i would not recommend this phone,131,10
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,5,positive,love this set I have gone threw so many cordless phones becuase they will not stay charged so I have tryied many till i seen thease and I am very please with the clear talk and the charge stays for quite a long time,40,11

Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,5,positive,unlike the other reviews i found the phone to work just as described the bluetooth paired with my galaxy ii without issue and it reconnects flawlessly the speaker phone sound quality is good and the volume adequate i have had no problems at all and would recommend to anyone,49,13
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2,negative,needed a phone to not miss calls this phone dose not have a message light have a couple of phones in my office if there has no blinking light i do not know there has a call had to get a new phone att has a nice phone with a nice orange blinking light when left a message,55,14

Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,4,positive,very happy with this phone I am still learning how to use it but pleased with it thus far i would recommend it,22,16
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1,negative,after a few weeks the phone no longer dials the right numbers for example i will write the number 444 - 333 - 2222 and it will dial 444 - 443 - 3322 or something like that it almost seems to be random i although at first it was because i have a wi-fi router close to it when dialing from my remote handset but it does the same from the hub which is hardwired to land line it is a piece of crap i will never buy a motorola phone in my life,85,17
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1,negative,my at t cordless phone with bluetooth is getting old so bought this motorola at a good price talk about user friendly not a chance with this one i like things to go smooth and easy with little hassel with this unit nothing is smooth and easy the bluetooth in itself is interesting enough when you get into range with your cellphone it should connect by itself once the programming is done but not this one you reprogram all over again and again and again hassel hassel and more hassel for a name like motorola this should be a top of the line phone bye bye motorola,106,18
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,absolute garbage terrible reception i had a job interview over the phone and neither one of us could hear each other i had o call back with my cell phone to finish the conversation i did get a second interview but this horrible product caused me embarrassment and possibly a job thanks for nuthin ge i donated the phones to goodwill and got new batteries for my old set which now work perfectly hopefully whoever buys this pos at goodwill does not really need to communicate with anyone,87,0
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,it did not last very long it stopped working i had to have it replaced with a better quality phone there was static and interference,24,1
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5,positive,these phones are very cool unlike other phones I have purchased these have an external alarm that you can set to wake you up daily how cool is that,26,2
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,did not like these phones from the time i took them out of the box not made well the caller identification is set up badly you got do way too much just to delete a number the sound is the worst I have ever heard lots of echo this phone just plainlly sucks sending it back went to use it the other day and now there has a high pitch buzzing nosie so i can not even use the damm thing that was it for me do not buy it,85,3
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5,positive,i ordered these phones about 2 months ago they are great package they each work very well and i like that i can label each set for each room of the house,32,4
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,nice to have all the handsets but the quality of sound on these is just terrible we could not even hear the other person on the line am returning these as soon as possible,30,5
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5,positive,a good system for the price simple and does the job another review complained about the sound quality but i find the sound to be quite good i think it really depends on the infrastructure / provider,35,6
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,after going through 4 phones over the last 7 - 8 years with panasonic and getting tired of the lost connection to base message from their handsets i thought I had try this one from ge phone arrived nice silver finish although flimsy feel handset did not snap into base i felt it was a bit wobbly no speakerphone on base unit but that was already known buttons offered stiffer resistance to the touch than panasonic if you consider that a good thing audio call quality was atrocious while calls did not drop the audio came in and out like shortwave radio for those of us who can remember decided this was unacceptable quality for something brand new returning to amazon i guess it is back to panasonic,125,7
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,voice quality poor entries in telephone book on one handset do not register automatically in others,16,8
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,very hard to get customer service as ge is using some other vender to market this product i will never buy it again,23,9
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,just not acceptable sent it back ordered upgrade and am happy,11,10
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,cheap construction always had panasonic cordless phones but tried this one because of the price did not like at all,20,11
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4,positive,i love my phones they work well the only thing missing is that they do not have the time on them if that was there it would be wonderful,28,12
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,not a good phone at all i can not hear on them most of the time no one else can either,20,13
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4,positive,i use in my office lightweight holds a charge and has a vm system,14,14
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,kept cutting in and out hard to hear when i turned up volume it sounded like i was in a giant hall i will be returning for a full refund plus my shipping cost to send it back i also will be canceling the extended warranty,46,15
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4,positive,it is nice light weightgood and i can see the numbers and screen better we are glad we chose this one,22,16
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1,negative,this phones base unit will not mount on a wall if you need it in a place such as a kitchen where you want it out of the way of water or other kitchen hazards this is not the phone for you also it is very small in size i called the manufacturer to see if there was an adapter that i could purchase but the customer service rep was snotty and told me to go somewhere else to purchase one that worked best for me if i could find one and that those types were not manufactured anymore i could not believe her attitude i can not say how it sounds because i am re-packing it and sending it back i have purchased my last ge product after today,129,17
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,they arrive very quic look real nice but extremely hard to hear on or for you to be heard u would not buy this set again very disappointed,28,18
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,does not hold a charge well on any of the phones,11,19
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4,positive,it did not have an instruction manual but the phones are working,11,20
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4,positive,nice units buttons light up and the speaker handset is just what this dr ordered,15,21
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5,positive,after looking at lots of phones with the ugly green and orange lighting these are perfect for what i wanted,20,22
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2,negative,unclear and muted conversations could not hardly understand anyone who called lasted about a month before the first one died two weeks later the main bass died not worth my money was not happy,33,23
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5,positive,probably the nicest phone set I have bought to date panel is easy to ready set-up was a snap batteries are included with the phone and they were fully charged within an hour would highly recommend,35,24
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5,positive,this is a nice small board suitable for keeping on a desk with to-do lists and such i think it is great,21,0
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,it was much smaller than i expected i actually returned it for a refund,14,1
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4,positive,small size easy to take places like a football field for plays,12,2
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5,positive,great for the counter in my aging parents apartment it reminds them of upcoming events and i can change the message whenever i visit good product,26,3
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1,negative,i liked my dry erase board a lot but the dry erase display had slipped out of the border and now has a bubble underneath my students find it annoying and so do i i wonder if mine is just a defective one or if all of them are like this,51,4
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1,negative,we bought 3 of these they have all fallen apart and are now in the trash i do not recommend,20,5
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1,negative,within 15 seconds of taking this board out of the package the rubber feet fell off and the frame around thecame apart i used double-sided tape to put it all back together but it is still not a great product,41,6
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5,positive,exactly what i order and order came in fast just wha i need for my event coming in may movie night,21,7
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,the aluminum frame fell apart within the first 2 minutes of opening the packaging super glue did not work but for now it is staying together by shoving poster putty into it,30,8
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,silver frame broke as soon as i got it and I have had to glue it back twice not sure if i just got a bad one,26,9
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5,positive,nice desktop whiteboard at a great price helps me organize my day meeting times things to do just right for me,24,10
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5,positive,i am in the habit of using a dry-erase board to keep track of work-related tasks and to-dos but after a move i no-longer had a wall in a convenient place to hang my board on i was very happy to find this board with an easel it is just the right size and the easel is adjustable it also is two-sided so you can flip it around to write additional lists notes,73,11
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4,positive,i have enjoyed owning the dooley aluminum framed double sided magnetic dry erase board with easel it is easy to set anywhere and helps keep me organized,27,12
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,i had the same experience as some of the other reviewers here the rubber feet did not even make it out of the plastic packaging so do not count on those staying on this however is not a big deal what is a big deal is that the aluminum frame is one piece with a joint at one corner the bends are fine but the joint is not attached to anything and the entire frame pops off sounds like a cosmetic issue right unfortunately the stand is part of the frame so if you are planning on using the stand you will have to figure out a way to keep the frame from springing off i had a board i bought from a store once that had a metallic finish that was also a dry-erase / magnetic board but unfortunately i can not find it again guess I shall have to keep looking,145,13
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,i bought this for displaying my band magnets at my merch table and liked that it had an easel back i will not be able to use it as intended and would not buy it again this board is white and magnetic on both sides something cool i was not expecting but it is cheaply made the complaint in the other review about the little plastic feet coming off straight out of the box is accurate for the one i received as well the metal frame around the board will not stay on and it will not even pretend to it is like it is spring-loaded to pop away from theof the board possibly these problems can be fixed with a little gorilla glue but aftermarket consumer repair should not be necessary it also either came dented or dented very easily when i was taking it out of the package i was at target after i had already ordered thisand saw larger magnetic boards there for less money it would make more sense to me to buy one of those and set it on an easel stand of it is own than to buy this particular board again that is probably what I shall end up doing,204,14
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4,positive,pros the price on this dry erase board can not be beat overall aside from small issues below it is a really nice desktop dry erase board perfect for to do lists or whatnot writes and erases nicely with the expo brand pens i have not the pen it came with which does not write well cons the marker that it comes with is cheap and completely cheesey so you will definitely want to get another if you plan to use this a lot also you will need an eraser because it just comes with a tiny one on the cap of the marker which does not do the job also the tiny black feet on the stand of the board have already fallen off straight out of the box leaving a sticky residue in their place and need to be glued back on,138,15
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,when i first received this i was seriously skeptical seemed flimsy and cheap but it does the job I have used this to open a number of those hard plastic covers on electronics the shrink wrap dvds even a quick straight line cut on some documents overall it is a nice little tool and the safety features are great for someone like me who is always cutting myself with anything and everything sharp if there was one wish it would be that the blade were just a little bit longer,90,0
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,you would think a tool as old as a utility knife could not possibly be improved upon but scotch succeeds with this package opener there are a lot of little touches that make it pleasant to use the grip is very comfortable and designed to make it easy to hold at the correct angle the extender slide is positioned where my thumb will not accidentally activate it during use the blade is short enough to allow the package to be braced on a table to make it easier to cut it is just one of those designs that gets out of your way so you are focusing on the task instead of the tool my wife tried it and she found it easy to use as well the one thing keeping it from 5 stars is the blade popped out once during use,140,1
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,as an amazon addict i get packages all the time this is a nice little tool to get your amazon boxes open quickly and safely after a while maybea year or so the blade does wear down so i have bought replacements,42,2
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1,negative,like all of us I have sworn luridly at the plastic bubbles in which everything today seems to be sold why can not they just go back to little cardboard boxes with windows when i saw thison another website i thought I had licked the problem but after less than a month and maybe four or five packages the little blade broke right off and i ended up right where i started from digging and tearing at the plastic with my kitchen scissors i suggest you use yours too or else a sturdy knife do not bother with this el-cheapo,98,3
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1,negative,scotch safe cut does not work safe your money for something else worthless worthless worthless,14,4
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1,negative,this is was junk threw it out the day i got it too much trouble to send it back,22,5
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1,negative,i hate it wish i never got it this product is beyond pointless more dangerous than a razor blade by itself already returned i thought it was going to be somewhat helpful like the ones you see in infomercials just a major waste of time / money,44,6
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,this package opener is the perfect gift for children grandparents and klutzes like me i can not tell you how many times I have dealt with papercuts or poking myself with a pair of scissors this little gizmo totally eliminated that problem it works effortlessly and you will find yourself using it for a million little tasks that you would never thought about before and it makes the perfect shower gift teacher gift or just a gift to yourself,77,7
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,i have been searching for anlike this for a long time now thank you so much for a nice christmas present from me to me merry christmas and thank you god bless you all alex christie alexchristie attnet,39,8
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,i like that this little guys small enough to fit in a pocket and that the blades smaller than a boxcutters so it is a bit safer zips through any tape plastic envelope top and more with easethe contour handle is a nice touch too,40,9
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,i think this is a greatblister packs are so difficult and can be so dangerous to open usually i use a scissors sometimes a knife and always think it is going to slip and slice something else i hate blister packs so this is something i feel fills a definite need and although I had like it better with a bigger sharper blade like an exacto knife it was able to open most of the packs without problem those very thick plastic casings did not work very well i think it is good to have around for general use definitely helpful but it may not work for all of your needs,106,10
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,hard to open packaging is a pain literally I have poked and cut myself on those plastic clamshell type packaging why do companies think they need to package products like that it is a waste so the safe cut package opener is supposed to take the pain out of opening those tough packages i tried it a few times and it does indeed make those packages easier to open it does not work just like magic although you have got to put a bit of effort into getting it to slice through the packaging and you have got to make a number of slices across the packages to get them open it is handy to have around and we are glad we have it to help with those crazy plastic packaging,123,11
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,this is really just a light weight easy-to-hold box cutter / razor except that just does not pop the blade out more than a small fraction of an inch this allows you to cut through plastic without cutting into the contents of the package a very simple elegant solution it does work packages are easy to open and I am not too worried about damaging the contents not that i would intentionally cut over a sensitive area at this price it is a good tool to get recommended,82,12
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2,negative,this tool is simply the pointy cornerof a razor blade i do not see how anyone can think it is more effective than scissors possibly more safe because only about 3 mm of the blade sticks out and hardly does any damage it is basically a worse version of a box cutter the mechanism to slide the blade in and out does not even lock so much for safe it also does not cut through tape with any relative ease at all the only thing this might be good for is gift wrap,92,13
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,this works perfectly for me and i give it quite a workout with my near daily deliveries from amazon no more using my keys as makeshift knife or running to the kitchen to get a knife and risking cutting myself this fits comfortably in my hand and feels natural to use I am quite happy with it,56,14
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2,negative,i had high hopes for the scotch safe cut package opener however it did not seem as tough as i had hoped the refillable blade fell out while i was cutting which was not an ideal situation by a long shot the blade is very small and not the best for thicker packaging the plastic piece that held the blade was not as substantial as i would have liked the best part is the design which makes the utility fit quite snugly and firmly in the hand it is also attractive to look at perhaps the next generation of scotch safe cut package openers will be more to my likingscotch safe cut package opener 170b,115,15
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2,negative,the blade is so small you have to get it exactly positioned correctly to even have a chance for it to work if you are off perpendicular the cutting is erratic I have tried it on a bunch on things packages from amazon dvds and of course sealed in hard plastic items it eventually worked on all of them but in all cases a plain scissors would have been easier i even had trouble opening the dvd but once a cut is made on the dvd plastic you can easily rip that open i searched around for the refill blade and found it on one site for 3 all in all i think this was a poorly designed poorly executed product stick with a good pair of scissors for now,129,16
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,boxes packages cds dvds and more this littleis amazing no more hassles trying to open those pesky cd wrappers it makes fast work of boxes and more it is small enough to be compact not bulky and easy to hold very excellent tool to have,45,17
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,it is perfect it does exactly what it says it does it seems very safe it is very easy to handle it cuts through that horrific clam she shall packaging like butter and it is certainly easier than a pair of scissors will this change your life no if you do not have a problem using scissors would i buy this no does packaging drive you up a wall and you want the easiest possible way to break it open this is what you want,81,18
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4,positive,handy little gadget pros low cost small blade less chance of chopping off an appendage ergonomic handle easy to push blade in and out of it is holder cuts through tape cardboard plastic wrapping cons i pinched my thumb skin while sliding the top button back to retract the blade because the blade is so small you need to exert some pressure on packaging materials to make sure it cuts deep enough the sharpness of the blade can dull quickly overall this is a handy tool for those who need to keep something small in the knife drawer for the many amazon packages that come to the house and it is much easier to cut with than scissors or a knife,118,19
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5,positive,i really like this package cutter it works well easy to hold safer then other package cutters i have used highly recommend,22,20
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2,negative,the nice thing about this package opener is that it is cheap really cheap the downside of this is that it is cheap really cheap it feels incredibly light and flimsy the blade is not all that sharp and is absolutely tiny it is not weighted at all and this device actually made opening packages an irritating procedure I had highly recommend something different for your own sanity 2 stars out of 5,68,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,as the brits say it does what it says on the tin the switches are nice and a cool blue led is included for nights in the forward berth of our boat the solar panel worked flawlessly and installation on our boat was simple i do not have any way of knowing how many cfm of air this thing actually moves but you can at least feel air movement when you have it on blow in mode recommended for an inexpensive ventilation device if you have sun available,88,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,this small vent is intended for installation in a small utility trailer although i can not yet report on how it works when installed i found the battery operation of the light fan and directionality of airflow works well no sunlight indoors so do not yet know how the solar works the fan makes minimal noise when the unit is held as it will be when mounted however that disappears to no sound when tilted as little as 5/10 degrees,80,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i put two of these on my 45 foot sailboat one set to suck and the other set to blow it was like a vortex of very mildly detectable solar powered tornado wormholes was created running through my boat from front to back it almost caused me to lose control of my helium indoors only r / c zombie shark but luckily i am an excellent air shark pilot and pulled through i am afraid to set them both to suck as it may because my ears to pop or i could pass out as it sucks all the oxygen out of the cabin but i think i can get out sometime in the 3 weeks it would take to do that i do have a scuba tank that should drop from the over head in an emergency air loss just in case i think the head trauma from the last time it deployed changed things in my brain so i kinda keep it taped up there,165,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,this vent does not move much air you can barely tell it moves any air not worth the price do not waste your money ricko,21,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,got what i ordered it looks good easy to install works fine how long it will last is an open question,21,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,nicerealy works maybe a bit weak for an exhaust van but has worked continually for over a month,19,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped,19,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,purchased 2 of these fans for a boat in june they look fine and nightlight is a nice feature they are crap do not buy them unless you just want a nice nightlight the fans will not start and operate unless you smack them even in bright sunlight so you become the switch they have a one year warranty so we will see how that goes,64,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,it was great while it worked worked for 1 year and now it will only run on battery solar part does not work,22,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,does not do much very little air is moved,8,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,unfortunately this product did not hold up as advertised we are looking for something to replace it to fit in the hole that has been cut into our outbuilding any more damage would be bad,36,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,do not expect a crazy difference but it does the job it works the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night again it is a small vent do not expect big vent differences in temperature I am happy with this product sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass went right in with some caulk vent is a tid bit noisy again to be expected it really does change the temperature i can feel it if i move my hand under it and the other on the other side that is not insulated and without a vent about 10 - 20 degrees difference consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this i think mine was about 40 at home depot,125,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for my outdoor she would just the right size and easy to install,14,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,thisstopped working after about 3 days,8,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,I am not sure if the fan is supposed to spin both ways but mine will only suck air in it will not blow air out which is really what i wanted,31,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,lasted 1 year all rusted the circuit board is poorly made and fragile would not recommend this vent,18,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,update will not work anymore it has been few months now and every time i go to the boat it is not running few hits and it starts but stops again so need to remove it and thrown away,37,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,installed this solar vent in the front hatch of my sail boat about 4 weeks ago it is working as advertised no issues with leaks in normal weather conditions have not tested it in green water conditions although,37,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,better battery would make this a 5 star,9,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it is ok for a tiny room tiny tiny room,9,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it was noisy and only lasted six months not worth the postage spent on it,15,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally no air that i could sense,14,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so i returned it for my money back otherwise it worked and looked nice if it were not for a bedroom application i would probably have kept it,41,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,so far so good works as advertised after 3 months the light is a nice added feature,17,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,well built and fairly nice to look at airflow is lower than hoped but adequate,15,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,terrible lasted one month what a rip off,8,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,do not buy this airflow is minimal and hardly worth the trouble it just does not have enough power,17,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,good vent i wish it had a way of closing when i turn the vent off installation directions are very general so take your time and think it through if you not at handy person,35,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,installed it and met my expectations it does not move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent pros you can invert air direccion in / out works at night by means of a rechargable bat and has a cortesy light cons does not move large air volume,49,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i put the su force in my small greenhouse nice features not as much airflow as i expected then it quit working after a couple of weeks i have not had time to try customer service so hopefully they will make it right,42,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i bought three of these to put in my rv they stay on all night running on the internal battery they are very quiet but they do not pull / push too much air,30,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,works great is good quality and i like the features however the fan power is a bit weak if you have a small greenhouse it works fine but not for any house over 6 x 8,36,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,high quality although full engineering i use it on my salt water coastal cruiser there is never too much ventilization in aboat,22,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,using it in she had that is being built will not know till i experience it,15,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,works once in a while when it feels like it too many switches confusing design blue light is inadequate and when the fan decides to come on it hardly moves any air at all,34,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i did not like them they are not stainless steel plus the inside is made of very chip plastic i guess i got what i paid for,26,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this works awesome in my vehicle never leaked once properly installed even driving 65 mph on the freeway in a driving rain,21,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,used in an 8x12 storage she had to keep humidity under control it is not going to win any prizes for air movement but it vents enough to do the job during the summer looks better than most options,37,37
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i would like to have it in place a while before i pass judgement the last one different mfg let me down after about a year,26,38
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i live aboard a 40 feet sailboat and these vents supply me with outside air when conditions dictate all of my hatches need to be closed the addition of the lightng feature is the future will prove a plus it is surprising how much light is put out,48,39
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,looks good and runs fine so far no more condensing on the boat interior instructions are poor on setting switches for anyone installing them the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small it is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2 hole leaves room for doing an epoxy coating onor hatch coring,62,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it does not work plain and simple instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes,30,41
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for venting rvs that sit out in the hot sun,12,42
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,noisy but circulates as long as the sun is shining on it,12,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i installed this myself and it works great,8,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,very low flow but does the job i used it to vent an outhouse stink pipe and it works good battery does not make it through the night but it is mostly needed for hot days,34,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,cheaply made does not seem to have much airflow do not know what it was meant to ventilate certainly nothing larger than a shorbox,22,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works well clean and easy to use and install started up right away we are using it to vent a greenhouse,21,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,I am still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so i can not vouch for their efficiency but i wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is not 45 or 5 as stated in various comments here the instructions that come with the fan say cut a 45 diameter hole using the template provided the template measures 425 not 45 i cut a test 425 hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat so do not order that 45 hole saw and mandrel for 50 i used a 7 adjustable circle cutter that i got at harbor freight it worked fine i am replacing the plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so i have the luxury of doing this work in my shop the only other comment that i have about the fan is that the ss cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates i have quite a condensation problem in my boat so i am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust I shall keep you posted,201,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this solar vent was very easy to install and can potentially replace one meant for a 35 hole on my boat this replaced a 45 vent leaving a little bit of abut there is a beauty ring included that hides any size difference quite well the light is not enough to read by but will help you see the other switches in the dark the fan direction can be changed and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night it looks great easy to install I am very happy with it so far it was 3 times cheaper than those available at west marine so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment,130,49
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,these are great low profile and work just fine my issue is this the exterior screws are rusting after only a week outside i doubt they will last very long the worse part the rusty water is leaving rusty streaks on my sailboatsruining my gelcoat and causing expensive damage to the paint i dunno what to do update today about one year later they broke seems they are not as waterproof as i had thought,77,50
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i used in in mobile storage transport trailers does good job of keeping humidity in control hawaii 80 no mildew since installed,23,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,to slow battery did not charge well instruction not clear it can be good for someone but not for me,20,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,bought this sunforce stainless steel solar vent for my new vinyl storage she had to be cooler inside i think it would be a better unit if the electric fan in it ran faster i felt outside just under it and it does move some air just not enough i guess well built and durable housing also,56,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,right out of the box it was slow to operate and you could see that the fan was not running true it wobbled and made a slight rubbing sound within a month it quit working due to a broken wire from the motor looking for a less expensive to the nicro i guess you get what you pay for,59,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,the sunforce 81300 stainless steel solar vent appears to work as advertised helps to lower temp in rv in hot weather and circulate air when rv is not occupied without having to plug rv to power sold by amazon with free shipping at b000bynglu,46,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,we are using this in a small hothouse and it works just great it was easy to install and seems to have reduced mid day temperatures significantly been working for about 3 months with no apparent problems,37,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,this solar vent stopped working within six months of installing it and being after june 2012 amazon will only give me a partial credit and i pay for shipping and sunforce can not even return my phone calls or emails do not waste your money and now i have a hole in my she had,53,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,short and sweet works great in my small greenhouse looks expensive i would buy this again if i ever need one,21,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i thought it was a bit pricy but the thing does work the light works as well this is not a tornado fan but is a small solar fan which we will use to move air through our cargo trailer,40,59

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004YY6JNU,5,positive,i have a wonderful show of petunias and other flowers on my porch and in the garden all seeds bought from this supplier germinate well and grow vigorously i have placed more than one order with them and shall buy more in the near future,45,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004YY6JNU,1,negative,i ordered petunia seeds to hand out as favors at out wedding naturally we had some left over so i planted them in our garden in the sun in a few weeks morning glory the plant family convolvulaceae was taking over my garden beds and nearly killed my rose bushes it took me an entire day to remove these unwanted flowering vines from all of my flowers beds and even then I shall probably still have to deal with this issue into next year who knows how many times they will self-seed very frustrated for this headache,95,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004YY6JNU,1,negative,unlike the vibrant colors in the picture the fllowers are very light pink and barely visible,16,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004YY6JNU,4,positive,the petunias are growing very slowly but i am hoping for blooms this year i love petunias because they are one of my showy plants,25,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004YY6JNU,2,negative,i am very disappointed that these seeds came from china needless to say it took longer to come also and there is not 250 seeds so how can there be 250 colors we have plenty of seeds in the us,40,8

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,i did not have any success with the seeds i followed the directions we did not have a single plant coming from the seeds would not recommend,27,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5,positive,germans call this the maggi plant because it smells and tastes like the condiment maggi cut leaves into small bits and chuck them in your soup salad or whatever,29,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4,positive,arrived on time germ on seeds is very good I am very satisfied with the product seedlings growth is very slow but it is typical for this family think about growing celery from seeds,33,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,i plant 5 times so far these seeds is coming out like half inch but after that is dying i do not know why but i received some seeds from europe and in 2 weeks i have 2 inch plant and doing great,47,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5,positive,good quality seeds they germinate as expected without extra care once the plant develop roots it can spread out by itself i can not buy this plant in the grocery store because is not well known in the united states i like it in some soups and stews,46,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,it was packed well i followed the instructions and planted 3 - 4 seeds in each of the 8 tiny starter pots i have 2 weeks later and nothing i will give it another extra days in case it takes it longer time to germinate before giving up on those seeds i will try another series of pots if nothing happens i will assume there is something wrong with the seeds the picture shows the situation 2 weeks after planting the seeds update i contacted the seller and no response,88,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,the seeds did not sprout i planted them the same day with my marigold plant in planting starters that i kept inside due to njs variable temperature at this time a year the marigolds are ready to be transplanted they are 3 inches tall the lovage did not germinate at all,52,6

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4,positive,we will see after planted if they sprout,8,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5,positive,sprouts very fast and have nice plants lovage is super in anything you would use celery i hope to bring some plants in this fall to use over the winter,30,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5,positive,it is hard in az to keep greens during the heat but i planted some lovage seeds and got really nice leaves before the heat came,25,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,all seeds were old or dry none of them come out from the ground i try 3 different times in different pots none come out sorry,26,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1,negative,major disappointment they did not germinate waste of money,10,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4,positive,i live in florida and i realized after ordering these that late spring might not be the best time here to grow this but i tried anyway germination rates were good but i think they are sensitive to the heat here it is unbelievable out there right now i am going to try again in the fall I shall update later this herb is amazing although the small amount i did manage to grow smells just like celery leaves and are perfect for soups,81,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4,positive,i ordered this after a different packet failed to even sprout these ones did sprout but very slowly maybe it was my fault since i may have planted them a little too late in the year next time I am going to plant them indoors and have lovage throughout the winter great for vegetable soups,54,15
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,these did not work at all our lab had them off in less than a minute we bought them with the hope that it would give her added traction going down our wood stairs as she is getting older and slips on occasion,42,0
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,my 15 year old dog could not walk on our wood floors until we found these booties they are really great,19,1
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,these shoes seemed ok except for the fact that my dog had them off within a half hour maybe some dogs just will not wear shoes,25,2
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,i was going crazy when we put in our wood floors and our large dogs were scratching them i found these booties and have been using them for the past 3 years i buy a new set every year for each dog when they come in the house they have to get their booties on and i have not had any scratches on my wood floors since they are good for the snow but i would recommend getting a couple of pair since they will lose them in the snow if it is really deep you will always find them eventually but it is always handy to have extras on hand they did not like them initially but have gotten use to them,121,3
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,i loved theof boots for dogs there were just two problems first the sizing instructions were inadequate and i ended up with the wrong size second one velcro strap per boot was just not enough for an active dog they came off repeatedly and in the snow got lost i think i can modify them to do a better job but someone else should have given it more thought before marketing was started,75,4
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,forget it all the velcro in the world will not keep these things on a dogs feet they are flimsy and easy to pull off i thought they would be the answer to my large dogs wet feet but just getting them on was harder than using a towel thoroughly to get the dirt off,54,5
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,this is the second time that i have bought hot doggers the dog wears them all the time in the house the first pairs lasted two years and can still be used although the rubber padding is wearing in places they are excellent and serve the purpose not scratching hard wood floors the dog took some getting used to them but being food oriented looked forward to a treat the first few times we put them on everyone asks about the slipper wearing dog,85,6
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,the size falls about 1 size bigger i ordered a size medium and it is kind of large on my dogs paws bought it since he tends to jump on us with his claws this works out great no more scratches for us,43,7
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,these work great for my boxer he does not mind them and they never come off he needs protection due to a foot allergy the only flaw is that they sometimes reverse thus he is running on the non-padded side which has caused some small pin holes to appear I had rather see padding on both top and bottom overall very pleased as my boxer has worn these for hours at a time with no issues,74,8
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,the quality seemed good but they would not stay on my dogs feet,13,9
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,do not stay on toes drag when the dog walks labrador and they rotate around every time so the stiff grip bottom is on top,24,10
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,super frustrating fell off my dog after only about 20 minutes of playing in the snow size was correct,19,11
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,goodif you could glue them on my dogs feet,11,12
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,keeps the salt out of paw crevices wish they were water proof,12,13
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,did not really hold out a lot of hope for these but ordered them out of desperation my golden retriever loves the snow unless it is any colder than 10 degrees or so her feet freeze instantly we gave them a try and she tolerated them better than i had expected but the issue is keeping them on i fasten them as tightly as i can without cutting off circulation but within a few minutes at least one usually two slip off i have not given up on them and we will use them when absolutely necessary but they are really a bit of a hassle fyi my dog is roughly 65 - 70lbs and i ordered the large they fit fine,114,14
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,it is cute however it kept slipping from my dogs foot,10,15
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,amended my stars to 2 these are poorly made do not stay on positioning of velcro does not keep protectors in place and elastic sock top is useless extremely frustrating for dog and owner sent them back,40,16
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,we have 3 medium sized dogs who quickly start limping when the snow gets in their paws i did not want to spend a ton of money on boots for them and the regular muttluks can each cost as much a a pair of my shoes i decided to give these a go and could not be happier being short they are easier to get on than the regular muttluks we do own 1 pair of those and the dogs appreciate the least amount of fussing with their feet so we are all happy sometimes they lose one or 2 in the deep snow but it is not often enough to say they are not doing a great job,116,17
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,ordered for my pomeranian in a small they will fit a lab sizing is way off totally useless to me,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,our lab slips these off within seconds i will wait a few months to see if perhaps they are too big on him but I am doubting it,27,19
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,fits my 110 lb bernese mountain dog great,8,20
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,get the right size and wrap the velcro tight enough you should not have any problems with these falling off my dog drags his feet badly so i got these for protection he does not mind them at all great product great price,41,21
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,i bought these booties on wednesday just before a major snowstorm by saturday i was back in the store for a refund with two torn up booties that had fleece sticking out of the toes admittedly my dog loves snow so he ran around like crazy in the booties but unless you have a dog that only walks gingerly or only wears them inside i would not / not recommend these boots,70,22
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,these started coming apart at the toes after a few days i stitched them up on my sewing machine and a few days later they were coming apart again,29,23
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,i originally ordered the red but i received an email from the company that they were out of red would i take black instead with this years cold winter these boots are very popular we took in my moms dog when she passed away and we do not have a fenced yard so we walk her the dog is about 10 and when the temperature dropped below zero she would start to walk on three legs and sometimes sit or lay down in the street our local pet store only had rain boots which i bought based on the sizing chart i bought extra large for a german shepard they are too big but we used them while i found the muttluks online use their sizing chart our dog is small for a shepard so i bought the small boots and they are the perfect size make sure to pull the straps tight or they could come off and they are a little slippery on,165,24
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,they do not stay on very well and they are bulky using them for the winter nut not ideal for the long run,22,25
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,for my dog he would not have these on he immediately and successfully got both off in less than a minute my dog would need a more secure type of shoe it gets very very hot in the palm springs area in summer and i did not want my little guy to go barefoot in the 110 degree temperature outside,61,26
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,these are very cheaply made i thought I had try them because of their claim to be non-slip well no matter how tightly i secured these on my dogs feet if they did not come off they rotated around and around and around and around you get the picture so totally not worth it the only good point of these booties is that the toe material is a lot more flexible and soft i had bought another brand before they stay on great but the toe is just extremely stiff with no bend so very unnatural to walk in as my dog as told me and not very comfortable in the toe area these were more comfortable in the toe area but that was it,124,27
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,this is a good product for the price two straps would be nice and the boots would stay on better but it is a good value,25,28
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,i tried so hard to make these fit my dog was great i thought he may try to pull them off he did not what did happen was the boots falling off his paws as he walked around for a very short period of time nothing seemed to work i measured his paws as was instructed they just keep falling off,60,29
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,bought these for use indoors on a 70 lb lab mix had a pair of knock offs that she could shake off in just a few minutes these work very good for what we wanted indoor use for protecting our new hardwood flooring i would not recommend for outdoor use although as the fabric gets wet / dirty very easy,56,30
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,this was a waste of money my chihuahua would only wear them for a few minutes and then they would fall off i kept putting them back on her feet and finally got tired of putting them on her when she was wearing them she was able to walk on the wooden floors but it was not for too long before she was missing 1 or 2 shoes,67,31
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,i bought these dog boots for my two bulldogs we have tile and wooden floors and they often slip when walking as they are getting older i thought that these boots would help provide them a little more stability the product itself seems ok but my bulldogs neither one would wear these in fact within seconds they both had them off both bulldogs were able to pull the velcro strap with their mouths and release their paws very easily i put them on them a couple of times in hopes they would tire of me putting the boots back on but they insisted on keeping them off in the end buying this was a waste of money,117,32
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,i put the dog boots on my golden retriever and they fit fine my only problem was that i purchased them so my dog would not slide across the wood floors but the boots have no traction for wood floors i will try using non-slip socks next,46,33
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,I have used these to protect the hardwood floors from our dog at my moms house I have also used these to protect my dogs pads outside in some rough icy conditions they have a good non slip rubber bottom and velcro pretty tight they do loosen and fall off after a long while but well worth the price and my moms peace of mind about her new hardwoods,68,34
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,i have a german shepherd that drags his hind toes [ to the point of quicking his nails ] and planned to use these on his back feet while on our poolon first use when i apply them as tight as possible they do stay on however they immediately spun so he was walking on the fabric side not the bottom i then sewed the velcro strap across more of the boot thinking that would help it stay on properly it did not they still spin around he has now worn through the fabric side I shall have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up i expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each on the positive side he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on even during / after swimming if i were to order again i would go a size smaller i used the suggested measurement procedure and ordered the large but think a medium would definitely go on and maybe eliminate some of the other issues,187,35
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,the boots work fairly well they do tend to come off and turn around on the dogs foot during use,20,36
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,we were hoping to get rid of all the runners in our kitchen and hallway since our lab will not walk on the laminate floor once in a while she slips then will not walk anywhere she will walk on the floors with the hott doggers on but they do not stay on very well after two days i was tired of putting them on 5 or 6 times a day and gave up back to the runners,75,37
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1,negative,search for these somewhere else you can buy at least 3 sets for this price,15,38
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,these little boots are great our 1 year old german shepherd really did a number on the hardwood we recently had our floors redone and these are really great both to prevent scratching but also helps her with traction they are easy to put on and they stay pretty well the only suggestion i have is that they go up a little farther next time i might try a larger size,71,39
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2,negative,i bought these because we have hard wood floors and our black lab was having problems with traction on the floors when he tried for traction out came his claws and so did scratches in the floor the boots are easy to put on however once they are on they tend to roll and the bottoms become the top additionally the boots are easy for my lab to get them off so they are a nice introduction but I shall be looking for a bootie that is longer so it goes up my dogs foot further and stays on better,98,40
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,these skuffies are a god send to our older dog 14 1/2 kodi on our new hard wood floors easy to put on and she never even noticed them or acted like they bothered her the sticky part really helps her get up and keeps her from doing dangerous splits on our floor she reminds us of our grandma shuffling down the hall in her slippers so we call them skippers,71,41
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4,positive,upstate new york has had a very cold winter and these booties arrived in time and saved my poodles paws from freezing it takes a few times to get use to putting them on dog and a few times for the dog to get used to have dog booties on the velcro helps to keep the booties snug on the paws,61,42
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5,positive,we just remodeled our home to hardwood floors one of my dogs with long legs had trouble walking on them and we were afraid he would fall and get hurt he would lose his balance and sometimes have a leg slide out from under him we investigated different methods and decided on these booties they have worked very well and our dog can now walk confidently on our floors you can tell the difference in his ability when he has them on he knows he can walk anywhere in the house as without them he is very hesitate to walk and goes from rug to rug like he has island hopping thanks for a great product,115,43
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,the ramp does not lie flat on the back seat of my toyota corolla when my lab walks up it the ramp buckles and my dog slips off he could get hurt using it wish i could find a way to make the space larger or return it as is it is just taking up space in my storage she had the ramp has scratches on it from when my dogs nails tried to avoid falling off the uneven surface he slipped off it and could have gotten injured it does not fit on the back seat of a corolla,99,0
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,this is a sturdy half ramp and stays in place it is used on mywith the doggie door my senior sheltie feels secure and has no problem walking on it i also bought a solvit telescope pet ramp forstairs it too has worked out well very pleased,51,1
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,i recently found out my darling terrier olivia has arthritis she can no longer jump up into the car or our bed i bought two ramps one to keep in the car and the other for the bedroom she weighs 30 pounds and it is difficult for me to lift her so this product is invaluable for both of us it was so easy for her to figure it out i praise her each time she uses it and she seems to enjoy her new adventure the only recommendation i have is it would be helpful to have a handle to grab on to when attaching it to theof the car with the leash in hand one has to manipulate the ramp with only the other which is awkward,130,2
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,i bought this to help my dog get on the bed and he uses it every night each morning iit up against the wall and go to work so he does not get on the bed while I am not home he can jump off the bed just fine now i control when he can get on things and when he can not it is scratchy on the surface like sandpaper but he could care less he hardly waits for me to get it in place at night so he can walk up it to get on the bed it is very light and i can move it easily from one place to the other it also looks nice so i do not have to hide it in a closet so people will not see it worth the money,136,3
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,this ramp has helped my overweight small dog get in and out of my van without hurting her back and legs it is light weight and easy to use,29,4
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,this ramp did not do it for us it would not stay securely on the door ledge and even if it did it was way too steep it is also very bulky the surface is sandpaperish which i suspect did not feel too good on the dogs feet,48,5
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,our 15 year old cat loves to scamper up this ramp to reach his food bowl in our kitchen we put nonslip feet on it so we could increase the ramps height and incline and decrease how far it sticks out in the room smaller footprint unlike the ads picture of the ramp ours does not have a wavy surface,60,6
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,i injured my back and am unable to lift my 18 dog at this time i needed to find a solution to this problem since he is not a jumper i searched for a ramp that would work in my back seat i have a 4 dr sedan of my mid-size car not a van or suv this solvit half ramp is a littler narrower than most and it works for me at a slight angle he is able to go up the ramp to the back seat by himself the majority of the these ramps were made for vehicles other than sedan cars fortunately the width works for me the ramp is well designed well constructed and extremely light at 7 s the light weight design enables me to place the ramp in the front seat area so i can use it again for unloading for me the car storage works better than the trunk because of my back he is able to get out of the car reasonably well very pleased with my purchase,174,7
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,works great for a large dog and minivan very light and do not have to fold it yay,17,8
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,works as advertised wish my dogs were smart enough to use it on their own,15,9
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,wonderful product works great to get my pooch in and out of my minivan not intended for use with regular car doors as mentioned on the product description,28,10
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,too short really needed another foot in length,8,11
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,i ended up returning this product if you do not have a minivan sliding door this product will not fit your car still looking for a workable option for an aging arthritic golden retriever who loves to go for rides with us,40,12
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,the ramp does not include any type of clips to attach to anything i was going to use this as a permanent ramp for my older dog to get onto the patio but it just slips off,37,13
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,i tried to use this with my minivan and a larger dog with hind end weakness a little less than 100lbs the ramp is too short for it is supposed use the angle is too steep when used as shown in the picture and the ramp slipped and my dog fell when i put it on the lower lip it would work for a very small dog who can scamper up a steep incline but not by a dog which has any medical issues,83,14
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,there ramps are great i have two others inside and outsdie had them for years they work great for my little dog who had both leg surgeries,27,15
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,I am sure the product is ok but we did not even get to use it before our dog died i was not happy that amazon would not take it back even although it is still in it is original box unopened because it was past the time limit,45,16
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,small compact user friendly shipped on time very satisfied,9,17
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,this is very helpful but most of the time my maltese avoids it,13,18
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,it is very light weight and strong the surface is rough enough so as to prevent slipping but does not hurt the dogs pads good overall product,27,19
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,it works well and it has saved me from picking up my dog into the car,16,20
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,this is light and my 70 lb 14year old golden retriever manages to get onto the backseat of my audi a6 with slight difficulty it only just fits the doorway to the back seat and it somewhat awkward in view of the limited space it is very usable,47,21
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,works great for my small dog i am unable to lift him into car so an answer to a very big problem,22,22
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,the ramp is too steep for the back of my suv when i went to send it back to the seller is would cost me 20 at the post office or 33 atnot worth it i will just have to keep it since i only paid 44 for it,51,23
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,i dislike the surface material of the ramp i had to cover ramp with a towel to avoid hurting my babies paws,22,24
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,ramp is too steep and my lab was afraid to get on it,13,25
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,would not recommend because it does not hold stable to anything you have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it depending on what you are trying to do that is not very convenient,38,26
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,its just perfect for going to the dog park,9,27
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,although the ramp description says it can be used on a couch / sofa there is no way to attach to the couch or cushions so it kept falling off this defeated the purpose which was a safe avenue for my dog to get on the couch very disappointinghas been returned,52,28
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,it is too wide for our kia soul car doors just do not open wide enough,15,29
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,no i thought it would be sufficient to ramp from floor to bed too steep for my little yorkie he will not use it instead I am using it to block access to different areas,33,30
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,this is great ramp because it is one-piece and lightweight i use it to help a senior yellow lab get in and out of my car this ramp is a bit shorter than other dog ramps so perspective buyers need to keep in mind the degree of incline in situations where it will be used,55,31
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,returned it it would work for theshown in the picture but that is about it,16,32
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,i have two mastiffs with knee problems whenever i buy dog products i look for reviews from owners of massive sized breeds this ramp is wide enough and just long enough to make the 12 inchup into my mini-van easy for them it is also wide steady and heavy enough 7lbs not to be wobbly or to bounce,59,33
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,did not work for the sofa inside too steep but is ideal for saving the backs of my basset corgi and mini dachshund when coming from the patio through the doggie door,32,34
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,love the ramp dog had second back surgery we use this ramp on a drop-off on our backso our precious dog will not reinjure his back it is sturdy and durable,32,35
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,i do love this ramp it was easy to install and my 16yr old dog can use it with ease rather than climbing steps,24,36
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,i returned thisdid not work at all for my dog i do not see how it would work for any large dog,23,37
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,the ramp came quickly and it is very sturdy i have a subaru outback and it barely fits in the passenger door i have to anchor it with my foot at the bottom so it stays put so my dog can climb into the back seat i probably will try to put something along the bottom so it will not slide it would be great for a van where the door slides open instead of just opening,76,38
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,this ramp did not secure very well to my stairs therefore it was not safe for my pets to use the width of the ramp was good which was what attracted me in the first place but i had to return it because it did not fit well,46,39
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,it is fair the ramp was not secure when our dog walked up it wobbled and was unsteady for a 60 lb dog,21,40
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,the ramp is short and is very steep even on the side door of my mini van getting longer ramp,20,41
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,i bought this ramp because i needed something for my dog that was not too bulky or heavy for me to use the material on the ramp is very slippery and my dog scratched it up and fell the first time he tried to get in the car then it had scared him so he would not try it again my dog is medium sized 50 lb maybe it would work for small dogs i would not recommend this ramp i ordered a ramp with removable carpet from my local pet store and it works great,96,42
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,this is not well designed and clumsy i would not recommend thisto anyone with a sedan as it is too wide to fit in a back seat door opening,30,43
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,thiswas too large / wide for the door opening for my suv probably works best for vans or sliding doors,20,44
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,not a regular door so it is useless not a normal car with the width of a normal car door no way,22,45
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,a little cumbersome to haul around for a small dog would be great for a large dog and a van,20,46
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,my daughter owns a vw jetta the back seat door does not open wide enough for the ramp to fit,20,47
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,my car is a honday civic back door only opens 1/2 way and never noticed it before nothing wrong with the door it just does not open at right angle to vehicle door does not open far enough to allow for ramp to fit securely seems solidly built although,47,48
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,this is a very good alternative to the expensive brands it is just as good I have never seen a single tick or flea in any of my four dogs even although they play outside all day in the garden recommended,39,0
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5,positive,i have two big dogs and flea are a worry in my house i live far in a wooded area and there is a lot of brush the dogs can pick up all kinds of ticks and fleas also theirand larvae kills and repels mosquitoes works for me thank you,53,1
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2,negative,smells terrible guess no company makes good flea and tick repellant for what i pay it should also repel flies the other one i used was just as bad,29,2
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5,positive,will purchase again fast shipping my little girl is free of flees and ticks she love the grass and this product works great thank you,25,3
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,i like this stuff it is cheap and it works fine i use it on the animals i groom i have never had any problems with it,27,4
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,no better then any store bought product but it was cheaper ok shipping i would use this product again probably,20,5
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5,positive,i love this stuff i first purchased this product at tractor supply because it was on sale i used to live in an apartment complex so my two dogs would play with about 10 other dogs daily it was a dog oriented community and we loved it of course they got a lot of fleas within the first few days bad enough to where there were fleas in the house and in my bed so i had to try something i did not want to pay the outrageous 40 for the good stuff so i figured I had give this a shot i have one dog who is about 15 lbs and another who is about 35 - 40 lbs so i got this to use with both of them it was amazing within a day if not hours all the fleas were gone from my pets my house my bed thank god and the product actually smells pretty good an orangish citrus smell my dogs do not like when it is applied but i think that is because they do not like the squeezing noise when you apply it overall great product it is the only thing i will ever buy in the future plus it is a great price,201,6
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,seems to work on my 13 pound weiner dog it does appear to take a few days before it kicks in but overall i think it is effective and not too pricey when it is on sale the smell lingers but eventually it goes away no issues with dog being lethargic or having any allergic reaction overall good product,57,7
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1,negative,i put this product on my clean dogs bathed the day before 5 days ago and have yet to see any marked difference the poor things are still scratching,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1,negative,did nothing to control fleas on our sheltie if you have a similar long hair breed you might do better trying a different product,24,9
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1,negative,this product did not work on either of my two dogs i was very disappointed that it did not provide protection against fleas and ticks as advertised,26,10
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,i read before buying sentry pro that many of these topical flea medications can have alarming side effects i did not use quite as much as recommended rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product i have not seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad i think it is important to mention i took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax and bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days immediately after recognizing i had a flea problem i wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective likely some people find it easier to use the more expensive brand and if i had the extras money perhaps i would have also but i am satisfied as the product did what it promised,157,11
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5,positive,i use this product as a preventative measure and because the price is unmatched my dog has had no fleas and she spends a large amount of time outside i will continue to buy this product,38,12
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1,negative,i used this thinking it would prevent fleas but it did not work at all local pet store person told me that only advantage or frontline are really formulated to take care of fleas,33,13
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2,negative,I have used this twice on 2 different dogs it works ok on one but does nothing for the other i will not buy this brand again,26,14
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2,negative,bought this product because i like the sentry dog shampoo it smells good and has been one of my favs lately because of the flea season even although i use flea control on my dogs on a monthly basis it still happens in my place i bought this product and the flea trap planning to kill all both on the dogs and in the house none of the products still fleas on the dogs probably it is time to move on to the expensive brands,84,15
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,believe this has been discontinued and can understand why it is more like a new england chowder with steak strips tasty but not a philly,24,0
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,not bad but not up to campbells chunky usual taste standards will not bother buying again,15,1
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,i was really disappointed in this philly style cheesesteak chunky soup there was no taste whatsoever and it was very watery i have never seen a chunky soup as watery as say a chicken noodle soup i am use to them being more of a creamy soup like that of a potato or chowder style soup i do not recommend this experience to anyone,63,2
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,i thought the meat would be a little thicker,9,3
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,barely any body besides copious potato chunks few random mystery meat things i think they were thin square flakes anyone remember sos unidentifiable cheesiness was main flavor and marginally tolerable overpriced undelivered capitalization on an americana favorite hoagie if you love philly cheesesteaks avoid this unmentionable fake if you love weird flavored potato soup go for it just do not be expecting any steak,63,4
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,I have got an opposite result than everyone else on here it is like miso soup smells rancid like an old sock but tastes great for 2 it is great you know you guys can add other things to it the meat is not rubbery like they say i think this soup is ok i rather have this soup than nothing,57,5
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,I have been eating cambells soup for probably 60 years this is the worst i have eaten do not buy this for philly-cheese it is not even good potatoe shop,28,6
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,i am a huge fan of philly cheese steaks but i do not know what this was i had my mouth ready for cheesy meaty goodness and was thoroughly disappointed,29,7
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,it is so cool and so great nice for the price you can buy one for yourself or somebody else maybe,20,8
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,it is just white potatoe soup with tablespoon of meat if they called potatoe soup they would be more honest,19,9
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,easy to prepare and great with the proper amount of salt,11,10
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,these are pretty tasty quick meals as with most pre-packaged meals it is got a pretty high sodium content so if that concerns you maybe look elsewhere,26,11
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,buy this for my dog he loves it,8,12
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,this was so amazingly good you have to try it,10,13
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,i found the soup quite good despite the mixed reviews a soup is never going to taste exactly like a cheese steak sub from genos in philly so adjust your expectations it is tasty hearty and perfect for a chilly day,40,14
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,nothing like a cheese steak just a white cream soup with loads of potatoes nothing like the picture shows steak pieces 10 times smaller then the picture shows 1/5,29,15
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,nearly inedible there are more ingredients on the spoon on the label than there are in the entire can seriously just a can of white flavorless gravy with 3 - 4 potato cubes 5 - 6 flecks of green pepper and maybe 3 - 4 fingernail sized pieces of grey meat hate wasting food but the second can went in the trash,56,16
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,i usually love campbells chunky soups but this one is not something i will buy again it is a potato soup in a white cream sauce and what seemed to be leeks or green onions and thick chips of dry beef that seemed out of place i will puree the remaining cans i have in the blender before so it does not seem like some of the shipping box fell into the soup,72,17
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,hmmm well this soup is on the thin side of town with not much flavor the few pieces of meat in it are chewy and have the texture of a piece of overcooked shoe while i do like most campbells chunky products i would skip this one,47,18
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,short and to the point campbells chunky soup philly-style cheesesteak 188 ozi liked it,16,19
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,this company seems to have zero quality control how else to explain that some of the chunky soups which i have happily five-starred come from the same company that produced this watery flavorless concoction the soup depends upon the thin yellowish-white stock to establish the cheese credential but it is already mentioned lack of flavor means that whatever this product is it lacks a crucial ingredient and the word cheese in the title is simply misleading the steak ingredient is several tiny thin pieces of meatwhich lack the thickness the heft the substance and the flavor to resemble the satisfactory beefiness of even the worst cheesesteak sandwich i enjoyed while living in the philadelphia area finally the necessary onion component is essentially missing here i found a very few small pieces of onion so overprocessed they lend scant flavor there are also a very few very small potato cubes which of course have nothing to do with a philly cheesesteak sandwich i truly urge you to bypass this product,166,20
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,this was good but not as great as some of campbells other soups,13,21
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,love philly cheesesteaks really dislike this soup it tastes nothing like a cheesesteak sandwich,14,22
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,1not as tasty a s i had hoped,8,23
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,this soup was pretty good it had a good flavor the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because there was not very much steak in it it only had a few small pieces in the entire can the steak did not have a lot of flavor either if they add more steak to this product it would be a lot better,61,24
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,lots of potatoes and the meat is sorta like it is in the sandwiches pretty good and creamy,18,25
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,it smells amazing and even when you first put it in your mouth it taste ok and then it hits you the rubbery meat that tastes horriblej i tried to just strain it and keep the potatoes and throw the meat out and it was decent kinda reminded me of cream of broccoli,53,26
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,so gross they need to stop selling this,8,27
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,i am a can soup eater and usually have this for lunch four days every week i like a lot of campbells chunky but this is not one of my favorites does not live up to it is name of chunky,40,28
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,this is a tasty soup and kept me full and satisfied all day,13,29
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,1,negative,just finished a bowl ok the whole can i really tried to like it i wanted to like it who does not like a philly steak sandwich well this is terrible really can you say after taste the good thing is i bought only one can i hope i did buy two cases of the wicked thai style chicken soup another reiview,61,30
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,heh tastes and smells like cheesesteak i dunno man goes well with crackers,13,31
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,this was part of a care package the recipients were very pleased,12,32
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,i really do not know what to say about this purchase you know what i mean it is chunky soup that does not taste like a sandwich but i like it there has really no surprises here and it is claim to fame would be that the beef chunks are pretty big but what you really need to do is pay attention to pricing on these prime pantry orders day to day because when they are left in your cart a couple of days you might see the overall price change to 30 higher and then you find out that your cans of corn went from 6 to 36 or something even worse so the soup is typically decent chunky but really keep a close watch on the price changes in your cart I shall recommend this creamy soup that somehow does not taste like a sandwich,139,33
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,this soup is pretty good it could use some more flavor and more meat because it is mostly potatoes the meat to potato ratio is off but it is filling and satisfying i might order it again,37,34
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,this one was good so unexpected flavor wise but good you have to be in the mood for it because a philly steak is not soup it is unusual and different and a fun flavor will buy again but will not eat every day,41,35
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,flavor combination was off texture was odd also,8,36
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,one of the betterstyle soups campbells came out with,9,37
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,does not taste like philly cheesteak but it is still pretty good I had say it is like eating an m m and expecting it to be a skittle still good but not the right flavor,31,38
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,2,negative,this is one of those things that is delicious for 2 bites and then gets old really fast it pretty much overwhelms you with cheese sauce it might be good as stock for a casserole,35,39
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,5,positive,a hit around this house good flavor and textures definitely on the buy again list,15,40
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,2,negative,too salty 9 dmv salt per serving what has the point of publicizing a healthy greens juice if not publicizing also high sodium,22,0
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,2,negative,i bought this by accident thinking it was caribbean greens which i love if you like a pure spinach taste this is for you if not stay away,28,1
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,5,positive,i always trust v8 products to be a healthy option,10,2
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,this is a great value for what you get I have been juicing for some time was doing it full time and lost a lot of weight and felt much better making your own juice every day is great for you but can be time consuming and expensive this is a super convenient option for healthy juicing it is not fresh juice quality but still better than getting something ultra processed or going for fast food,74,3
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,takes some getting used to not too bad,8,4
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,initially i did not like after taste but i hate things going to waste i got used to it and now enjoy something that is healthy for me,28,5
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,1,negative,if something taste awfull i do not care how good it is for you i would not use it,18,6
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,2,negative,not a fan of the taste not sure which ingredient puts me off but i will not be buying again probably others will find it just fine chacun a son gout,32,7
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,good juice but it is only 75 juice wish it was 100,11,8
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,1,negative,it was not very tasty to each their own thou,11,9
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,product is fine i am so pleased that there are more products without high fructose corn syrup but the prime pantry shipping packaging is terrible one shipment did not make it the last one barely did please package these better,39,10
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,5,positive,great taste flavor and with lower sugar so much better than the regular,13,11
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,5,positive,since I have started on this green juice i have lost 57 lb it is only been 1 month,17,12
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,2,negative,not what you would think it tastes like very bitter and sour,12,13
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,2,negative,i personally did not care for the flavor,8,14
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,1,negative,sooo when i bought this i figure it will have a great taste due to the ingredients it listed and boy was i wrong nasty taste my kids did not like it i did not like it this is all my personal opinion,41,15
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,1,negative,the combination of juices in this juice blend did not taste good to me would not buy it again,18,16
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,5,positive,i like this very much i taste more pear than anything,11,17
Prime_Pantry,B00TH1SKR8,4,positive,i wish it was not pasterized otherwise it is very good,9,18
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,i have been using the bior nose strips for 20 years i bought these since i was curious and can not tell if they are more effective than the white strips since they are black it is hard to see how much gunk they pull out of my pores you will also need to use a heavy duty paper towel or inexpensive wash cloth to remove the black residue from your face i am not sure how well it washes out of fabric i use expensive wash clothes and as soon as i saw what was left on my face i did not chance removing it with one of them in the future i will stick with the white bior strips since i prefer to see their effectiveness,126,0
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,did not nearly work as well as i thought it would i would not recommend these to anyone because did not even pull anything out the regular strips gave me a much better result,32,1
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,does not stick as well as the original cleansing strips when pulling off the charcoal strip hardly anything was pulled and it left charcoal in my pores needing to re-wash again,30,2
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,did not work as well as the ones i bought from target maybe an old product,15,3
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,i love the original biore strips and thought these would be the next generation with improvements i did not get the sense that these were any better or even as good as the originals I shall stick with those,39,4
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,cleanse your face and while still wet apply the strip to your noseit sticks better if you fan dry itany residue left on your skin comes off with cold water or toner which i recommend using to close your pores to prevent future breakouts,44,5
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,the regular pore strips worked a lot better these ones did not really do anything for me,16,6
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,this is the first time i ever used a biore charcoal strip and it works better than the regular biore strips which are the white ones they makes me skin smoother and i feel like they definitely pull out more of the oil and dirt than the white biore strips,50,7
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,they really do not work well I have used the regular kind too and always felt that they were nit very effective i thought maybe with the charcoal aspect they might have improved but i was wrong and it was a waste of money,42,8
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,tonight i tried biore pore strips for the first time i have a moderate amount of blackheads on my nose and cheeks nothing that bothered me too much but i figured if i could get rid of them why not i washed my face keeping my nose wet and put the strip on i left it on for the recommended 10 minutes even although i did not think i had that many blackheads i was amazed by how much came out and how better my nose looked it was a little hard to get off but the results were fantastic and i will be using these weekly,106,9
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,these work great on my boyfriends oily large-pored nose i will not subject anyone to pictures of the results but it looks like a little forest of dead skin cells and blackheads once the strip is peeled away the activated charcoal does leave some black residue behind but it is easily wiped away with a damp paper towel,57,10
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,these little things are wonderful they work great and this is my first time trying and i love them i will be ordering more,24,11
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,took out a bunch of blackheads with this they do not feel as tight and awkward as the regular ones but i did not notice any more coming out versus the regular,30,12
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,i do not think these work as well as the regular ones the box came completely squished would not recommend,19,13
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,there has something so cleansing about biore this one does not dissappoint i actually did not realize i bought the charcoal one but since i have it tried it and love it enjoy clean pores s,33,14
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,i have used many pore strips in the past including some homemade ones i used these for the first time and i saw all the gunk come right out it was disgusting but pleasing to see a cheap product do it is job so well i was very pleased and will re purchase the only downside would be the leftover black residue left around my nose but that came off quickly with a gentle exfoliator i recommend,77,15
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,stick to the original these do not work as well,9,16
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,these are no better than the regular biore strips but much more expensive,13,17
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,i have used biore strips forever decided to give these charcoal strips a try it seemed like they never really dried / hardened and i do not think they were as effective or effective at all at removing blackheads will not be buying again,41,18
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,original biore nose strips work wayyyyy better than this i used 1 time and will not use the rest of the package it did not do anything,26,19
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,these pulled out some gunk from my pores but did not work as well as i was hoping 4 stars because my boyfriend had better luck than i did i think it all depends on the shape of your nose,39,20
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,unpleasant there are others with better taste and same carbs,10,0
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,i wanted the like these but each flavor tasted exactly like the others i was thrown off by the puffed rice texture when they was no rice in it gave them 2 stars because of the low calories and the convenient size otherwise i would be giving them one star,50,1
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,at first i thought these were a bit pricey but when they arrived i saw that these are much bigger than the average energy / protein bars very filling as well in fact i could not even get through an entire bar without feeling full already so the price is actually very good for the amount the bars are not what i expected as far as protein bars go they are more like rice crispies rather than a traditional bar i loved the lemon-coconut a lot but the cinnamon and peanut butter ones were a little too dry for me,98,2
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,without a doubt one of the worst snack bars we have ever tried no one in the family liked any of the flavors we ended up tossing them out,29,3
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,did not care for the texture or taste of these bars,11,4
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,only the coconut lemon flavor really tastes good surprisingly it is hard to find a protein bar that has low sugar high protein and a decent taste so I am happy i found these will be ordering the lemon coconut in the future,41,5
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,i like the taste of all three flavors low ingredient list high protein and fiber low sugar perfect bars for me i order these regularly now,25,6
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,I had give it zero but i bought them at clearance price so i should have known my bad,18,7
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,not bad just a bit different taste than i expected - ],11,8
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,not sure why people are complaining about the taste unless they are expecting a candy bar all three flavors are unique and have reasonably good flavor texture and consistency is similar to a rice krispies treat think light and puffy,40,9
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,my go to breakfast bar great taste with lots of protein,11,10
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,they kind of hurt your tongue but whatever it is food,10,11
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,texture is simpler than expected no pieces of nuts or other ingredients but good flavor,15,12
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,it is ok but they are small bars but good to low in sugar for diabetics,16,13
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,so far i tried the lemon coconut and the cinnamon pecan they are okay tasting but not easy to eat i think because the bars are mostly made of puffed grain so they are extremely dry I am not a big fan of the flavors but it is nearly impossible to find a protein bar that tastes good and is not a ton of sugar and calories so i do not hold the flavor of these bars to a very high standard i think as a quick supplement to hold you over until a better meal these are fine i will finish the box and just remember to have a drink handy to help get them down,112,14
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,I have tried every protein bar out there and simply protein is one of the best it is not like the sticky pasty or cardboardy bars these have texture simliar to rice crispy treat the lemon coconut is my favorite also the bar still tastes / looks good if i smoosh it at the bottom of my bag unlike some other bars that melt or totally fall apart if they get smooshed,69,15
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,would not purchase again got the job done for a cross country move did not look appetizing and only tasted okay sticking with my beachbars,25,16
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,if you think you might enjoy the mouth-feel of slightly flavored bound together birdseed you will love these,17,17
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,these taste good but i did not love them,9,18
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,i do not understand all the negative remarks about a protein bar what do people expect to get the taste of a snickers in a low sugar high protien bar if you want something with more taste go buy a milky way or snickers as for this product it is as it states a good protein bar the lack of taste so to speak is because of the lesser amounts of sugar which i like i loved them,77,19
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,should have listened to the other reviews this bar is essentially dry puffed soy bits stuck together with a little flavoring there really is not much to it other than that and they do not particularly taste all that great either the flavoring is very light and it is just an additive i found one piece of coconut in the coconut bar just enough to be able to legally add it to the ingredients list on the back far and away over priced for what you get which is essentially a small health food version of a rice krispy treat,98,20
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,what an odd texture like rice crispies with a bit of flavor they are dry and crumble in your hand,20,21
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,yuck i have to drink water after every bite just go get them down so coconutty and dry,18,22
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i recently got an etrex summit gps and bought this software in order to download the trips i take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them the bottom line is that this 3 cd-rom set does not contain nearly enough information to do that i took a 4 mile hike this weekend near san francisco and downloaded it to the software it does show the track that we walked but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can not tell that we went up and down gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated furthermore the road into the park was not drawn correctly the ranger station and other services were not marked and so on in short the maps provided will not allow you to plan a hike which was the point in the first place right,155,0
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,these maps contain a good amount of detail within the confines of existing technology the maps include dirt roads hiking trails streams waypoint and of course elevation changes these maps cover the entire us and are used in conjunction with garmin gps units i would recomend this software to anyone with a garmin gps who wants to camp or hike with their gps as a navigation tool however be aware they will not be accurate enough in many situations and you probably want to have a secondary navigation tool available to you my experience with the unit has primarily been driving through forest areas and short hiking and camping outings,110,1
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i bought the garmin gpsmap 60csx and about 40000 worth of software i was under the impression that the topo us 2008 product was the digital equivalent of the usgs 24k but due to space concerns i assumed it would be perhaps half the resolution otherwise my gps would be the size and weight of a car battery i was greatly mistaken at how inaccurate it was after reading many other reviews i said heck with it and ignored thesayers in favor of purchasing it in my opinion thisis worthless i recommend that others avoid it garmins units are great but their maps and licensing especially the unlock wizards are a joke i recommend buying another product altogether thesayers are correct,129,2
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,i found mapsource to be a top rated program with a short learning curve i like it,17,3
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i paid a lot of money for this cd upgrade for my garmin and i still have not downloaded it after a year i took it to two expert computer shops and they can not do it i went to website downloaded countless updates and drivers and it still will not work i will never buy a garmin product again,57,4
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,it is taking me a while to get a hang of this product but I am able to download and upload tracks for my etrex legend and that was my main goal trip planning also looks useful it does not have many national forest trails in it and the trails it does have are generally poorly labled it is still a good way to make my gps more useful and possibly avoid picking up too many free trail maps to clutter my gear closet one gripe i have but may be me learning is that you do not seem to be able to open a saved map file and then add a new track to it that makes it hard to create a long-term record of ones hikes,123,5
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,if you want more detail then get the larger scale maps these serve the purpose of their scale 1100000 if you need more detail then you will need mapsource us topo 24k national parks it has a scale of 124000 that should be all the detail you need i only give 4 stars because it does not have some of the main trails of the northeast,65,6
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,good as long as you do not require detailed maps and topography certainly better than the base map pre-installed on most garmin units but simply lacking in detail,27,7
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,they sent me version 302 so i have to download updates to get it up to version 6x why do they send outdated versions and place the burden on the consumer and of course you will only realize your software is outdated when you have mind boggling problems getting it to work or even installed this is the way to drive away customers,62,8
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,i bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60csx gps and so far it is been great for that I have also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop and that is worked out well too my only compliant is that the back roads are not labeled on my gps screen so it makes it hard when I am driving and want to know quickly what road I am looking at but the routes are pretty accurate so i can usually identify by that also some of the data is out of date for those remote roads I have found a couple so far that are listed as roads but have been converted to hiking trails or reverted to elk trails many years ago coupled with a more detailed and sometimes more recent although not always forest service map it is just fine well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen gps maps,152,9
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,i love this product first copy this disk to your hard disk and then install from there then you do not have to used the cd each time youthe mapsource application also be sure to download the latest version of mapsource from garmin after you install the cd version,50,10
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,basically what you would expect in a 124k topo set the thing to be aware of is that these are topo maps not trail maps although they do seem to have a lot of the major trails on them I am using them to plan a trip to four national parks this fall one notable feature of this set is that it can be installed 100 onto the computer hard drive without jumping through any hoops so once you have installed the maps you can put the cds away for safekeeping,90,11
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,their software is very bad difficult to use expensive full of errors and gives a lot of problems a package costs over 100 and it does not even work,28,12
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,mapsource topo us has out dated maps by at least 6 - 10 year in pa and half the time the map dose not line up with the gps with roads and elevation when i emailed them about update i was told that the government sends them update and they have not gotten any in a while to me it sounds like there depending on other people to do there work for the price they charge they should be checking on the updates or doing them,83,13
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information i was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too certainly mountains do not change often but some trail land does i got it for terrain information of hawaii and it was adequate in this instance there was not the option of using the national park mapset i can not say personally but i would hope the national park mapset is more up to date,97,14
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i got this software a couple of months ago and i still have not been able to figure out how to use it the instructions that come along with the package assume you are a computer geek pass on this unless you have a lot of time to try and figure out how to make good use of it,58,15
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,this software used in combination with my gps is fantastic i am more confident in the woods even in the dark the best part is while on the road I shall never have to stop and ask for directions again you will never have to admit to your wife your lost again,50,16
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,many people have complained about the inaccuracies and lack of detail that garmins topo software provides however i am completely satisfied with this product it has more than adequate detail for my hiking and mountain biking needs and provides a ton of additional roadways over the basemap those of you who just intend on getting by with your basemap do not know what you are missing if you intend on doing a lot of out of state travel you would be wise to also invest in garmins city navigator software which places more emphasis on maps of major metro areas the software is a joy to use requiring little effort to copy maps onto a compatible gps also mapsource topo does not require an unlock like other garmin products just install and go,131,17
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,not for the serious hiker this map is way off on it is accuracy want to plan a hike on your pc before hand forget it contours are 100 feet incurements very limited reference points actually had me on the wrong side of a creek no bench mark refferences use your garman gps it is a great tool but do not waste your time or money with this map stick to your usga maps,70,18
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i just purchased this software with a garmin etrac legend i drove to the seacoast down many major highways that were not on the map even although they are 10 to 15 years old on my garmin i am always north of the features on the map i do not know if this is a map error or a gps error the mapsource software on the cd is old by several versions the new software is free online you do get what you pay for this software is not expensive but it is not very good on detail either,98,19
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,probably mapsource deserves a higher rating but i have only used it deer hunting in eastern oregon so far it was easy toand added a lot of detail even in a very rural area with only forest service roads the contours helped me to keep from falling into a ravine and being forced into a direction that i did not want to go i can not wait tomore of the map and some different areas i like the fact that you only have towhat you will be using it did not take as much memory as i expected it would i would not use a gps without it again,113,20
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,it is easy tobut the data is old and does not show accurate local information it was too broad for my use,24,21
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,i bought this software to help navigate the logging roads and mountain biking trails in north kitsap county washington state what trails are shown are largely accurate but not perfect some logging roads show a dead-end where it actually continues still although it is way better than nothing and impressive topo data,51,22
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,pros 1 memory requirements are no problem the 64 mb card can easily swallow several states worth of maps 2 if you do not mind not having street names depicted this software can easily allow you to course navigate with the plethora of street detail included 3 contour and waterway detail is spot-on 4 overall i was impressed with the logging roads and trails depicted for the state of maine they matched my delorme paper maps contour-for-contour cons 1 you can not input two waypoints and get turn-by-turn navigation guidance for highway travel a la mapquest rather you have to manually enter waypoints for every bend in your journey and this goes for pc set-up 2 if you want your track to remain right on the depicted road while traveling on highways you must stay in a higher scale cuz when you zoom in you almost inevitably end up a millimeter or two off course on your screen 3 price,156,23
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,while some of the maps are somewhat outdated the program provides decent to even very good coverge to make the gps 60 much more functional without this software you are missing out on much of the capabilities of the garmin 60 series to me it is a must have,47,24
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,very imprecise poor and obsolete software lack of trails roads and more could be even danger in the remote area to person who trust it you will have some use but rather with good paper topographic map,37,25
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,if you understand this products limits before you buy it you will be happy it shows topographical contours rivers and most streams for the entire united states in addition to that it shows roads that were in existance 10 - 20 years ago these major roads are also named the limit is that newer roads do not show up it also does not support auto-routing even if your gps does garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package is not suited for it the product support could be better neither the manual nor web site tell you how toall 3 cds on your computer so you do not have to swap cds when transitioning between zones the companys web site does not give a good explanation of what the software can and can not do you will be disappointed if your expectations are not grounded in reality garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available,169,26
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,i went to the ponderosa and sawtooth mountains with my new mapsource all of the major trails and many of the smaller ones i hiked were mapped the screen was easy to read at both close-up and enlarged formats i would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the mountains and forests,52,27
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,if you hike in areas not covered by mapsources national parks 24k then this is the only way to get topo maps into your garmin gps unit the scale is 1100000 in united states topo whereas the national parks version is 124000 so you get less detail but complete coverage one nit-pick although it is not garmins fault the 1100000 scale usgs maps are in metric so garmin converted the meter contours to feet which means that even contours like 1000 meters is shown as 3280 feet at least you do not have to deal with elevations in meters although,97,28
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,this gps mapping program is a real disappointment to begin with there is insufficient documentation to get started using it once you do fumble your way through you discover that it lacks detail enough to be very useful it is an outdated program for todays powerful gps units,48,29
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,the detail is pretty poor i was expecting better since the bluecharts and citi select is outstanding,17,30
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,the detail on this software is horrible there has an area we like to go camping and i found the area with this software it has one of the 3 major lakes in the area shows none of the forest roads hiking trails or campsites and i have it set on highest detail garmin makes great hardware but horrible software,59,31
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i found out today 06/28/06 from garmin after i contacted them about a transter problim with the cd software that the last update to the soft was in 1999 i was superised that the program is this old frankly that is not addiquit but there is nothing i can do with that,50,32
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,for hiking purposes these low detail topo maps are just barely ok there has so little detail it is not easy to create waypoints on your gps if your hiking trail is not already represented on this cd and believe me the trail data on this cd is not remotely up-to-date or detailed i honestly can not reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain united states parks one should always rely first on a godd printed hiking trail map but sheesh i was expecting more from these garmin maps,102,33
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i live in colorado and am amazed at how terrible the maps on garmins mapsource are rivers start and stop roads that have been there since the 1800s do not show up none of the trails are named it is really bad i would think that if garmin was going to force us to by their maps they would make an effort to improve them i would say that anyone with a garmin who is going to use it for 4wd roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints,91,34
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i was very dissapointed in finding that the maps on the cd is very outdated the one cover the areas around my house just outside denver must be over 30 years old i am also dissapointed by the resolution of the maps not even near the picture shown on the box,51,35
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,this software loaded easily on to my pc i was able to use it on the pc and then download it to my garmin 60cs without a problem i have not used all the features but for the off road riding i have done since i bought the software it has definately helped when navigating especially trying to find the fastest way back to base camp using roads that is powerline or forest roads my only complaint is that this software does not show all the roads and trails in the forrest i was riding in however it was comprehensive none the same,100,36
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,this is great product it has great detail and is extremely easy to use i found it a perfect match for my uses from work to hunting,27,37
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,you sent the correctbut we did not order the one we really wanted i returned the garmin etrex vista and you sent refund information thank you now my daughters boyfriend has ordered the correct one for me the garmin map source cd rom is fine and we are keeping it,51,38
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,i was not sure what i was getting when i purchased this topo package but am very pleased it is a great addition to the tools that geocachers use with plenty of detail i was also surprised that many of the better known trails especially in state and national parks are marked on the maps however it is easy to get spoiled by that and i find myself wishing more of the trails were marked i still feel that this software will exceed most peoples expectations my state of virginia takes up about 36 mb of storage on my gps so to store a whole lot you will need a gps with a lot of room i loaded mine with just the areas i frequent the most and any planned geocaching areas as the need arises also if you know you are traveling to an area you can print the topo map and put it in a zip lock bag for a map to go,160,39
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,a great map to have when you are out hiking off the trail i can find the easiest route around hills and swamps i wish to avoid long before they become a problem,33,40
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,the topo softwear that is offered by garmin is the poorest quality i have ever seen i called garmin myself and found out that they have not updated the topo softwear in more than a decade plus they have rivers labled as strems major roads missing and no road where there should be a road i was so discusted with garmin i sent my gps unit back if your looking for good quality topo softwear for a gps unit try lowrance gps units there much better than garmin lowrance updates there softwear regularly,93,41
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,if you are looking for a product that provides reasonable topography for camping hiking or just plain trail blazing this is it it is not intended to be used as a street map / guide although it has most major roads amazons price was great and i really enjoy the product my one nit is the installation instructions should indicate to install all cds on your hard drive then actually perform the installation by doing this eliminates the need to insert a cd everytime you want to pull up a chart,89,42
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,it was not easy but i finally got my us topo software installed so i do not have to mess with the cds garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install basically you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder using the copy command from the drop down menu will not work so you have to work around this issue on the second and third cd you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called east alaska and hawaii once done it will take a while do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive i had called customer support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes i discovered that the customer support at garmin sucks i love the gps i love the software but the customer support is a total waste of time amazoncom was quick with delivery offered my gps and software at a fair price and they were a pleasure to deal with as usual i will continue to purchase from amazoncom,195,43
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,not recommended due to poor graphics delorme mapping is a much better product,13,44
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,the software is great but i had to learn from the garmin technical support how to install the software on my hard drive without having to keep the cds handy it is simple just copy the cd s to your hard drive then install from there if you have already installed the software you will have to uninstall it first,56,45
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,i use this software in a gps map 76cs when riding an atv it shows many existing atv and snowmobile trails sometimes with the trail name it also shows most logging roads with names where applicable streams lakes and ponds are also listed it is very accurate and makes it easy to see where you are in relation to known landmarks it is just what i was looking for,67,46
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,i purchased the us topo 24k national parks series last year because i needed topos of death valley this year i needed topos of nevada so i bought united states topo i was expecting the detail to be less than adequate but was pleasantly surprised every trail and jeep road we traveled was shown as well as all the abandoned mines and quarries we visited if you do not need the terrain detail of the 24k series give united states topo a try first the one thing i am disappointed with is the programs insistence of having the cd in the drive to work this is quite annoying mapsource city select and united states topo 24k both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive united states topo should too,129,47
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,lots of interesting data such as peaks and other landmarks the data is not very detailed sometimes however I am guessing that the data came from the 15 topo maps on a trip i made to yosemite the data had the same error contained on the 15 topo maps and the yosemite park maps itself apparently the 75 map has the right data the data had to do with the layout of some drainages,73,48
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,the mapsource topo map cd is a great addon for the garmin gps units the original maps that were preloaded on the gps handheld unit were very minimal and now i have all the detail i need with the handheld unit i am a paper map kind of a person so i am very happy with the level of detail that comes with this program now my gps has enough detailed information to tell me exactly where i am so i can find myself on a paper map excellent simple program,91,49
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i bought this cd to help me plan a hunting trip in alaska i had planned on using the computer topo in conjunction with my gps to plot routes to lakes valleysto hunt the topo maps for the area i am planning on hunting are incomplete there are large lakes missing from the map so the cd is limited in it is usefulness to me i have a paper topo of the same area and will be able to make my hunt no thanks to the cd-topo,88,50
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,compared to magellan mapsend the detail provided by mapsource was poor not up to date and overall poor quality,19,51
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i bought this product to be able to upload topo maps onto my garmin etrex vista this is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your garmin unit other software claims to work with your garmin gps but they only download / upload waypoints this software is way overpriced it runs off the cd-rom so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps i tried copying the cds to my drive and installing from there and it would not work when pulling waypoints / routes / tracks from the gps unit mapsource always opens up a new map document you can not import into the map you have open without copying and pasting this is probably the most overpriced counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since ms office what this all boils down to is if you need detailed topo maps for your garmin unit you will have to she shall out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software,158,52
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,this product is what it is it is not a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it it is a basic set of topo maps that shows most local roads what do you want for under 100 for a set of maps that covers the entire united states it does not have every street name the water maps are a little sparce and some of the feature names are dated i bought i like it i use it for what it is good for bottom line is that this is a tool like any other you would not build a car engine with nothing but a 5 pair of pliers but you could you can mow your entire lawn with a 29 string trimer but you would not this is a basic 100 set of maps of the entire united states for the price you can not beat the detail if i had it to do over again i would still buy topo united states because it works for me,169,53
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i call garmin directly and asked them if i can find a product which helps me find new trails and i can install it on my notebook without using the cd the told me i need to use topo united states i loaded the program but it needed the cd i found out in here how can i install so never ask for the cd this is nasty the trail detail is that it will give you a point i hope at least the trail is crossing it i am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point maybe it is a vertical trail straight up i hate the map i still like the gps do not buy this it is a waste of money attila csakberenyi,131,54
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i installed this software package on my year-old computer but when i tried to start it i just got an error log file to be emailed to garmin their tech support department was closed worse another garmin software package metroguide had now stopped working and the windows uninstaller kept crashing when i tried to remove them a good hour and a half later i have finally reinstalled metroguide and made it run but united states topo is going back to the store i already have enough things that do not work,89,55
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,this software is garbage it barely works even after being updated to the latest version available on their web site try zooming in or panning the map or transfering to your gps and 90 of the time it will crash or tell you an error occured i can not beleive a company with a name like garmins would ship something so completely useless and overpriced if you have a garmin gps and you want maps for your gps you are stuck with garmins software so do not buy a garmin gps either,90,56
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,to bad there was not a choice to give this 0 stars mapsource maps are not good enough to deserve 1 star i spent over a thousand bucks on a garmin streetpilot and the mapsource unlock keys the streetpilot would be a great investment if it used maps other than those ones produced by mapsource if i use my streetpilot as the gps receiver and hook it up to my laptop and run microsofts mappoint i get much more detailed maps and better accuracy if garmin wanted to improve their product they would leave the hardware alone and ditch mapsource,97,57
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,the maps are a great addition to my etrex vista downloading was a piece of cake i was able to get the entire state of mississippi and parts of the surrounding states on the vista 24 mb every road and back road that is several years old are on here typical of any topo map you can go to garmins website to see what is shown in your area going from having only the major roads to having all land marks streams small lakes elevation lines really adds to the gps the amount of detail can be adjusted to your preference I have also been impressed with how accurate your position relative to the landmarks are i rated it only 4 stars because i noticed the price got jacked up from 76 to 90 bucks i bought this only 2 weeks ago,135,58
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,this works adequately on my new gps v the only problem is the topo maps do not allow auto-routing by the v to calculate routes around trails and more so it is back to standard gps map navigation but one use I have found is this some points of interest are not in the gps v base map nor are they in the against city select software so i simultaneouslythe topo software and presto i can pick out the topos points of interest set a waypoint up then route to it via the city select map it works fine that is unless you are finding a place which doenst have a road but for driving to trail heads and other topo type features it is helped me but it loses a star since i can not route directly on the topo maps on my v,137,59
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,i had said not to buy thisbecause it was an old version that was not true there are 2 versions on the product the application is version 409 the newest shipping version the maps are version 302 they are rarely updated amazon is a great place to purchase this,52,60
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,in a prior review i stated that the mapsource topographical software looked good on the computer screen but that i had not yet tested it in the field now i have i gave it it is first tryout on a long difficult mountain bike ride in a remote part of henry willard coe state park near gilroy california it worked as well on the gps as it did on my pc and again i have no hesitation in recommending it perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with united states geological survey topographical maps or other navigation aids so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed i agree with a prior review that it would be helpful to include a feature displaying the elevation profile of a given route,135,61
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,i am very disappointed with this software where quadrangles have been spliced together the roads railroads rivers and contour lines do not meet across the join line signatures change at quadrangle borders also the data are not up to date in hamden the canal rail-trail is shown as an active railroad finally there are very few identified streets overall the product looks like a rough draft rather than a finished product,71,62
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,the software works fine and uploads easily the maps seem to be 10 plus years out of date since they are missing sections of state highway and local streets in the greater seattle area that have been completed for at least that long it also does not include street names for local streets only state and federal highways i noticed it does include local streets for some small villages in alaska i definately would not recommend this set for urban navigation but i do like the topigraphocal features and the shoreline markers but have not been able to determine if they are up do date,105,63
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,we bought this software for the purpose of locating hiking trails and downloading the info into our etrex vista the vista by the way is a great little unit this topo software is not anyway the topo software did not contain a single hiking trail for many of the falls that we hike to in the adirondacks thumbs way down for this product if you are a hiker,68,64
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i bought this product for hikes and to guide me in navigating rivers only very major roads are named so i can not use this very easily to calculate my route there most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should the elevations and detail are very course no trails are shown i am not very happy i bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job fyi i bought this to use with my etrex legend which i think is just great,128,65
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,this product did exactly what i needed it to do and at a very reasonable price this used edition came in very good shape looks like it was hardly used used the upgrade available from garmin just went to help check for updates the program then works well with my garmin gps 60csx,53,66
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,i did not care for this product because the maps for the areas to the west of the mississippi river have no street level detail to show county roads or streets away from major cities good luck trying to plot a course to a location out in the country that is any distance 1 mile or more off of a major interstate highway or is not a national landmark,68,67
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,garmin products come with an unlock code they can only be installed on one computer and used on one garmin gps device i bought this produce used and so it is my own fault for not considering that the unlock code would be used as well so yes the disks are in perfect condition yes these are genuine garmin disks no i can not use them to put topo maps into my garmin legend purchasing garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment if you are going to buy them you need to buy them new and you need to purchase one copy for every device you are going tothe maps on so if you have three garmin gps units in your family you need to purchase three copies of the software shame on garmin,135,68
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,i bought this for my son in law to use for fire mapping in wyo he has happy with it so i am too,23,69
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,product arrive ahead of schedule and was exactly as advertised i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one,21,70
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,so someone gave me a garmin 60csx with the united states topo 3 cd set i was excited and was hoping i could use this gps for navigation on road and in the boat apparently not first off it takes hours and hours to figure out the mapsource software that is once you finally download the right version then it is not clear anywhere that addresses are not included so after wasting hours i finally do some google searching to find out these maps cover nothing at all really and trails or whatever else you might want good luck i simply wish the names of rivers were on the darn thing i live in florida we do not have mountains so i am scratching my head wondering what good this thing is i guess since i am a boater i could spend 300 to get the bluechart but after seeing the value of the topo maps i am concerned about throwing good money away for a lackluster product oh well it was free so who really cares i can always use it on the boat as a backup unit,189,71
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,this mapping software for my gps garmin 76csx was a great help in finding trails and roads it was close for elevation in the area thanks,26,72
Software,B00005AFI4,5,positive,i always thought that publisher 2000 was easy to use this upgrade is even easier even someone who has never used publisher before can make outstanding postcards flyers newsletters and publications what a excellent product,34,0
Software,B00005AFI4,4,positive,as much as i hate to admit that microsoft has done a good job i have to on this one the improved interface makes it so much easier to use users of old versions of publisher will be pleasantly surprised that this one is definitely worth the money for the upgrade if you have never used a desktop publishing program before check this one out you will not be disappointed i am running an entire small printing business from this program alone the only reason i have not given 5 stars is because i still want to be able to create text boxes in shapes round triangleinstead of square and rectangle,112,1
Software,B00005AFI4,4,positive,this is a good product i have publisher 2000 and i like to added features and the new templetes realy worth the money microsoft has done it again with really great features and value,36,2
Software,B00005AFI4,4,positive,publisher 2002 is a pretty good product i have not had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed once it has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it but stay away from the bundle with the photo editior included because the photo editior has almost no functionality,76,3
Software,B00005AFI4,4,positive,while most people will tell you that microsoft bit the big one on their latest release of productivity programs the office xp suite i personally feel that they have done ok while the 2002 series does not differ too much from it is predecessors publisher includes what i think to be a very important feature stability there is not a sole on this earth that can deny the reliablity and stability of xp whether we talk about windows xp office xp or microsoft anything 2002 i dare you to try to make if crash good luck for those of you in corporations ask your employees what the most irritating part of their day is you will undoubtedly get the response when my tools crash while microsoft might have changed minor settings in publisher to make it slightly annoying for the few you can not go wrong with the increased reliablity of the product so suck it up shut up and enjoy it,157,4
Software,B00005AFI4,1,negative,publisher 2000 was bad stupid me i thought maybe 2002 would be better not save your money and buy print shop or print master platium they work better for less money and take up less real estate on your hard drive the interface is even less intitutive that previously the most common task that even i can make word 97 accomplish will not work in publisher sorry microsoft i will not be buying this again everything the other reviewers have said times 10,81,5
Software,B00005AFI4,1,negative,without a doubt the worst canned program i have encountered in almost 10 years of buying software after 2 months on the phone with support i have still not beat the kinks out of this dog bcentral is only to happy to charge me 30 bucks a month for hosting a site that will never be launched with this pig no wonder they include it with every signup a guarantee that the space on the server will never be used pass on this pig,84,6
Software,B00005AFI4,5,positive,and you can not find a download for a very specific piece of software your friend needs it surprises you with a wonderful website that let us you purchase a copy for cheap and totally redeems itself thanks internet and thank you amazon,41,7
Software,B00005AFI4,5,positive,arrived quickly and in good condition with activiation code on the package i needed this to access some old files that coulldnt be opened in publisher 2010 worked great i prefer this version in a lot of ways,38,8
Software,B00005AFI4,5,positive,this product was very price-worthy was easy to install and has performed perfectly since i bought it it is doing exactly what i hoped and more the product itself was in excellent condition,33,9
Software,B00005AFI4,2,negative,my goodness you would think a 10 billion company could do better than this they talk about double sided printing you can not even print even or print odd pages you have to sit in front of your computer and print each and every page manually you can not print to an image file well yes you can but the low resolution makes the file unusable you can not print to a pdf printing to a post script file cut off half the image on one of the projects this product assumes your printing service uses publisher guess what most do not david,99,10
Software,B00005AFI4,1,negative,i agree poor girl i am a real newbie massage therapist turned computer user and have found this program to be a web creators nightmare i think I shall cruise on down to the freeware sites to see what i can scare up there i want a fairly simple web page that links to a few more for those of us that know the anatomy of the human body better than html i would stay away from this beast it will make the less confident feel even more so and by the way these other sugar coated reviews does microsoft pay some slouch to type them up all day or what nauseating,108,11
Software,B00005AFI4,1,negative,i was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software i have used in a long long time i am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability stay with the previous version,45,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,1,negative,i bought this product and love the results on my screen unfortunately it does not look so beautiful anymore when i print the pages out the preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode all my other applications print out just fine i contacted novas technical support but the only help they offered was to send another disk which did not solve the problem now they ask me to be patient while they try to figure out my problem i have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed no matter how great the software is if there is no real technical support it is worthless,108,0
Software,B00005NZXQ,4,positive,this software gives great guidlines for begginer scrapbookers,8,1
Software,B00005NZXQ,4,positive,this is pretty easy to use and I am having fun with it i can not compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I have used but from what i see this is really all i need,40,2
Software,B00005NZXQ,5,positive,i absolutely love this program and totally agree with the lady that found it to be one of the best programs that she owns i have had no problems with this program locking up or anything i made our christmas cards on it this past year and got lots of compliments i also made scrapbooks as gifts for christmas and got many compliments on my work this is a wonderful program and i am so happy that i purchased it,80,3
Software,B00005NZXQ,1,negative,i would like to say this is a great program but it will noton my computer i have never had this problem with any other program before some kind of computer glitch blamed on everyone else other than the person i happen to be talking to at the moment after about 30 mins of several toll calls and a couple downloads no luck well I am off for another program,70,4
Software,B00005NZXQ,5,positive,i almost did not buy this program because of the negative reviews but having worked in retail before i realized that people are more likely to complain than say anything posative i love this program i could go on all day about it i have so many ideas for projects and that is great because there are endless possabilities with this program you can make your project as personal as you want it to be add graphics of your own or alter their graphics to suit your mood you can add pictures and make them look antique as well as shape them into various shapes and styles add text here lighten here change colors it is fabulous as far as the pictures printing out clearly I have had no problem of course when altering your pictures if you force it into a shape that the pixels can not accomadate certainly there would be some problems digital pictures work best but my scanned ones have done well too just have fun and play with it i would reccomend this program to anyone interested in a unique and fun way to save their memories,187,5
Software,B00005NZXQ,2,negative,i was disappointed when i tried to play around with this product it is going back to the store today you can not print out just an element of the scrapbook other than stickers without printing out an entire layout so if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever beware you must print the whole page and you can not export images either this is basically a limited unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have otherwise stay away and save for a real scrapbook program i have not tried hallmark keep scrappin with scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there,143,6
Software,B00005NZXQ,5,positive,i already had scrapbook factory on a different computer i have all of my business forms in that program but did not have the disc any longer the only drawback is not being able to copy all of my old forms onto a flash drive if you buy this keep up with your discbecause it will not recognize the program it was made from when you try to open old files from a flash drive,72,7
Software,B00005NZXQ,1,negative,this edition of scrapbook factory is not nearly as good as scrapbook factory deluxe 4 i have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one three is close and as far back as i am willing to go although you can not extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages in four you can create jpegs as well as pdfs of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive it took me all of a half hour before i had my first page done showing people the ropes of the software i gave version four as a christmas gift to a few people took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own you can get a copy of four for about 2000 more than this version and i feel it it well worth it many pages i have done people think were done with 40000 photoshop do not waste your time with this software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves,187,8
Software,B00005NZXQ,2,negative,what a disappointment considering modern day programs this one is primative it reminds me of apps 15 years ago it is complicated yet limited in what it can do i have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as front it can not be done I have clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest no luck even the tutorial is non-interactive additionally pages can not be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste further each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects the help section is also very basic one good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job additionally no problem running this with windows 7 have not used any other scrapbook programs but i sure would not recommend this one,156,9
Software,B00005NZXQ,1,negative,i am extremely displeased with this product the software is anything but user friendly and the graphics are extremely cheesy any attempts i made at developing a scrapbook page were foiled due to extreme frustration with the program overall the product needs a drastic update and i am disappointed with my purchase,52,10
Software,B00005NZXQ,5,positive,to those with print quality issues it is your printer or printer preference settings there is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software it is also easy to use my 10-year-old who never saw it before jumped right in and is creating terrific pages can not beat it for the price,50,11
Software,B00005NZXQ,2,negative,I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that i can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer this one does not print well at all I have tried printing one of thier premade pages pages I have created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized i have not had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges i do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as i do not use this program another thing i found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic if you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them this program would be ok if you do not want to print the pages out but if you do look for something else,162,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,4,positive,this program is easy to use and helped me create a custom scrapbook page with little effort one caveat once you select a size template be certain to check the result with print preview before you expend any effort i had trouble getting the first page i created to print in 12 x 12 size on a 12 x 12 sheet of paper however i called tech support the first rep did not help much but then i got a follow-up call from derek who had gone to the trouble of downloading my canon s9000 printers driver together we got the print function going and produced a perfect page it is really refreshing to find a software outfit that really cares about the results it is customers are getting it is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy and that more background paper is not supplied but if you start with a blank template hey it is a clean slate and you can let your imagination run wild it will let you drop in your pictures and graphics wherever and help with the lettering for titles and journaling,189,13
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,i travel on the road all the time and i use my gps and laptop to find my way around i would have to say that the software that comes with the garmin gps is a hundred times more accurate and useful i have found that many of the roads in street atlas were labeled wrong or just plain drawn wrong there is a lot of old information and not updated regularly i live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in street atlas 2004 it still did not have my neighborhood in it and i live near a major city i can not recommend this software for other than very basic information you can get a paper map that will work better,125,0
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,i have been using the 2004 version of this program for about 5 months before i finally upgraded to this version on my p2/250 laptop it runs slowly but not nearly as slow as the 2004 version did i just purchased a gps device for it and love how it integrates with it i travel extensively in my job and having the gps feature makes finding where I am going very easy there are some inaccuracies with the pois as others have stated but they are not so far off that you could not find them with a little looking around at least with them marked on the maps you get a very goodwhere they are web based maps are good to have but when you have to travel to several locations in a day it is impossible for me to get online to find where I am going with this in my vehicle i can get where I am going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks i recommend this program to anyone looking for a mapping program especially if you have a gps device to find where you are and where / when you have to make your next turn,203,1
Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,after using street atlas 2005 for one trip i find it was worth making the upgrade one new feature is that it shows the next turn and the turn after that in the show turns window it also gives this information in the voice navigation this will eliminate a number of instances where i have used the voice commands to obtain this information the number of trail points is now settable which can clear the map and reduce theon the computer there is a new version of the microsoft speech recognition software the file system has been simplified with the option to return to the full system if desired via a patch available free from delorme the program loads much quicker i recommend buying street atlas 2005,129,2
Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,i bought this product expecting the excellent results i have had from delorme products for years it is been a nightmare trying to get it to work i have tried installing it six times on two different computers and i can not get it to plot a route i put in a start and finish point and it plots a straight line between the two points others have had this same problem as related on the delorme forum so it is not just my computer or my installation technique every other delorme product i have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem i have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply after five days on their forum i was told to follow the instructions for a so-called clean install but when i followed them three times i got the same result I am sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund,159,3
Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,delormes product is dynamic it works out-of-the-box as a gps navigation companion it will automatically start talking to you and guiding you from where you are and take you toward your destination if you get off-track it re-routes you automatically within seconds microsofts product is static or dead connected to a gps it will show you where you are but do not expect it to think ahead I have used it numerous times and it had been helpful because it is an accurate map and shows where you are but that is it there is a lot more to giving someone good directions than just saying this is where you are you want to know when to get ready to turn up ahead so you can prepare for it delormes software will do that for you and do it very well,137,4
Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,problems in many areas buggy installation i had to re-install after a squeeky clean reboot on xp had to use msconfig to boot with no other drivers the software still has trouble locating well-established addresses and significant landmarks weak find function can not identify addresses with any intelligence user interface is not intuitive at all ambiguous commands poor screen / button layout I am trying to be patient and tough it out but frankly i would not buy it knowing what i know now i also have msft streets and trips and although it has limitations as a navigation tool the u / i is much easier to use no problems with installation and the data is far more complete,117,5
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,i was blown away by this product in the sense that i could not imagine that such a well-functioning piece of software could be rendered virtually unusable by a horrendous interface the controls are tiny numerous and often cryptic to set up your gps mouse for instance you would have to click the exchange button do not even think about using this product while driving it is not suitable at all for a touch-screen display having said that the maps themselves are accurate and the programs packs a ton of useful information,91,6
Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,i have a long commute and wanted to figure out which back roads were ideal i was deciding between microsofts streets and trips 2005 and this program i think the deciding factor was that the delorme software has the ability for me to manually choose other roads besides the roads the program recommends microsofts version does not seem to offer this at least they do not mention it by allowing me to choose my own roads i can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even although they are the calculated ones it may not have as many pois but i was more interested in customizing and alterning suggested routes than points of interest that feature alone made the delorme worth it for me,123,7
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,i have used delorme products for a number of years and love the features the 2005 street atlas is a little slow to start but still nice to work with but they seem to have spent their time on features and not updating the database i live in northern virginia and was very disapointed with this release street atlas 2005 is headed for ebay and i cringed as i installed,71,8
Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,in some areas the software worked great but in others it was off by hundreds of feet showing me on totally different streets around my house it was consistently off by 800 feet and displayed my position one street away this is not due to the gps receiver the receiver gives the right coordinate data if you plot that data by hand on the map you will be positioned wrong this indicates that the maps are not calibrated right tech support was worthless all they tell you is that you can return it before 30 days of course you are still out the tax and the cost of sending it back do not buy this product until they have fixed the maps consider yourself warned,124,9
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,I am not the greatest remembering maps so when i got a usb gps receiver i was psyched granted at that time i did not have any software but i did not know that so i went out and got street atlas which happened to be the first piece of navigation software i found that was version 2004 I have been hooked ever since i used to get lost in downtown buffalo all the time now i do not get lost anymore i loved 2004 so much i got 2005 and it is a big improvement the user interface is much easier than in 2004 and in 2004 it was easy and i mean super-easy you can install the entire continental united states and fit it comfortably on your hard drive and map out a trip from one end of the country to the other and get there without getting lost for those techie people like me who get lost all the time this program is like a godsend you can even print out directions on your desktop and e-mail them give them to friends so on and so forth without a gps receiver,189,10
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,I have used delorme street atlas since gps receivers were novel and cost hundreds of dollars i have liked every version they have put out and 2005 is no exception the reason i bought the 2005 version even although it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through wine in linux including usb / serial gps support newer versions tested up to 2008 as of this review do not install and/or run well via wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored street-level navigation in linux if you want updated cartography and new handy features go with a newer version all versions of delorme street atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag however if you want a street-level nav program for linux that does not require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps delorme street atlas 2005 is your best bet,157,11
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,i use this software to map out a garage sale route it is simple and basic and allows me to flag each address on the route some of the features i could use in the future for a trip or something but right now it is garage sales,47,12
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,street atlas just keeps getting better i can go from anywhere but usually from home to a place I have never been to using the directions fastest shortest or scenic I shall know the mileage and have a good estimate of the time i can locate other places i may need anywhere along the way mealsrepairs hotels and more i find it much faster and more intuitive than any of it is competition we also find it helpful finding hiking trails / points of interest and areas set aside for recreation on weekends the ability to print out a travel package is helpful for when i am not using a pc,106,13
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,street atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of windows is not english or if the user sets languages other than english as their default language set on us version of windows sa 2004 does not work at all so i have to change the language setting of my us version of windows xp and reboot the computer every time that i need to run sa 2005 it was so cumbersome and i wished that this problem is fixed in sa 2005 however sa 2005 has the same problem and it seems like delorme does not care about this problem at all if you are a user who uses different language setting on windows you should try microsoft streets and trips instead of sa 2005 sa 2005 has better gps capability than ms s and t however my choice is s and t for this reason i gave 2 stars because it does a job sometimes when i do not mind rebooting my computer and giving up other jobs that need asian language support i do this once or twice a year,183,14
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,this is a big improvement over previous versions of this software the back on track feature works great if you take a wrong turn the software automatically calculates a new route to get you back on track much much better than microsoft streets and trips in the gps and navigation areas,51,15
Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,i bought this software and found that it could only work when win xps regional setting set to united states english since i had to have another regional setting because of my job the software was no use another thing is that there is misinformation on the products box it claims that delorme includes major roads and highways in canada while it is competitors do not the fact is that while delorme only covers major canadian roads microsofts streets and trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of canadian streets just as what it can do about united states addresses microsofts product can produce driving directions in canada too which delorme can not do one good thing about delorme mapping street atlas united states 2005 is that it has a 30 day money back guarantee i have returned my purshase and got the microsoft streets and trips 2005 instead,142,16
Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,i purchased street atlas 2005 as i was so satisfied with aaa mapngo from delorme the mapping program is absolutely great it is operation is really quite simply and anyone can work it it is much better than microsoft streets which i had the 2002 version the only fault is that their data base is too old and does not seem to have a lot of the development in the last 2 or 3 years of motelsstations and resturants,79,17
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,i have used delorme street atlas for years in my genealogical hobby i have found it amazing that it has so much detail of both urban and rural roads and also topographical features used in combination with a gps and delorme atlas and gazetters i have been able to locate drive directly to many obsecure locations,56,18
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,as a real estate appraiser i travel from point to point and then write reports about each site the gps and voice functions are irrelevant i never use them the report writing function is where i need a program daily and for my purposes which is entirely for drawing labeling and map notes for each site to be placed into a report this program is an order of magnitude worse than the version it replaced lots of new features just complicate the program and make the simple features i need harder to replicate and work with sometimes the map will zoom or reduce unexpectedly due to a casual move of the pointer that was not intended to produce this effect on balance i hate it the bright side you can find things with it if you are willing to battle and fight the complex functions to do so,149,19
Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,findings after brief trial pros 1 provide voice driving instructions but those instructions may be confusing in some situations 2 accept speech commands it is quite fancy cons 1 it will ask you to turn left / right where you are not allowed to do so this is quite dangerous 2 some map informations are egregiously out of date a road removed by freeway construction a decade ago still appears on the map and i was asked to go through it 3 it does not locate my location precisely with gps it claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway i wonder how it can think this way as i did not get into any freeway entrance can i simply jump into the freeway ms streets trips did not show this problem using the same gps receiver,142,20
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,did you ever beat on a garbage can lid with a wooden spoon well that is the sound you get from cakewalks music creator 6 the guitar rythmn sound is also shabby to say the least if you want a good backup music program just invest in band in a box you will be glad you did,56,0
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,well this is not a bad daw i found out after using this that i prefered cubase or sonar which is the upgraded version of cakewalk this is however a good daw to get your feet wet or to record a few mics at one time if you need to work on guitar parts you will need nothing more than this my needs have grown greatly and can not use this anymore but for the starter or small studio i do recommend this or cubase le,84,1
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,because my new samson go mic has bundled cakewalk software i decided to try cakewalk music creator 6 this software is a disaster in stability the bundled software was just as bad i got to use music creator 6 only twice before it continued to come up with an error message stating that the one exe file that opens up the whole thing was missing i must have uninstalled and re-installed this software six times on my computer and cleaned up everything involved with this program short of causing problems for other programs on my computer also customer service was terrible cakewalk needs to spend more time trying out their own software with various computers and operating systems and looking for problems rather than focusing on the art of rigid programming rules musicians do not want to waste time with programming musicians want to create cakewalk should either fix these problems or take a walk do you get it cakewalk i was with this software and oh this is mild commentary as I have had two weeks to cool off a bit i sent it back to amazon for a credit thank you amazon for your graciousness,196,2
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,i did not know if mc 6 would work on my laptop it works fine and will probably meet my needs when i get some additional gear and time to use it all,32,3
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,this is a great music arranger at a very low price point there are many instruments available and you can interface with actual midi capable instruments,26,4
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,it is great fun it would be much better i had were more knowledgeable about computers and more though overall i am learning how to use the program as i play a digital piano for the price it has a multitude of capabilities for me the tough part is mastering the software i have a granddaughter that loves to record her own songs I had never tell her that she needs to work on her singing it is just great fun,74,5
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,because i got music creator 5 on one of my anther computers but this program u can touch and it have everything u need to produced ur music yes it is professional,30,6
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,i bought this software thinking i could use it to record songs it will not take my guitar input even although it is running through a very good usb device I have only been playing since 1966 and working with computers since they came out i have decided that it was worth the 32 dollars just to gain the knowledge that cakewalk is way to complicated for normal people,67,7
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,great fun i had the advantage of my brother tutoring me on a previous version there are also some nice online tutorials it will certainly take a long time to learn everything but i was able to import and edit sounds for my avant garde music class immediately i can not tell you anything about what ever is normally in these kind of programs but for me it was awesome especially at this price,73,8
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,uninstalled it was getting errors runtime errors with windows 80 pro so i upgraded to windows 81 pro from windows 80 pro but still had runtime errors uninstalled it and errors went away but i had my magix music software install no problems i stay with my magix products they work great and are easy to use,57,9
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,this is somewhat an extensive program that you will have to do some study on to utilize all the features,20,10
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,i had tried another software and hated it this was just what i need to compose and record my music,20,11
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,product worked fine then got a free upgrade to music cretor 6 touch having issues and quirks where program now freezes up or is not responsive or needs to be forced shut because of one thing or another need to find help to find the fix to this issue also basic knowledge of the program would be very usefull since all the tutorials are not as simple as one would hope,70,12
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,the music creator 6 is very cool i use it on my music prodjects i can not stop use it it cool,21,13
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,one of the best things is the vidio tutorial caught me up to date quick i was using music creator 3 and jumped to 6 but for the price this works great it takes a little while to find everything but for recording with an interface module you can be recording tracks in a couple of hours i have experience in recording from reel to reel to daws to computers I am having fun with this one thanks cakewalk stvy d,79,14
Software,B004TO9M5W,5,positive,this product is always providing new avenues of creativity in my music recording i am constantly surprised by the avenues of creativity it presents i recommend it for any beginning artist,31,15
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,do not buy this first of all i spent hours just trying to get the notes to not skip there has a latency menu that you have to look online by good luck and change to correct this it should have been adjusted from the factory then you can not just go to sharps and flats on a laptop unless you have a mouse then I am not sure if it works or not the old music creator was far better then menus and windows on this are awkard and non user friendly i think I am going to look up an older version of cakewalk music creator on ebay one star because there has not an option for no stars,113,16
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,I am actually reviewing music creator 7 anyway i have been fooling with it for 3 months now and i do not like it for one thing the tech support is some of the worst I have ever encountered the product is not intuitive and the in-program help is not helpful neither is the cakewalk forum i have used earlier versions of cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers but this program just is a constant headache plus all the samples and clips that come with it are trash they are all house and electronica type stuff i do not see anything in the midi library and very little in the audio library that i would ever want to use but that is ok because i have not been able to get the latency down to a reasonable delay anyway not recommended,138,17
Software,B004TO9M5W,1,negative,may be is not your fault but i have a yamaha dgx-640 connected to the computer and i do not get no sound on the music creator 6 i followed all the directions from the creator but nothing i could use some help thanks alexndru davd,46,18
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,if you are a musician like me and a recording artist you will like this software the program is simple and the software is so easy to use upon plugging in my electronic keyboard to the usb along with my microphone i can record and create songs right on my computer sa-weet,52,19
Software,B004TO9M5W,2,negative,i spend more time being pissed at this program for latency bulls when trying to lay down more than one track at a time not to mention the crackling that never appears at the same spot in playback and recording and whenever it happens when trying to record vocals over my guitar it messes that entire vocal section up all i wanted was something that could let me lay down guitar vocals and drums in separate tracks i have a xenyx q802usb behringer to manage my eqs and i do not care much about midi so that whole part of the program is useless to me this is the first recording software I have ever tried outside of audacity and i was kinda expecting that since i was actually paying for it that it would come with a decent manual and do a good job handling my recording ha waste of my money and my time,153,20
Software,B004TO9M5W,4,positive,although i am no expert in this field i have found a few bugs in the program but so far exporting the audio and re-importing it has solved all the issues i have ran into i have no real experience with other audio recording software other than light use of audacity and an older cakewalk home studio 9 i do wish it had better tools for mixing but it does plenty for it is price,74,21
Software,B004TO9M5W,2,negative,this may work well but it is complicated i have not made it work well for me the reviews said it was easy but i did not find it that way,31,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,bad product just took a week of use and it began to crack in the front very bad quality,20,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,at the price i paid for these i really have no complaints they are beautiful out of the box and the leather and canvas is what one would expect from the pictures tread is deep and great if anything although they wear much more quickly than i would like after a couple of weeks worth of wear there are deep creases in the toebox and the insoles come out again fine for the price,74,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,great boot bought it for my daughter but the sizing was a little larger than we expected so ended up wearing them myself,23,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,i would like to point out that they run large so order a size smaller i had to return mine before i even got to wear them for this reason otherwise my first impression is that this is a definite improvement over the jungle boots that served me in my 10 years in the usmc,55,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,these boots fit amazingly and go here two days before they were supposed to they are a really good weight and are well ventilated i have not done any training in them yet but they are not bad to walk in the boots run big on the sizing so buy a size smaller than what you wear for a tennis running shoe there was no problem with mine when i received them and the packaging was normal cardboard shoe box inside a normal cardboard shipping box I shall write another review after a go through some training with them on and let anyone interested know how they are right now the boots are at 5/5 edit okay so I have gone through some training now and these boots are pretty good they are comfortable breathable and the weight is definitely not an issue i wore them all day and there was not any discomfort for me these boots are great still 5/5,158,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,these boots were purchased for my son who is bigger than average for his age and extremely hard on shoes when i was his age thanks to my grandfather being retired military i was given my first pair of boots similar to these because i too was very hard on shoes having this experience already i figured to do the same for my son he has worn them for a eleven months now which for him is amazing the leather is still in good condition the nylon has held and there is not a single stitch that has been worn out by constant use however I am a bit disappointed with the soles because they have worn quickly when compared with other brands i myself have been wearing the same pair of wellco jungle boots for 3 years every day and the soles of mine although worn do not look anything like his his literally have gouges missing on the heel and the toe is almost worn smooth still for an active child whose hard on shoes when considering the price I have got to give 5 stars,185,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,i am pleased with the seller and the boots i received them early viathe other reviews are correct you should order them one size smaller than you normally wear i did not and am having to return them when i contacted the seller they replied promptly and with courtesy i will be buying other merchandise from this seller in the future the boots did look like they would need insoles however all military boots i have owned for work needed extra insoles to be comfortable for 12 hour shifts,91,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,if you need a sturdy combat ready pair of speed-lace boots these boots are an unbeatable value tip soak em in hot water for 15 - 20 minutes then wear them as you go about your business after two hours they will feel like you spent a year breaking them in they take a pretty good shine too,56,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,i normally wear the tan acu boots for my army jrotc battalion for mondays and pt and let me say very good for running hiking anything physical and they are super comfortable they hold up great and overall excellent performance 10/5 for these boots and for all of those people who are a little overweight let me say i weigh 350 pounds and beat my mile run by 10 minutes simply from having comfortable boots 20 - 23 minutes last year in work boots 10 - 13 minutes in these very good excellent way to help loose weight fast if you like the outdoors like me ps they are the same as acu tan combat boots boots only black,116,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2,negative,normally wear size 13 and was too small maybe order next size up,13,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,they suck they lasted one month of rather sedentary kitchen work and walking home before the insole was starting to wear through showing my sock i had other panama lug soles that my father had from the army in the 70s and 80s that lasted me five years of daily wear rothco is crap chinese crap that is the purposeful surplus market real surplus is overrun of actual mil spec gear that hits the market not this crap,78,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,the boot was well made and just what we needed unfortunately it runs about a size too large,18,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,good price for this boot very comfortable i like it very much,12,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,purchased not even 6 months ago and the soles developed cracks and within a week of that the soles started to come off i expected a better quality from the company that purchased wellco the company that once provided high quality boots to the fine men and women in our armed forces never will i purchase a rothco product again,60,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,only reason why i put somewhat large was because some dingus said that they ran a size small so i ordered a 13 but they do not run small besides that the boots are fine a tad tall and pretty crappy laces but nonetheless good boots m8 go buy em,49,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,the feet inside pads suck but overall not bad and holding up,12,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2,negative,the price is good and the quality is not bad but i must say that they feel somewhat hard there is not any cushion in the inside like the first boots that i received from the army nor does it have resilience in the rain / puddle,43,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,girl no i was wearing cardboard and it gave me tendonitis that price tag is worth it as long as you are not doing anything tactical in them,28,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,bought these they were s t did not last a week of basic and it clearly has false advertising saying they are something and then you get something else at least they have the right picture now,35,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,add clearly states with zipper yet order came in with boots that do not same boots are sold on line cheaper and of same garbage quality also boots run roughly 15 sizes large,34,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,alternate use with other boots excellent fit and use for camping trip,12,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,not the best made boot not the worst made boot a good value value being what you get for the price paid they are comfy with a bit of break in they get very soft and really do not offer much protection against rough and tumble environments but they are a pleasure to walk in fairly light give fairly good wear ie they last ok I have had boots that were top shelf costing several times the price of the rothco boots they lasted longer they were a bit tougher no lighter as i recall i can not say the top of the line boots were as good a value I am rather rough on my footwear doing outdoor / jobsite work most of the time i can use these not worry about my expensive boots and they pretty much take the abuse until the soles wear thin I shall re-order when i need another set no problem,151,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,very pleased with this fit well very comfortable priced well enought i may even buy a spare pair before their gone,21,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,i love the boots unfortunately my feet swim in these boots my buddy who wears a 12 1/2 is buying them off of me they fit him great I am going to reorder in 10w,36,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,i am a veteran so i knew my size but they are good boots,14,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,while these are not the genuine gi boots i was hoping for they are good lightweight solid boots that fit as expected i tossed the cheap liner that comes in the bottom and replaced them with some dr scholls sports liners with arch support now it is like wearing sneakers and can be worn all day right out of the box breaking was minimal,64,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2,negative,they are just too big i wear size 11 in combat boots and those fit perfectly but these ones are way to big for me,25,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,one seam on the side is ripped but not to bad,11,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,they run big so get a size smaller,8,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,very descent boots well molded to shape of foot especially in the heal great souls except that they are rubber and leave black streaks on hard surfaces made in china require padded insouls as the insouls are leather but for the price they are a great pair of and kickers i recome d them,54,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,used them all summer out in the woods just make sure to break them in correctly and maybe pick up a good set of gel insoles,26,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,i have had these boots for over three years and worn them all over definitely one of my better investments,20,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,i like them a lot they are very comfortable and let my feet breathe they fit like a glove i love them they remind me of when i was in the united states marine corps,35,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,this boot arrived quickly and in good condition it is a good looking boot but was too big for my son who wears a size 8 the treads look sturdy the only thing i was not excited about was the lacing system it appears that there are hook / loop type lacing abover the regular laces however they are closed hooks so they also have to be threaded through holes but some people could see this as a plus i guess as they loosen quickly for easy removal and then do not have to be rehooked just tightened,94,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,as far as size they are good they are just a bit narrow hopefully that will change with use other than that i like them,25,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,the size was not what was advertised and after a month and a half of use the tread is worn off on both boots,24,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,thanks to reading the other helpful reviews we ordered accordingly he wears a size 7 sneaker and we ordered a size 7 boot also taking growth into account the wearer is a fast-growing fifteen year old we have about half a shoe size wiggle room with thick socks it is fine especially when breaking them in-that is definitely needed to prevent blisters as we have had these in the past and they lasted a year and a half i am expecting similar use from these,85,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,ok so i bought the whole family good milspec boots for our camping and bob needs force entry and these jungle boots i can say with out a doubt that these jungle boots are sub par out of 3 that were ordered my sons cracked in the first week mine cracked the second time i wore them thankfully my son has a second pair and i have a pair of force entrys as these will not last the month,79,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,the boots are labled as size 10 but the are over an inch longer than another pair of rothco jungle boots i own and look huge my feet are swimming in these boots if these are size 10 i am a monkeys uncle they look like they are probably 12 now i have to deal with trying to send them back and get my money back i can not even image what size would be an actually size 10 now that i have sent the boots back and spent another 1130 the company is not giving me a full refund nor paying my shipping costs the company is defrauding me out of 25 of the original cost plus shipping beware of buying from this company update amazon did the right thing and refunded me the shipping costs i do not think it came from the shipping company but from amazon nice move amazon,152,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2,negative,these boots do not come in half-sizes so they were too big for me and they have already developed massive cracks on the toe area after only a few weeks of use still they were cheap and kept my feet dry not the worst thing ever but these are definitely throw-away boots the boot equivalent of a paperback book when compared to a hardcover which in this case would be a reliable brand like bates,75,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,these boots are just like they are pictured fit great sizes are what they say they are and the are worth the price were shipped to me fast,28,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,ordered on september 232013 it is now october 7th still have not seen them if you need a pair hunting boots go to big 5 sporting goods at least you will have them this is the worst company to deal with i will never order anything from them againmailed them no response they just do not care order from another company,65,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,price was good construction was not i wore these boots for less than 12 hours total before the heel on the toe started to peel upon inspection both had started to separate leaving abetween the heel and the boot i actually noticed the heel separation because the front of the heel caught on ai am a tactical officer you do not want to trip on a situation because your heel peels off,75,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,the boot is a bit different from what i already had but it is very similar also the fit is exact although we thought it was going to be too small very happy with the purchase,36,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,came apart at the base in a week not a good product at all cheep glue was smeared all over the cheep leather save your do not buy,28,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,these plugs do reduce the noise from shooting but i can not stand the pain after ten minutes,17,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,this was a four star product until it broke after one week of use I am a carpenter and wear banded hearing protection every day for the convenience factor i liked that the gel material the plugs were made of could be easily cleaned unlike yellow foam which gets nasty in a hurry if these lasted a month or two i might of considered buying them again but a week is unacceptable,71,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,congratulations to radians for an excellent product much superior to any other banded hearing protector on the current market [ forget those bogus foam-plug jokes that need replacing every other day ] these are light-weight easy to wear around the neck when not in use so always handy a bonus the ear-plugs are very comfortable and easy to insert and later clean I am very pleased with my purchase and have given extra sets to friends who appreciate silence without clunky ear-muff bother,80,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,broke in less than two days plastic not very flexible nor pliable for everyday use,16,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,a bit tight but that is probably because of my big head laughing out loud i do like the soft silicone ear pieces and the fact that you get an extra pair with the purchase arrive on time in about a week have not worn these for long periods yet so i do not know if the pressure is enough to because pain but it definitely works for a little spur of the moment plinking,70,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,as others have said it snapped in the middle of the band after using it a few weeks i did not abuse it only opening it up enough to put around my head they use cheap brittle plastic very annoyed,40,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,like others reported they are quite right good for an hour maximum,12,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,super convenient the gel stays clean while all the nasty stuff sticks to the foam pairs impossible to loose very important comfort is adequate relatively cheap however after a few months they do begin to split down the seam in back and break i bought 5 pairs last time and will likely buy them again however i am currently content with my 500pk of ear plugs,66,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,perfect all around tool for shooting working around loud noises or anything that would bother you by being to loud comfortable and fits great,24,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,probably not a fair evaluation seems like a great product but did not fit my ear canals,17,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,i bought these because the ear plug material is smooth and easy to clean however the material is also quite firm and causes pain in the ear canals after a while also the noise attenuation seems lower than other similar products with softer ear pieces,45,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,individual plugs fall / blow out on my motorcycle i have used similar ones ugly when mowing grass and grinding metal so i thought I had try these for riding they work great hang on the neck when going into a store and more and do not look industrial,44,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,did not like it returned it was way too tight,9,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,i had them at the range today for the first time after about 30 min my ear hurt a little i reached up to my ear and found that the red end part had come off in my ear and the metal part was in my ear and could have been dangerous,52,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,just i wanted non foam ear pods these do not get hard and or dirty at work very cool and comfortable,23,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,it fell apart the firs time i used it the red ear buds come off the plastic band easily i lost one of the ear buds becasue of this,29,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,comfortable but lost one plug first day otherwise it was a beautiful day in the woods this many words required,20,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,does not stop sound bought for a 10 year old with glasses and it is almost as bad as nothing i tried it on myself and could not get it to work properly either,32,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,i was very disappointed in the radians red banded hearing protections i tried them at the gun range and had to use ear muffs because the ear plugs did not reduce the noise level enough so that i could shoot i can only recommend them for very low level noise not for shooting protection,54,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,these do not fit me well at all i realize it must be difficult to make a product that fits everyone but these are not even close plus they apply too much pressure and it causes discomfort,35,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,i regularly run a propane floor buffer and this is a great product the case they came in is reusable keeps them clean when not in use the design makes sure that they comfortably seal inside my ear after about 40 minutes usage my ears tend to get a bit sore minor issue a great product,56,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,bought these for the shooting range and have used them several times with no issues judging by other reviews maybe my head is smaller but the fit is not painfulat all after an hour of use the only reason not a 5 star is i wish the band fit behind my head without falling to my neck and being pushed by my shirt or jacket collar breaking the seal of the plug in my ear i deal with it for 5 - 6 compared to more expensive and heavy muffs or disposables a great value,93,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,you will need a small head like a kid to wear these otherwise it causes too much pressure basically the head band is too shallow it needs to be taller and wider,32,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,these are great vary durable and light weight our children used them on our trip to disney world they were good for the loud rides shows and fireworks when not being worn in the ears the can be worn like a necklace so far they have not worn out but when they do i will diffidently but them again,59,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,i can not hear a damn thing with these on is not that the point i use them for protecting my hearing while at the shooting range and also at home to drown out the wife,34,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,the gel plugs on these do not fit well in my ears and after having jammed them in hard enough to block sound they do not provide enough attenuation to suit my needs they also work loose and then i loose all attenuation it may be just my ear shape but i suspect the material they are made from transmits too much sound,63,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,maybe my head has a weird shape but i can not get the gels to fit into my ears well enough to block any sound,24,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,good price for the piece and only problem is the band is stiff and hard not flexible that can be easily fold,22,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,these just plain hurt my ears if i could endure the pain they might loosen up or maybe pulling them apart to stretch them out might help i gave up and went back to regular plugs and i am shopping for some of those cool over the ear filtering ear protectors,51,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,they worked good after i learned how they went in my ear they work better for me than the ear plugs with the strings,24,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,i got these for when I am on my motorcycle to cut down highway noisethey cut the noise down by about 60 they fit fine and i wear them for hours at a time i also shot my 357 and 9 mm while wearing these and they did finecrazy as it seems i think they are better for shooting than riding,59,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,they worked fine for short term wore them to an ipsc match and after a couple hours the band started hurting the sides of my ear the shaft from the band to the plug should be longer so the band does not impact the outer part of your ear i am going to switch to the howard leight earbands where have the longer shaft and keep the band off of your ear,73,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4,positive,these work very well for me not too tight the only problem i have had with them is a plug came off the holder once and bounced like a rubber ball and wentunder my truck,34,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,this is the best hearing protection I have had I have never cared for the ear muff type protectors being banded keeps you from loosing them it is silly to pay 100 for any ear protection when you can get this outfit for a fraction of the price and work just as well,50,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,these earplugs offer excellent hearing protection while working construction the biggest benefit is that they easily clip around your neck when you are not wearing them making it easy to pop them in your ears just before you grab for the saw or the nail gun construction equipment is loud and running it without hearing protection damages your hearing and let us face it unless it takes about one second to locate and put on your hearing protection it is not going to happen some of the other reviewers mentioned durability i had a pair for a year before they broke and just bought two replacement pairs they are a few bucks and easy to replace also the gel ear inserts are comfortable and easy to clean highly recommended product,128,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,the plastic band can not be adjusted and the pressure forces the ear plugs deep into your ear canal i can only wear these for about 30 minutes then i have to pull them out and i can only wear them for about an hour a day they do seal tightly and block noise i got these for yard mowing because my outside-the-ear earmuff hearing protectors became hot and wet with sweat i have an older pair of ear plug protectors that have an adjustable stainless steel band and a blunt type of oil filled ear plug and they are more comfortable it would help if a blunt type of ear plug was offered these would be good for short time noise exposure the most comfortable hearing protection i have found are the cheap foam ear plugs that you compress by rolling between your fingers and then press into your ear canal,151,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,i do not know if it is because i have a large head or not but this was not comfortable at all the problem was not the material that goes into your ears it was that there was way too much pressure applied through the band,44,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,the product is excellent holds firm and easily adjustable great for quick connect and disconnect of fenders better pictures of this product would be preferred when i purchased i did not know that there were 2 in each package friends at the marina liked them so much they took my extras,50,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,these straps are a goodbut absolutly do not last more than one year i put on 6 of them in late summer last year they were on my pontoon boat on a freshwater lake when i pit the boat in the water this spring they literally crumbled and broke they are not made to last but to be sold as a goodwithoit a quality product to back it up if you ow a pontoon get the plastic taylormade square clips that fit over the square rail,90,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,to thread the strap you do not need to be a rocket scientist but it helps longevity in the sun-zero we live in a community where you must remove the boat from the water except for seven day cycles total sun exposure was about 70 days the balance of the time the fenders and straps are in a box they shred like superman is pulling them apart almost lost four fenders absolute junk,72,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,thedid not fit my boat well,8,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,they rot over time in sun and break both my fenders are gone i thought they were stolen but then felt the straps and you can tear them like paper even easier then ripping paper maybe ok for limited use but do not leave them exposed to sun i had them on the boat for less than one year now i need to buy new fenders,66,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,purchased two sets for my boat very easy to use and install looks great,14,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,this product is garbage after 3 months in the sun the strap disintegrated i sent an email to the supplier and never got a response stay way form this company,30,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,i found that they tend to rot quickly,8,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,although i had to return thisi still give it 4 stars the only reason i did not give it 5 is because the description needs to be updated about minimum length it was too long for the purpose i was looking for,43,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,these work pretty well all although oddly can be a bit confusing to use and if the bumpers are heavy can pull the velcro loose so need to make sure secure correctly,32,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,lost 2 contour fenders off this product no way velcro way too flimsy,13,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,these are awesome and make it really easy to adjust your buoys,12,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,i really liked these for a few months however i left them attached to my boat as the primary connectors for my buoys when tied in our slip within a few months they had completely dried up the uv rays seemed to have broken down the material and they basically feel apart useless,53,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,easy installation works like a charm perfect easy to adjust love it,12,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,makes attaching bumpers a breeze as a new boater this has been a great option no need to learn all the knots right away these securely hold a bumper in place and various lengths,34,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,got these for my dad for xmas and he loves them good quality product and easy to use fast shipping,20,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,i did not find these very complicated except if you have to move them quickly mine did not last the season one basically tore off when the bumper hit thethey also twist easily and once twisted they become difficult to adjust i will not be replacing these with new ones,49,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,after our first season this year the product works pretty good i would not want to use it at a mooring where the boat rocks against ait is great for day boating,32,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,wish i could figure it out inx are useless,9,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,after 1 and 1/2 boating seasons that is about 6 months the sun got to the material in the straps the straps started disintegrating from the sun i about lost one of my fenders in the lake after the strap broke they are not uv resistant the manufacturer should use the black uv resistant strapping like they use on the bottom loop that attaches to the boat fender,67,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,it is to complicated if you ask someone to attach it works fine once attached,15,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,I have read reviews where folks said you need an engineering degree to figure them out well let us blame it on public schools now a days they actually make sense it is easy to see and figure out fair enough the instructions are crap on the package but when you think about and figure it these are really easy and make sense now i can not say the value to the long term use in a docking situation with the velcro but a temp hookup and/or river merge for a float these will work perfectly,90,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,i used these for awile and they were fine but ultimately decided on a product that clips on more easily,20,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2,negative,I am not a dolt I have assembled many things worked on motors and things that require at least a small amount of aptitude in following directions but i just spent 30 minutes staring at my strap that just came in the mail and the little package picture on the front and then flipping it to the back to the directions then back again over and over again i really hope i can figure these things out because i do not like clutter and i like things to look neat the only way i am able to figure out how to use these things right now i could just do that with some spare line i have and save the money but i want to be able to attach these like it shows in the photo am hoping i can figure it out directions are very unclear and have no photos to follow,150,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4,positive,i like the construction of these and the way they mount and hold my anchors if the price was a bit better i order order another set most of the marine stuff is overpriced it seems,36,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,pros sturdy good price long adjustment con velcro is slow to attach but i added a caribeaner clip for quickly connecting to cleat,23,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,easy to use works well unfortunately 2 of the ones i bought have ripped in only 4 months and the other 2 look like they are going to fail soon too all they do is hold up my white squishy boat thingers nothing fancy,43,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1,negative,the velcro on these does not hold the weight of my hull huggers i hooked them up to each side of my tower with hull huggers at theand under 5 mins they had both fell off velco is a terrible choice of closure,45,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5,positive,purchased these straps at a great price and they are easy to use also give a great look to our boat instead of rope tied around the railing,28,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,i do not like the look feel or fit of these grips the size fits my hand a bit better than my hard rubber hogue grips but does not feel as comfortable and does not look as good also the fit on the gun is just a bit off enough to make it look a bit cheap,55,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,i purchased pachmayr grips for my ruger super blackhawk many years ago and they are great expecting the same qualitly i purchased the grips for my ruger redhawk and was very disappointed they do not fit good and the grip screw nut was loose in the grip and just turns round making it hard to get the screw out when i got the screw out the nut fell out in my hand the grips are loose very narrow and do not fit my hand at all now i know that no one set of grips can fit everyone is hand but these are very awkward and i am going to return them,109,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,i ordered pistol grips for my s w bodyguard model 49 and they sent me grips for a rugar redhawk 44 mag i have tried numerous times to contact the company to exchange for the proper gribs and they never got back to me i also attempted to call them but you only get an answering machine i left several messages and they never returned a call i would not recommend this company to anybody I am not trying to get my money back just the correcti ordered,88,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,these are the only choice for my ruger redhawk with high powered ammo the reduced recoil felt makes them the best choice for me shipping and service from leavitt enterprises the amazon supplier was exceptional,35,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,these grips are just sad they do not meet up properly along the seem and are so soft that the hammer pin works it is way free with only five pulls of the trigger if you have hand like brock lessner then they may fit your hand i have large hands and they are just to big and poorly designed bottom line is to save your mony and bye the houge tamer there just better in every way,76,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,grip has 1/2 inon front of frame,9,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,not very well made did not fit very well has gaps at the front part of the grip,18,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,only shot five rounds with the new grip and found it just super the initial shock was completely absorbed and i had just the regular kick back now i can not wait to really burn some powder with it,38,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,i like these better than the hogue grips i have both for the same 44 magnum shooting heavy 44 loads is tolerable now,23,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,perfect fit painless install and very comfortable grip,8,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,four stars for design but only rated two stars because of the poor quality of the product this grip fits my hand better than the hogue grip but the hogue quality is much better i like that this grip has a very thin cover of the back strap but when installed the front of the grip along the finger grooves does not meet this leaves athat runs the entire length of the grip,75,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,this pair of grips did not fit my redhawk correctly there was a pronouncedalong the front where the two halves meet,23,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,i bought three different grips before i found this one this is the one that takes the bite out of the recoil it has a thin layer that covers the metal strip on the back of the handle it is what is needed to keep it recoil shock from resignating through your arm makes the redhawk feel like a super redhawk,62,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,4,positive,i can not give firsthand advice about this my brother needed it and is very happy with the purchase i do not even really know what it is,26,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,i bought over 20 knives to examine and test for bug out bags we are building for survive doom google it the criteria we were looking for included price between 10 and 30 well balanced full tang high quality stainless steel blade that will hold anbetween 5 1/2 and 7 in blade length slightly trailing point for good game preparation and piercing qualities a medium hollow grind for good cutting and slicing qualities a riveted larger handle for a big hand and made of durable hardwood or laminated resin a good quality nylon or leather sheath this knife is a relatively hefty knife and for the price is adequate it is not one of the two knives we ended up choosing for our bug out bags but it is not bad it would do the job around the campsite,138,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,good knife good buy it came in good condition except for a couple tiny dings on the handle which let us me know it is real wood and not false wood plastic stuff i had to sharpen it a bit but other then that it is a good knife balance is good also,49,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,a nice knife for the price your going to need to sharpen it although all and all it is a good knife,21,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,a great buy for a knife that is used for ranch work it is well made with good balance,20,3

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,if your going to use and not care about it ok i would not add to a collection not nice enough the brass is loose and the handle is plastic,29,12

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,this knife is very nice i bought it and some other things for my dad as an early christmas present and his face was priceless i recommend it for hunters,30,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,rolling on the floor laughing the 5 star reviews were obviously written by the seller mountain man eh any mountain man would rather hunt with a butterknife as it is likely not to fall apart my buddy purchased 3 of these for some boy scouts and this pos comes apart on it is own in the box comes warped and is fragile as peanut brittle just buy a mora,63,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,i like the knife the sheith was pretty cheap it tore very easy the wrap on it was not heavy enough needs to be stronger,25,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,handle fell off right out of the box,8,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,could use some serratedother than that it is a sturdy built knife,14,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,piece of junk you will be embarased to show it to anyone reminds me of the fake pirate guns they used to sell in drug stores this would fit right in with those I have seen lawnmower blades that where cleaner this one looks like it was sharpened by micheal j fox on a bench grinder with a chip in the stone,60,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,this knife is poorly made with an unstraight blade spine also very dull i cut my thumb in half with it and it ripped the flesh did not slice it i bought this off of budkcom,35,23

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,good knife very strong and goodlooking will last a very long time sheath is also nice good leatheralso very good price,20,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,thisis best described as a knife-shaped object it came quite dull and the steel is too soft to take a decenti would not try to cut anything with it a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one that said it suited my purposes as a stage prop very well and was about what i expected given the price the main reason I am deducting stars is because contrary to thedescription no sheath was included with the knife i received all i got was a small plastic cap for the point in summary this is a good option if you want something that looks like a knife but will not be used to cut anything if you want to actually cut things you should get something of better quality,133,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,this knife is awesome it is a 6 in blade with a wood and brass handle which is a good quality knife personally I am going to use it for hunting you can use it for whatever you want it is a great knife for a great price,44,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,blade is not good not put together well at all sheath is garbage broke when i got it not good,20,29

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,the knife is poorly made but still somewhat usable not recommended for people in need of a knife really should not be sold to people,24,32

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,i purch ased four of these knives and am very dissatisfied with the quality of the knives mostly the wood handles i give knives as christmas presents and feel bad to give something ofpoorquality,34,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,it does not look as nice as the picture it is a very cheap knife but the quality is still too awful the blade came really really dull it cuts nothing the blade is really loose i can twist it left to right finger guard is super loose it moves around like crazy spine of blade is not straight not worth the money spent two stars being kind not more,68,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,great wood and finish great steel knife cool embedded sheathe too a good buy thanks so much to all knife lovers or 1800s it has that 1800s civil war look to it,32,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,this knife is a complete piece of crap fake wooden handle sheath is complete trash blade is dull as a butter knife no point on blade bent to the left feels like something i got at the dollar store as a kid paid 18 for this knife and extremely pissed,50,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,i really like the way this knife feels in my hand it is real easy to move i use this for defense not anything else well not just that it looks good with all the other knifes i have,40,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,this knife is a cheap made knife the entire cap of the handle was not fitted correctly the blade I had of a lower quality it s just a cheap made knife i would not recommend buying this knife,38,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,does not come sharp unless you have a knife sharpener or a file do not get you will have to file the knife to a sharp,25,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,well the blade came unsharpened the tip was broken off and does not keep it isat all horrible knife,20,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,bought 13 of these as gifts for the cast of a show i directed as they will mostly not be used for other than decorative purposes they were fine however at5 of the snap straps on the sheaths do not go around the handles snaps put on too far from the end which is annoying luckily i have enough leather working craft to fix them but still on at least three of the knives the pommel is loose and will turn almost 3/4 turn to tighten but will not go a full turn so these knives have loose handles / blades and feel sloppy / wobbly disappointing but they were cheap so there you go,111,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,i took this knife out on a over night trip and tried ti baton through a branch less than wrist sized and the blade rolled not thethe whole blade rolled to the side do not waste money on knives like these save up and get a decent knife of get a mora or a schrade if you are a cheapo,60,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,sheath came broken and no one will replace it with out sending it back i will not spend more money on a rippoff,22,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,this was better than i expected it came sharp and the weight felt good in my hand fit well into holder,21,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,i buy expensive and a few inexpensive knives but i would not give 2 cents for this piece of crap the cheap wood handle does not align at any point with the guard or pommel looks like they used a wire brush and a rock to finish it the lacquer was stuck to the plastic the blade is misaligned with the guard the leather sheath is thin as paper and the stitching was do loose you can see an 1/8 inchoverall it was a complete waste of money in fact i will dig it out of the garbage and send it back whoever is selling this garbage should be ashamed,112,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,this knife while cheap is much cheaper than it is price not a good buy and i returned it no stars are really required,24,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,i like the knife very much it feels good in the hand and cut well the knife is great the holder is cheap and i am looking for a new one,31,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,bought it for my wife to use in the wilderness when we go camping and or hunting would be good for self defense if the occasion ever presents it is self,30,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,the overall construction seems very solid and considering the price it is a steal the handle is a tad bit misshaped but nothing major by any means could just be me being picky the gold parts on the ends of the wood were not in the best shape when i got it but the wood handle is beautiful and more than makes up for and blemish the sheath is lightweight and solid as well,73,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,i was very pleased with this thank you so much also very fast shipping yes i for sure would recommend this to a friend,25,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1,negative,paid almost 300 then shipping and that is what i got a 300 knife i really should not complain but really the pakis could have at least made the blade fit the handle properly did not expect it to be sharp it is not did not expect it to have anit do not,51,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,if you are looking at this knife and your thinking of purchasing it it means that you are focused on the price and not the quality i bought the knife thinking that it would be a decent quality because it has come from bud k i have bought several knives from bud k catalog this knife is the worst of all i have bought when you purchase or if you purchase this knife do not expect to get what you see in the picture provided blade is dull sheath is very poor quality and the handle is made of extremely poor quality wood only reason i did not give this blade one star is because it is the only blade of poor quality i have recieved from bud k all in all save your money and buy a decent blade bud kup your game,143,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,quality is good not a hunting knife but it will hold for those weekend trips blade needs sharpening but nothing too bad,22,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,i got this for my grandson for christmas he loves it seems well put together especially the sheath it is made of leather extra thick to make it safer and more durable,31,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5,positive,this is a fun knife just for round the woodshop hacking on stuff to make the distressed look on projects,20,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,this knife is everything you hope to expect from a knife the design is terrific and the quality is great however the knife is mad in pakistan but it is a good buy great christmas gift,35,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,i never said i do not like it for the price it is a good tool box knife evidently baboo bobott had a bad hangover at the factory that day and did not give a damn about making the wooden handle look nice the blade is decent and will cut stuff when i need it it is too bad a company sells a knife dirt cheap and then jacks up the shipping by 400 to make money off of a customer,86,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,not good rough handle bad workmanship barely aon it rough bad balance just what you would expect from a 10 blade save your,25,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,you get what you pay for the knife has a very cheap leather sheath almost feels like thin cardboard but it works the handle on the knife had a big knot in it which made a void in it the price was less than 500 so well worth the price and a very good company to work with,58,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,worth the money sheath works but that is about it good feel and all in all a pretty good knife solid construction,21,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,this is a well made hunting knife for the price i think it is a great value it takes and holds anjust fine,25,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,i bought a bunch of these for under 10 again a decent piece of stainless on a child like grip with a pos sheath so what did i expect for 10 hey this was made by a 50 / day craftsman they could have spent a bit more on the handle or the sheath i was disappointed with several of these k exclusive brand knives,63,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,ok looking not sharp could at least put anonit but balance is nice definitley will have to sharpen the heck out of it but after all that said and done ship fast real fast ordered one day got two day later so that three day cool about all that thanks will order again and price are not bad either get some more knifes later yep,66,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4,positive,when i received the product i was immediately dissapointed not only was it dull but the blade was bent to the left very noticeably throughout it is length the handle is very awkward to hold and the sheath is trashy i payed 11 dollars total for this knife mostly in shipping but that is far too expensive for the product i received if you can get free shipping and you really want this knife i can not stop you but i do not recommend this in any way update i sent the company a complaint telling them i was highly dissapointed in their product and in a couple weeks without any warning or notice a knew undamaged sharp knife arrived at my house free of charge great customer service,126,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,hey found this knife thought it would be ok because it was dirt cheap but if your looking for quality you want to pass on this jewel and admire it from a far the blade is cheap so save ur dollars and kick in some more that is worth getting,50,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,i love the design of this lighter it is built solid enough to use as a weapon holds lots of butane and points an led light at whatever you are trying to light at night perfect for campfires the dual flame type for wind resistance also burns the fuel more efficiently so it does not leave black smudges on glass or metal surfaces it would be a great lighter if it worked 1 worked for about a week before the led light quit working the switch stopped clicking i did not send it back for repair instead i cut back the rubber to jam the safety button to make it light easier then ordered a new one 2 arrived empty and 4 attempts to fill it failed with a hissing sound at the refill valve this one i sent back to zippo for warranty repair 3 arrived today they sent me a brand new one but the led switch does not click at all so the light does not work I am right back where i started 3 out of 3 have been defective disgraceful for a company like zippo especially at 3200 retail,191,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,got one for christmas works well although it does require a little effort to hit the 2 buttons in sequence to get it lit i got it down but my wife hates that part which probably makes it child and accident-proof the instructions mention that this is a windproof lighter at least if you keep blowing it out it will relight that does not mean it will stay lit in high winds but it will relight when the wind dies down as long as you are still holding the buttons the windproof-effect has something to do with 2 flame outlets the main orifice has a small glowing grille next to it is a tiny hole where another flame comes out the flame itself is not a jet but like that of a candle the built-in led light works ok and the button for that is easy to operate the black rubber handle only seems to add bulk but it will not slip out of your hands the carabiner clip is probably useful I had give it 5 stars if it were not for the double-button push required to light,185,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,i received the zippo oul as a gift about a week and a half ago i comes filled and with batteries it is a wonderful gadget to have around the house for lighting candles and citronella torches on thethe tiny light is great for outdoor lighting in the dark,51,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,my male relatives have everything and consequently are difficult to buy for i found this lighter quite by accident and am glad i did my brother is hard to impress but this did the trick he immediately took it camping and was very pleased with it is performance i followed up by purchasing three more for other members of the family I am next,62,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,for 3400 bucks i expected a tourch i get a stronger and longer flame from a 500 throw away lighter you get at the hardware store apparently i can not return them so i got stuck with 2 of them i would never buy from affordable luxury,46,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,unit came very quickly works perfectly out of the package is a little larger than i expected better for lighting propane appliances and wood fires seems like it will be easy to refill,33,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,purchased from amazon and it worked ok for about 6 weeks followed filling instructions and use instructions zippo warranties it but you must pay shipping and send 10 do the math i stick with throw away bbq lighters now,39,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,although i sympathize with the button-safety haters fixing the problem took all of five minutes and i listened to mozart so it was quite pleasant complain all you want but it is better to do something is my philosophy whenever I am complaining about something the reason I am bestowing five stars on this tool is the combination of quality and price I am biased toward zippos anyway because they are simple and they work 999 of the time most things in life work 75 of the time and not always that for what i paid in plastic refillables with triggers in the winter of 1999 i could have bought two of these so I am going to buy another now and another one yet for a gift buy this tool leave the safety alone if you have little kids fix it if you do not with a tiny phillips screwdriver and it will last for years,150,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,functional but not very practical it is a lot bigger and clunkier than it looks online and very heavy i would be better off just with a candle lighter,28,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,i should have read the reviews i bought this thing thinking it would be a really useful addition to my emergency kit i can not figure out how to make it light you have to destroy the package to get it open and cut through the instructions in the process instructions are cleverly hidden on the inside of the cardboard cover the fine print says it will not work at altitudes over 5000 feet i live at 8000 feet i can not see in the fuel gauge whether it has any fuel or not i would be sending it back except it says you can not do that,104,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,the product is okay it is pictured with having an attached cover / top however it did not come with one perhaps that is why it was considerabley less expensive i find that very misleading and i would not buy from that vendor again,42,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,this product is difficult to light hard to see the refill line and adjust the flame the high setting not enough and if you turn it down to low the flame goes out the flame goes out easily at other times probably would work indoors but matches or a inexpensive candle lighter would work just as well,57,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,i was looking for aburner lighter for my camp stove most that you buy are disposable and i hate throwing things away comes with a nice key ring for hanging it up the drawbacks are 1 the fuel level window is so small and does not go through to the other side of the lighter so i can not see the level and 2 you have to push two buttons at once child proofing to turn on the flame they are quit stiff because they are covered with a rubber shield and hard to depress together they recommend that zippo fuel only be used so i bought a can at the same time,113,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,this is a great lighter for camping or around the house it has a good design for an all purpose lighter one thing that really was a pain was the paper warning sticker that they placed over one of the fuel windows this is one of those stickers that tears into a thousand little pieces when you try to remove it have they heard of removable plastic stickers or removable glue like on post-it notes,75,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,has good design but flame is weak and easy to blow out ignition switches are very difficult to press,19,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,only problem I have had is hitting the the light switch accidently when lighting the flame and killing the batteries and will not work at all wish they put the light switch somewhere else or safety switch for it other than that i love it,43,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,i purchased the zippos mpl line worthless too and thought this outdoor model would be better i had the same problem it takes about 3 attempts to get this going if you try hard enough you can probably can it going on the first attempt but good luck they way over do it with the safety feature it is so good that nobody can get it working wish they would just do away with the safety button bottom line is that it looks cool but when i reach into the drawer to get the bbq going i get my 4 bic to get the fire going,104,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,i was very excited to get this product because i am tired of the cheap 5 lighters that you get from the supermarket however when i got this i was horrified by the performance the first thing i noticed when i tried to light it is that the flame is pitiful it barely comes out the end yes i adjusted the knob at the bottom all the way up the flame is also very easy to blow out i was trying to show my kids that it would relight so i let them blow on it but it would go out with even the smallest puff from my 2 year old and it would never come back the led light also takes stupid watch batteries so beware of that i am very disappointed and i am going to be sending this back as soon as possible,146,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,this lighter is certainly child-proof in fact it is so hard to ignite that you will likely need two hands and a couple of attempts it looks cool but must not have gone through any usability testing i bought this lighter because i associate zippo with quality products this product changed that perception,54,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,this lighter was essentially dead on arrival i read all instructions before attempting to use it after a dozen or so futile attempts to get it to light i read the instructions again i topped it off with butane set the flame adjust to maximum and double checked that the batteries were installed properly still nothing after many more frustrated attempts to engage the very difficult to use safety and ignition buttons at the same time it finally produced a flame about an 1/8th of an inch high wind resistant a baby could blow out this flame by the way it is not actually manufactured by zippo in bradford pennsylvania according to the package thisis manufactured in china to zippo quality standards zippo should be ashamed of itself this is an expensive piece of junk with their name on it,142,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,seeing all the negative reviews i was a little scared to buy this but i figured i would give it a try at this price i do not know what the other reviewers experiences were but my case came in one piece nicely packed in a box with multiple inflatable packaging around it the frame itself is great and just the right size for displaying a comic book i recently had signed it is made of very sturdy plastic i think i would have to work at it to break the front the back is a piece of black plastic that does not seem as strong and is probably the part that the other reviewers were claiming broke i can see how that could happen with neglect but it is definitely strong and sturdy enough to hang on the wall next time i need a comic book frame i will definitely be buying one of these,152,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,the part that allows you to hang it on the wall is poorly designed and broke the first time i mounted it on the wall plastic is high quality as the fall from 6 foot did not cause any further damage,40,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,great product and service always a pleasure doing business covers work great for modern age comic books makes it easy to hang them on the walls,26,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,the showcase is nice but it arrived broken i do not recommend his brand product this seems to be a consistent problem,24,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,I have ordered this product twice i am very pleased with the reasonable price and quality of the frame however both times i have ordered it it has come cracked save your time and spend a few extra dollars ordering from somewhere else,42,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,like others mine arrived with the clear front cover completely scuffed up and with a few small scratches to boot i was able to wipe away the scuff marks nothing i can do about the scratches not impressed overall it will do the job but certainly not for that price tag i would not pay more than 2 for this,59,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,these are great cheap easy pop in hang and display,10,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,was received cracked and it is not eligible for a return I had advise against ordering this one buyer beware,20,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1,negative,would return the product if i was allowed to,9,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4,positive,awesome way to proudly show off your comics my only problem was the display was a bit scuffed when i received it,22,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1,negative,should have listened to the other reviews it was completely scratched up totally ugly to look at no way am i hanging it up and of course returns are not accepted save your money everyone this might as well be a scam,41,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1,negative,it was broken when i got it very disappointed and it looks extremely cheap,14,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,great for showcasing off cool looking books not a preservation type case by any means but if you are like me and want to switch out a comic every month or two to hang on the wall this case is great,40,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4,positive,these hold the comics well and the blackmakes them stand out,13,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1,negative,do not buy this it got here quick but the box was all beat up before i even opened it i immediately noticed that the crystal clear cover was scuffed all over when i fully removed it from the box i saw the huge crack at the bottom wow I am returning it immediately and spending the extra money on a glass case,62,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,my comic book fan brother was delighted he had this to cover his newly autographed comic exactly what i needed,20,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4,positive,recieved the order very quickly but as i opened it it looks like the cover was scratched or more liked hazed light scratches luckily i was able to buff out,31,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4,positive,had a few scratches but overall looks great,8,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,given the limited availability of an economical and yet sturdy comic book frame this frame is what you pay for it is cheaper price is reflected in the quality i received two of the three that i order broken the plastic clip on the bottom breaks easily even when packaged in a box with bubble wrap this frame does hold the comic books well for display but it comes with a caution of being very fragile,75,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,it is a giant plastic she shall made of two pieces so i can hang my comic on it is all i really needed,21,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,they came within the time that i was promised everything was intact,12,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1,negative,arrived broken in 3 spots 2 on the black plastic 1 on the corner of the case thewas secured on one side with bubbles and box showed no obvious damage so I am not sure if it was shipped that way or what i should have read the other reviews,51,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,i bought this tent at an army surplus store for a big game hunt have yet to use it for that but I have spent numerous nights in it outside I shall admitt it is a little tricky to use right out of the package but once aquainted with set up it is bliss to sleep in keeps rain bugs and uneven cold ground out of the equation you will need extra rope for the main supports string for the canopy support and you shall have to store all but the smaller gear underneath the hammok also a pillow not for your neck but for under your knees the curve of the hammok stresses them a little hope this helps,114,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,ok this hammock does require extra rope to even set up it may seem ungainly at first but if you are patient with it you will be rewarded i reccomend using a very sturdy rope to set up the wight bearing portion of the hammock i just use fishing line a spool of it would seem useful in a backpacking situation anyways to hold up the netting and top tarp it is sort of scary to get into but if set up properly and entered with care is actually pretty comfortable inside i think it is great for backpacking or camping where you need to be off the ground very light and takes very little space be smart and you will have no problems btw i weigh about 220 lbs and have no problems with it,133,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,we bought this hammock in march 2010 and did not even take it out of the box and use it until august i would give it 0 stars if i could after one use the seams of the straps that attach to the ropes began to pull apart from the body of the hammock making for a very dangerous situation if someone were not to inspect and notice it before climbing in the one person who used it that one time was far under the weight limit the manufacturer rates the hammock so that was not the issue this is an extremely dangerous product granted for the price you do not expect the quality to match the best on the market however that is entirely not the issue at any price you have the right to expect safety if used within the guidelines the manufacturer sets for the product if someone were to climb in and the straps were to snap a major back or other injury could result i notified amazon and they stated they have had complaints about thisi guess not everyone takes the time to write a review i can only hope they remove it from their inventory,201,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,i bought this hammock for local hiking trips and maybe an overnighter like the other person stated it is a pain in the neck to set up yes you will need extra line to set it up and it is not wide enough this thing is better suited to be set up as a ground based mosquito proof shelter why would you do that if that is the case then just buy a net and save on time money and the added extra weight of this junk i do not reccomend this cheap alternative to buying something better like a hennessy or other quality name brand hammock,106,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,pros not much it is cheap and has a mosquito net attached zippers seams and stress points are relativley sturdy although I have only used it twice so far less bulky than carrying a sleeping pad and tent cons there are no directions on how to set this hammock up normally it would seem like a no brainer as most hammocks come out of the box with the suspension ropes intertwined / braided into the actual hammock but this hammock does not you get the hammock the canvas net nylon and seperatley the rope and metal rings you need an additional 30 feet of rope to suspend the mosquito net and nylon roofing no way is this rain worthy as is you need to get an additional tarp plus another 20 feet of rope heavy especially with all the additonal rope and tarping pretty narrow on the inside especially with the net zipped up and inside a sleeping bag,152,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,great product slept in it in the woods and not one bite,12,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,second one I have owned must to have a spare perfect,10,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,need more than 2 trees go in with a knife in your pocket you will probably need it to cut your way out when this thing flips you as a tent it is hard to enter and exit,37,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,instructions worthless need to buy extra rope very narrow do not even think that you can weigh 250 and lay in this,22,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,very bad stitching everywhere no give on entry way you got to b a worm to get in it ropes keep sliding solid panel on one stitching was so close to missing it came apart first time i used it never got it out again,46,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,my grandsons is in marine rotc and scouts he needed this for field work and it is great,18,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,it looks as described too cold to use it yet although,12,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,did not come with items to fasten to tree,9,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,good and strong quality this hammock fill every aspect thank you,11,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,it ripped the first time i used it,8,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,I have used it in the amazon rainforest a number of times and it keeps the mosquitoes away every time,19,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,not a wide as expected very cheap material and way to complicated than others that i have bought also the netting roof collects rain,25,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,theof this thing is actually better than how it works i took this on a three night trip in the mountains of west virginia it was pretty cold do you know why there are signs before bridges that say bridge freezes before road well that is because there is cold air going over and under the bridge thereby making the bridge colder same thing happens while sleeping in a hammock it is cold furthermore if you move in your sleep and i mean at all you will wake up constantly trying to reposition yourself one time i woke up and the entire hammock had shifted to where i was laying on the mosquito net portion of the hammock overall very cheap fabric and just not a practical solution to camping in the woods,134,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,seems to be great piece except u have to buy some extra pieces which they do mention,17,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,for the price i would recommend this you need a little patience and common sense to use it but it does work well tip when you string it up put all the weight / tension on the bottom ropes put hardly any weighton the mosquito netting because the straps will break and the hammock will suddenly drop until the main ropes pick up thewas well worth the entertainment factor for a boy scout who did not trust me,79,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,got for my nephew super picky guy 2 days later it is set up in the back yard yeah perfect gift for a boyscout,24,20

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,this is very cumbersome to use getting in and out of it if you are anything over 5 - 9 it is too small,20,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,awesome tent a lot of people complained about not being able to close the zipper once you get inside you need to hang the netting using 1/8 bungee cord not rope this allows the tent netting and canopy to flex the only issue i had with this is that we camped at 11000 feet during a really cold and rainy week i brought a small tarp with me to cover the hammock that kept me dry but when the wind blew it got cold specially underneath it the answer to the problem was to use an emergency blanket to keep the wind from penetrating my sleeping bag the other issue was finding 4 trees spaced right to hang it tried using 2 connections and the hammock was not as stable once i connected it at 4 points it worked awesome,139,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,this is product is good in theory setting it up for the first time for summer camp was the only time it was used the mosquito netting tore very easily and the zipper pull fell off leaving the product zipped up there was no fixing it to make it useful and therefore other sleeping arrangements had to be made at the last minute,63,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,wonderfulit is a lot better then sleeping on the ground i am not sure if they make a two person one i would buy it in a heartbeat and would and have told everyone about this,39,27

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,i used it today to lay in my yard the only thing is that it has no poles to keep netting up abit of a hassell but other wise it is awsome,31,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,my husband was very impressed with the quality and how easy it was to put up need to make sure the trees are far enough apart or it will sink to the ground,33,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,this hammock was a bit more narrow than i expected laying on it as designed i found that my arms were prone to just fall over the sides unless i crossed my chest mummy-style with them the bag that it came with ripped on the first use and i was intentionally trying to take it easy on it the ropes that tie together on it seemed a bit iffy some fraying going on combined with the material which i knew before i purchased I had say this is nothing but maybe a bargain basement hammock,96,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,on my last 4 day kayak trip i wanted to have the hammock with mosquito netting but it flipped me out on the first night and the mosquito netting came undone the second night i would not recommend thisto anyone buy an eno or a hennessy they are worth the money in the long run,57,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,awful not stable at all you have to be a less than 150 to sleep on this if your any bigger it is not stable i threw it in the trash,33,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,this is a good hammock but it does not come with the necessary hanging equipment i had to buy that else where brings the cost to the same as my other hammock which i like better this hammock provides a better view of what has around you the other hammock kinda blocks your view of everything but the sky heres the link to the other hammock i bought as well as this one the skeeter beeter comes with everything you need and is harder to fall out of,89,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,very durable but kind of small good for it is uses although outdoor shelters are hard to find this one is well built just take a tarp with you if you are going into a high rain risk,37,36

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,wow this things so cool i can not wait for this summer to use it i did not know it was going to be this big i love it thax,28,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,i have to admit this tent is a little complicated to set up until you get used to it but it is a great tent especially in the south where mosquitoes and insects are plentiful most of the year,39,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,i purchased this in thinking it would be more like a cot than a hammock and then to use as a tent was wrong about both we set it up hung and it did not come out looking nothing like the picture the bottom did not lay flat like the picture shows it was all bunched up and not very wide at all and when attempted to get in it it was very hard to do since the zipper is on theof the bottom and when i finally was able to get in it it flipped so we tried to set it up like a tent since it shows that you can do that to well it did set up kinda like a tent if you peg the bottom down to the ground tight like your suppose to forget getting in it that is for sure and then if you get it loose enough to get in you have to crawl on the ground to get in since as i said before the zipper is on the bottomneedless to say i sent it back also it does not come with hangers or pegs,195,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,my son went to sleep in it at scout camp and top part was not sewn correctly and ripped only had 10 mins use will have to send out and pay to have it fixed,35,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,got this for backpacking a little heavy for pack my husband packs it in his pack due to weight of it it does a good job in keeping out rain and bugs just be careful at bedtime not to move much or you will flip over so we staked each corner down with tent stakes seemed to fix problem yes i would recommend it anyone,65,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,slept in this hammock for a week at boy scout camp very comfortable easy to set up it could be a little wider and the fabric over the top could be a little heavier to better repel water but with three sides open essentially the whole thing is not water proof but this material is nearly a sieve for the price however can not beat it,65,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,back in the 50s i remember sleeping in jungle hammocks at girl scout camp i purchased this for my grand children and now want to order one for myself i received this in a matter of days,35,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,this was a gift for my nephew and it was put up in his room which is used all the time it is well made and durable i would recommend this hammock to a friend I shall probably buy another one for camping,41,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,this is nice and i feel better knowing nothing will be crawling on me but there are no directions and i can not find any to hang this model plus we do not have enough rope to hang the hammock and since the screen does not zip off all the way we can not use it without hanging the screen so we are looking for rope or bungis to attach the top of the screen if it were able to disconnect then we could use it with out the screen until we got the extra roping,96,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,i absolutely love this thing a real life saver the only thing i would advise others to do is by some extra rope but other than that this is a awesome hammock,31,49

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,difficult to set up requires a lot of tweeking to get it right very narrow and hard to fit into it is okay for a child or smaller person but for a bigger guy with broad shoulders no way price was okay functionality was just overall bad,46,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,at first this looked to be a promising solution to a problem i was having whilst hiking after receiving this product and opening the box to examine it is contents i was eager to test this product when i was setting the hammock up the loops on each end of the hammock which bunch the ends to form the typical hammock upon hand testing the sag of the hammock i am not quite sure what the material actually is which supports the ends of the hammock however i am sure that this product would not stand up to even the most modestunfortunately I shall be returning this product as soon as possible,112,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,waste of money you will never get it to look as good as the picture shows cheap material extremely hard to set up,23,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,this is a very good hammock similar to one i used in viet nam these hammocks are designed for physically fit young soldiers not typical american heavyweights extra large people should stick to tents or motor homes for us that stay in good shape it is a great hammock happy camping,46,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,barely wide enought for an adult needs to at least be 1 1/2 times it is current size very dissapointed in this hammock,22,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,this hammock looks great from the outside however it is very cheaply made when i set up the tent it was hard to get the right height and was very uncomfortable to get into pros it is cheap for what it is it is easy to carry around has a decent mosquito net cons does no tome with rainfly shown in some of the pictures the side netting tore little they do not come with ropes to set it up and the entire thing is just uncomfortable it is extremely narrow on the inside it is not fully water proof overall i would recommend steering away from this hammock and spend the money on a bigger better hammock,113,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,it is been sitting in my closet for 2 years still do not know how to set it up and do not want to spend that much energy trying i do not know about durability or waterproof but it feels like canvas,38,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,i just got it and so far it appears to be rugged material not cheep stuff i was surprised at the quality compared to the price I had get another one as far as walkin in the deep woods and needing a place to take a nap there is no better way than off the ground in a mosquito net i saw a review saying it was cheep he was not honest i know cheep and hate it i will say there is not the canvas that is in the picture and no extra rope to tie it to a tree it also says there is no directions if you can not figure how to tie a not to a tree stay at home but it looks like it is well worth buying,130,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,received this product and the construction was poor strings were loose everywhere and the zipper kept snagging it was also quite small and I am 55 135 lbs which is hard to do avoid this and get something of better quality and larger size,43,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,was poorly packaged and would not want to get caught in a thunder storm with it very light material and cheaply made texsport wilderness hammock with mosquito netting,29,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,as long as your under 6 foot and 250 pounds this mosquito hammock is fine when used with a rainfly over the top yes it takes a few hangs before you get it right remember to tie it up high but straight across use the roof only to block sun a rainfly is needed as with all the topend hammocks out there it is a must have you have a canvas bottom which means less chance of a mosquito bite from below as compared to a nylon hammock a bit heavier but still packable not very wide but for the normal size person you can lay flat or on your side with no problems a pad and a sleeping bag makes this a winner works pretty good on the ground as well with cot or bottom cloth it does everything the big boy hammocks do at a much cheaper price ofcourse you can not brag you spent 30000 on your hammock but do you really want to video available [ ],167,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,esta rede funciona bem para ambientes tropicais somente no dei 5 estrelas por que ela vem sem o cordame necessrio para a sua montagem mas nada que no se consiga comprar bem barato em casas de material de construo e o preo muito bom,44,63

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,i bought these under the pretense that they were cheap and i could install them in a few seconds before my trips to the woods worst decision i ever made with 15 not only are they flimbsy terribly made but not a single gun out of my collection will fit in these things the diameter of the hooks is only about 1 1/2 icnhes wide no shotgun or any ar or carbine style rifle will fit only my rem 700 would fit but the scope rubbed on the roof and it would not fit in the bottom so it was out of the question as well only a pellet gun also the bottom hooks are so close to the top hooks that not even a pellet gun will fit inside i only recommend if you wanted to spend a solid hour dremel in hand as i did increasing the diameter and cutting an inch of the bottom hooks other than that do not buy go with the roof rack or a seat hanging bag just as long as you do not go with these,181,2

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,i got these to put in the back window of my pickup they are pretty flimsy and it seemed like no matter what i did i could not get them to stay in place i wanted to be able to set my m1a in these but the hooks were not wide enough for her i know that an m1a is a bit bigger of a rifle than most a mans gun if you will but these hooks were a solid 3/4 too narrow i may end up drilling and tapping the metal near the window and running a screw through these i might also just not worry about it and just mount these in the workshop to keep the guns I am working on off of the desk if you are just going to put small rifles or ones that you will not mind falling then these are decent if not i would recommend getting some more serious gun racks,154,14

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,product works fine with sliding back window you have to tuck it between the rubber and not in the track for the glass seems a little flimsy but for the price it works great it has rubber where the gun lays so it will not scratch it,46,16

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,two stars thedescription and depiction is fairly accurate but the mechanism for securely holding position is more flimsy than it appears these racks were consistently being knocked out of place by even the most gentle jostling in the truck add to that the fact that they do not accommodate side-by-side shotguns nor most of the stocks on my guns and i just could not keep these around,67,18

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,i was very disappointed with this gun rack i only use it to hold my sons hockey sticks in the back of my truck even with the lightweight it still pulls away from the back and is constantly falling spend a few extra dollars and buy a better gun rack,50,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,nice product and thanks for delivery on time,8,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,good for square body chevy trucks with sliding windows as the window is too short for many metal gun racks without drilling the rack works and looks good stronger than you would expect holds two shotguns without bending personally i like the plastic racks if you are worried about getting the finish on your rifle or shotgun scratched i highly recommend this rack it is plastic so if the rubber wears off it will not scrape off blueing made in united states which is a nice plus the plastic racks were popular in the 80s on chevy trucks does the job well for those who want old school without drilling this is the rack for you do not toss em behind the seat when you can keep them nice and clean on a rack,130,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,they are exactly as advertised fit great delivered on time,10,62

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,my husband needed these to store rolled plans in the rear of his pick-up and they work like a charm for that purpose keeps the plans neatly rolled up and out of the way easily installed,36,64

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,this thing is junk and if i could still send it back i would definitely do not buy,18,67
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,little space to secure ends wobbles side to side,11,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,you pay what you get for that is all i have to say,12,69
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,works well as a coat rack and for hats too,10,70
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,this holds my mosin and shotty at the same time just each facing the other way stays snug keeps the weapons safe even over bumps plus even when empty it is just awesome to have a gun rack,37,71
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,not very well designed guns keep falling and it does not adjust to where two guns can be held in my chevy silverado extended cab the head rest are in the way,31,72
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,perfect just what i was expecting and a good value i use mine in a farm truck and keep a 22 and 12 gauge in it they stay put on some fairly rough terrain yet easy to get gun out when needed,42,73
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,work well easy to install but the nuts and screws are hard to get right good product tho,18,74
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,one of the best things i have got works great easy to put in and take out of my truck,20,75
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,it works but not reliable i would not buy this again,11,76
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,these are pretty flimsy you get what you pay for i guess we had to modify them otherwise the guns rattled and the pieces of the rack slid as we drove,30,77
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,no good do not stay on window slip off,8,78
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,it is a pain in the ass to put my hunting rifle on and two guns is to much weight it will shift,21,79
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,these are alright and function but extremely cheap also all i can fit in it is a rifle and that is because the barrel is small my 12 gauge is too fat to fit inside good price but you get exactly what you pay for,44,80
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,kinda hard to get a good tension on it to keep it in place,14,81
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,you have to use wooden shims for the back window of a f-250 ford pickup and that is with the divided back window that has slots you can fit the rack footing into even then both assemblies are wobbly because of the plastic construction i do not know if you can use this rack with the factory installed back window and there are no installation instructions to help you with any work around substandard all round even for the price i would not bother even trying this one to see if it might work for nine bucks it will not,97,82
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,they worked in the pics and looked good in the package but guess they are not ment to hold real guns i bought two sets one broke in 3 days the other warped from heat they are now in the local dump,42,83
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,buyer be warned this fits very few windows does not work in a chevy colorado gmc canyon double-check the measurements against your window space before purchase,25,84
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,great fit and form realy like it and it will hold a rifle or two but not my sharps rifle just to heavy for it thanks for a great prod,30,85
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,they wiggle loose and fall out from vibration of vehicle had a gun fall out of the window and behind the seat,22,86
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,these are cheap was not expecting much but was still disappointed impossible to get tight enough to stay snug even when i did the would not fit any of my rifles do not waste your time,33,87
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,i actually bought the rack to hold a couple of drivers golf and they did not fit my back window the bottom holder was to low head rests and the top holder was to high,35,88
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,they work ok but no matter how much you push and make them tight they will still move around the will tilt as you hang items on them some times when placing a gun on it one may completely come out also the adjustment is only to the distance from the top holder to the roof so you can not adjust the distance from the bottom nor can you adjust between the j holders foget about using the bottom holders if your seats have any type of head rest too they maybe ok if your using it for an 80s truck or older or maybe on the back side glass of a suburban,112,89
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,fits well is out of the way and so far have not had a problem with it installation was a little tricky at first but once i found a good spot to hold it seems sturdy,35,90
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,these little gadgets are great take your guns hunting and tell any would be truck thief that you are armed and it is probably a betterto go steal someone elses truck maybe a liberal,35,91
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,pro if it fits your truck you could probably carry fishing rods without it breaking con way too small to fit f-250 rear window flimsy never imagined that this would not fit a standard pickup with a slider window also never imagined that anyone would sell something that even if it did fit is not fit for purpose caveat emptor agrum non emi quisquilias identification est do not buy this trash,72,92
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,this is a piece of crap good thing it only cost me 1700 because it is not worth any more this thing will not stay put in the window and i ended up throwing it away,36,93
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,i now have these in both sides of my astro van i need another set for my truck hu what,20,94
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,it took several tries before i realized the ends really needed to be pushed hard behind the back glass trim i am not sure i would even have tried to push them that hard if i had a new truck but in the old work truck i was willing to risk it i should also say that i use these for carrying plans and a 4 level both of which are lighter than a rifle or shotgun but i would hazard the guess that it sould support a firearm with no problem,92,95
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,i have owned one of these before and i liked it alot especially made in united states it arrived on time but it was missing a carriage bolt and a wing nut hhhmmm i went to value home centers to pick that up other than that i would still buy another,47,96
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,i bought this to install in my f150 supper cab i have the sliding glass rear window i carry a 30 - 30 lever with 40 mm scope and 22lr lever iron sights and everything fits fine really happy with this rack i do not know that i would trust it to hold both guns while driving off road but for on road seems to work just fine,64,97
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,this keeps my fishing poles inside when i travel i used to keep them on the roof too bad my two rifles would not fit very handy when space is limited,30,98
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,as described they worked well in my 1989 chevy truck pleased with the price i use them for fishing poles,20,99
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,it is obviously plastic but it works great and is strong slap it in and put your guns up five stars in my book,23,100
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2,negative,in my last dive trip 3 eco flares only last 1 or 2 dives because a bad seal let water get into bat compartment,24,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2,negative,not bright at all not sure what this thing is really for well built although,15,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,my diver buddies not find me in the lakes,9,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2,negative,i am a kayaker it worked for about 2 years no leaks it just quit for no visible reason it looks all dry and clean inside new batteries or replacing bulb does not help disappointed in what i thought was my trusty eco flare,43,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,love these flares for cylinder attachment great for seeing buddy in low viz situations would recommend to others great battery life,21,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2,negative,i purchased this to put in my bike pack for use as a back signal to oncoming traffic and also to have an extra light if i need with the interchangeable bulb out of the box i thought i had a defective product the batteries that the product came with were dead when i put my own batteries in i had to spend a while switching them around and rotating the bulb assembly when it finally lit up so if you think your light does not work just fiddle with it for a little while longer so with brand new high output batteries this light is barely brighter than a 7w bulb in my oven i do not feel safe using this as a signal light on my back for riding my bike on the road at night i would not recommend people use this for that purpose at all at this price point their are other options i will keep it around as a back up for backcountry riding just as a emergency signal because they claim it has 500 hours of light which is much more than any other light system i have,194,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1,negative,cheap junk very poor design you think they would make a better quality light i do not trust this light not good,21,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4,positive,how can you go wrong when this helps to find your buddy i love this turn off the battery twist when you come out of the water,27,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,nice little reliable marker light i attach it to my tank by the lanyard for night diving it is nice and visible but does not give off a light that you could read by so it will not blind your buddy but your buddy will know where you are the light came with a blinking red led installed and a spare white constant on led that can be swapped for the blinker so you can use this as a navigation flare,79,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1,negative,changed batteries changed bulb never could get it to turn on total waste of time and money i guess i can use it to store matches in,27,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4,positive,compact size and easy to use twist the lens cover to turn led off and on includes a solid burn white led bulb and a red led that flashes great for night dives or lowdives to identify you buddy or group,43,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,small lightweight reliable what more need be said the led uses very little battery power and provides a good way to find your dive buddy,25,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4,positive,could be brighter probably plenty at night but not as bright as i had hoped for monterey green water diving,20,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2,negative,the package is so simple there is no users manual or anything to specify how to use this light i installed the battery then seal the white top then nothing happen the light did not turn on and there is no controler or anything on the body i do not know what happened i suppose that light will be on after i installed the battery,62,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1,negative,just received it thought it looked like good quality saw it was made in the united states and was even impressed that it had duracell batteries instead of some no name cheap ones i put the batteries in and nothing swapped out for the red bulb nothing tried different aaa batteries nothing i am returning this faulty one and a new one is supposedly on the way from amazon will update if the 2nd try is better 2nd try failure i received the 2nd unit quickly amazon return process is quite easy however this unit did not work either incredibly disappointed,104,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,i purchased this beacon in a three light set to date it has been on three dives and doing fine for the flooded compartment review i recommend using a silicone lube to grease the o ring and threads it makes it easier to turn and water tight i use silicone lube available from ikelite with all my flashlights also check the batteries mine arrived doa and had to be replaced my beacon is specific to which direction the light module goes in and will not work if reversed the flashing red beacon stands out and is not a throw away light like the chem lights two thumbs up for eco friendly hope this helps happy diving my friends,117,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4,positive,i got this to put on my dog collar for night time walks and when i let him out in the yard at night by himself it is water proof and it turns on with a twist the best selling point is the 500 hour burn time on the red flashing bulb it would be nice if it was a bit smaller but considering the price and battery it users it is not that bad because i have a large dog he does not complain only gripe i have was swapping the bulb from white to red flashing it comes with a little package that has the two bulbs in it you need to pull the one in the flash light out and push the new one in took me a good 15 minutes to get the bulb out and the new one in,142,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4,positive,this is a nice little light the blinking red bulb burns bright and i use it as a safety light for my bicycle,23,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1,negative,i just received this today it does not work neither bulb checked batteries they are fine i needed this light for a special project and am now very frustrated i will just buy one of those dollar store things and modify it I shall be back to let you know about how the return went rate light 0 stars amazon took care of the return in an instant kudos to amazoncom amazoncom gets 5 stars for their prompt and seamless customer service for this,83,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5,positive,i have used this light for two years now i use it mounted to a rack on my mountain bike i like the simplicity in just tightening it to turn it on and off i commute a lot and use it daily i have replaced the batteries only once and that was just to be safe i am still on the same original bulb holds up great in the rain and can take the punishment of being knocked around on a bike i ordered two more so cars can see me even better not one complaint,96,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4,positive,i had a large nut holding my basin faucet and this was the only tool i found that could lock it down it is pretty loose on the hinge although so you might have to use two hands to secure it to the nut and turn but bottom line is it worked-and the shipping time was very good also,59,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2,negative,i needed this large size basin wrench to remove an old kitchen faucet unfortunately when it arrived there was no spring which makes it very difficult to use in tight spaces the end of the wrench just flops around so it is hard to get it to grip the nut if you can get both your hands up there then it might work but with one hand it is nearly impossible the only positive of this wrench is that it is quite large so it can work for nuts that are 2 and larger other wrenches I have tried were much too small for a 2 nut,104,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1,negative,the manufacturer failed to install a spring in the large jaw making the tool useless i returned 1st tool for replacement i included explaination for returning the tool and talked with a service representative the replacement tool arrived within two days excellent response unfortunately it had the same defect no spring in the large jaw i again contacted the customer service desk and advised them of the problem the service representative said she would have the product pulled from the the availability list i solved my need for the wrench i was pleased with the response from amazon lasco 13 - 2029 metal 16-inch basin wrench large jaw for faucet installation,112,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5,positive,it is hard to find a basin wrench that is big enough to turn that big nut that holds the single handle faucet to the sink this one does it and is inexpensive too,34,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4,positive,every once in a while you are confronted with a 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 nut holding a sink faucet this is usually tucked up behind the sink well and the only way to get at it is a with a basin wrench or some very tricky maneuvers with a set of adjustable pliers this large-jaw basin wrench solves the problem nicely more typical basin wrenches will work up to about 1 1/2 after that you have got to improvise the extended upper jaw on this unit allows you to work with nuts up to 3 in width which covers the majority of 1 1/2 to 2 sanitary pipe fittings you do not need it everyday unless you are a plumber but when you do need it it is nice to have,127,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4,positive,pro build to last and can fit up to 4 nut con needs a spring for the jaw but did not need it for a 3 nut that i was tightening,30,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1,negative,the only thing good about this purchase is the stellar customer support from amazon the tool has no spring as every other basin wrench does so you have to try and hold it closed with the free hand reaching up behind the sink which defeats the purpose of the 16 inch handle the seller does not return emails but amazon stepped up and refunded the purchase price,66,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5,positive,single-handle faucets usually attach to the sink via a single large nut we had a loose faucet for a couple years and nothing i tried would get around the large nut in such a small place i was able to tighten it up in just a few minutes using this,50,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1,negative,the jaw on mine did not bend 90deg even with a lot of force it just seam stuck whoever made this did not test it before packing it I am returning mine and wasted time with this order,35,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2,negative,i got this to remove a rusted on single hole kitchen sink nut that a standard jaw size basin wrench was too small for it did not work i tried liquid wrench i tapped on it and more i put vice grips on the shaft to increase the torque as the t handle is rather small in the end i just cut the nut off with a dremmel i should have done that in the beginning the 1 3/8 nut i used it on seemed to be at the small end of it is grip do not get this tool instead of a regular jaw size basin wrench the jaw is not spring loaded to help it grip the nut like my regular basin wrench is new kitchen sink fixtures do not seem to need a tool like this for installation,136,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2,negative,the wrench is very loose it does not hold tight when you try to turn it needs better crip to support the turn,23,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5,positive,this is great for any size nut but if you only need to use it once you may just want to take some pvc cut slots in it for the nut if it has wings and use that i will use this on many projects and have no need for a small one now this does it all,58,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4,positive,if you are home owner and do not foresee using this type of tool often this will get the job done the lack of spring did not really make it that much more difficult as i could reach my hand up to the nut but in certain circumstances if you can not get your hand near the nut without the spring you may be in trouble is saving another 15 bucks off a higher quality wrench worth it hard to say how often will you need to use it I am confident even without the spring you will figure out a way to make it work once it grips it is super easy to tighten the nut my kitchen faucet no longer moves thus I am super happy,121,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5,positive,works like a charm let us see how the plastic holds up to a year of sunshine and bad weather,19,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2,negative,tabs were thinner than expected and felt like it could break very easily,13,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2,negative,very thin 0016 torn one after installed original one was twice as thick 0032,14,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1,negative,these tabs are small and weak they do not attach well and simply sit in the track so they pull out easily if much force is applied if you have large screens or they are tight to fit look for something else,42,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1,negative,warning this one does not fit the screentight screen frames you will buy from homedepot or lower,16,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2,negative,the product is fine but it took a long time to receive the items,14,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5,positive,i used these tabs when i replaced some screens that had been in place for 20 years the screening material was easy to find at the local home depot but the tabs where nowhere to be found these have worked well with the charcoal colored screens that i used I am not particularly handy withstuff but these were easy enough to use it just took a bit of work to figure out which side of the screen to place them opposite the side where the spline is located and you need to work it a bit as it does make inserting the spline a tighter fit i used a 0140 spline with a standard screen the tabs make the insertion and removal of the screen much easier and so far they held very securely time will tell if they will get brittle as they age the one negative is that since they are a solid blackthey are noticeable my previous tabs were clear but then they got brittle over time and just broke when i tried to remove the screen,183,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2,negative,very thin when you use the tabs to remove the screen they pop off the ones i used from lowes did not do this,24,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4,positive,these tabs are the dimension i need with a 1/4 inch projection into the spline channel these tabs are like the originals on my screens so they do the job and hopefully will last several years also a good price and quick delivery i wish however that somebody could come up with a better design that would be sturdier and easier to pull,63,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5,positive,i bought this to replace old more than a decade and broken pull tabs on my window screens these are much flimsier than my old pull tabs but they do their job does not break off when pulled up to lift window screen,43,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5,positive,these work well easy to use when replacing my window screens,11,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4,positive,my old screen frames had none or missing / broke off these did the trick it is a standard spline held pull tab nothing fancy would have been nice if the box came in an even number of tabs although kinda stuck with 1 extra that i can not do nothing with fast shipping time was greatveddy veddy gooooood laughing out loud,52,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2,negative,we take our window screens out each year for the winter we have been doing that for 10 years i got a 25-pack to replace tabs that occasionally snap off and these tabs break much much more often than the tabs that came on the original windows we have had the most problems with tab breakage in screens that have a lot of sun exposure so it may just be a uv thing just to be clear they are not pulling out due to installationissues these tabs split into two pieces the long part of the tab shears off and the remainder of the tab stays under the vinyl spline shopping for a better solution,116,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5,positive,my local hardware store did not have these and i was replacing screens they work just fine for me but may not hold up as long as the oem,28,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5,positive,i did not expect the water pressure to increase from this water filter showers are now so much more refreshing than they used to be you actually feel cleaner from the increased pressure and the cleaner water an excellent purchase in my opinion,42,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,i have been using this product for almost a year now initially everything looked perfect however the hand held shower unit is made of a poor quality plastic so is the tubing after 3 months of use the tubing ruptured because the metal framing around it had a sharp end which was not fixed properly and over time it cut the rubber i had to buy a new hose to replace the old one along with a new shower head after a while the connector between the shower head and the filter broke since it was plastic now i just have the filter from the original package but have a beautiful new shower head and hand held combo attached to the filter with a new metal connector hope the filter does not brake with the new shower set,138,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1,negative,where to start first issue my order was forgotten about and never shipped to me i will say that after i contacted the seller via email they did respond promptly and ship myout including a free water filter second issue the bath ball filters handle broke w / n the first use third issue the shower filter was not even on for a week before the tubing w / n it burst please do not purchase either of these items,77,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5,positive,this is the best hand-held shower head i have head so far the filter is great my skin is smoother and my hair much much softer whenever i take a shower at the gym now with unfiltered water i feel the difference the chrome is beautiful no more chlorine smell and now with the hand-held i can wash my hair without getting in the bathtub nice,66,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5,positive,i grew up in new york and absolutely never gave a second thought to the quality of our water my hair was always soft manageable and shiny then i moved to the midwest where i found the hardest water in the united states it clanks as it comes out of the tap you have to use a chisel to remove the residue from your counters it leaves my hair dirty-looking stringy dull and flat water softeners do not do a thing to help even moving to a neighborhood with so-called city water is no improvement i tried every type of shampoo and conditioner tried rinsing my hair in rainwater i collected in a barrel that worked a bit although it can be quite a shock in the winter and concocted a vinegar rinse finally i purchased the crystal quest with it is super-duper filter not only is my hair soft and manageable again but my skin feels much better too it was easy to install and works great if you live in an area with hard water treat yourself and get one of these handheld showers,183,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,this is a good product the advantage is it leaves your skin feeling smooth and moist i actually feel clean when i get out of the shower city water tends to irritate my skin even while i am showering the extension on it allows for easy clean up of your shower and makes washing your pets 100 easier it also has an off switch on the shower head which helps when your trying to lather your dog without turning the water competely off the only disadvantage is changing the direction of the filter every couple of weeks i would like to have a shower head filter that i can install and leave of course i would still have to change the filter either way you decide to take is up to you all filters need maintenance overall this is a good product for the price you pay,147,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5,positive,my hair is softer is it the new shampoo i used or the filtered water my hair is so soft that i can not help playing with it my husband has extreme dry skin he put cream over all in the morning by evening he has suffering from the itchy dry skin again so bad that i wish he could put cream on during the day now he does not need to put extra cream in the evening,76,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5,positive,my hair is better now that i started using this it was really gross feeling before i know that is vague but i always felt like i had gunk in it before,31,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,not only does it filter the bad stuff from your shower water but the design gives you a nice steady well dispersed stream of water,25,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1,negative,water comes out slow and it faster to wash yourself in the sink do not buy thisit is the bad,22,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1,negative,there was no way to make this shower head stop leaking and leaking badly it had a funny looking head and it had little water pressure i replaced it with one that was cheaper and easier to install and has never leaked i also find the company and it is associates to be disreputable they promised me my return shipping because they did not origionally send what i had ordered but after having fun at my expense and doing what i could to resolve the situation i was left with them owing me money i do not recommend this product or this company,101,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1,negative,bought this and was working well for a few months about the 4th month started toand could tell the filter was not working properly due to smelling chlorine again in shower called crystal quest directly they said they would send me out a new unit that was over 2 months ago tried to work with this seller said they would get back with me the next day it is been over a week and still have not heard anything back from the seller or crystal quest this was really the worst customer service I have experienced next time would buy a different brand just to ensure proper customer service,108,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,kind of disappointed with the quality of the all plastic unit will go out and purchase different shower head later the hose still will not behave itself need more flexible supply hose filter works great living in the nw whenever we get our torrential rains the water services pump up the chlorine and being somewhat allergic to it the filter takes care of the smell and irritation,66,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1,negative,i bought this product a year and a half ago i have had to get new parts for it several different times already now it keeps breaking because it is made of cheap plastic a type of styrene which is toxic btw after 1 year they would not send me replacement parts so now i am stuck with a broken showerhead that i can either keep buying parts for from crystal quest or i can find another showerhead that does not break all the time anyone have any showerhead filter recommendations i am so dissapointed in this showerhead such a waste of money and it is been a hassel having to write to crystal quest every 5 or so months it seems to get something replaced not at all environmentally friendly either i do not know why they can not just make it of metal i would certainly buy it if it was metal it would not be breaking all the time and would not have the plastic / styrene concern either did not like the customer service from crystal quest either,172,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,i live in chicago where the city water is hard i purchased this showerhead with some reservations because of the previous reviews so far i am very pleased with the product the showerhead does give you increased water pressure resulting in a more powerful and cleaner shower experience less residue my skin scalp and hair is less dryer than before the installation process was easy and quick no dripping or leaks the filter seems to work great you do have to reverse the filter on occasion this product is mostly affordable due to the long filter life up to one year one negative the showerhead only has 3 or 4 water settings most have 5 settings in this price range,120,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,worth the easy to install frnkly it not any harder installing one of these compared to a garden hose outside your house,23,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,this is a pretty good sprayer but the plastic button soon leaks needs washer kits often so be prepared to buy them in quantity if you have like me several sprayers the positive is the excellent lifetime warranty and service by kohler customer service i wish they made one with less plastic and better designed button i have had to replace 2 with buttons leaking or coming off and was sent prompt replacement,73,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,first of all in case you are wondering the spray head is plastic with a brass coating the photo and info is vague on this the hose from the spray head is unwieldy for the spray head and causes the spray head to have problems when trying to seat i put a weight on it under the sink outside of that it does the job and is better than the one i replaced,72,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,this spray is pretty good quality for a replacement kitchen spray it looks good is a decent weight and was fairly easy to install my only complaint is that it did not come with a weight to keep the hose tucked neatly underneath the sink without that weigh the hose can sometimes be a little tricky to put back under the sink but it is not too big a deal overall i am happy with the product,76,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,only one star from me first the quality of construction is no different from generic home store quality so forget the kohler quality equation looks substantial but it is only looks just chromed plastic second the force of the spray is weak suspect this is either the number of holes with too much volume per hole either reduce the number or make them smaller and yes it is the sprayer because the previous unit worked fine maybe mine was a fluke on the strength of stream so suggest buy locally and install before the return window is gone just in case,101,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,i ordered this because it was kohler well I am very disappointed the only well made part was the hose the handle and piece connected to the hose are plastic very cheaply made would definantely not recommend,36,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,mediocre quality fitting on sprayer handle loosened after a few months and started leaking under the sink tightened it up and thestopped for now,26,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,i just bought two of these spray heads unfortunately why two because since this spray head was installed only two years ago it is already broken twice parts springing out no fixing it while it is out of commission so is our sink because it diverts the water from the faucet therefore i bought two assuming it will only be a matter of months before it breaks again and it is a big deal not to be able to use the kitchen sink when this happens very disappointed in kohler and have already told the design / build firm that redesigned our kitchen to never use this sprayer tried to replace with another brand but the sizing was such we had to replace with this one sigh,121,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,i bought this to repair a pedicure chair and it worked great,12,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,nice sprayer but wished it was not made of plastic expected something a little better from kohler,16,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,i purchased this to replace the original sprayer on my kohler kitchen faucet pros looks good installs easily better connection than the previous design it replaces old version had tendency towhere the hose met the handle cons the only thing i do not like better than the previous model is that the water pressure is not quite as strong through the sprayer,62,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,i bought two of these the first lasted a year before the handle shot off and water sprayed all over my kitchen ceiling i ordered a replacement a few weeks ago and after installing it today found that it leaks now i need to return it and find another option,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,i ordered this sprayer because it was the only one in thei needed i was not positive of thebut ordered it anyway yes it is the muted gold tone / brushed brass or whatever you want to call it but it matches my faucet perfectly I am not crazy about the push button in the front of the sprayer because I have never had one before and it is taking a little getting used to but at least it is the rightand it works fine my husband said it installed perfectly easily,92,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,excellent product works better than expected should be double the cost so was quite surprised my spouse likes it is looks and the way it operates much better than the original that came with the sink,35,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,this kohler sidespray is a total piece of junk it may look like it is made out of metal but it is chrome-plated plastic so it will not last and will easily break the spray button has a very soft spring and is poorly located so when you grab it to use you often get a random spray you do not want finally the way the sprayer attaches to the hose is very stupid it is constantly coming unscrewed and leaking water ugh,81,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,bought it in may by december the hose kinked where the spray is attached can not use standard hose have to throw it away junk,24,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,ili likedtthe retro design but it leaked we installed it and water continuosly dripped from the sprayer head the base felt like cheap plastic disapointing,25,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,my last sidespray had the button fall off and searching for a replacement was harder then i thought i would be it did not seem like any of the large hardware stores had the sprayer by itself this one was the same brand as my sink / faucet and complimented the faucet perfectly in fact i like the look of this one a lot more then the one that originally went with the faucet and it works great,75,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,i looks good and installs easy but like someone else mentioned the pressure is miserable i would not recommend this to anyone,21,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,this is a nice looking sidespray it matches my brushed stainless steel sink the nozzle pivots where it meets the hose which i like as it feels a little more maneuverable than the cheaper fixed nozzle-hose connections,37,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,thank god i could find this to replace the broken one apparently shiny brass is outlawed at home product stores the cost was reasonable considering my other choices would not have matched this old house,35,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,there has about 18 inch depth in the clamping area they open to about 3 effective bite spring strength is about right for laminating get a bunch of them these clamps are stamped from sheet metal they look kinda cheap but work as good or better than the american 2 - 4 hardware store variety they are far superior to the curvy plastic kind that cost around the same price,67,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,as described arrived quickly very happy great price,9,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,these are pretty strong clamps i have not used mine for much yet but they appear sturdy and strong,18,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,very little spring pressure i have some that look just like this and will hurt you if you clamp it on your finger these look the same but are not the spring pressure is harder the further you open them but if you are clamping thin piece of metal or wood it does not have enough pressure to adequately hold the piece down i do not recommend these it is back to lowes where they are more expensive but i guess you get what you pay for,85,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,these are good clamps the cool orange padded insulation covers slip right off the first time you use them squirt the orange pads full of form a gasket and slide them back on then you are gtg,37,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,these are not at all like the photo in the picture the grips look like they were painted on not thick at all like the photo the clamps do not open very wide so i could not use them for the intended woodworking purchase unfortunately the cost to ship them back is more than what i paid so i guess i just lost out on my money maybe i can use them for something at work think they will hold stacks of paper together,86,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,great simple clamps i like the red handles it makes them easier to see i will probably buy more since i use them all the time and this size works with virtually anything if i need to secure / hold larger objects i would use larger bar clamps but that goes without saying use the right tool for the job the only thing i had to change was i glued the rubber tips and handles to the metal so they would not slide off,81,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,good enough quality for my project delivery was fine and on time,12,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,these clamps look nothing like the picture these clamps have a straight profile whereas the clamps pictured have an arched profile this means that the clamps open to only 2 and 1/4 inches if you are clamping two small boards together they will do the job if you are looking for 2 and 3/4 to 3 inch jaw openings look elsewhere i have given the 1 star rating due to the fact that the pictured clamps and what i received are totally different update well i am glad that they changed the picture to what the clamps really look like all of the plastic coverings have come off the clamps at the time of this update i really did not expect a lot from the clamps and my rating would have been around three stars but with the picture being wrong and the jaw opening size being incorrectly stated at the time of my original purchase 0ne star is about the right rating,163,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,i use these clamps when it comes to the bigger jobs they work great and hold items very well i even have attached then to shelving to hold up screens and dividers,32,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,this is just what i ordered this is just what i wanted and i was lucky and happy to find it available from amazon at a good price and brought right to my door,34,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,i bought these to hold our pet food bags closed i know it sounds a little weird but we were trying to use cloths pins and they were just too small we have multiple cats a big dog and about 200 humming birds to feed so we buy in bulk to get the bags to stay closed you need some serious holding power and these clamps do the trick,69,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,they are 2 inch clamps the deals is not as cool you are better off going to home depot and buying better quality clamps for 99 cents or so,28,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,they are heavy duty and the springs are strong they seem to hold as well as expected I shall use them all the time,23,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,they do what they need too i had purchased another set of pretty much the exact same things 6 in heavy spring clamps from another manufacturer and they had a much stronger clamping grip but these do the job really good for gluing or joining parts together,46,14
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,bought this for a 9 year old boys birthday party it was a real hit my son loved it so much he hated to bash it open very nice looking good quality well maybe too good quality it took many many hits before even started to bust open but it kept the kids busy and they had a blast finally had an adult give it a good bash to drop all the goodies,72,0
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,the pinata arrived in the time specified by the seller it looked just like the picture was well put together my nephew had a knight themed birthday party and the pinata was perfect for it the kids had a great time slaying the pinata,44,1
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,we bought this for our sons 6th birthday knights was the theme all the kids loved taking their turn but it was king dad who had to slay the dragon with his pocket knife we could not get it open the head came off but not at the candy opening it arrived very quickly and was packed great great price too,60,2
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,this was a great pinata and a wonderful addition to our princess / castle themed party the party was for my 3 year old daughter but i wanted to have something her older brothers and cousin could enjoy so i got them swords and they slayed the dragon pinata it did not hold a lot of loot so i began throwing more stuff on to the ground once he was broken open overall a very cool pinata,74,3
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,i thought it looked a little odd upon arrival but my children assurred me it was great sure enough the kids at the birthday party thought it was a cool pinata it was not very easy to break open but i had the candy packed in tightly,46,4
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,i ordered this pinata for my sons birthday party in which we were making a movie it arrived in plenty of time for the party we used it for a scene where all the kids were knights battling a dragon and it worked out fine i gave it slightly lower marks for durability because it ended up breaking at the neck instead of bursting open but that was fine we saved the head and used it to add in shots later with water shooting out of the mouth with the garden hose making it look like the dragon was shooting water at the knights lots of fun i would buy it again if i was doing another similar party,119,5
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,thiswas ordered on september 27 2008 for my grandsons birthday party held on october 11 2008 thewas received by my daughter from the vendor on october 23 2008 it took almost a month to receive it which was past the date of the party the expected ship date was not to exceed twelve days which would have been october 9 2008 i called the vendor on october 9 2008 and i received no clear explanation for the delay as a result i will never order from this vendor ever again,94,6
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,pinata was badly mangled and folded into a ball wings are broken head is pushed in product is almost completely unusable,21,7
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,this came completly folded in half and a super small box it was ripped crushed in and had creases from being folded only reason not 1 star is because i still filled it with candy and kids continued to detroy it,39,8
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,the dragon pinata arrived a little smaller than expected but that was not the problem it was packed terribly as a result the wings were bent backwards and will not stay open one foot and it is mouth arrived ripped I am very disappointed,40,9
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,the dragon piata was really cute and helped make our party more fun,13,10
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,need to use smaller type candy like starbursts and tootsie roll size worked great at 6 year olds birthday party,20,11
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,very cute makes a great decoration but a terrible piata could maybe hold two handfuls of candy,17,12
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,broke in half with the first kiddo hitting a 3 year old so disappointed move on to a different vendor,20,13
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,it was beautiful fun and delivered quickly thank you,9,14
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,the head broke off after only 2 children went through the line we had very disappointed children at our party,20,15
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,good cost-effective pinata not a lot of room inside so do not buy if you are planning on cramming more than a couple big fist-fulls of stuff inside but if you need a cheap dragon pinata and you need it fast was prime when i bought it then this is your go-to,50,16
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,where the body and head connect is so flimsy that it only lasted 2 kids looked cool but was useless,20,17
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,i wish there was more information about the capacity of this otherwise i never would have bought it knowing how small it actually is do not hold your breath if you think you can fit 2 pounds of candy in here because you can not a little sad that with all the kids coming to my daughters birthday that they have got a pinata with hardly any candy in it i barely got 2 105 oz bags of little snickers twix milky way and more in there i was going to put cute little pencil erasers in there too but i can not fit anymore in it disappointing also does not look much like the picture even after i tried straightening it is body out,117,18
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,the pi ata is exactly as described and i am well pleased with this purchase,14,19
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,we ended up liking it so much that we pulled the candy back out and kept it around unbashed easily the coolest pinata we have bought the only downside is the small belly so it can not hold much candy but it is so cool that we do not care,46,20
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,i agree that the body cavity is a little on the small side but overall i found this pinata to be really cute and the quality of it is as i expected it i feel that it is a reasonable price for what you are getting we are using this pinata as a jabberwocky for my stepdaughters alice in wonderland themed party after i hung it up for a couple of days he straightened out nicely i did not have the issue of it being crushed or broken as some have said i mean it is a paper dragon that you are going to bust with a stick for the price and for it is purpose i think that it is a great buy,120,21
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,not good quality the wings look weird and do not stay open there has pieces without the black paper so it looks unfinished the part that holds candy is very small so does not hold much i would return if i had more time before my sons party very disappointed,47,22
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,it is definitely small but i like that as it took just the right amount of candy,17,23
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,no indication of a hole to actually put candy in it,11,24
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,this came all squished the wings arm and legs are stuck to the body if i pry them open the cardboard will rip does not hold much mostly small candies like tootsie rolls,32,25
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,this is an awesome looking dragon using it as the enderdragon for my sons minecraft party a little small will not hold a ton of candy but overall a great purchase,30,26
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,worked great for my sons 1st birthday knight party he loved sleighing his first dragon was a bit hard to stuff and t here was not much room for goodies,29,27
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,the wings do not stay up so i have to fix them also the photo looks much better than the real thing i can not return it because we have a ninja party all the ninja pinatas are out of stock,40,28
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,this was the highlight of the entire knights of the round table birthday party it was well constructed and easy to fill a perfect addition,25,29
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,got this pinata for my sons birthday party when it arrived the package and the pinata was damaged we did not have the time to get a new one because of how long it took to get thisso we figure it was going to be beat up anyway it only took one hit and the head went flying off plus this thing was very small tryed to contact the seller and was told there has nothing they would do i would buy anything else but this peace of junk,90,30
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,thisdid not look as nice as the picture presents it will the colors were dull thewas smaller than i expected it looked wimpy i was embarrassed to bring it to the party so i went out and bought a more expensive looking piata from a local store,51,31
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,bought this for my sons 9 year birthday party to go with pokemon theme i thought it would at least be something different but it is very flimsy the head broke off at the neck after the second try kid a 4 year old girl hit it with the stick had to re-tie it up to continue the game without the head and then that did not even last for a couple more players most kids did not even get a turn it was a disappointment and i actually had kids crying because they did not get to a turn to hit it booo,101,32
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,very nice use it for my son party holds a good amount of candy and very sturdy,18,33
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,great product my son loved hacking away at it with his friends with the homemade wooden sword i made after everyone got a shot at it my son chopped it is head off on his second try it took about 8 hits total before it broke open the only part i was disappointed about was that the candy did not fly everywhere like you see in the movies some candy flew out enough to distract the children so that i could rip it apart a little more and get all of the candy out,92,34
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,i ordered this 1 week before my 4 year old sons knights and dragons birthday party with the two day shipping from amazon prime it was on my doorstep two days later i was definitely impressed with the processing speed the pi ata was a roaring success we uswd it first as a party decoration the kids enjoyed screaming and running away from it during their make believe play the red wingspan was perfectly frightening most of all the kids had a blast fighting the dragon we had seven 3 - 5 year olds striking with foam swords and it lasted two rounds before succumbing to the knights determination all kids got a few good shots twice so props to the production for making it the perfect balance between sturdy and vulnerable and just fyi the sweet spot to hit is the bottom of the belly this was worth the money and was by far the best decoration and activity at the party,160,35
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,very cheap feel like you could almost break it when moving it around,12,36
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,is not 19 inches tall as described asked for refund and all they give you is excuses and run around,21,37
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,it worked for about two kids with a couple of swings each it broke at the neck but below where it was suspended it served it is purpose and help candy until it broke i can not really fault something for breaking when it was designed to break and made to be hit with a baseball bat it was pretty cool and we had fun making the dragon attack the kids trying to hit it,73,38
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,when my son turned 10 the topon his list was a piata literally at the top of his list so he got his piata we broke 3 ropes holding the piata up before the piata allowed itself to be beaten to smithereens and all the boys had a great time,52,39
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,it was really small but the children enjoyed it,9,40
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,lasted long enough to be fun for the kids to whack at it for a while,16,41
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,sadly this is a terribly designed piata we bought it for my sons 8th birthday he is an average to small size kid and it broke with his 1st swing imagine the disappointment of 10 kids who also wanted a swing at it unless you plan totape it before use i would not recommend,55,42
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,such a cute pinata for a dragon themed party broke on neck with one swing due to the way it is constructed so that was a little disappointing,27,43
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,he is a little doofy looking in the picture and he has even more so in real life do not get me wrong i love that i did not have to try and make one his face just seems a little wonky is all he held about 80 pieces of candy and he took quite a beating before the kids finally got their candy i would say he has good quality family entertainment,69,44
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,from the picture and other information describing the product i was expecting it to have more space inside to put candy we used miniature candy bars and i could only get about 20 pieces inside the product was made very cheap and when i moved it i was afraid it was going to fall apart my three year old took the first swing at the pinata with a plastic baseball bat and it cracked open right away therefore not leaving many swings left for the other children i would not recommend purchasing this pinata for an older childs birthday party,100,45
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,nice pinata but the only thing is that it is too small did not hold much candy,16,46
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,very cute but very little room for goodies broke very quickly when hit by 4 year olds,17,47
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,not what i was expecting the thing is tiny barely holds any candy it came all smashed up i had to glue the wings eyes and not sure what to do with the tail it is totally bent out of shape I am so embarrassed to hang this up if i had time to get another one i would when i saw this online it reminded me of the ender dragon from minecraft my son is so into that right now i figured I had surprise him so sad,83,48
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,big it was nice and took a while to break,10,49
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,hit it 3 times and busted open looks cool,9,50
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,piata was great except it was broke when i got it it was sent in a bag should have been sent in a box so it was protected,28,51
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,my pinata was broken the neck was half torn one of the wings was torn not happy at all was not worth it at all and the prize not worth the size,32,52
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,this piata lasted about 10 little kid hits before it was literally sliced in half by a 4 year old when it arrived the wings were flopping down so we had to use wire to get them to sit up like in the picture there was not much room in the body for filling so we had to poke a small hole in the head to get more stuff in on the positive side it did look nice once we had it stuffed and full of goodies it was just disappointing that it broke so easily,95,53
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,the entry point on mine was not really clear because the plastic seal was missing but the back of the neck had a weak joint which i used to fill with candy i also used construction paper to make flames it was very nice,43,54
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,the piata was just too small did not hold very much candy and it got flattened during the shipping process disappointed,20,55
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,the piata was okay it was much smaller than expected and did not hold much candy it did ship quickly and looked similar to picture,24,56
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,broke open after 4 swings fun for our first piata easy to fill and our birthday boy and guests really enjoyed having something different,24,57
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,the dragon piata that i received was different from the one that was pictured it was similar but still not what i thought i would receive will not be ordering from them again,33,58
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,this is a good pinyata but i wish it had more room inside for candy i had to rip extra room in the tail and head to fit all the candy i bought for it but other than that it look great and the kids loved the dragon pinyata,49,59
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,coolestever worth it used this for my daughters disney evil villains party as malifacent and it was a big hit,22,60
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,took only one hit and fell apart very sad birthday party kids and disappointed parents not only is it really too small it almost ruined my sons birthday thankfully we had a backup piata,34,61
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,adorable the kids loved slaying the dragon and reaping the rewards of candy and trinkets from the dragons belly would recommend,21,62
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,a lot cheaper than if i would have gotten from a party store worked great for our knight and princess themed party it was even slayed by a knight and shipped quickly,32,63
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,this was perfect for our sons birthday party plenty of room to stuff with candy and it was made of very good quality and actually took many hits to crack open,31,64
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,bought it for my sons birthday party all the kids had a blast with it it went really well with the how to train your dragon theme,27,65
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,we are evidently spoilt by the pinatas we have had in mexico which are made from papier mache that is set as hard as concrete the black dragon is cute read pretty small but the main issue was the strength we had 6 kids at the party and the first one did all the damage the rest of the kids never got a chance to give it a whack which caused more grief than we needed we will not be buying this again,84,66
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,my son and his friends really enjoyed this pinata my only complaint is that the tag said it had strings for the kids to pull to get the candy to come out but there were no strings we ended up using a drum stick to break it open,48,67
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,i choose this rating because it broke after the third swing by two small eight year old boys it is very small save your and double up on brown bags and use that as a pinata old school that way everyone can take a turn to swing seller did have fast shipping although,52,68
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,we ordered this for my 5 year olds party this pinata was cute and exactly as it looks in the picture however after three direct hits from a 5 year old the pinata snapped right off at the neck not to mention it holds very little candy because it is so narrow not your best option,56,69
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,just received it today i have never seen such a small pinyata nothing will fit in this big regret quality is okay but big disappointment size,26,70
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,i bought this dragon pinata because of the amazon reviews i read and the price it was about 18 when i purchased it around 10 - 15 cheaper than other dragon pinatas i had seen the reviews were mostly all positive so perhaps i had high expectations when i received the pinata some of the colored paper on the dragon was loose and the wings were bent terribly I am sure this could have been prevented had it been shipped in a larger box there was no way to fit it in the box they used without breaking it is wings aside of that it was a sturdy well made pinata,107,71
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,i bought this pinata for my sons 5th birthday and he loved it in fact he loved it so much he did not want to destroy it so we had to take all the candy out of it and now the dragon hangs in his room my other two sons love it also it was a good deal the wings and the tail were squished a little during shipping and the wings did not stick out like it does on the picture but i would buy it again,86,72
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,the black dragon shaped pinata is cute and pretty durable i bought two of these at the same time one did not come with a nylon loop to hang it with had i bought one first i would not have bought another i would not recommend this to friends looking for pinatas the wholeof a pinata is to be able to stuff it with lots of candy for kids this is the smallest pinata i have ever seen you also can not stuff candy / toys in the dragons head well this is almost half of the pinata the recommendation is to only stuff 2 lbs of candy in it i do not know how you could stuff more in there the candy also needs to be small so you can pack as much as possible in it for the 2 - 4 kids it will satisfy it also does not stand up as in the picture you have to hang it i had my soccer team beat this thing to a pulp then gave them a pre-bagged bag of candy afterwards as they each did not get very much i think this was designed by a dentist,190,73
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,i was seeking a durable dragon pinata and this is perfect we used the pinata a little differently my three year old was not blindfolded he slayed the dragon as part of his birthday party so i wanted one that could take a few well placed hits before smashing,49,74
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,the game consists of about 40 stages as far as I am aware starts off fairly easy and picks up in difficulty as you progress it can get a bit repetitive at times however since you can use different units in different ways to take our your targets it keeps it to a minimum for the most part you will also probably want to repeat stages so you can gather items to equip your minions with more powerful equipment pretty fun I had definitely recommend it,83,0
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,not sure why there are a lot of hateful reviews here but I am really enjoying this game the soundtrack and sound are great and the gameplay is really addictive and very similar to that of pikmin it is even created by the same team upgrading your units is fun and keeps me coming back i have not beaten it yet but I have put a few hours in and I am sure it will be expanded even further with dlc in the future also multiplayer the worlds look great but the actual characters are a little lacking in detail compared to other vita games but the gameplay is fast and fluid and that is what matters most to me i picked this game up for 30 on a lightning deal and i think that is the sweet spot for it,134,1
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,this game is ok for the first half but then the areas get cheap there are electric fences and fire traps that are almost impossible to avoid the games difficulty does not increase due to a need for the players skill to increase but rather the game introduces cheaper tricks and tactics in each new level and due to limited control of your army the game becomes very frustrating i do not recommend this game instead invest your money in one of the other excellent launch titles like uncharted rayman mutant blobs attack or escape plan,95,2
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,a great game to play on the vita one of best stragey game i played I am glad i got it for my vita,23,3
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,i purchased this game when i preordered my ps vita i should have waited this game minus well be an app for a smart phone a free one at that i believe it is a great concept yet nothing else went into this game you have minimal control it is basically a one button does all action game except for movement i assure you you will be disappointed with it luckily the gamestop i purchased it at let me return it for a preorder of unit 13 so far I have been extremely happy with my vita and all the games i have uncharted wipe-out ninja gaiden and dungeon hunter this game was an extreme disappointment if you are planning on purchasing it wait til it goes down in price I am sure you will easily be able to get a pre-owned version any day now i believe most people who made the mistake i did of purchasing it will be trading it in very soon if they are not able to return it ultimately it is your decision although i believe the majority of ps vita owners will have serious buyers remorse,192,4
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,each levels kind of repetitive but it is an awesome game good to plan a pinch when you do not have much time to play through a whole game,27,5
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,nice little addition specially since it does not take up precious space in the memory card,15,6
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,garbage waste of money graphics are so sloppy controls are terrible gameplay is not fun characters are so small on the screen everything blurs together,25,7
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,i loved it i got it very quicky and it was great the music is amazing and the game is fun,21,8
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,do not waste your money this game is absolutely terrible my understanding is that the game makers are struggling to come out with games that can be played on the vita but this is a game that could have been skipped in the development process the graphics are ok the controls are easy the concept is cheesy,57,9
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,this game is for no reason bad but it is not the best of it is kind either if your really want this type of game play play the pikmin series score6/10 mediocre,31,10
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,i got this on the cheap when i first bought my vita and was very disappointed the graphics are crud and the gameplay is not very good in addition to that there are only a few music tracks and they repeat over and over again,44,11
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,i love this game the music is great and the game is fun shipped fast and well packaged it is just what i was looking for,25,12
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,overall i like the game the theme is dark and humorous right up my irreverent alley i picked it up on sale for 20 and i feel it is worth that price pros the soundtrack is all metal fun semi-mindless game play the goblins reactions to things are fun cons repetitive not much strategy involved,55,13
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,between the thrash music and monotonous control it is like being in the army corp of he shall to be sure this game has no real replay value and is slogging to make it through the first time,36,14
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,for something called army corps of he shall i expected this to be a great action game but this game truly does not live up to it is name as it is a square enix game and 2012 i thought the graphics and gameplay would be that much more enhanced as they have created some of the most memorable games to date not a game full of intense action as it is name implies i was bored within the first twenty minutes of playing,81,15
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,good game long but beatable never seams boring but some times repetitive completely original style and game play like no other game,22,16
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,love the features and design of the controller but i must have received a dud two weeks in and the controller would start giving random inputs and randomly turn off in the middle of a game also shipping took longer than expected but that was fedex fault,47,0
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,had one of the xbox 360 style sticks with dead spots then the pin sleeves in the controller end of the cable have started recessing into the connector and it stops working unless you fold the cable under the controller i have only taken the cable off a few times and I am very gentile with my equipment so for my 10000 i will be expecting a refund from a company with a long history of low quality products madcats should be out of business grade a military components my,90,1
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,i love this controller no slow turn great grip and modular design was a major selling point for me also because of modular design we will see different options in the future face plates different collars wire analog sticks can not way to see what they will come up with,49,2
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,,14,3
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,4,positive,so i bought this controller because i really wanted to play the last of us but i despise the standard ps3 controller i swapped out all the sticks and the dpad for the xbox versions and used the trigger swap feature to make the triggers the shoot / aim actions it works great and does everything i expected it to overall I had say it is worth it if you can afford it i paid about 50 for it here on amazon but i would not pay the 100 retail price major cons wired controller with a short cord the bumper buttons feel very clicky and kid of cheap and the overall build quality against the cost of the controller,115,4
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,do not buy this controllers buttons stopped functioning after about 18 hours of use the d-pad buttons were unpredictable the left analog stick completely stopped working i could go on and on about failing parts i will say it is very possible i got a lemon from the reviews i read / watched however for the price quality control should be squared away also the ps4 is coming out soon and most serious gamers will be buying the new system with a newly designed controller from what i can read is going to be phenomenal so if you are reading this soon after i write this just practice a little patience,106,5
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,4,positive,so the controller is absolutely the best controller on the market in my opinion however the cable that was sent to me was defective and after a few weeks it started glitch ing up on me so i called mad catz and they said they would send me a new cord but i had to pay to ship the defective cord back to them which would be around 5 dollars so in total you are spending about 10 dollar in shipping in conclusion the controller i highly recommend to anyone who is a serous gamer,95,6
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,this product does not work have tried 2 different ones and am now getting a full refund for the malfunctioning product the buttons were pushing themselves,26,7
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,so dissapointed with this control should have listened to other reviews buttons would get stuck all around making my games so hard to play not recommended at allwas returned and i returned to my regular ps3 controller,39,8
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,i was very excited about this controller but there has to many fawls the powera fus1on tournament controller is better for true gamers like myself,24,9
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,so i got this controller and all i got to say is man is it nice everything works great however if you wan to use the d-pad for fighting games might have to she shall out another 15 for the fighting d-pad version from madcatz it is a little switch out part i was not sure how good the controller would be but it works like a charm yeah it is 80 - 100 bucks depending on sale but it is worth it and if something breaks like the stick / pad easier to pay 15 per part than spend 40 - 50 on a new inferior controller and madcatz gives a 2 year warranty,104,10
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,i purchased thisas a gift and i was so happy to hear that it surpassed their expectations i would purchase thisagain in a heartbeat and it comes packaged very well,34,11
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,the controller performs great in my circumstances but when it come to the multiplayer side it has a few bugs i put it thru 20 - 30 hours of cod time at the end of it all the playstation controller is still superior the mlg controller just does not perform we will bugs pop up all the time i do not know how nobody else wrote about that but the main issue i had was the controller not performing well,73,12
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,i will start out saying this is one of the best controller i have ever seen there is no lag in the thumb sticks and i got my off ebay kinda used i have tested this controller on games like god of war uncharted resident evil metal gear solid and there is no lag buttons feels great so this has lag in thumb stick is all false will with mine it is plus madcatz have been good to me i would differently by other one it is just as good as the duel stock,93,13
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,do not buy this i had it for less than a week when the d-pad stopped functioning it is a waste of money i expect this kind of shoddy work from mad catz i guess but the mlg ought to be ashamed to put their name on this,46,14
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,i got this controller for my husband as a gift and at first he was excited about it he plays a lot of ps3 games and goes through 3 - 4 controllers a year from wearing them out this seemed like a good solution since he would be able to change out the worn out parts easily when he first tried it the buttons were sticky and register without any contact at all several communications with mad catz and they determined it was defective and it is being replaced for 100 i expect it to work if the replacement works i will post another review,103,15
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,this controller is amazing it is super sensitive and very durable it is nice to fianally have an super high quality customizable controller,23,16
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,overall it is a decent controller but it is not worth spending 100 as some of the other reviews stated the d-pads are flaky and even running through the menu options it does not function if i can not accurately navigate the ps3 menus or the in-game menus how do you think it is going to function when playing a game there are no dead zones and i had to increase my sensitivity for battlefield 3 for it to match the similiar behavior from my dualshock 3 controller the sticks are a little slow but they do jump a little but no deadzone the bumper buttons are too stiff after a few hours of game play my hands were actually tired from having to really hit the buttons hard to make the work i used the controller for probably 10 hours over the past 2 weeks and everytime i switched back to the dualshock 3 i performed much better in battlefield 3 than with the mlg pro controller it is a nice controller fits in my hands well but has some silly little flaws that completely ruin it for actual use for 100 some of those simple things should not exist in the final product of the controller,201,17
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,ladies and gents save your money this is not what you think stick to the dual shock 3 controller i just got mine in the mail and just sent in back in less than 3 hours of owning it and playing with it take my word for it,50,18
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,i bought this controller at d1 there is some pro but in spite of all the pro the 4 analog sticks sucks they are too sensitive and their range are too restricted so the dualshock 3 is much better wasted opportunity,41,19
