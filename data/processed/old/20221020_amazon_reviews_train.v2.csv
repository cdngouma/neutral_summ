All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are very thin pull off easily without residue rare the only odd thing about these is that on the crease it actually had cut out slits along it so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket / shirts,45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it not the best,14,1
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,so far they have not really worked will not stick to the fabric of my jacket,15,2
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,i have tried several brands of shields and most do not stay attached all day / evening this purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed love them and am hoping that i receive an equally excellent product when i need to reorder,46,3
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,they do not stick well to the fabric bunch up not comfortable,12,4
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,it did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,my wife thinks that these things are great,8,6
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,thedoes not adhere to clothing very well it is basically pointless to use this product very disappointing indeed,19,7
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,these shields were too flimsy did not sick and bunched up will not purchase again,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,the shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket i had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well just be mindful when you take the jacket off / put it on i will continue to use these much improved from older versions that would come off,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,perfect for the victorian era ball now i do not have to wash the whole dress after every event,18,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,very hard to position not worth the hassle,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,theseems great but once i started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat it is kind of a give and take on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side it is not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck,70,12
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,great product i used these for a series of interviews that i would not have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview they worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i bought 3 brands of dress-shield and i tried these last these were thinner like the 2nd brand and i understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin they are useless people who buy these sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time money and embarrassment if you perspire avoid these if you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes good enough,75,14
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,helped prevent stains but did tend to slip a little,10,15
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,i can see how these may not be the best for a shirt however they have saved me on dry-cleaning for my work blazers a nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it is awesome to get a few wears out of each during either a big client meeting or a hot spring / summer day these will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure,63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,these are good in theory but they do not stick to my clothing,12,17
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,barely sticks to clothing ends up bunched and then unattached,10,18
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not seem strong enough several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when i applied them to silkier fabrics on the plus side these pads are quite thin and quiet,41,19
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,it is not sticky and the material is poor,8,20
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,they did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I have only used this once it worked fine,8,22
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product very bad quality for the price i paid,14,23
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,greatbut held up poorly kept peeling off and sticking to my skin no bueno,16,24
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,great concept in theory but i find they do not fit well in blazers as I had intended to use them,18,25
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor i use these in blazers mostly they are perfect i will say that if you are sleeves are tight this shield will be difficult to apply / stay in place when you put the blazer on they are the perfect size for the underarm and you can not tell they are there these are must-haves for long work days,66,26
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i was very impressed i plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i really like my gun run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,when i got this it had a few problems including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it,21,2
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,the power supply went out on me and never worked again,11,3
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also,12,4
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,it is doing good so far i highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos i love this,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just does not mix well with skin i guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe,34,6
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,this kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,21,7
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,it is a good starter kit but over heats with bigger tattoos power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems very nice people i would recomend this kit,34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,the machine came within 4 days of me buying it but the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily a warning to first time tattooers this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own also please for my own sake do not use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing on fake skin or fruit but I have never heard of the brand and something tells me it is bad ink other wise it is a perfect machine for beginners,102,10
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,the kit came 1 day late but it is cool laughing out loud the grip is not the one they show it is straight n ink caps white no biggie thanks you,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,it did not come with a grip i waited forever and i searched everywhere and there was no grip,18,12
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i like dragon hawk products because your tattoo kits have a great price for people like me that is starting out tattooing and i check out others brands of tattoo kits but no one had a better deals but dragon hawk is the place to start if you love tattooing and want good deals of tattoo kits ps wow your kits only have a big black ink bottle that will last me awhile and saves me money thanks and you got a costumer for life,86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,good for the money everything is working well just do not use this ink,13,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,great fun product looking forward to the next dress up party going as the tattooed lady,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,what a waste of money this product is waaaaayy over priced for it is poor quality i bought this kit to have my best friend pro artist draw ani had for a tatt on my arm we followed the directions to a t and it still came off within the next day the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use one marker never worked bc it was dried up and the adhesive is a joke it is messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross you would honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice invest in a real henna tattoo kit,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i would not recommend this product it is just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,pens work beautifull but after 3 days sometime less you need to remove definatly not lasts lasting for weeks the latex covering feels gross and does not last long i will not purchase again company did send out quickly,38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with these they are basically sharpies they function the exact same way and the colors are not true to the lids it is fine to have them if you are expecting markers but they do not make convincing or lasting tattoos,39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,product does not stay on for more than a day ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo nice colors although,22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love love them where have these been i love to change up my tattoo never permant thank you love it,20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,they do not stay at all it says 2 - 3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and i was sadly disappointed,20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,this was really fun and I am glad i got it because i enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough they all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones do not work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos do not usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long either way i still really like it and recommend it,66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,needs many many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly they are not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead these are just permanent markers with glue / adhesive do not waste your money on this,51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the product is not as advertised mine did not come in a box the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil the tattoo remover is very dry without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper the topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what the pens are ok with good colors too bad the kit is so poorly put together bewild get your act together,86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the ink washed off without the sticky stuff if you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week it is like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it also the yellows and light green pens do not even show up on skin,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,not what i although there just likemakers not worth the money,13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,we had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies we bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised colors bright and vibrant all the pens were in new condition not dried out like the store pens had been my only disappointment was that there really is not a lot of ink in these they dry up much faster than regular markers for the price you would think they would last longer I shall be buying more wish there were more colors or choices of colors,110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,one pen was dried out when i got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones very disappointed,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,this was a gift came in a cheap plain box a lot of the pens do not seem to work the fine tips do not seem to work,27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the product is ok you are better off getting the 18 piece version or none at all because i got multiple red green and yellow markers the yellows hardly show the tattoo remover wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants the most impressive part of the pack is the sealant which is essentially watered-down glue you are better off with sharpies or other thin permanent marker that does not run through the creases of your skin mind you elmers glue water and rubbing alcohol things you probably already have if you do decided to buy this kit i suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue this sometimes keeps the sealant from collecting lint,117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer it fun to design things,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the thick sides only worked on all my pens could not get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,the fine point on the markers did not work,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,these markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily even with the protective coating having a lot of fun with them at parties although,27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,ok my daughter does cosplay these pens were so great for her costume they stayed permanent and no smudging she had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days i do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it,44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,so i got them in the time frame it which was wonderful and all but like several people have said they come dried out i had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up one had mold on the fine tip I am like what the heck also they do not last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing very disappointed,76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,the pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out so honestly i will stay with the sharpies,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,love them i think my daughter loves them even more so fun to work with i like being able to change not really into permanent body art these are perfect for that,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,some of the pens were dried out which i did not expect did receive it in a timely manner,19,27
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i really like them awesome product the shipping was very quick i was surprised,14,28
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,some colors do not look nice on the skin one pen was open and thin side do not work,17,29
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,this kit was a gift for my teen daughters they have a lot of fun with it the tattoos do not last long even when you put the protective material supplied but they still enjoy it i would recommend it,39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,i was so happy when they came in the mail i opened them up used them and thought all was well the ink did not run when i took a shower but when i went to use them again they would not work if you happen to be looking for a one-time use then you found it,55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,did not work well did not last the two black pens stop working before i could finish the first temp tattoo not worth the money just use eyeliner or a sharpie,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,my daughter loved this gift awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each,19,33

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get all of the different colors however i found that it was not that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks it is fun but i was disappointed,52,36
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more ink less,19,37

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,worked really well need more black pens in the set although,11,41
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i did not buy this and I am not recommending using temp tattoo markers use sharpies they have cleaner clearer colors that show up well you can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it is simple so please do not waste your money when you can use sharpies,51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,i like to play with them they are a bit to easy to come off fun to play with although,20,43
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 15 year old niece and as far as i can tell she was thrilled with it she wants a tattoo when she turns 18 so i thought this would help her make that decision,39,44
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,they are good colors and even without the coating the design will last a few days only issue is that after you first do them you need to let it dry a bit and even then a bit can rub off very fun,43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,it was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,looks real had several people come up to me and comment hard part was telling them it was a temp glue is sticky even when dry use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash,44,47

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased the inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as although it had no case at all,42,4

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,for the price it offers more protection than the soft cases but the tablet fell from the arm of a recliner and the screen still cracked because the case does not lock if you have children or pets i suggest a case with a locking latch,45,31

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,hate this cover the clasps on the side do not hold the tablet in so it falls out all the time the stand up feature does not work very flimsy went cheap and got cheap threw it in the garbage and went to best buy,44,47
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,i it is perfect for my 10 in tablet it was a good buy i like it keeps the glass safe from damage,20,48
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,the tabs to hold the tablet keep slipping off they let the tablet slip around rather than hold it tight,20,49
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,had looked everywhere for what we needed and this is exactly it perfect fit to protect our christmas present to each other,23,50
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,purchased as a gift this cover fills the bill for tablet protection and utility the quality is quite good for the price,22,51
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,the holding latch cover on and off volume control it slips off constantly i would not recommend they did not consider compotent t design,23,52
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,when i received it it was the holidays and it was a gift to go along with a tablet that i had purchased after the holiday and the excitement wore down we found that it is not as sturdy as i thought also there is no opening to take pictures with the case on the tablet not happy with it but i learned my lesson you get what you pay for,71,53
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,the case still allows the tablet to slip out even when you go to close the case not good at all it was a waste of money i will buy new ones,32,54
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,the case does not hold the tablet in place the tablet slips out even when you go to close the case not good,22,55

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,tablet was hot pink when i ordered orchid purple the stopper for the stand does not hold and causes cover to open and fall from table the four holders keep slipping and tablet comes out of case,36,57
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,advertises the case is for the trio stealth g2 however in order to take a picture you must remove your tablet from this case before you can take a picture most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures also this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture it falls over just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless,68,58
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,advertised for trio tablet however there is no hole for the rear facing camera so you can not use the camera if the tablet is in the case,27,59
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,fits good and looks good wish that there was a better selection oflike black one red is ok,21,60
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,i really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out theis very vibrant and i love the black elastic band that holds the case tightly closed and the bonus stylus fits perfectly in the ear plug outlet so it will always be available,70,61
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,the cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it did not was a let down,25,62

All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,i liked it a lot it looks really nice on a hand and it does not look cheap the only thing that was bad few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly so i had to fix it with pliers so that it would not fall apart,50,0
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,it is okay and i like it however it is cheaply made,11,1
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,the bracelet is very pretty but not well designed it does not stay in place,14,2
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,i bought another one of these in silver and they both lose theirafter wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather I am never buying these again,28,3
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,i purchased this bracelet and ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter because it is so unique also it is a cute and inexpensive gift to give for no special reason or to add to her christmas gifts i hope she will love it,41,4
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,very I shall fitting ring too small bracelet too big,9,5
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this is very flimsy i bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked,29,6
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways i steel like it but is crapy,17,7
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,product as expected but although stated it would be slow was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas on the same day can a week sooner,30,8
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,the ring part broke off from the chain the first time i put it on,15,9
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,broke i kept the ring part because it was cute laughing out loud,11,10
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,got thistoday and it was already broken,9,11
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time i wore it,19,12
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,i bought thisas a joke for my grandmother knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only 200 when she received it the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring or the bracelet part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo instead of soldered together even if you want to make someone laugh or buy for throw away jewelry do not,68,13
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,a sleek exotic piece they were beautiful on my model and my date was complimented all night i will check and buy from this company again,26,14
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,thiswas well worth what i paid for it it was good quality for the price and i received it very quickly,23,15
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,this is a really cute accessory the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right the chain to the wrist is a good length the one real drawback is it is actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight but i salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate,62,16
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,kinda big i have small wrists very cute although,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this thing fell apart like 10 min after i gave it to my girlfriend i would not recommend this to anyone do not buy this cheap thing we did not expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for halloween but it did not even make it to the party,50,18
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,no sizes on it biger than my fingers,9,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,hate these pens the pens are not multicolored and the ink runs out after a few uses would not buy again,21,0
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a nurse so i thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder this first one exploded the first day i used it all over my scrubs and i looked like a slob all day i thought it was just a freak accident so i decided to give another one a try the same thing happened there is definitely a flaw in the design and i will not be using them again,80,1
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use these quite frequently to take notes since i do not have a smartphone the only complaint i have is that sometimes if you push the pen into it is cap too hard it will break this is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain aside from that although they work fine great for carrying around in a pocket,63,2
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i have no need to write with pink purple or green ink blue is ok but black is the best,20,3
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times i have always used the mini rsvp pens from pentel most stores in my area are not carrying them so i found these sorry but i hate them they are very small for writing and since i attach them to my keychain the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day my other pens never broke thicker plastic if you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok i will not buy these again since i have found the pentel pens i want on amazon oh and the chain they come on is a joke totally worthless,120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I shall have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion as described and intended however i was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket and it works very well for that i unscrew the little keychain attachment and the lid stays on in my pocket so I am always ready to write in a notebook i carry i frequently have a better pen but not always this one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen otherwise it is a little too stubby the product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter but it works well for what i wanted,130,5
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,honestly if i had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily i never would have purchased this product i should have looked for push button or twist pens instead these pens are small fit well on a keychain and writes okay but i almost lost the cap s quite a few times due to the price point it is not worth the time returning but i will not buy again,70,6
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are the perfect size to put in my diabetic meter bag thank you so much,17,7
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,good deal for the number of pens definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys / if they will be yanked around a lot,43,8
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these come in handy when you do not have a pen ready just put it on your key chain and you will always have a pen handy amazinglove it I have given away 6 already close friends and others i tell them where to buy them keep up the good work with fantastic ideas,53,9
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,love these little pens they work great with post-it note holders,11,10
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the caps came broken this is the second time i ordered these just because i like the size and i can not find any other brand,25,11
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,pen constantly slips out of cap preventing me from keeping pens on the key ring more of a pocket pen than anything,22,12
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,worthless product and i assume because it is cheap i lost 2 pens already in 2 days so obviously i bought the pen caps not the pens because it is the only thing it stay very lose and weak,37,13
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,nice pens good size for small geocaches which is why i bought them,13,14
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,chains break easily caps do not hold pen well pen often falls off my hospital badge,15,15
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I have had these pens for less than a month and I am on the third one as the pens have fallen out of the caps i have the pen attached to my work badge i work in an office setting so there has not a lot to grab / catch on the pens but they continue to fall out I have been walking across the office and had coworkers stop me because my pen is laying on the ground some feet back i would not buy these again nor suggest that others buy them either,90,16
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not stay in the cap using it as a keychain is useless because it falls out too easily,20,17
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted hard to find in office supply stores,11,18
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,got these for my husband who makes deliveries and needed a pen to attach to his lanyard they are good but as they are used over time one fell out of the cap and got lost however considering how inexpensive they were I had still buy them again,47,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,not happy after giving these out in stockings a few of them did not light up,16,20
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,terrible the pens are very loose in the caps resulting in them falling out frequently I have lost practically all of them waste of money,25,21
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i still have nowhy 6 colored pen with all black ink,13,22
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wore them attached to my lanyard after less than a week the pen did not stay in the cap the fit is not tight enough,24,23
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,the pen writes well the cap does come off easily so it is not suitable on a lanyard or keychain it is perfect to put inside a purse or pocket,30,24
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,I am always in need of pens when going out to events dinner movies when i have a small purse with me these are small and perfect they are 3 inches long black ink i will buy more well worth the money,40,25
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,i love these these are great little pens and i have already re-ordered more they write very well and i love the different colors i am using them inside small survival kits,32,26
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,great little pen just what i was looking for,9,27
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i am a teacher and always need a pen handy i tried to keep this on my lanyard but the pen does not stay in th cap I have already lost 3 from the pack,33,28
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,this work great with my passport love them,8,29
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i needed very small pens for wallet and small handbags these are almost perfect the cap separates from pen barrel too easily a dried thin strip of water-proof fabric glue inside opposite sides of cap takes care of grip for cap now to keep my daughter from adopting them,49,30
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,too small and pour plastic broke in one week,9,31
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,loved the pen at first worked great and convenient to keep on my badge for work always had a pen to sign documents with however the caps continually fell off not worth the buy,34,32
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are great as they fit in your pocket i use them on a lanyard for taking notes in the field and they do not hang as low as a regular pen would amazon seems the only place you can actually find this pen size,45,33
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly as ordered perfect for lots of places where a pen is too large,14,34
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted to hang it from my lanyard but the hardware did not hold up and i lost the pen,20,35
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,time will tell whether the caps fall off but so far so good the pens write well no skipping they do not feel cheap in the hand the little o-ring on top of each cap is small but i did not have a problem fitting it onto a small flashlights o-ring after i removed the chain the chain itself is not sturdy to the eye or feel essentially useless i would not trust it to hold otherwise I am pleased,76,36
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pens themselves usually worked fine for me but the caps do not attach strongly enough to the pens for them to be a good keychain pen i lost all of these within about a month because the caps where the keychain is attached just did not stay attached to the pens,52,37
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use them allways one in each bag,8,38
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,no ink clogs easy to put cap on and off great for nurses who never can keep up with pens,20,39
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,do some geocaching they are not the best quality but they are great to leave in a larger geocach container for other cachers to document their find,27,40
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i work in a hospital and purchased these to wear on my badge i was hoping for a pen that would be easily accessible and would not get lost or misplaced greatbut not so great product for it is intended use i could not make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap with normal use some of the caps cracked and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen it is pretty frustrating when you try to grab your pen in the middle of examining a patient and there has nothing dangling there but a pen cap,106,41
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i do not know why i did not look at the reviews first i wanted to have pens on our keychains so we always have one the cap fits the pen so loosely i really do not think it is going to stand the test of time if you are going to make a keychain pen maybe you should make it so it will work on an actual keychain,64,42
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not like to stay in the cap,9,43
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,they all fell apart rather quickly and got separated,9,44
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted these pens to keep on my work badge / key ring so i would always have a pen handy but the pen constantly falls out of the cap so i lost 3 pens within a few weeks before i gave up they would be better if the cap stayed on and if they had colored ink to match theof the case,63,45
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,thewritersedge dot com space pen store reviewed this product and found it to be of excellent quality yet recommends that you go to our website and take a look at the authentic fisher space pens that write upside down through water dirt oil and in freezing temperatures,48,46
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,the pens are not tightly held to the caps so they are lost within hours seriously all 6 were gone within hours of attaching to my key chain,28,47
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,plastic cracked and broke in less than 24 hours,9,48
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,cheap and a greatbetter in some ways than the nite eyez ones because you do not have to unclip anything to get your pen just pull free of the cap and write my wife clips one to her scrubs pantleg loop plus they are dirt cheap lose one goes through the laundry no tears,54,49
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i used these for work peds nurse for labeling so i always had a pen handy attached right to my identification i even attached one to my wallet but the pen itself eventually fell off clickable minis may be a better option if you expect a lot of movement / use of whatever you have it attached to convenient otherwise,57,50
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,cap will come loose after a few weeks in your pockets thus i end up with a cap on my key ring without a pen on it if these were threaded caps it would be perfect,36,51
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i am definitely impressed with the pens i quickly put one on my work keys and on my car keys never have to borrow a pen again within a week both pens had fallen off without me realizing it caps need to be tighter,44,52
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,just what the doctor ordered when you need a pen and do not have one some more words to get past the minimum what a silly,26,53
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i like that these pens all have black ink the orange green and more ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl these pens are half the length of typical pens but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing the small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you are on the go and the cap style prevents leaking construction is cheap and lightweight but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen the keychains seem pretty flimsy and i discarded them did not really want that feature anyway,110,54
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,pens go in her pocket so when a patient calls she has got the pen right with her to write with great product she loses them a lot i will be a frequent flyer on this one,36,55
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a pe teacher and need pens to be handy for quick writing i was totally disappointed of this product the eons will not clip back into the cap after a couple uses it got to be who can find that bright orange pen in the grass first activity save your money not a good product to attach to a key ring,62,56
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,maybe I am just hard on things in my pocket but these things break very easily on every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap stripping the hole I have tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely much prefer the nitepocket pen by inka,74,57
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these are great for my purposes i always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I am the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great because they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans i never noticed them until i need to write something down I am not sure why the description listed the product box with product dimensions 65 x 28 x 04 inches but the pens are 35 inches long and they are all black ink i was worried since the description mentionedred / blue / black / green / purple but these are describing theof the casing not the ink i needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors i can not believe that I am excited about pens,131,58
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are great for keeping on your lanyard and are always handy perfect for teachers and the colors are great too,22,59
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,especially for pre-teens kids b4 their growth spurt all grandkids enjoy these in their xmas socks along with a small empty book they can fill with their ideas,28,60
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you the chains are reasonably strong I have only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner the pens are moderately tight in the cap they do not fall out with normal use but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be friction locked allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap the pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks such as writing a signature or jotting down a note there is no way you would want to use it all day unless you have small hands,128,61
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are not meant for writing papers or business i gave away as little tokens and i can tell you that right now my co workers still have these little cute pens hanging from their desks they are fun and great since they can be pinned on a refrigerator magnet they do not write bad either,56,62
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i should have bought the retractable kind of mini pen without caps that can be lost,16,63
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,although the pens write nicely attaching the keychain to the cap of the pen was a horriblei keep losing the pens throughout the day because they are not designed to stay in the cap under stress,38,64
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are a greatbut because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge and be lost other than that it is a very handy tool,36,65
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the true utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off i fixed this problem with these buy wrapping a piece of tape electrical ortape around the part where the cap seats on the pen now i need to really pull hard so i hopefully will not lose them,62,66
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,kinda cheap and i got an uglynot going to be getting anymore these are for toddlers,17,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,that i received was not listed but i still like it it took a long while to arrive but it was still cute when i received it there has a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well however beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire,66,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,love it i wish you could choose the colors although i received a polka dot black and white and polka dot teal and white,24,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,this is cheap and a waste of money,8,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,this is nice i just wish i could choose the colors,11,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,really cute but was a different material than i expected it to be i think it is satin,17,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,you are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be alisted not worth the money,21,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it is a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it is supposed to be,36,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2.0,negative,i got some ugly funkyand while it looks cute on me it is really small i have a rather big head and so it does not reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model it is also made of cheap wire so be careful with it,53,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,I am very disappoined i ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material what am i going to do with three of the exact same headband,27,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it came a lot earlier than expected i just wish i could have chosen theof headband,17,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,it is okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick thebut i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,do not like it at all from the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and i received a light pink polka dot one i have no use for it,37,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,very cute but i do wish i could have chose the,11,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,this is perfect for my daughter she loves to collect this kind of headbands and she has so happy,18,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,this is a really nice headband to use whenever I am washing make make-up before going to sleep,17,15

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,sleep with this every single night not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs oh my god so fricking painful anyways since becoming pregnant i want to sleep on my side a lot and so i am worried about wrinkles too i guess but the pain dear lord it is so bad i tried using a pillow but this just slides in place and stays better i mean it does not even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom score,87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,dumbest purchase of my life do not let it be yours cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best i was shocked to say the least roll up a towel and use that instead,33,8

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i bought this bear on another website the other reviewers are right this would only work well for very large boobs i bought the isima breast pillow and that has straps that secure it in place sometimes i put a comfy bra on too over the pillow to secure it even more so and also i like sleeping in comfort bras i would recommend the isima breast pillow i have size c implants,73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,this works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place my primary complaint is it does not rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts I shall wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still need a tight sports bra to hold it in place at least for me I am 58 tall slim build with breast augmentation might work better for natural breasts still use it although i do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place,116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product works as advertised according to her she finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place,39,16

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,might work for some but was too thick for me natural 34ddd the bear design is adorable but i went with the bosom buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me,36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all not worth the money,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,well damn i missed the return window by a few days i have dds and this thing is too big it has to be for someone with fffs or someone with nat geo tits,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it is pretty useless unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this does not stay put at all,32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,love it after researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles i saw this and thought ah ha it is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 ddd breast from smushing together i notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place h m has great long stretchy tanks i use,77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed it is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place even with wearing a sports bra to sleep ultimately it does not do well what it is advertising to do,51,25

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,great product for a great price easy to clean and good product,12,1
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,they are ok a little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult,17,2
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,gave it 4 stars because the product is good but i found out I am not a fan of sponges for applying makeup i like brushes better,26,3

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,not worth a penny sponges broke off handles within days do not waste your money,14,5
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,good price but not very good quaility in this sense you kind of get what you pay for sponges are very stiff,22,6
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a breeze every time i need to do a heavy contour i reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender i find this product easier to manipulate they are sturdy and well built and everything arrived intact the makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful i was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon this bundle is a great value for the price and i would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup,103,7
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,only one of these sponges i was satisfied with and that was the teardrop the other two seemed a bit flimsy when i used the cleaningthat came with the sponges it tore through the sponges so i am no longer able to use them not very satisfied with this product wish it was of better quality,58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like i want,17,9

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,cheap handle came out of all of them,8,11
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,waste of money too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product,15,12
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful they were smaller than i expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator blendor they get the job done and i love them,36,13
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,it feel a little to harsh for my face,9,14
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice,12,15
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,cute they apply concealer very well no messy fingers,8,16

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this stuff does not work like i had seen it in makeup reviews,12,2
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,my lips are stained pink so are my teeth and my tongue after brushing my teeth the toothpaste foam is pink my finger tips are also pink i would definitely say it does it is job warning do not apply on the go you will stain everything,47,3
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,i love thesuper cute does make your lips dry although,12,4

All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,interesting thisis a much darker pink than expected but it is a pretty pink toned stain,18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this is a fun product goes on very sticky you wait til it dries and then peel it off the longer you leave it on the darker the shade i would say it looks like you have eaten a popsicle,39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,do not buy this horribly disappointed i anxiously applied this and immediately knew i made a bad purchase lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry when i separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips it was gross then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,product exactly as expected after watching some youtube videos of girls reviewing this product apply quickly before it starts to dry also make sure like are dry and do not put chapstick on prior or the product does not stain as well impressed this did not try out my lips like most lip products do,52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,i love these they are really great they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink they do not leave any marks or anything once you have finished applying it and done it right however for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so although and leaves a thin outline on theof my lips but that might be because i often lick my lips my favoriteis lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark redjust do not apply it to dry and flaky lips,104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,this was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss i had fun experimenting and applying it i just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen i was done however since i did get it close to my lipi had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well it is a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips would buy again,100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,this just did not work for me on any level I have heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try i followed the directions and put the gel on my lips it was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky after leaving it on for some time i tried to peel it off but nothing really peeled it just was stuck and i ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth what i was left with was no visible difference inwhat has so ever i was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash,106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,i would give no stars if possible extremely messy and difficult to apply it is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible i threw it away,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,absolutely useless the gel is sticky clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it there has no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off extremely disappointed,38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I am kind of 50/50 for this lipstain i like the fact the last long in ur lips and does not dry out my lips it is a greatthe only problem is very hard to apply sticky and messy it difinitely need some time to get used to it this is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off overall i would buy it again,83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,love it it is weird to apply at first and it is pretty goopy but once you have gotten the hang of it it is amazing dries out your lips what lip stain does not so have chap stick ready to apply after the watermelonis more red than i had expected lovely peach is a nice light pink just bought another in the peach,62,17
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,do not buy this cheap terrible lip gloss it is the worse it is does nt even apply to my lips it is like plastic in a tube absolutely terrible,26,18
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this stuff is so gooey it is hard to keep it on your lips for more than 30 seconds it feels gross and does not really peel off,26,19
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,too dry on my lips difficult to apply and it barely shows,12,20
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,to hard to get on straight needs a better applicator,9,21
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,this applies horribly burns the lips and is just gloppy it does not ever dry to peel off and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips,33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,the peach is a little lighter than i expected more of a very light pink it is a little messy but once you get the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it is easy to remove i just scrub my lips and it comes off when i do not want theany more,56,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,love my new nail polish essie have a great selection of shades and i am very glad they have this one back,23,0
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,greatbut horrible formula it goes on thick and gloppy like a polish that has been sitting on a shelf for years i expected more from essie,28,1
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,i love thisI have heard a lot of complaints about the formula so i was worried when i ordered it but the bottle i got is a nice formula it is not jelly-like not thick it is great,37,2
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i love theand the consistency was ok for me but it does not wear well at all I have worn it twice and both times it chipped almost immediately I have only had it on for 36 hours and it looks like it has been on for a week it is so chipped this is not my usual experience with essie polishes,60,3
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i had the original chanel ciel de nuit back in the 90s and loved thei never had the original essie starry starry night but i bought the revival today and like all essie polishes i loathe the formula they are always streaky and clumpy and the brush is too small and hard to controlpayoff is good after two coats not as sparkly as the old chanel it knocked off but i would not re-buy about once a year i buy an essie polish and then remember why i hate them i should stick to zoya,97,4
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,all the colors are great but this one was the best,11,5
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,i am sure the formula is great but thejust did not work for me it was very shimmery and almost had a multisheen to it even my 2 14 yol twin daughters said it was too young for them however i am sure someone else will love thisi had really hoped it would be kind of a blush-champagnewhich it looked like in pix my bad,71,6
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,beautifulbut chips after two days even with expensive base and top coat,14,7
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,well it is a prettybut that is about it chipped of the first day and the gel formula was very difficult to work with,24,8
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,theis amazing i just love it so glad it came back,13,9
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,do not buy nail polish bottles arrived broken with nail polish coating everything and they will not honor a return,19,10
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,such a greatand really good coverage for a polish with glitter,13,11
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,greatbut chips way to easy i do wash hands a lot but not long lasting,17,12
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,love essie polish this particular mix is pretty thin but a couple of coats once dry is super cute will be using for the rest of the summer,28,13
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,the consistency was too tacky and it was not as shimmery as advertised i believe the original formula was better however one coat was ok for my toes,28,14
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i do not know why essie comes up in the luxury category I have never liked this polish the colors are mostly bland it chips quickly really this stuff is overpriced it is not terrible but it is not high quality either,38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,very prettyperfect for a suttle look,8,16
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure would not recommend i am not a fan of essie nail polish especially after buying this,24,17
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,i love essie their nail polish is one of the smoothest applications I have found thehas always been one of my favorite it is light yet striking i am normally not a fan of light colors but this one has always been elegant sophisticated and timeless i am so happy to have theback on the market,60,18
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,first essie polish of mine and i must say besides the formula being a bit thick it is a great polish overall 3,22,19
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,i have no issue with the coverage or consistency i took the polish to my favorite salon and had them do it however I am 26 and i think theis too blue for me maybe for new years or vegas but for work it is a little much looks like what a 16 year old would wear to a dance pretty but not for every day wear,66,20
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,got the nail polish when they said i would and it is great love theand the ease of putting it on,23,21
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,it certainly is not identical to the original but it is still a great polish semi-sheer gelly layer with slightly chunky square glitter it does resemble a night sky in a van gogh kind of way in that way this one is probably more appropriately named than the original lasted a normal amount of time and no staining,56,22
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,greati really like it the only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal i hate it,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,they were given as gifts they loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,not at all what i expected it is not navy or dark blue it is very much a bright royal blue and i guess all the sparkles in the polish adhere to the glass bottle or get completely buried under the blue because there were little to no sparkles on my nails if i had known this i would not have bought it because I have never used it,67,25
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,very thin formula it takes way too many coats for it to even look like you have nail polish on i would not recommend purchasing this one unless you want to go for a more natural look,37,26
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,very clumpy and goopy did not go on smoothly only used once,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,not what i was expecting at all usually essie colors are true tothis is one exception once applied theis iridescent with a lot of yellow greens tones and even with three coats it is still translucent i have a few other colors from this retro revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost 900 i paid,65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,love thiseven more beautiful in person,9,29
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,either i received the wrongor they are knowingly sending out something completely different i received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them no flowers or leaves at all and the beads do not even look like the little ones in the picture either so I am getting a refund for this disappointment,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,when i ordered these the description said silver the ones i got were gold they have since changed the description still i was not happy,25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,the gold on these pins is very yellowy gold i initially did not like theat all but they ended up being pretty in my hair so i wore them anyway for my wedding,34,2
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding the pins looked very cute i wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette and i gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well the pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding great product for a good price,66,3
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold overall it looked great and is reusable,26,4
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,I am actually pretty happy with these they are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I am not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy but overall it is not a huge issue they still look so pretty i used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well i plan to use them for my wedding now as well i do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well but i could not find them anywhere,89,5

All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,these hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day during my trial my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle i bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair we decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive these hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost i definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day,103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the metal had a cheap look to it did not end up wearing it,13,9

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,they were really cute but left my fingers green,9,1
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is the green is not even noticeable if you leave the rings on and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I am still loving the others,43,2
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,i would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent not that it was a problem because i fixed it like that but still not the best quality,31,3
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,all the rings are different sized and some fit some do not,11,9
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,the rings snapped easily and the midi rings were not very adjustable,11,10
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,i totally thought these would be cute for the summer / pool / beach i would not want to take these in the water the paint on it is all chipped and cracking there were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area 3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not the ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we are not comfortable the metal is garbage the paint is chipping and the sizing is weird i might be able to use a couple as toe rings not worth what i paid for them,96,11
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,came in as pictures the material is not flimsy cute rings,10,12
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,they are made out of plastic reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old,16,13
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,so i received my rings early which was a big plus they came in a small package and i was very pleased to see that they were perfect although the rings seem to have the black paint chips or something like that stuck on the inside,46,14
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,they are cute they are super affordable they are just little trinkets after all i got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures / nail art I am doing for me not to wear for real,34,15
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,poorly made broke as i put them on the first time cute style it it was made out of something else dont waste your money,25,16
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,only one of them broke and i did not like that one anyway laughing out loud they are surprisingly sturdy for what you are paying they are all different sizes after a while thestarts to get a little coppery these rings are pretty good for the price,43,17

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these are okay cheap metal so potential breaking,8,19
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,these are really cute they kind of bend but it does not seem to be a bad thing one of them bent almost all the way open while i was running around at work but it did not break as far as accent rings go they serve their purpose paint them with clear nailpolish so the will not make your fingers green,59,20
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,these rings are a cute design but the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers,29,21
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these rings are very cheap the metal is almost plastic-like the designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped only three of the six were sanded leaving sharp burs on the other three i am dissapointed but contented with the few rings of the set i can wear i would still buy from this seller as their service is wonderful and everything else I have bought from them has been excellent,76,22
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,i was so excited when i received these they are such a cute design but they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding / soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on,38,23
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,plastic like not what i expected most of them broke you get what you pay for,16,24
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,love these little rings but you get what you pay for all the open / adjustable rings break within the first two wears the solid bands are a bit stronger realize these are a trendy short term accessory,36,25
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,very very poor quality all the rings broke and crumbled after 2 days,13,26
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,broke the second i pulled them out of the package,10,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i was skeptical at first but i love azorro hair brush straightener it works super amazing wish it would let me post my picture with the before and after well worth the money and support is amazing,34,0
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,my hair is quite short so i use this on my top layers with much success on the shorties underneath i still have to hit it with the flat iron as my hair grows back out to chin length i look forward to only needing this brush it is quicker and effective,51,1
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it i really like it a lot it is a great addition to my styling products so it has a great feature of shut offing if it is not in use for a long time it heats up in seconds and keeps the temperature constant i love how it makes my hair look and feel i can do my hair in seconds,73,2
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,was not the same brush shown in the picture did not work when plugged in sent it back,16,3
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,horrible did not work and burnt my hair do not bother,9,4

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,does not work on curly hair as it states,9,6
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,this works great it is much better than a regular flat iron,12,7
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,heavy and awkward to use you almost can not use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings it does make a little difference but not enough to really notice the bristles will scratch your neck if not careful would not buy again,43,8
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i really like this brush and despite the fact that my hair is short it still worked quite well 10/10 would recommend to a friend,25,9
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,the product inside the box seemed like a duplicate brush did not have the temperature indicator on it plus did not even work when plugged in,26,10
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,hair does not get as straight as advertised it seems to snag african american hair,14,11
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,unbelievable piece of junk i used it maybe six times i wrote them and explained the condition of their product to them and they ignored me,26,12
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,this hair brush did not work for me and i would like to send it back,16,14
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,i was not sure this would work since i have extremely thick curly hair so here it goes it does work i let my hair dry naturally and used the ionic hair brush it really did work but not as well as my flat iron the pros is that is great for touchand it is easy to use this will be my everyday straightening tool but when i want pin straight hair i will continue to use my flat iron the cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and i may have to order another one for myself,103,15
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,love this product it heats quickly easy to use and provides great results worth the price,16,16
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,too heavy and bulky and I have burnt myself several times using it i only used it 4 times now it is collecting dust,21,17
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it works a bit better than i expected still experimenting,10,18
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,great for straightening your hair i use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron,26,19
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,like it just not pleased with the number of the heat overall it is good,14,20
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,did not work and my hair is not even curly just wanted it to smooth,13,21
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,works good on hair that is not too naturally curly,9,22
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,this brush works amazing on my course dry hair i only need to run it thru once and move to the next section of hair there is 1 draw back the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it,49,23
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,easy to use and i get great results which is important to me since i have very coarse frizzy kinky unmanageable hair,22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it was a gift for our daughter she tried it but it did not work on her hair it left it as frizzy as it was before she started,28,25
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it really works great but the only problem i have is the buttons should be in a different place because i held it i was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as i held it to do my hair other then that i do like it,55,26
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not impressed i have short hair with swoopy ends the brush is not able to do my ends at all,20,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,perfect it is a bit difficult to use on shorter hair but i did expect that,16,28
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not happy with the quality of this product at all and being i paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy,24,29
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i ended up returning it it was so big and bluky and it did not stop the frizz it actually made my hair more frizzy but the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair this would probably be perfect,46,30
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i am so happy that i bought this it really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener,25,31
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,it is an excellent concept but this brush just does not get hot enough to do my hair and i had it maxed at 415 i have thick long and kind of wavy hair and when i read the manual for the recommended heat and i had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10 times through the same section to get it even mildly straight plus i believe it states that it is static free def not,77,32
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i had some difficulty using the brush if my hair was not 100 dry and tangle free when using the brush i kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature i got this brush so that i could straiten my hair everyday but it is a bit to difficult to do that,51,33
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,it takes half the time to straighten my hair and not get burned,14,34
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,good morning i live in brasil and i boughy on my vacation after30 days it is broken and o use only 3 4 times i sent this product to my son he lives um united states is ir possble to change,42,35
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,works great my daughter has curly hair and this straightened it qith minimal frizz,14,36
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i purchased 3 two for me and 1 as a gift i hope it works but i used mine 1 time each they both stopped working amazon refunded my money and i bought a better unit thanks amazon,37,37
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this hot hair brush the power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush so you are constantly turning it off super poor design i had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush but i noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron it would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large even after straightening with a flat iron using the brush to give it some lift body and/or curl i just could not make it happen without investing much more time than i had patience,137,38
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it broke one week later when my aunt used it it is basically a blowdryer,14,39
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,gave as a gift did not get hot enough,8,40
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very very dim also thetemperature of the lights are cool blue wish i could return,17,0
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,this is such an awesomei do not have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup i hung this on the wall right next to where i have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows it has a light so it is very easy to see the one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows or eyeliner i put it up so the installation is very easy i received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,99,1
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,the amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate a good source of light from somewhere else close to your face is needed the hardware works well easy installation looks stylish useable area of mirror on the small side,48,2
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,just like in the hotel very nice and makes me feel pampered no more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and i love that it pushes back out of the way i would recommend this mirror lights up nicely i did receive a discount to review thisand this is my honest opinion not biased,60,3
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well mirror functions perfectly my problem is the lighting which i needed for shaving in a dark location i could use a brighter light hence a 4 against 5 batteries were not difficult to install overall a goodproduct,50,4
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,disappointed when i pull it out to use it will not stay in place,14,5
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,terrible product the quality of this mirror is awful i bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke and i thought the light would be great the light flickers and will not stay on and even for the few moments it is on it is so dim it is worthless i have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries not easy to do either and no improvement the mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good i tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply,101,6
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,i love this mirror i did not want to spend a ton it does exactly what i need it to looks great too,22,7
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,wall extension seems flimsy but i never got far enough to find out the battery case extremely difficult to twist open once it is the edges of the open case are sharp yep it cut me returned for refund,39,8
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror was easy to install and works fine but the reason we bought it was the lighting the leds are very dim and almost useless,26,9
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,mine appears to be defective needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror i could not do it myself also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation,33,10
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the product appeared to be exactly what i was looking for but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke there really is not kind of hack or easy fix either appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing,43,11
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,was what i wanted and worked great,8,12
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,broke rivit so need to send back,8,13
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,the screw jackets are hard to install but i do not fault the manufacturer for that i think it is my walls overall great purchase,23,14
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is just fine however the perimeter light is so soft or low that it is pointless do not buy this product for the light feature you will be disappointed,28,15
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirrors and extension are great the light is worthless,10,16
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,got this for my 92 year old dad so he can see better to shave works well and arrived on time,21,17
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,now i can see myself without my glasses,9,18
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it is very wobbly i could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries so i can not rate the usefulness of the lighted feature,35,19
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,good quality mirrors both the plain and magnifying sides good quality construction the light leaves something to be desired,19,20
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very flimsy and takes a long time to balance also poor lighting,13,21
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,great mirror the light is worthless do not buy it if you need a light,14,22
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,light is not bright magnification not good will give away,10,23
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,impossible to open the mirror to install the batteries i guess i have to return it worthless,17,24
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,works for our small bathroom not as bright as i hoped,11,25
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,it was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done the light is really quite bright not sure why others said the opposite installation was very easy and it seems well made not at all flimsy,41,26
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this product is heavy as it is expected to be but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better i have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and i am going to end up with 7 years bad luck the mirror is beautiful although and the led is just bright enough that i can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights overall i probably would buy it again I had just invest in a better mounting screw set,97,27
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the led light is not as strong as it sounds like it should be the construction is not all that sturdy either the mirror part is wobbly and I am always afraid it is just going to fall off onto the floor,38,28
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this mirror works great the light is not too bright,10,29
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,this has never worked the switch is bad and it will occasionally flicker but will not stay on,18,30
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,all in all it is decent for what it mainly is a mirror the magnification is exactly what i was looking for the light was a perk but it is not very bright and really does not light up anything extra that my bathroom light does not so i do not really use it the arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall it swings slowly back towards the wall but this could be from how it is mounted but basically it works just fine for what i need it for,89,31
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,the quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming / thinning / styling there is a lot of hair evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease it was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk the write up clearly states themay be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting the wig i see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights the wig i received is theof the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown if you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights you may be disappointed i like to play with different wig colors and styles and i am ok with theat this price you are getting a quality product and really can not go wrong unless you are not willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different,186,0

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,although the brushes were good the makeup was cheap heavy cakey thick and terrible,14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,this kit is very small everything is way smaller that you may think but the makeup itself is good quality the beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless i threw it away it is almost like a novelty toy the brush is great and so is the makeup but it is creme that means you have to put a few drops of water on theyou are using and water on the brush before using i really like the palette colors i would recommend for the price,87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like the tacky-ness of the product it really makes powdered colors stick and look vibrant the brush and sponge did not come with the makeup i received amazon refunded the money for thisback to me and said it was ok that i kept the product since i did not receive all the pieces this made the experience super positive for me i ended up spending more money on amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one,86,25

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,works amazing i love the colors and it was really simple and easy to use my first time it turned out perfectly and I am loving the contour it could use a little more volume to it although there is not very much in there for 10,45,40

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,it is fun to use the different shades the brush spreads it on nice and feels soft i think it makes a great look,23,42
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,well worth the money for 10 you have a contour kit with a free brush and beauty blender the colors are alittle light but they still work they are very creamy not thick i highly recommend,36,43

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,one of the better ones i have tried matches skin and does not make me break out if i accidentally leave it on overnight,23,47
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,i would never buy this product again or recommend to anyone the creams are so terrible they can barely be applied they are not spreadable i might just throw this right out a day after it came in the mail so disappointing,41,48
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this sucked did not work at all i would never buy this again i was extremely dissapointed,16,49
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,the beauty blender was smaller than expected but everything else was perfectly fine and came on time,17,50

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i actually really like it I am a tomboy so i do not do makeup when i got the pallet i just went on youtube for how tos and i really like the look gave it 4 stars because it is a little thick but good,40,54
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this was terrible it almost looks like a kids set for makeup plastic i could not even use it really because the contour will not even come out of the circle with the brush do not waste your money,38,55
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the maroonis nice and the blue is not bad but i will not use the other two now that i know that the magnet does not work i was really sad to figure out it did not work but it still was not a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature,56,0
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i love theand everything but when i opened it half of it was spilled everywhere and i could only use the red and silver extremely disappointed i love the other colors and it wears nicely but i just really do not like the fact half of my order was unusable,51,1
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i love the colors but the magnet did not work at all good thing i had ordered another magnet to go with these i tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked,39,2
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,problem was not with the polish itself it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all i tried everything so i am disappointed,27,3
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i recieved the package and they looked fine i did not open the individualboxes when i recieved it since it was a gift for my niece when she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top andwas leaking out and starting to dry already the others worked great i just wish that the other one was not broken,67,4
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i do not recommend it it is clumpy and hard to put on cleanly,12,5
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,love this magnetic polish i have worn the silver / gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer,21,6
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,this product is terrible i tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work the polish is clumpy like it has sand in it or something so it can not be used as regular polish either i tested the gold and the blue very very disappointed i would have asked for a refund but i bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them,67,7
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i got a 3d magnet gel polish i tried them on my nails i work at nails salon and i know how to use that the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality seem they had sands inside and can not work at all especially the silver and gold one i will never buy it anymore bad and bad,63,9
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,looks great and simple to apply just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends roughly 30 seconds and it works nice,25,10
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i was so excited for these polishes to arrive today unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable they were mostly dried into a big clump i even tried using gel thinner the other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them,45,11
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i love this polish it is beautiful and exactly as described the shipping as fast and the seller is super nice,20,12
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,beautiful colors do not think the magnetic thing woks well but the colors make up for it,15,13
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,beautiful colors the cat eye does not seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me I shall practice more update after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4 i kept them in the original box all the time so it was not light that was cutting them,59,14
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i purchased came quickly two of the products look as if they had been previously opened the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out i give 2 stars one for each good product the blue and silver,40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i bought these solely for the star shaped magnet i found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish I am going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if i can get the desired results still holding out hope on that i can not give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is it is lose runny and it pulls away from the nail horribly by the time i was done applying it the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that i eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing and i still had bare spots the formula is subpar the only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately which would end up being more time consuming i do not recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure so on top of the bare spots i can not even see the start mark i can not wait to scrape this off my nails,180,16
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,initially i ordered this product and received a duplicate colour ie blue red and two silvers instead of gold and silver however customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end i received all four colours i have used the blue red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark slate colour i have not tried the gold yet but generally i like the sensationail brand a lot,88,17
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this stuff is awesome the colors are very pretty and the magnetic stuff works great even comes with the little magnet wand,22,18
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i can not figure out how to get the magnets to work right they seem to barely work which just makes the polish look sloppy,24,19
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,the colors are pretty was not sure i would like the dark colors but after trying the blue i discovered they are pretty have to master the magnet although did not get it centered the first time,37,20
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,it took me a while to get the hang of it but this polish is quite awesome i got so many compliments on the starburst people were in awe and wondered how i did it,35,21
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,these were awful i love sensational products and normally they will last a week these only lasted a day or two before peeling off and the design looks nothing like what has on the package,34,22
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,birthday present for daughter she loved the set,8,23
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,there were horrible we have used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy seller would not comment back on returns such a waste as I have seen these in videos and they look like they would work great,45,24
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i opened the package of the blue which was completely sealed took out the brush and it was all wonky and clotted i cleaned off the mess and it was bubbly and lumpy and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles it was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush then i tried the magnet thinking well at least i get a nice magnet from each of these nope did not work the gold also was clotted and wonky but not as much and the brush stiff like a toothbrush but the magnet worked on that one still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box but more like thin straight lines i do not want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I am sensitive to that i purchased these a while ago so it is past my return window or these would definitely be going back the colors were great although,160,25
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,do not buy i use this brand of nail polish all the time and these are very inferior compared to the norm they were clumpy goopy and completely unusable when i went to request a return it said these items not eligible for a return either old or used but either way do not waste your money,58,26
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,terrible one bottle came with the brush bent completely up unusable another bottle came with hardly any polish in it at all my daughter was very disappointed the other 2 bottles were fine and the magnet does work,38,27
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this was part of a gift and she loved it,10,28
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,horrible this stuff was crap the magnetic properties were a joke if i could rate it a 0 i would 2 out of the 4 bottles were a dried out mess of goo beauty brags said that they would send me 2 new bottles or reimburse i got nothing from them do not purchase this junk,53,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i was very happy with these buttons for crafting thank you for having these buttons available when i needed them,20,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,i bought these buttons to add to a cardigan I am making they are a good size for womens or childrens clothes there was a sticker on the package that said 279 so I am not sure why they cost a dollar more than that if you have a good craft store around where you could get buttons for cheap you could probably find a comparable product i bought these online because the local craft store has pretty high prices and these were a better value,84,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,great for little projects especially baby items there were two different sizes of white two different sizes of black and one size of clear i ordered these not know what size they would be because i did not see it anywhere on the description i would order them again,48,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,more buttons for every need great value for cost,9,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,too small i needed to sew some new buttons onto my winter jacket but these certainly were not the buttons for the job the sucked poor enterprise,27,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,nice mix of black and white buttons sizes are pretty standard and just what i was looking for delivery was a little slow,23,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this purchase i had ordered these in 7 different colors thinking i could do a lot of crafts with them after arriving 3 days after they were supposed to i was not happy to see how small the amount of buttons was and how many of those few came already cracked and broken what bothered me the most is that i paid over 6 for each package then saw that it has 229 printed on the label you are better off getting a better deal at the dollar store,93,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i have nothing bad to say i ordered 130 black and white buttons and got 130 black and white buttons,20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,it is really hard to find basic buttons at a good price these days but as usual found it at amazoncom used a lot and still have plenty more in the pack than it looks like in the picture,38,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,they will work very well for a the need i have for them without a doubt,16,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i received these today and instantly did a product refund they are smaller than what i need and to make sure i did not miss something i went back to the post to see if there was a size and there was not one listed it did say mini i guess i just missed it in the detailed description then the package it came in says 229 for the price if you are going to sell something to make profit from it maybe take the original price off since i paid 536 what a waste of my time waiting for these to arrive now i need to go to the store to find better buttons boo,113,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,buttons are very very small not many matches disappointed,9,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,the buttons are mostly very thin and no traditioal hour hole buttons were included only two hole very disappointing,19,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,perfect size for storing my scrapbook projects before the album is complete sturdy box to hold everything i need,19,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,handy assortment of nice looking boxes useful for a host of storage projects,13,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,i have no complaints about these boxes i have to use them for larger photos although because i found none that would hold 8x10s exclusively this is larger but will serve the purpose,33,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,perfect for storage i am using them to store each of my four childrens pictures and moments until i can get to putting them in a book they look nice on the bookshelf and are sturdy,36,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,5.0,positive,i have received myin excellent conditions you are splendid sellers but i have ordered 1 morelike the one you delivered please i want to know what is happening to the otherbecause i have not received it yet thisis necessary to store all my documents and other things i have i will purchase more items like this as soon as possible,68,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,2.0,negative,the box is fine but giving it 2 stars because it is misleading in the picture is 5 boxes says assorted colors in description and features it keeps saying boxes it did not specify one box and there were other sets of 2 - 5 that were similar in price but they were plain if i had known it was one i would have gone with the plain ones,65,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,i only received one box nowhere does it say only one box comes and you do not get to choose thethe picture shows six boxes and the ad says assorted colors buyer beware not worth the money for one box that looks used with marks all over it,50,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,very misleading thought i was purchasing 6 boxes as well should have read the comments before ordering,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,2.0,negative,i must have missed something i thought all 5 boxes were included when it stated it came in assorted colors,20,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,lovely box i thought i was getting the set of boxes shown especially since it did not ask forchoice the price for one box is not marvelous and i thought i was getting a great value for the six,40,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,yep a single storage box for 16 not the 6 shown in the picture deceptive,15,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000Y3INIY,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed i thought that i was ordering assorted storage boxes and i received one dark blue box i will be returning it not worth the 15 price,30,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,5.0,positive,needed to paint labels on some projects needed stencils for my projects now if i just do not lose these like the last set i had,25,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,5.0,positive,absolutely pleased with stencil lettering kit i use this on multiple farm equipment to identification model and year of purchase,20,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,5.0,positive,great size for the harvest poster we made for our daycare room,12,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,i like the product but i did not get a 5 i did get two 2 s,16,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,5.0,positive,product fit the bill for the project in hand just remember to let the stencils dry out after use or they will tear easily,24,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,not worth the money only good for one use do not recommend if you have to tape letters together,19,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,awful awful awful absolute wast of money i did not think anything could be cheaper than thin paper but these were,20,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,4.0,positive,it is difficult to use this with spray paint it is hard to keep the entire stencil on the surface you want to stencil which allows the paint to pool and run they do work but it might be better to use a brush or paint sharpie I am still messing with different techniques,51,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,4.0,positive,these should be good for a few uses for the price that should be all that is reasonably expected,19,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,perhaps i received a bad package but over half of my letters were not punched out i did not return them because i had a craft fair the next day and did not have time to find new ones i went through each one with a utility knife to cut them out,52,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,1.0,negative,a lot of the stencils were not perforated enough to punch the letters out i used a straightrazor to cut through on some of them but i should not have to do that in the first place i tried to return them but it saidwas not eligible for a return i guess at only 3 and change it is not that big a deal but i wish i had not ordered 2 packages of them,74,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,these stencils are really only good for one use i was hoping to use them in my classroom but after the first time of using them with washable markers these paper stencils have started to fall apart if you are only expecting to use them one time then these may be fine,51,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00114REKI,2.0,negative,they are horrible if you get paint on them they are paper do not recommend them,15,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,i was more than pleasantly surprised that this worked as well as it did mixing is only a sight pain asmixing suggestions seem to be spot-on,28,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,i do not recommend this product for any type of work even if is a small project the instructions are very hard to understand and once you figure it out you find that everythat comes in this bag is very cheap let me start with the glue it is a cheap glue and does not work the paint is also cheap and good luck matching the colors be aware that the peace of vinyl that comes with this product is like 2 x 2 save your money and buy the existingvinyl by the yard and replace the whole thing or get it professionally done,109,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5.0,positive,thisworked as advertised it took care of the small rip i had on my couch the instructions were very clear and easy to follow they include several basic colors that you can mix and create more also amixing chart to help you mix the colors and get it as close as possible to the one you are tying to match i would buy it again,69,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,i used this on a chair in my living room and was able to mend one area smoothly but it cracked after the chair was used but still looks better than it did before the other area is still kind of bumpy and i will smooth over soon but it has not cracked i think the first patch i did was too thin it will take time to get it right the product is obviously packaged at someone has home and is not mass produced,84,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,this was a wast of my money i tride to repare a smoll cut in the set of my motor scooter it would mot stick i had cleaned the seat before as per instructios it is just a wast of money for my part,44,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,made the furniture look so bad that i put towels over the area until i can replace the couch,19,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,turns out i have yet to use this product i still have it but ended up not needed it the contents look pretty complete and seems easy to use,29,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2.0,negative,only recommend if you have a small tear,8,7

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,the black does not at all match the black sofa and thedid not dry darker than it appeared it got lighter i guess they did not take into consideration that most leather couches are not matte if you have a glossy leather sofa like we do do not waste your money the product will look like you used black paint to cover scratches and holes the texture samples given to re-texture a scratch or hole do not do a whole lot aside from smudge it around and good luck removing it when you do not like theit dried as we used a sponge a magic eraser our fingernails and nothing took it off and I shall be damned if i put rubbing alcohol on my 600 leather sofa,127,35

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5.0,positive,I am a huge fan and practicer of restoration work but i normally work on ceramics and resin when i noticed how awful my leather work shoes looked this was a natural thing to try for me if you are careful it works really well to hide damage and to renew older furniture and shoes mixing colors is hard and that is why a lot of people gave bad reviews because they did not mix their colors and got mad that thedid not match you have to have the patience and artistic ability / dexterity to really take your time with this and to test carefully ifmatching i bought this for black pieces and the black paint works fine you just have to be careful not to over-apply and to wait for the glue layer to dry before applyingit is saved me almost 100 of new work shoes and an office chair,150,59

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,this is a terrible product especially considering the price first of all thepaste is the patch if by some fortuitous circumstance you are able to match theof the piece to be repaired you had best hope it is not a hole larger than an inch if it is forget it there simply is not enough paste to patch once patched the repair material barely sticks and the texturing process to allow it to blend in is poorly thought out michelangelo resurrected could not manipulate this product into anything discreet just buy coloredtape or a new whatever you want patched,104,76

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,i think it depends on the size of the tear and your expectations i used this to fix a rather small hole my parrot had chewed in a dining room chair as others have said if you look closely you can see the repair but it looks much better than it did before this product is unlikely to make your damagedlook as good as new but it did a decent job for me,76,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,difficult to use and make the repairs look good,9,84

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,not a bad repair kit at all much better than using heat-based repair kits easy to apply but mixing is a bit tricky as the vials are very small to work with,31,94
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,i normally do not give out negative reviews unless it is a really bad product this product is that bad nothing but junk i followed the instructions to the tee and it made the damage look worse especially around the edges definitely looks like a patch job highly recommend that you stay away from this repair kit,58,95

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2.0,negative,this product is very difficult to use and would perhaps work on a tiny project but it is messy and not easy to match the leather or vinyl i was trying to repair an office chair and that was impossible,40,99
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2.0,negative,i followed the directionsbyand when i took the patch off after the paint had dried it immediately started pealing and did not conceal the area at all bummed because i really was hoping this product was going to work,42,100
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5.0,positive,first i thought it would noit work by painting but the touch-up paint stay in our sofa for long time and looks great because of the colors provided low cost and definitely works great,34,101
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,2.0,negative,i used this product to repair a small cut in vinyl flooring i followed the directions mixed the colors to match it matched pretty good applied and let it sit for 24 hours initially i thought this was going to be a great fix the next day i cleaned the floor with my swiffer no scrubbing and noticed that the product was coming up i put some water on the area wiped up with a paper towel and noticed more of the product coming up obviously this is not a permanent fix so if what ever you are repairing is going to get wet this may not be what you are looking for,113,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,i am looking for another product to repair my hot tub cover followed the directions exactly the no-heat glue they provide seems to be about like elmers wood glue the colors matched fairly well but as soon as i thought it was all repaired i pulled off the sheet that is supposed to texture it and the entire patch came with it really disappointed you could do better with elmers glue and a colored sharpie,75,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,i am pretty darn crafty and if i can not make this look even remotely good than i imagine most people can not it really make the small tears look much worse and more noticeable not to mention that the tears reopened,41,104
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,i tried this product on a boat seat it took me an hour just to get the first application ready and put on it says to put another application on after the first one is dry it took a day to dry i got very un-inspired about doing this for the several splits i had to fix it would have taken me a month to do them all with this kit i gave up and bought liquid stitch just apply it with the built in brush and it is done,89,105
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,4.0,positive,had a faux leather chair which had an l shaped tear along the top of the back was able to match the chocolateand repaired the chair can i tell it was ripped yes can i see the damaged area when 5 foot away no and i no longer notice it every time i walk into the room or look at my son during dinner and neither does my wife which is a good thing i would practice with ayou will not be using on anyou do not care about to get the hang of it the directions are a little hard to understand and i had to read them 2 or 3 times to make sure i understood careful when applying the grain to get the proper side down this is why i would practice,139,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,5.0,positive,i used this to fix my boots and i love it,11,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1.0,negative,thisshowed up dry and not spreadable i am very displeased,12,108

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i used full page t-shirt transfers before and they seemed wasteful when the image is small it is good to have smaller size transfers for small projects followed the instructions and it worked well,33,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,i used these to put my book cover on a baseball cap the sleeves of several sweatshirts and a couple of teeshirts they work great easy transfer great colors and did not fade in the wash,35,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,this particular product has the wrong instruction sheet inside and caused me to damage my photos product probably would not have been so difficult if the directions inside the box were correct,32,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,this smaller sized sheet of transfer medium is handy i use it primarily when i design and print labels for my quilts on it,24,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,these work well for what they are like any other t-shirt transfer they need to be cut closely to the image to make them look decent they wear well we used them for a company event but after about 15 washes they are starting to peel off a bit,49,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,these work great for small projects just try and cut out as closely as you can to your design so it does not look ironed on at home they do also tend to crease and fade over time so take care when washing if it is something you really care about,49,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,well as other reviewers have stated the instructions are completely wrong it is like they are not even written for this product i suggest that you go to the avery site and download the correct instructions for this product I am giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions they would simply do as i did and attempt the instructions that came with the product that will not work at all if you follow the correct instructions from the avery site you will have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer it comes out pretty soft and bright not sticky like some transfers I have used in the past I have washed the shirt i made a few times inside out and it still looks almost like it did right after i made it,140,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,these were awesome easy to use and fun to make for gifts family members avery products are first class always,20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,as mentioned already the company screwed up completely on the directions took me 10 minutes of trying to separate the transfer sheet to figure this out once you know how to apply these they are actually very nice iron-ons I have made a few shirts for my 5-year old daughter who absolutely loves them I have also transferred images onto bibs for my youngest daughter amazingly they have lasted quite a long time over several washings they begin to wrinkle a bit but as long as you dry them on low they will last a while my wife accidentally dried one shirt on normal and the transfer ended up wrinkling a bit and looked like it had been through a dozen washings considering we have bought shirts from stores that have lasted less time I am very happy with these,133,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i liked the 4x6 sheet size because i often print smaller-size images to iron-on to t-shirts and find I have wasted half the page i found it did not peel easily after being ironed on which is always a plus avery has a high-quality product and if you are interested in making your own t-shirts matching aprons for a cooking or gardening club or memory quilts custom onesies would make a perfect baby shower gift great rainy-day activity to help kids design images on the computer and print out for an adult to iron on,92,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,as many reviewers have pointed out the instructions included for this product are ridiculous i have tested this product on several white t-shirts have not done any dark the actual use once i figured it out was fairly easy this was not a problem the real problem came in after a few wears and washes of the three shirts i have made i would say each have been worn and washed 3 or 4 times on all but one of them the image has already started to crack apart and peel it could be that i did something wrong but given the abysmal included instructions i called the help line and followed their directions exactly so my conclusion is this product needed a little more work before releasing it to the public,132,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i had read the reviews of this product before purchasing so i was well aware that the directions included with the product were entirely wrong and disregarded them thankfully users had posted better instructions and i was able to figure it out on my own for the most part I have only used this on white cotton t-shirts and although it is easy to apply especially since i do not really care if it ruins our garage sale iron the images have been breaking apart on the t-shirt material since this is the main reason why i purchased the product the use of it has become null to me I am not willing to she shall out more money for nice t-shirts that I shall probably just ruin so these transfers will probably just go in a drawer somewhere in my house never to be used again,142,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,really there is not much else to say it printed beautifully in my ink jet and transfered easily onto the garment fun product to use to create some original presents and more would deffinitely buy again,35,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,all you have to do is print the design you want and you are able to iron on the transfer works great only photo size so if you want a larger picture get bigger than 4x6,35,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i always have a few packets of t-shirt transfers and some new t-shirts for impromptu projects i mainly use these to entertain kids making team 1 and team 2 items to add to a theme event bridal shower toss pillow covers or other random temporary projects as with most print-yourself iron-on transfers the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings themust be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour / print transfer to another part of the t-shirt in other words do not leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing as with items in this genre this is purely a temporary in the momentfor something that lasts i would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick and mortar my one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing,168,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,transfer stickes for t shirts have always been a great way to produce great gifts for party attendants specially for kids birthday parties and to have an uniform look for family or group travel this stickes work great and i did not burn any transfering to t shirts only drawback is size may be a little small for large t shirts adult x and xx sizes,66,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i used these to make transfers for aprons for my family for our holiday family reunion they are really easy to use and were a huge hit with my family i washed mine in cold water in the gentle cycle drying on the lowest setting and there was no real loss of detail orjust be sure to use a vibrant photo or image to transfer to insure that you get a quality image,75,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,I have used avery transfers for inkjet printers before instead of having t-shirts printed for employees who come and go and mistreat the ones I have bought and had screen-printed i have often opted to print our logo with these transfers i think this latest batch i got is slightly more resistant to fading in the washing / drying process i suppose I shall know better a month or two from now but so far they seem better same good performance as far as inkaccuracy and consistently even transfer of image two months later the images i printed continue to wear well through the laundry process the two concerns anyone may have about using these transfers have now both been put to rest for me the image is intense and evenly printed the image stays that way much more than it would have with previous editions of the transfer try some,149,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,this photo transfer paper works great i am not using it for t-shirts but the wife wanted to start a memory quilt i took several photos that i had archived and using this paper printed them from my canon printer the iron on transfer to the cloth she is using went perfectly and she is extremely happy with the results it looks as if i will be ordering quite a bit more of this so she can finish her quilt,80,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,these are great for my 3 year olds t-shirts they fit perfectly on the shirts and i do not have problems with them often i had one that was hard to get the sheet off the shirt but i honestly do not know if i just did not push hard enough or iron it for long enough so i can not say it was not my fault although nothing is ever my fault ask my 12 year old laughing out loud I had buy these definitely,78,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,there were a lot of problems with this product first of which were the directions that were completely baffling the other was the product itself there were problems with printing it on my printer then with tranferring it on the shirt and then with washing i would not recommend this product it was too much of a hassle to work with and poor intstructions,64,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,as others have posted trying to follow the directions that come with these is mind boggling after several attempts to figure it out i actually came to amazon to see the reviews and found i was not alone my wife is an art teacher and usally can figure things like this out much better than me so she will be playing with thiese next all i want to do is make a custom t-shirt for my 4 year old it should not be this confusing,84,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,it did not even work in the printer went in came out did not do anything just got new printer will test it and update review if a success but from the looks of it it probably will not be the directions it says avery dark fabric transfer tips what about light colors and the directions from there on are shabby as in they are muddled I am not even sure the directions in the package are even correct the only plus i can see so far is the support line a support line for t-shirt transfers is not it supposed to be easy,97,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,great mission accomplished made a nice graduation gift,8,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,i usually do not write bad reviews but this was such a disappointment and a waste of money i used it to put images on two white cotton onesies it says right on the package ideal for childrens clothes the transfer attached the white backing to the shirt as well as the image unlike other light t-shirt transfers I have used in the past but i figured it would be ok nope after one wearing i rinsed them both in cold water in the sink and the ink ran terribly nearly all the red just washed right off ugh but still I am not wasting onesies so i just dropped them in the wash after only one wash with the rest of the baby clothes the transfer is ripping and torn and looks like garbage this is the worst iron-on transfer I have ever used avery you let me down,147,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,this product is junk i only use jet pro soft stretch this stuff cracks and the colors are not nearly as nice as the jet pro you do have to use an actual heat press with the jpss although,39,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,to me it was difficult i made mistakes a lots the print came out after washing may be iron was not enough,22,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i love customizing things fabric is no exception so when these popped up i was sure to grab them i was discouraged upon attempting to do my first transfer because the instructions made no sense in fact they were completely incorrect the instructions say that the transfers are for dark fabrics but the sheets say for light fabrics after eventually getting this to work i found out that that you can not dry the fabrics on anything other than low which is fine with me i dry everything on low to keep them soft they are really no better than any other iron on transfers i will not be purchasing these again but if avery comes out with a new and improved transfer i will consider it hopefully they have taken all of these reviews to heart,133,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,2.0,negative,i thought that i would love to put this toghter but not so much it was much harder than i thought it would be and over time the paper has started to fall apart i would not buy this again,40,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,4.0,positive,i love crafting but this one took forever be prepared to spend several hours on this project although the end result is very pretty some things that annoyed me 1 the colors on the picture are not the exact same colors that you will receive the colors that come with the kit are mostly pastels 2 be prepared to pull your hair out trying to do the flower kinds that are shaped like petals 3 vague directions but full picture tutorials are available on her website for 2 of the flowers but with that being said they are very pretty and if you enjoy crafting it is something fun to do also if you measure the dimensions of the tissue paper and keep the directions you can recreate these flowers in different colors they were simple and look very charming but these may be a little too difficult for children,147,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,5.0,positive,i ordered this product after looking at other paper flowers and nothing else was what i wanted so i gave this a try making the flowers was very easy and quick to do i rapped the wireabout 3 times to just add more mass to it and it makes the flower more stable i will be ordering more to use them as centerpieces for a party i get comments from people who are not very crafty and complement me on making something that looks so complexed but it will be my secret that it is not hard at all,102,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,4.0,positive,i have a friend who likes to do crafts with her 5 year old daughter so i thought they would enjoy this kit i have not seen it myself so i can not comment on the quality it seemed a litle expensive just for tissue paper and instructions but i was in a rush i hope to see the finished product when i visit them i can say that it was fast shipping,73,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,1.0,negative,the package was open on one side and did not contain paper or all contents very disappointed in whoever packaged this and opened the kit,25,16

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,2.0,negative,bought these to use as center pieces for a baby shower making the first set and i not going to do anymore the pin cushion type flowers are fine but the folded petal flowers are an epic fail i have tried every way possible to make them work the instructions are virtually worthless i have been crafting for over 40 years and am pretty good but this kit is just a mess,72,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,4.0,positive,directions need to include how many pieces of tissue per flower include more florist tape and stamens to match the current directions or revise the directions i used four kits to create eight beautiful wedding rehearsal bouquets / rehearsal dinner decorations / bridal suite decorations each kit took 4 - 6 hours to complete,48,22

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,5.0,positive,i bought these for my wedding flowers i was getting married in the desert and could not have real flowers and then i substituted better double sided tissue paper from a fine paper store so these were a learning curve for me i ended up making wedding flowers with my friends and they were fabulous,55,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0052UNLTU,2.0,negative,unless you are just good at this already these are too hard for me i gave up and just did the pom pom flowers very complicated but all the supplies are there poor directions too,35,25

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,1.0,negative,these are terrible the colors are not as pictured on the box they are very pale you can not tell the difference between the colors even when youthem right alongside each other there were also only a few colors in the box not as pictured again for example i got four blue four yellow four pink and four orange but really since they are all so pale it amounts to a box of 16 white chalks also they are very brittle one arrived broken and one broke in my daughters hand while she was trying to write with it and when i tested out another one thinking she had pressed too hard that one broke in half with very little pressure in short these were a waste of money and effort,133,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,2.0,negative,colors are not very vibrant not what the image looks like at all,13,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,2.0,negative,half came broken and i was almost upset until i tried using them and realized they only break if you touch them colors are not very intense either but i was using blackboard stickers and not a real blackboard so your mileage may vary,44,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,4.0,positive,like the colors but they all came broken if i was a kid i would be upset,17,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,4.0,positive,great chalk to be used on a green board where the white does not show much i am student teaching 7th grade english and prefer to use a blackboard rather then a smartboard yellow seems to work best and hopefully some of the others will be bright enough so the students can see i like that it is small but i would have preferred the bigger ones i do not know why people go into mad cow attitude when they get their chalk broken it is chalk buy the sidewalk one if you want it to endure,95,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B009C98RQY,2.0,negative,the chalk is great it is not dustless but good chalk is not dustless and this writes well it is also gluten free if someone decides to eat it haha the reason for only two stars is the price 1181 is way too much to pay since you can buy it locally for 047 / box i can not tell you where you might get it for that price but use you wonderful imagination and you might just see it,77,16

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,bought these as a spare set until i can find my boye needles they arrived promptly the larger sizes look and feel sturdy they are plastic so i would not get too rough and tough with the smaller sizes great value for such a large variety as a side note love the colors,51,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,i bought these hooks to take on a flight next week and they will not work at all these hooks are very poor quality the hook end does not catch the yarn at all i would not recommend purchasing these hooks you can find susan bates plastic hooks for less money and much better quality they did not come in a case like advertised just a clear plastic bag the larger sizes would work sufficiently but the smaller sizes would not work for any project,85,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,they are light wt they do the job i just have to get used to them the hooks do not have their size written on printed on them i taped the size to the hooks for convenience for me,38,10

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,go to your local craft store with a coupon and get quality product that actually makes it to your hands what you think your savings g does not make up for the frustration and aggravation of trying to actually get your product,42,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,i used them once then never again i suppose it is a matter of preference but I had never used an acrylic hook before and i just did not like the feel of them nor the way they slid through the loops of the yarn,42,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,so pretty i use these all the time since i got them because they contrast so brightly with my yarn the smaller hooks are pretty thin so be gentle but mine are very well made and have no snags,39,24

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,product came fast exactly as listed however 4 stars because of the resistance of the hook against the yarn not smooth like aluminum but still useful and worth the,30,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,piece of junk not at all what i waited so long and patiently for do not waste your money,18,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,the description said these hooks came in a case and they do not they also do not list the alphabet size on the hook just the mm size and you can hardly see the numbers i do like the feel of the hook for the most part although,48,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,they arrived much sooner than they estimated and are as beautiful as i had hoped,15,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for these but was rather disappointed the second smallest size snapped shortly into a project with very little tension the tops and underside of the heads have sharp and rough points i easily sanded these off with a metal nail file but they were unusable prior to this lighter than an aluminum hook but much heavier than bamboo i would not purchase again,66,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,shipped super quick butdoes not look like picture there are 5 different colored hooks in the package but they are not marbled or tye-dyed like the photo and yeah as someone else said the smaller hooks are a little flimsy ok for the price,46,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,they are really nice to work with them they look like colorful,13,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,a little rough at the loop but i fixed that by filing it down,14,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,these plastic hooks have terrible burrs that pull on the yarns and tears them up i had to sand them but the plastics just burr again,26,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,there was no case the needles were in a cellophane wrapper like you would buy at the store definitely not a case,21,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,very poor constructed and quality take the time and buy locally,11,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,nice and durable feels weird to use since i am used to using a metal hook plastic feels like it catches on some fluffy yarns,25,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i absolutely love these hooks the only con is i wish that it had the alphabetical size on the hook it only has the numerical size,26,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,they are great work just like they should no complaints had to hit a few spots with some sandpaper but besides that great,22,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i love my hooks and my cousin seen mine and she ordered a set the colors are yes catching awesome,20,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,firstly the description is incorrect and the seller is aware but never bothered updating it claiming that someone else had changed the description without their approval how hard cud it be to change the description back to being correct if it were that easy to change t without approval secondly while the seller as polite they did not address my issues which is the description is incorrect there has no case and no free stylus thirdly when i pointed out that my issue was not addressed they stopped respinding to me as lastly the smallest hook broke reported this product to amazon got most of my back less taxes and bought a metal set instead better to get that metal set the yarn glides with these plastic ones there has a lot of friction,132,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i like this product because it have all different size of the crochet hooks all my crochet items look amazing,20,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,i love the hooks the only problem i have with them i can not see the sizes on them even with my glasses on other than that i love them,30,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,these were unexpected i do not know exactly what i expected but they were very bright and colorful these are also for christmas,22,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,i ordered this set just for the big hooks and they are just great they are smooth easy to work with and do n't catch the yarn the smaller ones are not so smooth 300 mm and 400 mm but anyway if you are planning more precise crochet project it 's better to order metal hooks,54,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,arrived timely and good value but several of the hooks are unusable the grooves were fused together so the yarn just keeps slipping the larger hooks are better but needed to filed down as there were pieces of acrylic still stuck on them i would buy these again for sure and just spend the money on higher quality ones,59,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,i bought these more for the larger hooks in the set and could honestly care less about the small ones which look about as sturdy as those plastic sword toothpicks but another reviewer said they hold up well they do have some rough edges mostly out of yarns way on the end but annoying enough to want to sand off there was no plastic wallet / case to speak of either just the hooks i must have gotten lucky because shipping was actually pretty quick overall i got what i paid for and expected nothing more,94,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,only issue is it is difficult to see the sizes but that is the acrylic aspect of them overall the product was good took some time to get it from china but i am pleased with the product and would buy again if needed,43,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,like the sizes feel a little flimsy but so far so good if i find a flaw I shall let people know,21,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,great they were coming off a but in the cornerns but not a big deal they served it is purpose for my scarecrow pants,23,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,easy to work with these go on fast and easy the colors are great these came fast and i will reorder again,22,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,followed directions went on just fine after first wash they pulled away from the edges and were almost completely off waste of money I am going to had to actually see them on and even then they do not stick to my jeans,39,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,seller was good and thisarrived promptly but this produce is horrible selected these and paid more money because i thought they were nicer looking followed instructions and all the patches did not stick to the jeans or they stuck and then immediately fell off before wearing jeans would return them for a refund if i could but i have used them feeling totally ripped off they do not work and nobody else should waste their money on these,80,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,i got great use out of these work like they should and easy to put on,16,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,did not last through more then 2 - 3 washes,8,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,does the job and very easy to apply no complaints except material is kind of cheap,16,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,they work just make sure you do it right because i got another hole in my jeans at theof the patch because i did not make it overlap enough,30,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,the good you can cut these to the size you would like the bad they would not adhere at all i tried every single patch that came in this packet and not one would stick to the fabric it would stick partially if at all and then after cooling would peel right off I am a seasoned pro at ironing on patches and so i feel confident saying that these are simply poor quality 11 for a handful of patches is bad enough but 11 for patches that will not even stick is just insulting i feel like I have been ripped off frankly and i do not usually feel that way after purchasing something off amazon i ordered some iron-on patches from another company off amazon and those adhered beautifully these are a scam,130,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,thisdid not stick as per instructions i had to sew,12,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,saved my favorite sweat pants the patches are great for large holes easy to cut for smaller ones one can cut any design in the patch holds great during washing and drying without tacking the patch just wished there was more than one sheet of each patch,47,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,unfortunately these patches did not work very well for me at all applied one onto a pair of jeans which came off within 5 minutes i had also followed the instructions exactly as stated i would not recommend these even although they are very pretty if you want to sew them on then buy them but if you are looking for a quick fix these patches are not your answer,68,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,one of the patterns was an exact match for my favorite robe and i was able to match the plaid so well it is undetectable very easy to apply,29,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,i love these they are really cute they were easy to apply but after two washes in the washing machine one of the patches came off the others are still going strong but i was a little disappointed that one came right off,43,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,maybe you are supposed sew them on too but they came off after one wash,15,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,fell off the jeans i ironed them onto within minutes disappointing,11,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,cute fabric but did not stick to surface and lifted almost instantly bummed,13,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,the look great but did not adhere to my [ clean dry ] pants total bummer,15,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,these are cute patterns / plaids but the material is thin and the adhesive is weak i used them for my sons jeans and when i washed them all the patches came off you could reinforce with stitching but the material itself might not hold that either,45,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,will go nice on plain material shirts in the boys closet,11,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,these work well adds a stylish touch to an old pair of jeans,13,20

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,horrible you do not get a variety of colors it is nothing like what is pictured i only received four different colors dark blue light blue red pink oh and one yellow button,33,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,i am planning on returning these the picture shows bright colors and the ones i got were pastels and it does not seem that there are 40 of them,29,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,2.0,negative,there colors were as pictured but the quantity was no where near 50 i only received 36 buttons,18,4

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,5.0,positive,the buttons look beautiful and exactly like the ones in the picture i did expect a little more but i did not count how many buttons there were so I am not sure although you can not really expect much for 3 - 4 overall seems like a great product,45,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,i thought buying this was a good deal until they arrived over 10 were broken when they arrived in the envelope package not happy about that at all,28,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,4.0,positive,the buttons are vibrant colors and are perfect for making button necklaces when paired with some painted buttons also sold on amazon the price is very reasonable the only complaint is you do not get over 50 but i would not want them to decrease the size of the buttons to meet the quantity advertised to satisfy the 40 g weight indicated so i can accept this issue the colors are more vibrant than the picture shows I have ordered more,76,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,2.0,negative,very cheap guess you get what you pay for,9,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,i made magnets out of these for an upcoming craft show the pieces were good sizes variety of small to medium will definitely be buying again to keep in stock,30,0

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,these were smaller than i expected but nice,8,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,as most other reviews have said these are not coaster sized I am not sure i even had a piece that was 4 in diameter more than 2/3 of my bag was the size of a silver dollar not what i needed at all i had no choice but to cherry pick the largest ones to use for my ornaments if i had more time i would have sent them back great price but change the advertising,75,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,these were great for our sons wedding reception,8,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,they were all 2 to small for my project had to send them back,14,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,ended up being way smaller than i expected and i read the measurements but a great deal for the quantity,20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,i thought they were a little bit thicker but the wood texture worked well for my fireplace project i ordered more for another project I am working on,27,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,smaller than expected but should make great ornaments as soon as the wood burner arrives,15,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,loved these for my crafty project but as other reviews said they did vary in size some by quite a lot all in all still worked for my homemade ornaments,30,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,what a waste of money do not buy pictures are deceiving make it look nice and big pieces looks like they come in a big box but they come in a tiny bag,34,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,the description says they are 2 x 25 inches i measured them and they are really 1 3/8 by 2 1/4 the holes drilled in them at not centered and will not allow them to hang straight i will be returning this product as it is not at all as the description saysit is sad that an amazon seller does not take more pride in their product,67,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,they are great however this said 50 pieces i did not receive 50 pieces like it states which is really unfortunate also i was unable to locate the specifications of the pieces on the mobile app so they were a lot smaller than anticipated,43,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,great for crafts great for christmas ornaments great for magnets to be put on for the refrigerator,17,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,these showed up exactly as described in excellent condition beautiful and perfect for what i need them for,18,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,ordered the 2x25 they are all just over an inch and a quarter wide almost a full inch short of the product description,23,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,small very small and the sizes are irregular but I am still happy,12,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,my purpose was craft and i see myself making christmas ornaments with these i like that they are varied in size the packing is not fancy came thrown into a bag but there is not anything delicate about them so they came in good condition,43,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,too small smaller than the picture leads you to expect they will be good bbq chips,16,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,they are so small not worth it at all i had nohow tiny these little rounds would be smaller than the palm of your hand,27,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,they are smaller then i had imagined but they look great i bought these for a project that they probably will not work for so now i need to come up with a new use,34,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,I am disappointed because these wood pieces do not look nothing like the pictures shown they look so much bigger than what they actually are it is misleading if i would of known how tiny they are i would have not purchase these wood pieces now look at my pictures the first one is almost this size of a tape look how tiny the other two are I am going to keep them because i do not like returning anything i already paid for,81,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,when i bought these i thought they was bigger they are little can not use them for what i want,19,23

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,too small i thought they would be a bit wider,10,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,image does not match items recieved wood is very small twig pieces not the disc size 2 to 3 inch image shows deceptive,23,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,used them at a craft day with my sisters and we made christmas garland tripods coasters and ornaments with these read the size although as some reviewers did not and blamed the seller for their misfortune,36,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,if i could give it no stars i would it came very quickly and the box was fine the wood slices were packaged in a plastic bag when i opened it there was a really moldy smell and sure enough over half were blue also many were crumbled or cracked in halfit is true to size although most were on the 3 cm side,63,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,these are great they are small but if you read the description and are not surprised when they arrive i think you will find that they are excellent quality for small craft projects I am having a blast with them,35,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,pictures made it look big and never was,8,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,nice quality but far smaller in size than advertised,9,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,these slices are pretty and will work fine if you need tiny wood slices however the pictures are misleading and i think this product is too expensive the majority of the slices measure 3 cm which is the small side of the 3 - 5 cm quoted I had maybe pay 020 each but not 033 the pictures are misleading if you are reading quickly and not reading the fine print the picture of the slices in a box also shows 3x the quantity you get and makes the slices look a lot bigger than they are however if you want this size they would be fine just make sure to get out a ruler before ordering and think about what 3 cm really means cute for tiny ornaments or kids crafts,128,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,were supposed to be the 3 - 5 inch not cm i had ordered some that size in the same order and wanted bigger ones for a wreath very disappointed i wasted my money on these when bigger ones were the same price,41,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,was not a big as i hoped but i love them will order more heres what i used my for after the first project did not end up the way i wanted,30,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,so these are a lot smaller then they look in the picture i guess i should have read the size but the picture makes them look very big like the ones i needed well i made them work and am very happy with what i have done i will actually be buying more so yes small but happy it worked out for me,63,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,some were warped some were molded horrible product price explains a lot,11,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,much smaller than i thought but great for trinkets or ornaments,11,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,no stars for this one i had to put one to submit comment they where discribed as coasters 3 coasters are not very useful,24,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,absolutely tiny picture is not realistic super unhappy,8,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,they were just as advertised and worked perfectly for my craft project there were only 2 out of the whole bunch that were too small,25,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,5.0,positive,perfect for what i wanted i plan on using these as key chains to hand out at a baby shower i probably should have ordered them a bit bigger,29,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,4.0,positive,they are fine just smaller then expected i wanted to woodburn letters onto them to make a welcome sign but they are just a little small for that was hoping for coaster size not tea light size,35,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,these slices are much smaller than they appear in the photo and much smaller than i would have preferred quite a few are the size of a 50-cent piece and none are as large as what appears to be a 2 1/2 3 slice that said they are clean and they are aged so they will not split,57,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,was under the impression that these round wood slices were coaster size i planned on woodburning them for my wedding guest now they will all get a magnet to put on their fridge they are about the size of a silver dollar,42,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,many smaller and irregular in size than expected,8,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,some of the pens exploded and got ink everywhere so i had to return them they also felt very cheaply made in my hand like they would snap if i held them too tightly so i did not purchase another pack,41,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,all but one of the pens work well one of the purple pens is unfortunately already dried out the triangular shape makes for easy storage and allows for a better more comfortable grip,33,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,fine product good transaction a couple of pens seemed a little dry otherwise i would have rated the product 5 stars overall happy with the purchase,26,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,so disappointed in these markers one was completely dry two barely work several are scratchy and one broke apart the first time i uncapped it and ink got all over the place i feel like i got a different set of markers than those in all the reviews i read before purchasing i will never buy these again,58,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,love this i use this for my planner to doodle u have alot of different colors to play with it does not bleed through paper,26,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i bought these to go along with a coloring book of very intricate mandalas so i needed pens or markers that could handle the tiny details of the pictures the fine tips on these pens are fantastic and the colors do not bleed out through the paper plenty of different colors to choose from as well good purchase,57,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,this is the 3rd batch of markers i received 2day where all the blue ones are dried out weird i guess I am not supposed 2 use blue laughing out loud,28,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,they work ok they came in fast like 2 or 3 of the pin did not work,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,i got these because they were cheap artist inkers and i wanted to test them out i open the case to find out that the pens were dryed out the tips on some broke off and the caps insides fall apart i say do not ever buy these because they will waste your money,53,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,tips were broken and several were dried up,8,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,bought them as a gift recipient was very pleased,9,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,got these for college went to work on my homework and the grey and light yellow does not work i have not used all the colors yet but now i have to order new ones not happy,37,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i ordered 2 of these for christmas gifts only some of the pens worked i was past the return date so stuck with them the ones that worked are great,30,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,first off these are fine tipped markers not pens secondly I have never experienced drawing with something that does not remotely match theof the cap it is like a surprise every time the light colors are dark the five different greens are all roughly the samethe yellows are orange or green and they have run out quickly on the plus side the case is nice and i like the triangular shape and the price was cheap,76,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the colors are all vibrant 1 of the markers may have had abut after inspecting each and every single one i could not find d it but oh well i love them,33,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love these i wish i had found them sooner thy arrived before the date that was given i use them for school and also for coloring I have had them for over a month and all the colors are still vibrant and i have not had any issues with the ink not drying fast enough,54,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,very disappointing these are not thethat the cap says they are at all,15,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,mis-advertised these are in no way shape or form gel pens they are markers they have fine points and work well as markers but they are not gel pens which is what i was expecting when i ordered them markers can not be blended no glitter and all the colors are extremely dark would not order again,56,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,nice colors and good for details but i did break the tip of one already by applying too much pressure,20,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,they have an incredibly cheap feel and are not gel as advertised i will be returning them,17,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,half of these are already dried out plus the colors do not match lids i picked up a yellow one and thewas deep orange,25,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i really liked the pens they were nice for a while i used them only for a school year if that is a while but some of the colors dry out faster than others once a pen has been bent or split there has no going back that was the only sad part about these pens,54,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these are a very nice fine tipped pen work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in there are plenty of colors but i did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper there was only 1 pen that i had any issue with and it was a light green which did not bother me that much since i do not use a lot of the lighter green colors but by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let thedrop and i have not had any issue since the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing the colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you will not lose them anywhere i am attaching a copy of a picture that i am working on right now using these pens for the linework the wording is done with a marker i received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review,203,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i bought these to use for adult coloring books and a lot of people end up using colored pencils but i wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick is a great variety of colors and it is very sharp clear bright pigmentation I had recommend this to anybod so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book I am not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I shall probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i like the colors but when i received them one of the pen exploded and was a mess,18,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i like the fine line it draws however three of the markers were dried up before i even got to use them disappointing and i probably will not buy their product again,32,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these are nice pens very fine point they are great for tiny details however they do not blend well when you fill something in you can see each individual line each time you cover over the same area it gets darker due to the fine tip i would not recommend for anything larger however they are great colors and nice quality,61,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,good set of coloring pens but colors are not as bright as i thought they would be,16,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,nice pens i wanted a fine line marker to use with my silhouette machine for drawing and writing sentiments these worked perfect they have a pretty good range of colors the nibs are nice and strong also and draw a nice fine line,43,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when i purchased them they were not they are fine point markers had i wanted fine point markers these would been marvelous but not what i wanted mis-marked not what i was looking for no good for adult coloring books,45,29

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these were pretty good markers they are fine tip and theydecently some colors are basically the same shade but other than that i had no problem they arrived quickly and I have had them for almost a year now,39,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,there has only one shade of red which is sad but a billion pinks and greens so that makes up for it,21,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,one of the pens blew up when i first used it i had to throw it away,17,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,great but one of the pens was leaking in the package when we got it,15,35

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i ordered these to use on my ultra-intricate adult coloring books definitely a fine point works very well on tiny areas i recommend some larger or broader markers for bigger areas as these leave a rough texture to the paper when used toa larger space,47,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,very scratchy so i ended up giving them to my grandchildren i will not purchase again,16,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these fineliner gel sketch markers are of a very high quality and have nice bold colors the markers come in a wide array of colors in a reusable plastic container I have only had one markersince I have begun using them they are excellent for mixed media projects mandala colorings zen tangle journaling deconstructing books grocery lists i would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge that is all,77,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i use these for coloring and they are great products the only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so i have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow,40,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i was so excited for these pens to comes in and they worked great at first but i have not even finished coloring one page in my coloring book and my dark brown marker is dying i made sure to cap all my pens properly but it is still dying i expect pens to last more than a day,58,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,many of the colors appear very differently on paper than what you expect based on theof the cap,20,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,I am a teacher and i love my office supplies i could not wait to try these out they are definitely fine point and there was no running or bleeding as i drew colored and wrote with them i love the variety of colors that come in the pack as well i am excited to use them very similar to the rong thai fine point markers i tried them in a coloring book and because the pages are thick it did not bleed through but not sure i would use them for coloring i did receive this product to try out and review,99,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,love these got an adult coloring book and these work great for all those little details in those pictures i highly recommend these and can not beat the price also got them quicker than expected so that was nice,38,47

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love the container of these fineliner pens and the 24 colors are good although a couple of them are pretty close in tone to another still a good set for tiny spaces in adult coloring books,37,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,not good for adult coloring books they do not glide very well scratchy / dry might be better served for signing signatures or writing text but for coloring in you do not get a consistent fill some places are darker than others and those dark places bleed through was looking to try a new brand to diversify my range of colors i typically use stabilo but unfortunately will have to keep looking,70,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i love these pens i find that they do bleed through most paper unless it is a very heavy weight paper the colors are vibrant and i use them all the time,32,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these are the right pens to use with adult coloring books after trying pencils and coloring brush pens i found these work in the tight places the best i tried all of them to see if any were dried up and all were good true toas well you need to replace the lids so they snap on tight to keep them from drying up,66,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,these just arrived in the mail and at least one of them leaked as they are all covered in a bluish-purple ink theappears new as the blue is all over my hands now as well,37,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these pens are really awesome i used them when i was studying for my exams because i like for my notes to be colorful and organized my only problem was that a few of them dried out or ran out of ink very quickly i had hardly even used them it was only two or three in the pack that did this and the others still work great,68,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,using these for my adult coloring books and they are wondeful several coworkers plan to purchase the same product for their coloring books as well,25,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,terrible absolutely terrible 75 if them are dry they do not fill well very blotchy what an total waste of money,22,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,they are great for really tiny spaces but when it comes to bigger spaces you really have to take your sweet time,22,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,i recently bought these pens i have used them three times and four of them are already dry waste of money,21,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i like the flow of these pens and they only barely bleed through a quality coloring book however the dark green was leaking from the bottom of the pen and was already all over the other pens when it arrived I am sure this was a fluke also for 24 colors a lot of these colors are so similar that it is like I am using the same colors over and over i would have liked more variety in the pack,78,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,nice markers lots of colors to choose from,8,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i ordered these to use in an adult coloring book they work perfectly for the extra fine lines that are in the book they do bleed through just a tiny bit so i have a piece of paper in between my pages they do not bleed through the lines for me like other markers did i can be very precise definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs fine detail,70,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these pens are awesome i got them for coloring in adultbooks they are amazing for small areas,19,64

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,really goodmarkers bc they do not bleed through paper and write better than gel pens,16,68
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,they are a very fine point and run out of ink before a project can be completed,17,69
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,cheaply made and the there is a inkproblem,10,70

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,the pens were all leaking when i got them so i sent them back for a refund,17,72
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,horrible ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer ofalso these are listed as pinkrise and they are plinrise for some unknown reason if you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove the triangular shape is pleasing to the hands although,65,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,some pens were already dry and unusable very disappointing got much better pens at michaels,16,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love to write and draw and i am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers i am so glad i got these pinkrise office colored fineliner sketch drawing pen fine point gel ink pen ink width 04mm set of 24 assorted colors they are very nice and come in a plastic case that seals nicely so when you are done you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them and they write just wonderfully i am very picky about my pens and markers but could not find anything negative about these i absolutely love them i was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion i am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way i am just a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision,157,75
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,like others said some where dried out when i received them and seem to run outfast,16,76

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love these markers i was worried about the quality and the price but identification buy them again i love them i was impressed with the size since i wanted extremely small markers and these nailed it,37,80
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the lid and the actualdid not always match but i just made achart in the flap of the book for comparison loved the markers over all,29,81
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,markers bleed all over my hands they run out of ink right after one use I am completely disappointed i would give them zero stars if there was an option for that i wish i could get my money back,41,82
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,was delivered very quickly the colors are great and the pens do not bleed across the page very pleased and would recommend to others,24,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the triangular shape makes these easy to hold i like a finer tip but for what they are they are good,21,84
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted no problems with dried pens nice variety of colors super fast shipping i received my set 2 days after i ordered it happy with my purchase,30,85
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,not only are they dried up and yes i did shake them and wait a while to use them but some of the tips are split down the middle the colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out,45,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these are great for very detailed drawings the ink seems to stay consistent even after prolonged use also the barrel is triangular rather than round i found it a little awkward at first but it certainly did not cause any issues these would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type maybe paired with an art book regarding shipping i have prime and it arrived within 2 days,70,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these pens work well but they run out of ink sooner than other brands,14,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,half the markers were dried out upon arrival waste of money,11,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,i love these markers it really brought my artwork to life good thing i already owned a blacklight flashlight because that is the only way it is going to glow it would be better if the markers came with a mini lamp so it would be more convenient and easier to work with for those who do not,68,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,the product seems beautiful and practicali think it should be pretty goodill try it in a minute,17,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,received it very fast but it is not as bright as i thought it was going to be,18,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,two colors were noticable under blacklight and some not so much,11,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,these work great and are fun to use they glow like crazy under backlights i used them at a glow birthday party for girls to decorate t-shirts they had such a blast and made all sorts of designs with them they had to laugh when they saw their brilliant work under normal lights of course the colors are softer rather than brilliant neon while under backlights they were super easy to use and there were no duds,78,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,just as effective as highlighters which are naturally somewhat phosphorescent under black light in fact these are highlighters with a supped up label to make it feel like your are getting something worth your hard earned money let me tell you a secret you are not ps i tested it under 3 different uv black lights by the way two different led uv flashlights one a screw in bulb side by side with standard office depot highlighters they are indistinguishable from one another,82,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,only lasted one day went back to use them again and took off the cap and none of them would write,21,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,5.0,positive,i tried on both black and white boards white boards work best,12,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,these barely glow under uv light not a fan and will not be using them,14,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,4.0,positive,shows up well with black light recommend to buy,9,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00XZYLRHS,1.0,negative,it is not good it does not glow in the dark i got it for my birthday and i was shy to say to my friend that it glows in the dark,31,10
Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,really disappointing as a noise reducer no noticeable difference does diffuse the exhaust really not worth it,17,0
Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,does not block sound that much but it does reduce dust fits shop vacs,13,1
Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,thought i was looking for a filter but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum did the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she did not know it was missing,39,2
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this installs easily on the rigid vacuum exhaust port but that is about the only good thing about it it is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it i could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not it is a goodbut really does not work too well,60,3
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this product being advertised as a muffler is misleading i observed no difference in sound level i just completed my test it is being returned an effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac this is a viable option for my use since i will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective,77,4
Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,the listing for this muffler does not say what size hose it fits there are three sizes when i received it i realized it did not fit my vacuum,27,5
Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,my ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106db at 3 feet according to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a dead kennedys concert the muffler reduces that to 105 so maybe a wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler further using an unscientific stick to your face test I had say it reduces suction by about 15 so basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac if you need that and do not want to just tape a sock to the outlet click buy immediately i finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet now i can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her f-16,124,6
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,it is a muffler makes the shop vac quiet stays in place does not stick out too far one two three four,20,7
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,i did not need exhaust dispersion if i did i would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device to my knowledge none exist i wanted a muffler this does not muffle i took it back the end ps this site will not allow my zero star rating,45,8
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,this not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine does not blow air all over from the back of the machine it is a great addition for very little money we were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list,50,9
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,i was surprised to see that this muffler received 4 stars when i read the reviews praise was given not because it muffles sound but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust indeed this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my ridgid vacs i bought two of them but i was in a rush and got them locally when we are working on a job site there often is lots of dust imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in it also spreads the dust over an even greater area as other reviewers describe this muffler oh why not just call it air-diffuser redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle this greatly reduces the force of the air it is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler but the difference is too small to spend any money on so in terms of living up to it is name i give it one star,190,10
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,this little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac the name is rather misleading as it was not designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction,40,11
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,if you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place if you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust this is what you need it can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust,44,12
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this is definitely not a noise muffler it is not a silencer either it does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face by redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable i bought this for our new ridgid wd1680 which amazon does not sell the big box store i bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so i got this to go with it used in a garage the vac is surprisingly quiet it seems our hoover upright is much louder i measured the ridgid as-is at 83db with the muffler on it was 83db there was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant i figure it is also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I am going to return it the wd1680 also works as a removeable blower in that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port even although it was the same port with just a tube attachment so bottom line is that this is useless,182,13
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart this really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern and also diffusing it with some very porous foam vacuum performance is not hindered it is not really a muffler as the noise level did not change for me but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying it should really come with the vacuum but since it does not its a no brainer purchase,82,14
Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,i bought thisfor the rigid shop vac with detachable blower basically the same unit as the sears craftsman version it makes a noticable difference in reducing the frequency of the sound thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit although i can not say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter i do not have a db meter it certainly makes it seem quieter and much more bearable you do have to watch where you point it although because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction although this is by design it is the blower port after all also it not fully inserted it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on worth the money,130,15
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,perfect for what i needed see behind without turning around check on skier or tuber or to see approaching boat from rear clear enough for all that and secures tightly so no vibrations,33,0
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,the mirror workes as expected on the bass boat and is used for skiing in the water in the summer,20,1
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,great product at a great price i would highly recommend thishas a wide view for towing skiers behind you,21,2
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,i liked having this mirror and it was inexpensive but it was also cheap the piece for mounting it broke off within a couple of months and that is with minimal use it was a disappointment,35,3
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,this was rather difficult to install on my boat i also found out that it does not meet the requirements for acceptable mirrors in texas by the us coast guard,29,4
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,simple mirror that gets the job done and you get your monies worth the reflective part is plastic so it is not as clear but it is certainly more durable than glass you may need to put a shim so it fits to you windshield,44,5
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,it works fine you get what you pay for the key word for this product is economy,17,6

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,not too shabby a decent value mirror that has stayed attached so far,13,46
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,it is more of a shiny piece of plastic sticker than anything else it does get the job done tho as functioning as a rear view mirror still would have preferred some sort of plexi or tempered glass,37,47
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,a piece of junk what a waste of time I am surprised that it is even sold on amazon,17,48

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,i guess for the low price it functions however the construction is plastic and the mirror quality is poor just a piece of film,23,63
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,mirror part not exactly high grade lens material but for a budget purpose does the job seems to screw into place securely and is the right size and seems solid enough we always have more than one person in the boat if we are towing someone so this was more to be legal in case we ever wanted to have just driver and person being towed and for the driver to be able to peak on their own without relying on the other passenger so this fits our needs well enough in spite of the lack of crisp visual it is ok to good not good to great,106,64
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,price is good not a glass mirror made of plastic hopefully holds up,13,65
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,the clarity of view seems fine to me but it could definitely have a larger view the problem for me is that i can not find a way to securely mount it yet it will not tighten up enough to fit any standard ski boat windshield that i have seen surely with a little more creativity i can make a spacer to take up all the space but i should not have to modify a product to fit a boat it is marketed to fit would not buy again,87,66
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,i would not put this on a jon boat straight to the trash,12,67

Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,not very clear to see and it broke around 30 mph,11,72
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,needs to be at least 4 wide and long,9,73
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,there are fancier models of this mirror but for an affordable price it is easy to attach the the windshield of a boat i use my mirror to help to watch skiers as well a see what is going on behind me in general if money was no object you may want to consider a higher-end model with suction cup mount and more i opted for this because my boats windows are tinted and i did not want to stick a suction cup the window tint I have hit this with my head a few times and it has not broken the build quality is okay but i doubt that it could withstand extended abuse I am happy with my purchase and the price paid for this mirror it helps to makes my boating experience more safe on a budget,135,74
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,this is a very universal clamp on cheapy but does the job i had to make a block to take up the space to elliminate the rattle otherwise works great,30,75
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,cheap and blurry but what i expected for the price does mount easily buy metal or glass for clear visibility,20,76
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,just what we needed for our kawasaki mule utv now we can see what is coming up behind us easy attachment,21,77
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,2nd one i ordered the slightest bump and it is broken i put a new one in my boat on saturday 7/13 and i bumped it on sunday 7/14 it broke,31,78
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,I am not sure why it took me so long to order one of these not only is it required when skiing with only two people but it is hugely convenient do not hesitate to buy one they are a great asset on a boat,43,79
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,tried to save a buck you get what you pay for the clamp actually popped itself off as soon as i mounted it,22,80
Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,this is really a pretty cheapounfortunately it does not quite fit over the windshield of my boat also the only way to tighten it onto the windshield is with the provided screws it really seems like there should be a foam covered plate between the screws and the surface to prevent scratching the surface I am using it but actively seeking a better alternative,64,81
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2.0,negative,poor quality you get what you pay for i guess strongly recommend to anyone considering this purchase to consider not purchasing thisas it is advertised as a universal fit it is not,34,0
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5.0,positive,they are just what i wanted i had a hard time finding such seat covers and these are great very durable very happy with them,25,1
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4.0,positive,i like saddleblanket material for seatcovers I had rather that the saddleblanket material was used for the whole cover instead of spandex around the top and edges one of the elastic straps came loose when i pulled on it it is cheap but better than many of the seatcovers on the market today i use a large safety pin to hold it properly at the bottom out of sight,65,2
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2.0,negative,not a universal bucket seat fit way too small does not fit would not recommend to a friend rips upon stretching,21,3
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4.0,positive,i really like the style and the toughness of the weave only one thing prevents me from giving 5-stars is that the cover should have a hold-down strap on the bottom front when getting into vehicle occasionally the cover will slide up and off the corner,44,4
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1.0,negative,they are nothing like they used to be and because they say universal fit does not mean they are universal i have a ford explorer sport trac and it would not fit the seats properly terrible,36,5
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5.0,positive,bought these seat covers for my 84 toyota pickup found them to be as good as any saddle blanket seat cover available would definately recommend them for a toyota pickup,30,6
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,5.0,positive,these are the only truck blanket seat covers i could find for trucks that have bucket seats they have been on a couple of weeks and they seem like good covers the blanket part covers the seat part well,39,7
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1.0,negative,does not even come close to fitting a 2012 canyon,10,8
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1.0,negative,upon receiving this product by allison corporation do yourself a favor and forward it to your local landfill you will otherwise be compensating for it is poor craftsmanship and craft store materials,31,9
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,1.0,negative,the worst product at amazon directions were horrible do not buy unless you are looking for inferior product in every way no zipper no tie down strap no opening for arm rest each with which was described for use in installation process i feel ripped off should be negative star rating,50,10
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,2.0,negative,i put the seat cover on the seat in my truck and two days after i put them on they started coming apart in the seams would not buy again,30,11
Automotive,B0002KKI2S,4.0,positive,have not had these for very long so i can not grade them on their durability they fit reasonably well but could use a couple of more attachment straps so far although i can not complain about anything wrong with them,38,12
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,these husky liners will save your carpet and nice mats i have 3 kids in school and these have saved my interior,22,0
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,I have had these for nearly 5 months they look and perform well i think they are overpriced for what they are worth 25 for the pair not 45 plus my biggest complaint is that they emit a chemical off-gassing smell i am not sure why cheap plastic but they still give my car an off oder after nearly 5 months of use it is particularly bad on sunny days when parked car heats up avoid unless you do not mind chemically oder,81,1
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,more than adequate will protect the carpet during the winter quite well,12,2
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,these require trimming to fit so they are not completely custom but they are very easy to trim and fit our 2002 subaru legacy outback just fine the only down side and hence one star off is that there is no molded in socket for the pin which keeps the mat from sliding around i did cut one but it does not seem to hold it in position that well,69,3
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,nice mats fit well into my 2002 a4,8,4
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,these mats does not fit bmw 525i the mat is actually on thepedal it is just too wide on the drivers side and that is not safe,27,5
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,i purchased these mats to replace the ones i have had for over 10 years i purchased a new vehicle and i wanted ato match the interior the drivers side mat did not fit properly on my toyota 4 runner after cutting where indicated there was aof at least an inch between theof the mat and the side door as it was winter i could already see the floor carpet getting dirty i cut the mat further in the upper left corner to better accommodate the foot rest and the problem is resolved but it does not look right with the ridge cut away my old ones fit perfectly and i was expecting the same from the new mats,124,6
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,the floor mats are super durable and a real breeze to modify if needed to your particular car or truck,20,7
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,driver side can be cut to fit passenger side is a little to wide and can not be cut to fit so not quite custom fit,26,8
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,needs to be cut to fit look bad wanted to surprise my daughter by replacing very old carpet mats the really look so bad i may not leave them in the car,32,9
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,these are not custom fit you cut them with scissors and they sort of fit not that impressive the back ones are dual non-fitting landcruiser has a single piece go with weathertech,32,10
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,update i contacted husky about these mats and the poor fit in my toyota highlander outstanding customer service engineer admitted these are more of a general purpose mat and not specifically designed for one model of vehicle instead he shipped me the cargo liner mats which are custom molded to cover the entire floor in front of the driver and passenger the custom fit liners are far better if you drive a highlander or larger vehicle choose the custom liner and skip this mat original review i drive a 2006 highlander and was happy to see that my specific model was listed unfortunately these floor mats are anything but vehicle specific the husky website tells you that they will require trimming and even after doing so the driver side mat does not fit correctly this is a safety hazard and i strongly recommend against this product save your monay and shop elsewhere,153,11
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,weathertech makes the digital fit for the 2004 tacoma but not the double cab i bought those mats from amazon because their fit guide said it would work when they did not sit right i went to their weathertechs site and learned that they do not make the mats for the double cab truck you can submit a product request on that site and tell them you want that this mat made once there are enough requests they will make it if you are buying these mats because you do not want to spend the 100 that weathertech charges then you may be satisfied if you have ever owned the wt mats these are no where near the fit since they were 60 of the cost of the wt mats I am not disappointed,128,12
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,very very pleased in these mats and they are heavy duty and nothing flimsy about these love them and recommend them,21,13
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,they really do catch all the dirt and slush perfect fit for my car too i matched them up with the center husky liner,24,14
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,the floor mats arrived on time and in very good condition the product was a perfect fit for my car and the quality of the rubber is very good,29,15
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,mat does not fit driver side is ok not worth returning but irritating and poor service when the type and make of car are carefully specified,26,16
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,i ordered these for my suv as mine had worn out so far they are working great i do like them and would recommend them to others,27,17
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,these are not fitted mats for your bmw 3 series they need to be cut trimmed and fitted to match the contours of your vehicles floor the product discription misleads one to belive these are custom fitted mats not one word about cutting and trimming for fitment if your considering buying these mats do yourself a favor and go to your local big box auto store and buy a set of 20 dollar generic mats as these are not worth 3x the cost,83,18
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,mats were advertised to be custom fit they have to be cut down to size and do not fit at all this should have been explained in the product description,30,19
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,these are great floor mats very durable stylish and easy to wash the crud off which is a big bonus here in the midwest with the harsh winters we have i would highly recommend,34,20
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,I have had several husky heavy duty floor mats in the past i prefer the heavy duty to the hskey liners in the front as they are less slippery and thicker normally they fit great and last forever i bought this set for my 2004 tacoma double cab 1st gen the fit leaves something to be desired initially the drivers side was terrible but there are pattern lines for trimming it down after trimming with a razor it is a good fit I am not sure if this is for multiple models but i would prefer a fit out of the box the passenger side needs to be molded differently on the bottom left corner as it comes up over a bump in the floorboard colour is great match materials quality is great and I am sure they will last as long as my other huskys have just a bit disappointed in the passenger side fit it is not terrible by any means but not perfect as others have been driver side is perfect after trimming with a razor blade along the trim lines,179,21
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,after hitting someand tearing up my front fender i decided to buy these to cover the damage they worked great and fit like a glove no sweat on the tape i just used clear silicone via caulk gun to attach nothing to it one thing to note these attach behind the front running lights via screws in other words you remove your front running lights then replace atop the fender covers back to the holes the screws in the kit were just a little short and not really up to the task i went to the auto store and purchased some stainless 8 screws with plenty of length to tighten up everything these look great on the jeep i also have real diamond plate installed and the guards matches just fine,133,0
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,if you buy these you will need to trim these and take your time to make them fit correctly i had to use a dremel to shave down the sides for both sides to sit flush then i had to use a heat gun to heat them up and mold them to the fenders so they would sit right go to lowes or home depot and buy stainless steel screws the ones they provide will not work correctly you will want to use a pan head screw head size 8 and 1 long go to your local auto parts store and pick up a small roll of 3 m double sided tape has a red backing and the adhesive is a dark gray the provided tape will not be enough to hold it down right overall not a terrible product but for a 50 molded piece of plastic i would have expected it to fit better,154,1
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,the front is much easier than the back lights come out easily and the fit is pretty good i read a review that said it did not come with new screws and the ones you take out of your lights are not long enough i did not see any when looking at the parts so i went and bought some but later when cleaning up i found a little bag with 4 black screws in it and taped to another bag the parts came in never saw that laughing out loud i assume these were for that but i did the front and backs at the same time so can not swear to it again instructions would have been nice they look great,117,2
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,neat product adds to my black and white only look thre is a slight problem with the driver side guard as it doenst want to lay flat other then that I am happy with them,34,3
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,applied these per instructions the double stick tape should be a little thicker to really catch the body better so it stays put i actually added some of mine to it so it would stay product does what it is supposed to protects corners and is stylish,46,4
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,purchased body armor guards to cover some paint chips and prevent more they do that but the adhesive does not stick and really is only being held on by the parking light screws even the screw holes had to be enlarged to line up they do not lay flat on fender goodshould come up with better adhesive,57,5
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,these guards look great in the pictures but for the money they are way over priced here is a list of things that could be improved on these that i created while installing these 1 better tape I am not sure why rugged ridge skimped on the tape for these but after installing the left gard as per the instructions it literally popped off i went down to kragen and got the best 3 m tape they had and the guard fits flush just fine 2 quality control for 50 plus dollars i would consider these a disappointment the plastic was unevenly cut was thin in some areas particularly where the screrws go the mold might have been crooked because the screw holes were also a little uneven 3 heavier duty i know plastic is very strong but i was definitely disappointed with the weight and feel of the plastic as well considering the price for 20 dollars i doubt i would have said anything but for triple that and more on other websites i was pretty annoyed definitely considered returning them they do look nice once you get them on,189,6
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,way over priced for a piece of thin plastic that attaches with tape,14,7
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,looks good and easy to install had no problem with the screws that they came with but the tape is not very good quality a little too pricey but overall pretty good product,36,8

Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,look awesome on my jeep and easy to install had them both on and installed within 15 minutes,18,10
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,i just received one of two parts i just received the right side passenger,14,11
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,adhesive sucks but buy new at the store and your set gives wrangler a good look,16,12
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,cheap product double-sided adhesive is a joke i bought these to cover up the damage the old ones caused on a used jeep i recently purchased as per the previous owner i had to rivet them to the fenders just to keep it on rugged ridge clearly does not test their products and i do not know how they have stayed in business,61,13
Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,i purchased knowing the price but i was expecting a harder more heavy duty plastic instead they are a thin cheap plastic and meant to be glue to the car with 3 m tape they are not meant for performance they are meant for looks do not expect them to stick great to the body unless you are willing to drill them down left side did not fit properly i decide to return them and next time i will spend the extra money and go with the real ones,82,14
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,looks like metal with peened paint coating disappointed not as pictured not metal very cheap made go to autozone and save your money,23,0
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,does not fit the cup shown in silver in my picture even although it looks like it would my fianc said he has to put a coozie around the cup for it to fit in the cup holder he really likes the way it looks although,45,1
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,this is easily the best solution I have found to adding cup holders in my yj i had to remove the center console i was using and these fit the bill they work great fit great and look great what more can i ask,43,2
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,it works easy to mount with my jeep 1995 yj there is one problem although since i have side windows wining inside this cup prevent the window from opening i am still debating on what to do but the product is what you see and how it is advertised,49,3
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,i like theof this cup holder but it is a little specific in terms of use it was clearly designed for the type of cup in the product picture not a standard mug or something a little different in terms of shape personally i use it for a slightly different purpose than in my jeep which sadly i do not have anymore i have it attached to a cart that i use in my classroom i teach music you can check out pictures of the cup holder in action at my blog mobilemusicmansionblogspotcom,94,4
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,we have an old pu truck that is manual shift and no built in cup holder this works great even for a big gulp,24,5
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,i got these for my yj they work really well i thought that since they are plastic they might not be very sturdy they are really tough although they are really simple to put on and they are a life saver,37,6
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,very very small did not use it wast of money oh and did not come with screws either,16,7
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,it works great for most cups however i was hoping to find one that would fit my yeti cup and this one is not quite big enough,26,8
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,i mounted this to my lawnmower it lasted about 5 mows i guess the vibration of the mower was too much for the poor little guy,26,9
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,very light plastic good for a 12 oz can is about it,11,10
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,just what the jeep needed was some deep cup holders definitely recommend buying these their way better than most jeep center console cup holders tall glasses will not spill,28,11
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,disappointed in the material i think metal would be a better alternative too flimsy to hold larger drinks,18,12
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,great addition to any jeep and a easy install you can never have enough places to hold a beverage my jeep is a manual so my polerpop 44 oz would always get hit on the down shift if i was not playing attention now i do not have that problem anymore,47,13
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,wish it would have been metal as it looks in the picture but it works great for now,18,14
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,it looks a lot better in the pictures than when you open the box and pull out a flimsy plastic piece they must have changed the design from the one pictured also because it now only has 2 bolt holes if you are looking for a heavy rugged cup holder keep looking,51,15
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,worked perfectly for my 1991 jeep need to order a second one,12,16
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,cheap plastic not metal as appears in picture no factory hardware uses 2 screws to attach that the buyer supplies and only holds small bottles or cans never would recommend,30,17
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,plastic not metal like the picture shows hate it,9,18
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,glad they are plastic little snug between hard doors and the dash in my yj but no complaints would buy them again,24,19

Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,works / fits as described easy install only thing is that it is plastic but heavy plastic works well enough for me,19,24
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,did not realize this was plastic hope it holds up,9,25
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,would give it 0 stars because it does not fit the 91 jeep wrangler drivers side i installed it closed the door and the door broke it,27,26
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,the images clearly show a triangular back plate which fits all three bolts i received one with only the two top bolts also this cup holder does not fits any of my tumblers the only cup it will hold is the one depicted it is so custom it is useless,48,27
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,installed in minutes the mounting holes are slotted so installation was simple pics do not show it but the cup holders fairly well braced underneath it also has a slot to accommodate a coffee cup after installing it i drove over to mcdonalds and ordered a large coke a bigger drink than I had normally carry and the cup holder held it securely and did not flex under the weight of the cup I am comfortable that the cup holder could handle anything I had want to carry in it,83,28
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,decent looking blocks the vent window and will not accept most large drinks but looks decent and fits most things too bad it is plastic not metal but price does reflect that would buy again,33,29
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,was not like the picture i am afraid it will break,10,30
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,unfortunately the bottom part of the cup holder size was not large enough to fit a typical stainless steel coffee mug contigo 14 oz with 2875 in diameter the bubba brand mug i have fit about 025 in in the bottom opening but i do not use that mug much and forget about a yeti while all mugs fit in the upper portion in most cases it was too wide and not tall enough for me to trust it would maintain a mug securely especially while driving the diameter of the smallest opening of the holder is 275 in and the largest / upper portion diameter is 34375 in,105,31
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,the cupholder is a great design but engineering fail in the use of plastic i bought two and one broke within a week the other is still holding on but because of the brittleness of the plastic poor reinforcement for the cupholder to prevent breakage due to vibration i do not think it is going to last much longer i will be building my own using these as a template out of aluminum,71,32
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,i asked questions on this product cheap cheap cheap plastic i was told by ryan manufacturer it was metal not plastic please refund,24,33
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,plastic cup holder do not know how long it is going to last besides shipped as a single cup holder so i needed to order another one,25,34
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,i bought these after reading all the reviews these are great for water bottles soda cans and starbucks cups i have not had any problems with them bought a second one for passenger side no problems with spilling,37,35
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,pretty sturdy easy to install seems to do the trick looks alright too,11,36
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,was made of cheap plasic and did not look like the picture only had two mounting holes and snapped when my x large tea from thestation was placed in it and went over a speed bump crack,38,37
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,received not as pictured would not work for me,9,38
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,wish these came in aluminium as the plastic is kinda flimsy with larger drinks also wish this was slightly bigger as drinks like route 44s from sonic do not fit at all,32,39
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,work perfectly can hold a large cup without any problems after getting coffee all on the inside of my windshield and down my left left on the first bump although i recommend always keeping it covered,36,40
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,do not expect to receive the same product like the one in the picture what you are getting instead is a really cheap drink holder with only 2 screws instead of 3,30,41
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,good utility to hold cups long-term use the jury is still out looks good and fits perfectly,17,42
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,just wish it was metal the plastic flexes alot,9,43
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,the picture shows a cup holder that mounts to all 3 screws and it looks metal the one you get will only mount to the top screws and it will be flimsy plastic,33,44
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,not what i expected looking for a rigid heavy duty cupholder for my truck this is a flimsy plastic wannabe,20,45
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,it hold cups but i was under the impression there was a place to put it really no where on a 79 cj5 dash without blocking something maybe put on the roll bar in the back,36,46
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,works well i actually thought it would be more heavy duty and for some reason i thought it looked like powder coated steel it is not it is just plastic i have it mounted in my cat skidsteer and it has been holding up to the jarring abuse so far and it does the job,53,47
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,will work fine but will break if misused it is plastic,11,48
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,very low quality plasticdoes not look like the photo very misleading,13,49
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,what a piece of junk not as pictured and made of plastic,12,50
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,does not properly fit an 85 cj7 jeep,8,51
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,i did not read the description well at all but this is the best looking faux metal cup holder made if only they spent the time to make it out of sheet metal instead also the picture shows 3 mounting holes instead the one i received only has 2 plastic things like this do not belong on jeeps,56,52
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,not for newer jeeps apparently which lack screw areas to install so not for jks i have 2014 wrangler can still install using a bolthole from passenger grab bar just one screw about 1 inch sheet metal type if tight enough this one screw will secure cupholder pretty well holder just ok plastic with significant flex or bounce no top on the drink you will be wearing the drink ps manufacturer does specify fits earlier jeep but i do not think amazon does,83,53
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,i think it is awesome works great it is fairly strong so it can hold a heavy drink,16,54
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,love this gives me somewhere to put my drinks in my cj not so sure if it would hold a 40 oz beer but it shall hold a 12 oz like gold,29,55
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,who ever came up with this design my hats off to no more coffee cup flipping out of the cup holder of jeep center console if you own a jeep you know what I am talking about,36,56
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,does not fit a jeep cj-7 would require removal of dashboard,11,57
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,I have already bought 4 of these for my jeeps looks good easy to install a,15,58
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,look at it then make you own that fits your container,11,59
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,i really wanted to like these but they are really just too small to fit most cups into a can or water bottle fit fine but big fast food cups do not,32,60
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,bought a second one for my cj7 works great,8,61
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,if you are in a jeep and your suspension is a bit stiff like mine i would not recommend purchasing this little guy it seems convenient upon first glance and it is quite cheaper than purchasing a center console although the material is quite flexible and bends with every bump thus giving any drink without a lid a small chance of success for surviving the journey of say driving to work,69,62
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,would be cool but it does not work if you have your dash pad I shall take my hula girl over a cup holder any day,24,63
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,i should have read the reviews i assumed it was metal since it is designed for a jeep the two mounting holes do not fit in an 87 yj the doors will not close when they are actually on i only gave two stars as i thought it looked cool with the rhino liner style plastic,53,64
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,i love it installed in my tool box works great,10,65
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,works great to have a cup holder in a jeep,9,66
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,very cheap plastic that blocks the wing window on the hard doors since it is plastic it vibrates so much that my coffee will jump out of the cup going down the road great concept terrible execution,38,67
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,we installed two rugged ridge cup holders in our vehicle with ease we have found cups that fit tight and we have not had any spills,26,68
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,nowhy anyone would complain after buying these es they only have two mounting holes instead of the three shown but the two hold just fine it is ruggedized plastic which it says in the description and they have ridges under the arm to help make them more sturdy unless your trying to carry excessive weight in them they will last pretty good for a cheap cup holder,69,69
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,this is a cheep flimsy plastic product rugged ridge should be ashamed to put there name on this it will break so easy do not buy unless you like buying junk,31,70
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,they show a picture of a cup holder with the cup holder above the three 3 screws holding the cup holder what i get in the mail is a cup holder which is even with the screws of which there are only two 2 screws holding the holder not what i ordered it is not stable with only two screws i guess that is why they show a 3 screw model which is what i ordered,74,71
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,fits both sides of my cj7 perfect works with all different size cups nicely happy with the product great cup holder alternative to an expensive console,26,72
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,4.0,positive,i was a little let down that this was not metal but it works great just the same i put in in my 95 jeep and it has been great to finally have a cup holder,36,73
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,this cup holder fullfilled my expectatives the material is not metal but it is not nessesary as accomplish with my necessity keep the beer save jaja,26,74
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,the picture of theshown is what i wanted but received a similar but differentwhich will not work i am disappointed but hopefully will find a use for it,31,75
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,1.0,negative,i purchased for installation on a dozer it was fairly expensive and is thin plastic i am not sure it will hold up,23,76
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,easy to install and very durable would buy again for any jeep you can tell it would last for a very long time also it arrived very fast,28,77
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,this is a greatbut with it installed you can no longer open the wing window it is kind of a bummer because i use the window quite a bit i am going to mount it using some self tapping screws away from the window so i can use them both at the same time,55,78
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2.0,negative,these exact holders used to be made from metal i wish I had seen they cheapened the product and now make them from plastic i assume that one will break within the year i have low expectations which is too bad because a couple friends have the exact one except made from metal and they are pretty much indestructible these plastic ones are not,63,79
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,5.0,positive,does not hold a lot of weight but it supports at least a soda / beer can easily so what can you say other than it is a cup holder that works in a yj well,33,80
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,installed bright he shall yes no doubt crisp white / blue tint light he shall no you can see by the pics below make sure your headlight housing and wiring can withstand the extra heat generated by these 100 watt monsters this is my second pair of 100 watt halogens I have bought to try and match the main outside headlights which are 6000k leds not even close nice price tho if you are just looking for more light and do not forget about heat generated if you have to run these long periods of time make sure your electrical system can handle the extra power draw,98,0
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,they do not look bright white they actually look like the cheep blue head lights you see kids rolling around with they are supposed to be brighter than stock head lamps but they are actually dimmer and annoyingly blue,38,1
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,much better output over stock bulbs cool white light so far so good,13,2
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,they are not really for off road only they are a s,12,3
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,actually received my order quickly fit perfectly also they look very nice and i could notice the difference in my lighting,21,4
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,they work good bright light exactly what i needed for my truck,12,5
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,it was not the xenon whitethat i was hoping for if anything it performs just as good as regular halogen bulbs giving it 4/5 because the price is relatively cheap compared to other gimicky bulbs,36,6
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,i bought these to replace my stock high beam lamps they are not even distinguishable when turned on i had to stop my car and get out to see if they were indeed lit thedoes look to be whiter than the stock ones when looking at them however the lumens are simply not there do not waste your time,60,7
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,about same brightness as regular bulb but has whiter appearance,10,8
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,I shall start by explaining that i have a 2009 toyota corolla and was looking to upgrade to an hid system these cars have two sets of headlights there is a dedicated low beam set and a driving / high beam set i got the low beam switched out pretty easy with 9006 8000k single beam hid system i looked up the type of bulb for the driving high beam set and it was 9005 so i ordered a 9005 hid system thinking it would be an easy swap like the low beams nope after installing that system they flickered and did not get bright for the high beams after further investigation i discovered that toyota is using a voltage change to achieve the difference in brightness obviously this will not work for hid so then i decided to find a white as possible halogen bulb well when i got these bulbs i was under the impression that they would be whiter and or brighter than stock do not let the blueof the bulbs fool you they not only do not shine blue they do not even act like they are closer to cool white than stock now they are brighter but not whiter kinda disappointed,201,9
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,these did not change the brightness of the drl or high beam theis ugly yellow my drl is still factory yellowdo not waste your money,28,10
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,great colour blue light is pretty white installed on a forester xt 2009 they are 9005 hb3 light bulbs but do not fit in the stock light fixture took me a while to figure it out it is because of the o-ring which was too big i took the o-ring off the old bulbs and put them on the new ones they fit right in now 1 star off for that would have been more if i did not solve it did not expect this from a hella product thought a standard was a standard will update if they fail but a decent priced product just remember my little hack if they do not fit do not touch the bulb as well,116,11
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,when i saw it was for off road i returned it,11,12
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,20 times better than my old bulbs super bright super white going to buy a set for my dad,19,13
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,these are great high beam bulbs however because the glass on the outside is a distinctive blueyour headlight lenses will reflect this when the car is in direct sunlight not a big deal although,36,14
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,these are very bright being 100w fit my 06 si perfect and are a very bright drl and high beam light,21,15
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,not any brighter than the stock bulbs disappointed that 100w is not brighter than the 65w bulbs,17,16
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,they work make sure you check your local laws,9,17
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,do not fit prongs are too big tried these on 2 different cars with same bulb size,14,18
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,these did fit my car they did not pop up any error codes the lightis nice and clean white with the faintest hint of light blue however light output was really poor as these are for my drl and highbeams I had say they do great as drl but damn if the highbeam was just a poor amount of light output against the factory yellowish halogens,67,19
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,can not really write a review as although the amazon system said they fit my car 1996 e36 bmw they do not,20,20
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,nothing about the bulbs output is white they are incredibly dim to the point that they are useless what has even worse is that these 9005 bulbs do not fit into my vehicles 9005 slot in order to get it in i had to unscrew the slot and essentially screw the bulb in place seriously do not waste money,59,21
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,bulbs worked great with no issues came quickly in a sealed box have no issues i can ever talk about,20,22
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,they are not the blue that you are expecting but that was not why i really puchased them they are substantially brighter than the stock bulb which is all i really cared about very white bright light and still burning bright good buy,43,23
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,i know you usual get what you pay for but was optimistic about theseis barely whiter than stock bulbs if you want bulbs to match hid headlights you will be disappointed,33,24
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,not work say they are and are not white light is the same standard is light yellow light not buy this product,22,25
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,excellent product these bulbs perform as well as the factory hid xenon headlights on my 2005 corvette the low beams outperform most other so called high performance bulb for the high beams i would not hesitate to recommend these high quality bulbs to everyone who wants to see farther down the road those who have,56,26
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,i bought these from ebay due to lower price they are much better than phillips and any other brand and about the 100w it is ok but i do not think they would last much,33,27
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,product code correct to what i needed but did not fit lighting plugs when i attempted to install thewas said to be compatible with my vehicle,28,28
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,compared to the stock bulb these hellas make them look like a house light they have that cool coloring and are the brightest lights I have seen,26,29
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,i got these to closely match my 4300k hid kit these are bright im still using the stock wiring harness but it is ok because i do not really use my brights for more than 5 mins anyways i will be upgrading my harness soon although to prevent anything from getting too hot since these are 100 w bulbs,57,30
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,1.0,negative,these are not very bright and one of the bulbs seems to only be at half bright only i know it is not the wiring or such because the old bulbs were equal in light output i v had these for almost one month and i feel they will not last will not be buying these again,55,31
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,4.0,positive,you have to considerer for what do you want this only work for the high light,20,32
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,i bought this for my is300 for the drl and i tried everything it did not fit into the socket like the original ones i wanted this to give my car a true bluebut it did not i do not recommend these bulbs if you want to have blue lights,51,33
Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,halogen lights will always be yellowish tried sylvania ultra 4100k and piaa xtreme 4100k these are very bright they may look white if you are staring directly at the blazing bulb but the light cast on the road is distintively a halogen yellow if you have an hid low-beam but do not want a yellow high-beam then this is a good light used on a 2001 x4 with factory 4300k hid the bulb has a royal blue bulb that changes the yellow to a white light about 5000k just barely a hint of blue compared to the factory hid any halogen that attempts to change thetowards hid will compromise brightness this was acceptable to me since i rarely use my high-beam to flash other drivers,126,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,bought this for my central ac unit outside that had a lot of mashed spots there were no instructions on how to use this or put it together so i had to youtube it it looked easy the way the guy just combed through the fins but when you actually go to do this unless your fins are only slightly askew you are going to get stuck i ended up just sitting there using the comb for over an hour on the spots and eventually noticed that the individual combs started to break or get bent it is plastic and not very sturdy plastic at that after losing 3 prongs i just ended up getting a small thin blade and using the flat side to coax the dents out worked better than this fin straightener pros well it works for a bit cons cheap plastic bottom line if the fins you are trying to fix are only slightly out of shape then this would be easy to use but if you got some big dents and a lot of them you should look for one that has metal prongs or just get thin sturdy blade and spend a bit more time and patience,199,0
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,this tool arrived in new package and very handy for straightening those bent fins on my air conditioner could not find this product in stores,25,1
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i actually bought this to straighten the fins on my carrier air conditioner unfortuantely the packaging says it is for radiators and i attempted to use all 6 sides on my air conditioner and none of them fit,37,2
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,so this does what it is supposed to and seems well enough made i was able to straighten my radiator and condenser fins on my car with it so it does work,31,3
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,i was doing some maintenance on my home ac unit and discovered that some of the fins on the unit were pushed in thus blocking some of the air flow this little gadget easily opened them back up in a matter of minutes,43,4
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the comb at least the 15 vanes per inch part of the tool is not very durable at all within a few minutes of use the teeth began to break off making it all but useless i was not even able to complete one of my 2 condenser units,49,5
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,honestly could not fit the tool in my outside ac unit at all would not recommend,15,6
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,what a life saver efficient and do not see how i did not have this tool before,17,7
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,i have tried using this on central air unit and a car and it does do a very good job on either i end up using a screwdriver and be very careful and very patient,35,8
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,never have my fins been so evenly spaced laughing out loud,9,9
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,this worked fine on my rv a / c for about half the job as others have commented the teeth break off way to readily i got enough done using both the correct size and one larger when that one was toothless i small fraction of the cost a repair guy would charge I am sure if i were to buy one again i might research one with metal teeth it did work easily while it lasted my fist time trying this at the price i guess i can always buy 2 - 3 and consider them disposable,93,10
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,keeps unscrewing while i am trying to use it very difficult to use,13,11
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,used on old radiator to straighten fin slow process but gets the job done,15,12
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,i got this today and with all the sizes available there was none for my airconditioner i threw it out,20,13
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,bought this to straighten the fins on a window unit that got hit by a hail storm comes with 6 different fin spacing sizes to fit different cooling fins unfortunately not of them fit mine so it was worthless shoved it in the toolbox drawer and never touched it again,50,14
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,plastic teeth were too thick and not deep enough it was frustratingly clumsy to use i finally gave up and had better luck finishing the straightening job just using a small flathead screw driver that meant i was going row by row instead of being able to do a bunch of rows at a time so it took forever but at least that way the end result was perfect,69,15
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,ok for minor repairs i have some hail damage to my a / c fins and this worked ok to straighten them out at first but due to the large area of damage the tool plastic became bent and stopped working before i could finish the job this product is designed to straighten 8 9 10 12 14 or 15 fins per inch needs to be a more durable material,68,16
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,very nice device works well and is reasonable priced,9,17
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,as this was a replacement for a lost tool it matched perfectly,12,18
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,i suppose this worked about as good as could be expected but it did not get the job done before the the teeth started breaking the condenser on my air conditioner has about 15 fins per inch and they were flattened by hail about the only method that seems to work is picking them back up one by one with a grapefruit knife,62,19
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,works well for a variety of radiators and some condensers but older radiators and condensers have fin counts which do not fit the provided combs,25,20
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,unfortunately it does not exactly fit most of the gauges on my condensers i bought this to improve the air flow of my window air conditioner units probably not really the fault of the product I had lay more blame on the a / c mfg a decently made product for a difficult job,50,21
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,this tool just filled the bill for straighting out condenser fins as it has many different sizes for the bill and i have been able to use it more than a few times and it keeps on working,38,22
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,do not waste your money it was totally broken in less than 5 mminutes very poor product should be removed from this site,23,23
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,the fin straightener does do the job i did not anticipate the fins being so deeply bent and going deep is an art that I shall perfect with the straightener soon,29,24
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,none of the combs seemed to fit the fins i had to straighten does not feel well made would buy a different brand / style next time,24,25
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,did not work i do not think i can send it back now but will be more careful with other purchases in the future,22,26
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,a couple of old window ac units given to me had dented fins this straightened them out so they run more efficient,22,27
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,does not have a smaller separation setting for most a / c fins the insertion end could be more pointed to ease getting in between the fins handle angle is awkard when trying to straightened the fins,35,28
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,as other reviews does not fit and i measured really not sure what to do with it now wondering if they will take it back,24,29
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,does what we bought it for it is light weight and very compact it is perfect for our rv air conditioner,21,30
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i bought this tool because the fins on my a / c were completely bent and mangled it was starting to affect the performance of my unit i was quoted several hundred dollars to get this fixed by a professional instead i picked up this tool it does support several different units since it has heads for different numbers of fins per inch i was able to use this tool and spend about 30 minutes to fix the fins on my unit i am rating this only four stars because this is not the best quality for only a few uses it is wonderful but a professional would never want to use this tool because i could not imagine it lasting with that much abuse,122,31
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,during the first minute of use the fins in the 12 broke off poorly made plastic fins are too brittle,20,32
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the fins on this little tool do not fit with any of the fins on either my window air conditioner or the central air conditioner which got damaged during a recent hail storm so I am back to square one i found success by using a razor knife which is a tedious process although I had return it but after the postage my refund would not make it worth it so I shall just put it with all the other tools i have have no use for it does not come with instructions which was disappointing even if it is supposed to be obvious what a guys supposed to do,103,33
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,i have four different-sized window ac units and none of the sizes on the tool fit the fins on any of them i have noif it works or not it is too much of a hassle to send it back to amazon so for me the tool was a waste of money i wished i had bought this tool from a local store so i could just return it i guess you live and learn,76,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,one of the tines on the 15 side is bent making it nearly impossible to insert into the radiator grill,20,35
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,the white plastic part has way too many irregularities i was not able to straighten out my ac condenser it is easier to take a knife and run it down the condenser and straighten out the fins,36,36
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,this tool is destined for the finest garbage pails you can find it does not work it is flimsy and i think a rubics cube is easier to figure out if anyone knows how to use this thing effectively I had like to nominate you for president of the known universe,48,37
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,this tool works but you might want to buy 3 or 4 of them since the plastic teeth break after a few pulls through the fins i had to resort to dragging the tool sideways across the bent fins to straighten them after a few of the teeth broke a tool like this with either high-impact plastic or metal teeth would work much better if it helps i have a coleman-evcon heat pump / ac unit and the 14 count teeth worked well on my fins until they broke of course,89,38
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,anazon is a good place to buy this tool is almost useless for what it is made for there has to be a better tool for this,27,39
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,after getting a little carried away with the power washer i was forced to buy one of these worked well for all but the verywhere our ac unit has a 1 inch metal frame that got in the way of the tool,44,40
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,i used this on a very large 4 x 3 refrigeration condenser which every square inch had been severely damaged by hail the entire job took me a good 5 hours and required a great deal of patience and a little wd-40 this little tool worked beautifully and proved itself tough and versatile not one tooth on this tool was damaged or broken thanks to this little tool my refrigeration unit has been completely restored saving me a tremendous amount of money for replacement,84,41
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,great price and made with quality red handle the white plastic comb is not made to specs the comb teeth are spaced right but the comb teeth are too wide you will have to use sandpaper to make this product work i also had three of the six combs with another problem the teeth of these combs were either bent too far outward or inward and there was no way to correct the problem i think it is a great design but maybe if it was made with a better process and too more ridged specs it could be worth the money and the time if you need anlike this keep searching for a better made product,118,42
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,i have a whirlpool window unit that is about five years old this worked just great for it i need to try it on my other unit now but i was impressed with the simplicity the only reason i do not give it five stars is because the plastic tines look they will not have much longevity very happy with this purchase,60,43
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,unfortunately this would not straighten out the fins on my a / c unit i just could not get any section to fit well built and nicely priced if you can get it to work,32,44
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,this did not work for my air conditioner before ordering this product get a ruler and measure how many fins per inch on your unit this product is designed to straighten them if they are 8 9 10 12 14 or 15 fins per inch mines 20,45,45
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,it just took me a few minutes to perfect my technique using this tool and after that my air conditioner fins look like new again i wish i could measure the efficiency improvement but by looks alone it is 100 better,41,46
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i love this seat cover comfortable and feels great on my back get yours now,15,0
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i have it for both my car and my office they work great and the beads increase circulation which increases male performance after the car has been sitting in the sun all day the seats cool off faster than the steering wheel no need for expensive ventilated seats like amerigon my back and behind are less sweaty the beads also relieve my back pain in the office i get laughed at but it is better than having a loud desk fan to cool you off and my shirts are sweat stain free i wish they made this in black or dark brown because the lightdoes not match my seats,110,1
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,not happy with the product after using the seat for two days the seams came apart after contacting the company i received a full refund without having to return the,31,2

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i have a large leather chair for work i spend most of the day in front of two computers so when the temperatures in southern california go up the leather ceases to be comfortable for me so i purchase this seat from amazon i have used it everyday for the last 2 months and it is very comfortable infact I am sitting on it now quality seems good so far i do not expect to have to replace it for quite a while,82,5
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i was worried the first time i tried this beaded seat cover it was stiff and hard after fifteen minutes it became uncomfortable but like new pair of shoes it is very comfortable after being broke in it keeps my back from sweating so much and feels nice to sit on one thing the band to hold the back to the seat is just barely big enough to go around my seat i do not have anything to hook the loops on the bottom part to but that is not a problem for me i think i would work well enough just sitting unsecured in the seat it is solidly constructed I am 200lbs and have been driving on it for two weeks and can not see any signs of wear or breakage update i use these in the summer time they stay in the back seat during the winter after two summers of sitting on one it fell apart i noticed it tearing one day and a week later it was falling apart all over,171,6

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i love bead seats used them since the 70s when i heard that cab drivers in new york city used them the seat part more important than the back rest at least for me my dogs tore up the back anyway beads are sewed on well i guess because have not lost a bead yet car mfrs do not seem to use a variety of bums to design seats so we have to find something to make them fit our bums better,77,8
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,did not work for my husband in his truck seat he just threw it away,16,9
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,these seemed like a great thing and were cooling to sit upon however the rattan is made of some material possibly nylon that breaks down extremely quickly in our intense southern sun within a few weeks my covers were disintegrating into flakes of beige plastic that infested my car in a huge mess and the covers lost any use as they fell apart i do not recommend these unless you just need something like it for a short car vacation,79,10

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,summer in florida can be pretty hot these will at least keep a bit of air running between you and the seats these used to be all the rage before the days of a / c but none of the auto supply stores carry them any more,45,26

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,this seat cover only has on strap that goes over the top part of the seat so the bottom cushion that you are sitting on moves very easily since there is nothing holding it in place or to keep it stable when you go to sit on it it is going to move out of place,55,38
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,it is not as good as the ones I have owned previously the edges curl the beaded portion does the job if i do not get too frustrated with the curling,29,39

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,the seat cover is fine it does not have the wire insides which after time pokes you in the back the beads are great the only problem is the borders they should be firmer they fold over when you get in the car your leg will catch theafter you are in it is necessary to straighten it out,58,44
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,the product is okay although i expected it to be of better quality well it appears to be cheap as in this looks like it will get ruined in just a short period of time laughing out loud,34,45

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,this seat has to very significant problems first it is too small for the seat on a chrysler seabring convertible which is pretty remarkable considering the chrysler has an average size car seat second the back strap that is supposed to hold it on to the seat back broke after the third time it was used in the car it rips right at the sewing seam on the attachment point on the side of the seat cover it general is of flimsy poor construction i would definitely not recommend this product and i plan to return it stay away from this one,102,50
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,it keeps my back from sweating in the hot summer here in texas but it curls up in the seat when i get in my vehicle the manufacturer should have put tie strings,33,51
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,i was dissapointed when i unpacked the seat covers for the money i paid for them they are very fragile i already had some beaded seat covers in my car but i wanted to replace them since they slowly started to fray but they were in my car for several years and it was expected these seat covers will not last long judging from the material they are made of,69,52
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,this seat cover is made well it seems durable but it does not put enough space between your seat and you so expect to sweat when using this,27,53

Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,hope they hold up as long as our last pair we love them specially in the summer when the last pair did wear out the beads still stayed in place it was the outer mesh that got worn down from getting in and out so much also you do not even have to use the elastics to hold them in place if you do not want to,65,56
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,the wire surround on the seat is very uncomfortable and cuts off the circulation in my legs would be further off paying more for better quality product,27,57
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i got this because i am trying to protect the seat in my car from sweat after i go to the gym if there was some way to secure it to the seat it would work great it only comes with an elastic band that wraps around the back of the seat and it gets stretched out and moved every time i sit down either cutting into the backs of my knees or blocking the seat belt,77,58
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i am very pleased that bought it I am glad that the quality is excellent and all the normal love it,20,59
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i needed a simple seat for my car that would allow air to flow around my back and seat I have tried others one year later this one is still intact and working fine the strap to hold it to the seat busted a few months ago but that was the weakest part and i expected it otherwise no sign of the main part of this seat falling apart it is good to go,72,60
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,thisis was not worth my time or money true it was inexpensive but this thing will not stay in place on the driver sear of a civic and it is too light-weight to do much in the way of adding comfort it is like putting tissue over the seat on day one one of the wooden balls that you sit on cracked not recommended at any price,68,61
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i bought 2 one for each car the price is good and they did what i wanted which is to keep my back cool only problem is they do not fasten well on the car seats over time the nylon strings got strained and some started breaking in about a years time but still functional i think i got my moneys worth,62,62

Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,the seat was uncomfortable mainly because it could not be secured in place and did not fit my car seat i took it out,24,66
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,these are exactly what they look like beaded car seat covers that are ticky tacky and crappy however that is exactly what i wanted a low cost comfortable way to sit in my car I am happy with the purchase but beware these are not a high endcomfort does not have to be high end,55,67
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,i have trouble with my legs going to sleep on long trips so far I have used this beaded seat cover on two trips involving all-day driving each way and have had no problems with my legs the beaded surface takes a little getting used to but after the first 20 - 30 minutes of driving it actually became quite comfortable the seat cover slides around on the seat making it a little awkward getting in and out of the car but that is the only problem i experienced some have complained about poor construction but so far i have had no problems i would buy thisagain,106,68
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,buying this cover was my big mistake it has fallen apart apporximately one month after installing the previous cover was similiar and last for only 3 months,27,69
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,another hot day and I am sitting on my bead and rattan cool seat cover sadly it does not provide the relief I had hoped for it is just not that comfortable or cool it is better than no cover at all but not by a lot also as other reviewers who i bought in spite of reported the fising line that the beads are strung on is after a couple of weeks starting to come loose I am now in the market for another seatcover for my overly-warm desk chair,83,70
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i was looking for a relatively inexpensive beaded seat cover that would allow me to scoot in and out of the drivers seat easier i just bought a new vehicle that has cloth seats and i found it somewhat cumbersome to slide in and out of the drivers seat I have been using this seat cover for about a month now and i have no complaints about it it is durable and comfortable and fits on any sized car seat i would recommend it,82,71
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,first off amazon packed this thing in a massive sized box so when my skybox had to ship this to the caribbean everything cost me 300 us secondly it came apart in 9 days it was also way to small and never covered any part of the chair more like 50 do not let the size on the pic fool you this thing is for a child rubbish,67,72
Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,i have not experienced anything wrong with it,9,73
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i bought these seat-covers hoping to avoid the summer unpleasantness of sitting on my cars original vinyl seats after about 1 months use the woven edging surrounding the beads began to deteriorate and she had pieces everywhere i swapped passenger driver covers and made it through the summer before the second one similarly deteriorated she had and generally fell apart only the outer surrounding wovenfell apart not the center bead area previously i had used the larger bead-only covers and they lasted several years until the fishing-line string for the bead began breaking i had hoped for longer life from these covers I am a pretty careful person and at 60 and 175lbs i do not think I am oversize for this product on the plus side they did provide relief from the summer vinyl-stickiness however both my covers are in the trash just a few short months after purchase thumbs down for this product,155,74
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,this peice of trash started unraveling within 2 weeks of sitting on it in my office the fishing tackle they use to hold the beads together is already separating from the frame of the chair do not waste your money this thing is cheap junk,44,75
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,the quality of thisis extreamly poor i have 3 of them that are falling apart after 30 days use in 2 different cars the metal on the rim is all bent out of shape the fish line on the beads is coming apart the fish line is sticking me in the back the construction of thisis poor if i could return all 3 and get a refund i would i can not recommend thisto anyone,80,76
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,very comfortable my previous seat lasted for more than 5 years they wear out eventually because you sit and move on them i bought 2 one for each car,29,77
Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,have used a beaded seat for years helps with back ache can not find them in local stores anymore so decided to check out amazon the rattan seat still will not conform to my seat and have used it for more than a month still feels stiff and hard to adjust so I shall pass on to my daughter plan to order one that has material around the edges this is the type I have always used so lesson learned,77,78
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,i purchased this product a week ago i am in the heating and cooling industry in and out of the van all the time also i travel all the time from customer to customer do not purchase this cover it is falling apart after a week in use the fishing line that holds the beads together is poorly woven the beads are separating from the line,64,79
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,classic and elegant describes this accoutrement to comfortable seating allowing ventilation of what was once a hot leather office chair it transforms the office chair into a vintage antique work of art the blond beads contrast with the black leather background and evoke a celebration of days gone by the caning and stitching are impeccable originally purchased with theof detaching the seat from the back i decided to leave it intact to allow even greater comfort and ease of movement i did not notice or find that there is an elastic strap to hold it to the back of the chair until days later with all due apologies to j peterman,112,80
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,worked fine on my 2000 4runner my recommendations use the clamp method 2 shop clamps not too tight low pressure only need to pump to 5 psi do not put brake fluid in the bleeder use it for pressure only remove old fluid from mc refill install adapter pump to 5 psi adjust as required to hold pressure bleed brake furtherest from mc rear pass side use care not to completely drain mc break seal refill mc and repeat took 30 mins to do all 4 wheels taking my timedid not spill a drop when i did this job 1 year ago i put brake fluid in the bleeder and it leaked at the mc despite passing an initial pressurecheck i also have a 2005 miata for which i have the correct mc adapter threaded even so i prefer to just use the bleeder as a pressure source and continually add brake fluid to the mc as i work my way around the vehicle added benefit no clean up of bleeder required update 2 - 2 - 2018 built this rig and now use it with the power bleeder see pic this works way better holds pressure no leaks again just using as a pressure source 5 - 10 psig i depressurize and refill for each wheel quick and efficient keep level above low level in your mc,203,0
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,first things first get rid of that j hook and chain if you want to keep your sanity if it was not for a reviewer who posted he used clamps instead of the hardware that came with this i would have literally thrown this out no joke the seal just would not happen on a 1999 toyota corolla to even allow proper pressures to hold and it required all this fiddling and screwing for nothing i guess i just could not believe the manufacturer who sells an otherwise excellent product would include something that would not work with that out the way i went to my local hf store picked up 2 inexpensive clamps and man i was amazed at how well it turned out it even seals better than my 1107 requires little fine tune turns to seal does the only downside to using the clamps is not having clearance around the mc to use the clamps but if you do the go for it,162,1
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,this has to be the biggest pos i have run into in a long time no matter what i did it leaked and leaked i removed and cleaned several times tried every position and placement imaginable and when i was done had a puddle under my car and brake fluid all over everything in between suspension a complete waste i will be returning this for sure,66,2
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,the picture shows a male and female hose fitting along with two hose clamps those are not included with the 1101 adapter that i received you must have the two fittings to be able to cut your existing powerbleeder hose then be able to use both your existing adapter and the universal adapter 1101 the powerbleeder does not have a compatible fitting that this will connect to,66,3
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,works well as long as there is a decent flat portion of the body of the master cylinder to hook a chain underneath you will also need space above the master cylinder cap to place this on top tighten it a lot or you will get a slow unnoticeable stream of brake fluid running out of it i noticed by the pool of brake fluid underneath the car then had to crank the wing bolts another 4 - 5 rotations each worked great on 2010 honda fit did not work at all on 2012 camry due to the cap-side of the master cylinder slanting upward meaning the chain would slide right off during tightening this is not the adapters fault I am not sure i could get any adapter to work on that darn thing instead i used a pneumatic air bleeder which works but it is waaaay slower but again it works pneumatic air bleeders do not work on all cars because they do not create a lot of suction pressure,166,4
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this worked excellent to bleed the master cylinder on my toyota mr2,12,5
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,works better than expected use it a a dealership one man job,12,6
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,anything other than a factory fit cap adapter willi have the metal cover with the chains pure torture to use it may feel like it is tight so when you pump it up and start working you see fluid leaking down because the pressureis allowing the fluid to fill too much then brake fluid starts to run out of theyou can get a replacement cap and make your own adapter or pay for theirs,79,7
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,to be fair I have had the motive power bleeder for 10 years without issue however honda and acura among others have to do things a little differently including the caps to their brake reservoirs unfortunately this catch-all solution did not acommodate hondas design flaw imho and i opted for a mityvac-style bleeder instead motive is still my top choice for our other cars,62,8
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,this thing is terrible to use iimpossible to get a good seal on the opening of the mc reservoir i had fluid all over the engine bay and the garage floor i did the set up and tested under pressure without fluid as per the instructions held 15 psi for a minute but about halfway through the job it started spraying fluid all over the place then to add insult to injury when i removed it the tapered seal fell down into the fender and is stuck for life or unless i decide to disassemble the fender off the car i have their machined aluminum caps for my other cars and they work great,114,9
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,will not fit a gen 5 camaro no way,9,10
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,supposed to work on honda but does not work for 2012 crv the ears on the cap are too big and do not allow it to sit on the opening of the reservoir,32,11
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,I am sure with some braking systems this might be a great solution however on my 2005 gx470 there was no way to effectively route the chain beneath the master cylinder without risking interfering with damaging the electronics that are proprietary to the cylinder in the end i had to do it the old-fashioned way have someone press the pedal while i opened the bleeder valve rinse and repeat at least the rear calipers have a brake booster those were a cinch,81,12
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,great concept that is why the 2 stars but tighter than he shall even after i seated it properly and tightening it it still leaked out making a mess want my money back for this and the pump bottle,37,13
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,it works for 2011 rx 350 finally i removed the metal bracket of the brake fluid reservoir and drill a holes on the left side to install a 8 screw which stops the chain to slip out of the bracket during tight the j bolts of the the adapter i add the brake fluid to the reservoir and use motive to pump 10 - 12 pis air for the process wish motive make a better adapter for lexus / toyota without chains and j bolts,81,14
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,unless your master cylinder is completely flat directly under the cap this adapter will not work bought it for my wifes es350 which this is listed as compatible and there is no room to wrap the chain around I have been using motive bleeder for years but this is the first universal adapter I have bought it is not motives fault that toyota use a oddly shaped master cylinder but they should not have listed this as compatible with the es350,77,15
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,universal fit for different size cylinders and does not,10,16
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,the adapter appears to be well made but was larger than i anticipated and did not fit my subaru clutch master cylinder so i was unable to use it,29,17
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,it does not fit the toyota sienna as claimed,9,18
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,used this to do a brake bleed on my 2002 mitsubishi eclipse worked great make sure you do not tighten down too much or it will bow and break the seal definitely worth the price for the add on to an already great system,44,19
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,work great i added a quick disconnect and now it is even easier to use,14,20
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,have attempted many times to use this product and have yet to have it seal well enough that i can actually pressurize the system and bleed the brakes,28,21
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,worked amazingly well unsure why so many have issues with the chain and j hooks sealed fine for me with no issues what so ever i have a suspicion the complaints come from those that are over tightening the wing nuts it takes very little tightening sorry some people should leave vehicle repairs to actual mechanics,56,22
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,do not waste your money poorly designed buy a replacement cap and fitting and make your own cheaper and more effective then this product extremely disappointed i have a european car as well that they make a direct fit cap for and it works great did not expect their other products to perform so poorly,54,23
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,worked well on my old toyota supra the plastic adapter plate and rubber gasket are thick they are able to withstand a reasonable amount of clamping pressure without warping it helps to use some silicone or synthetic-based grease on both faces of the rubber gasket to maintain a good seal i was able to achieve up to 15 psi without any issues the chain and j-hook clamp can be a bit fiddly but not too bad i use the motive system for air pressure only so i was frequently taking the adapter off and putting it back on as i topped off the reservoir during a complete flush of the brake lines i could only wish there was a toyota-specific adapter that might have made the process a little quicker,130,24
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,needed attachment for modern cars to bleed brakes with motive product 105 pressure bleeder system should be included with 105 bleeder as a complete kit,25,25
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,bought this to use to bleed my clutch line although it is for the motive brake bleeder i was able to use it on my clutch master cylinder since it is universal i just had to move it around until it got a nice seal once i got that it worked the same like when using it on the brake master cylinder works great definite must have if you work on different brand cars since it is universal,76,26
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,application guide is wring and is does not for my car called to replace and they said they know it does not fit but will not update their application guides nor were they willing to refund me my money i have pictures to show that despite stating this parts first my car it doe not even come close and there is no alternative part that they make the company was not willing to help in anyway and i will never buy anything from motive products again,86,27
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,5 stars but too much work to fit it on cuz u need to tighten those 2 nuts so 4 stars,22,28
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,used it for a 2006 honda accord it is not a perfect fit and took some adjusting but luckily there were no leaks as i was able to hold it around 10 - 15 psi,32,29
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,received in a timely manner product was as presented,9,30
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,it is not very easy to use on my 07 g35 since it is a universal cap it does not seal 100 the metal chain that goes around the brake and clutch fluid reservoir to create the seal works but the reservoirs are not perfectly flat on the bottom to prevent the chain from moving therefore the chain can move loosening the tension and breaking the seal i would recommend to either pump the brake and clutch pedals the old fashion way to get an actual cap for the vehicle you are working on to make sure there has an appropriate seal brake fluid is very abrasive and having it spill all over the paint is not good which is what happened to me,120,31
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this was just the ticket for the subaru brake bleeding has never been simpler,14,32
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,buy it no more needing to buy multiple taps that are too costly to even bother to buy the tank this should be added to the tank system as an option,31,33
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,this adapter is a pain to use it was difficult to attach to the brake reservoir for my rav4 and corolla and once attached it leaked and was not secure at all i was very worried it would slip off and spray brake fluid every where so i kept the pressure low around 5 - 8 psi i seen alternative ways to attach this adapter to the reservoir with ratchet bar clamp and hopefully if i try the clamp method it works better,81,34
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,i do not know what others are doing to let thisi started and it leaked so i cranked down the wing nuts and no leaking at 15psi in my bleeder used it on my 07 toyota tundra overpriced for what it is so no 5 star review,48,35
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,a great addition to my motive power bleeder and works nicely with a little mods to the sealing of the master cylinder i use this for my 2001 tacoma and my 95 camry a nice tip to make it seal better to your master cylinder is to use a cpl squeeze clamps to help it seal better and hold pressure,60,36
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,two stars because i had to do a 8 upgrade to make it work i purchased this along with the motive products power bleeder european black label which i returned see other review i could not find a black label that is metal instead of plastic for the universal adapter problem is the cap is not rigid enough to hold pressure first time i use itall over the floor since i could not found any metal universal adapter i used a rectangle piece of 1/2 inch thick plexiglass and drilled 3 holes for the center hose and the two j-screws materials and labor from tap plastic cost around 8 slide the plexiglass on top of the cap and tight the j-screw worked the first time i place a small amount of adhesive between plexiglass and adapter so it does not move around too much used on two honda without pressureproblems if there is an option do not buy the plastic adapters at all,165,37
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,4.0,positive,is a good fit adapter piece required to bleed brakes on my 1998 toyota corolla,15,38
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,1.0,negative,motives website lists this as the adapter for a land rover discovery ii bottom line is that it simply does not fit the application staff or marketing department never bothered to check fitment have used the power bleeder on my other cars and i am please with that product disappointed with the false marketing of this product zero stars,59,39
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,design requires you to secure the universal adapter top down with the provided j screws and chained around the master cylinder however the 2008 honda civic i tried to use this adapter with does not have the master cylinder right under the reservoir so there is no way to adequately secure the adapter down without getting air leaks nicein theory but unless you have a metal master cylinder to secure this piece down tightly with it is completely useless,80,40
Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,5.0,positive,this work perfectly it can be a little bit of a hassle to put on but patience is key follow the instructions and all will be good in the world,30,41
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,2.0,negative,from the description on the website as well as one of the reviews i thought this would work on a motorcycle scooter actually with a 4 cycle engine it does not the packaging on the unit describes it as for automobile engines only after getting it i went to the companys website it too said autos only and recommended a different product for smaller engines like motorcycles this may work fine for autos i do not know but for my scooter it did not work at all I am a bit mystified how the one user got such good results on his motorcycle engine my advice unless you want this for an automobile engine this probably is not the right product for you,120,0
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,5.0,positive,i used this to provide rpm data while rejetting and fine tuning the carburetors on my motorcycle it worked well and seems to have a decent build quality make sure to clamp the tool on the plug wire in the right direction know if you are testing a two or four stroke engine and know something about how many spark pulses are sent per engine cycle,66,1
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,to my surprise when it came time to use the product did not work having waited to long to use it the return warranty had expired so no return for me,30,2
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,did not use it right away but when i did it did not work at all too late to return so just threw it away seems like you just never know about electronic equipment,33,3
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,funny they do not show the packaging in the add it clearly states for 3456 or 8 cylinders also states for smaller engines please see our model 321 now i want to send it back as it will not work on a 2 cylinder harley-davidson and they want me to pay shipping insurance and a return fee not disclosed guess i will not purchase from unbeatablesale inc again,67,4
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,this worked well for my needs i was worried at first because of thebetween the sensor and my plug wires but it gets a good consistent reading every time i do not have a tach on my bike so i need this to set idle when syncing my carbs i bought this after a few good recommendations and fully recommend it as well as usual amazon had the best pricing,71,5
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,i am very satisfied with this product i repair small engines and this unit does exactly what i need it to do,22,6
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,this tach works pretty good only drawback is it is directional sometimes that puts the display on the back side and makes it hard to read but overall a nice tool,31,7
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,4.0,positive,works as advertised and performed it is function just like i had hoped it would i needed to verify the rpms on my v twin motorcycle,25,8
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,5.0,positive,i found the digital clamp-on tachometer the tool i have sought since buying my motorcycle in 1999 setting the idle speed was a constant challenge due to the motorcycle not having a tachometer i finally have a reliable idle speed and found the tool to work as well on automobiles and other engines,53,9
Automotive,B000UZO0L0,1.0,negative,this tach does not work well at all while you can hear that the engine is running at a steady speed the tach reading will vary by as much as 400 rpm or more with an engine running at a reasonably steady 1000 rpm at idle the tach will read from 800 to 1200 to even 1300 or 1400 at times worthless as a engine tuners tach if i had not already disposed of the packaging i would have returned the device and gotten my money back do not buy this tach for engine tuning totally unreliable,97,10
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,just received this lights and got done installing them as night arrived i coulnt wait to see them at night well the lights make the car look better but i was expecting them just to be a little brighter overall I am very happy with them have no regrets you can not beat them for the price,57,0
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,awesome head lights bought this set to replace the set i put in my truck 8 years ago,18,1

Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,shipping was quick and I shall give kudos to the vendor who replaced bulbs and refunded s / h for return bulb was in my foglight assembly for 3 days and it blew up inside unit yes i cleaned bulbs prior to installing i had to take fog light apart to clean lens inside and remove glass debris bulbs have been kindly replaced by vendor but in the interim i bought a cheap set of hyper yellows for half the price and they are still working and going on 2 months without any issues do not recommend the bulb but i recommendf the vendor for their customer service excellent,108,3
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,dim barely bright enough i was not expecting such a dim bulb but i guess you get what you pay for lesson learned,22,4
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,received the product fairly quickly put it in and it works it has been a week and it works so far i am not that picky on thestyle and more of my headlights just need something that works hope it will last long,44,5
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,fast 2 day delivery got them for my 1999 oldsmobile intrugue gls with a bulb size of hb4 or 9006 these bublbs are amazing nice white light with a touch of blue light it is a whole diffrent world driving with these bulbs they allow a larger angel of view my only problem with them is that i do not know if these are dot department of transportaion approved but minus that these are awesome for 1850 with shipping,77,6
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,bought these because when i got a front end repair the dealership did not know where i got them from looked very similiar to what i hd before untill after a weak the blue part of the headlight was melting off did not even bother returning them did more reviews and learned some of these are imitation and not from nokya so be careful who you buy these from,68,7
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,i have tried different headlight bulb from the silverstar to ultra and different asian made bulbs this particular product gave me what i was looking for which is a brighter and consistent light at night travel on the freeways fantastic highly recommended,42,8
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,2.0,negative,do not waste your time or money on these lights received them in a reasonable amount of time and they installed without issue after 20 minutes of use i realized that these were junk heres why 1 while they shine white they do not shine bright dangerously low light output while driving at night 2 they put out so much heat after the 20 minutes on drive time that my headlights were too hot to stand in front of or touch if you disregard my warning make sure to get a wire harness to protect your oem wiring 3 the blue flaked off of these during my drive time i have to assume from the heat do not buy,117,9
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,5.0,positive,i had an issue with my headlight that i think where stock well anyways they were real nice and blue and after looking around at the normal spots i found that no one caried ones that where similar to the ones i wanted i was willing to wait for the shipping time and I am glad i did because these were much cheaper then one would be at the dearship i think,73,10
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,i bought these for my wifes 1997 honda accord gave a nice light blue tint to the light unfortunately after 2 weeks one of the headlights died spent a few dollars more and got ge ones and have had them since these would have gotten a better score if they would have lasted longer than 2 weeks,57,11
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,this has to be the worst headlights ever made they are coated with a transparent blue paint that cracked and fell off after 20 minutes of driving time i had to put my old headlights back in because these were so dim i could not see the road the yellowish ones you can get at walmart are brighter,57,12
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,4.0,positive,i purchased these bulbs for my low beams in my 2009 mitsubishi lancer because i wanted hid style lights without the hid price i have to say these bulbs look great a much whiter light almost with a blue hue to them it gave my car exactly the look i was going for at a fraction of the cost the only downside is that they are not very bright about the same or slightly less than the stock bulbs so if your looking for a hid look but not a super bright light then these are a great buy,99,13
Automotive,B0013I2GJQ,1.0,negative,the bulbs look nice and give the crisp white light that is promised but at less than half the light output of the stock bulbs and closer to a quarter of the silverstars that i had prior if your purpose is to see better at night do not get these bulbs i have been useing my dims which are silverstar ultras since installation because they allow me to see better i bought the nokya for my highs,77,14
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,1.0,negative,a real piece of junk the worst 10 bucks spent in my life it does not hold anything any type of bottles coffee cup from any brand will not fit and it will be quite dangerous to drive with a beverage in this cup holder especially if it is a hot beverage because it will fall down on either your legs or your passengers 100 of the times not to mention the fact that with this cup holder on you can literally forget about using the emergency brake again you will not be able to reach it if a bottle or a coffee cup are sitting in it and the brake will not pull all the way i do not know who designed / projected this piece but he / she was definitely not the sharpest pencil in the box do not waste your money like i did,141,0

Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,got here just on time great shippment pros easy install took 2min tops and dose not get in the way dose what it is suppose to do and best of all it matches the hard pastic cons not much to say just that large drinks will tend to tip over if your not holding them correctly uther than that i just drink out of cans it is a must buy,69,2
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,this is an excellent product it is easy to install took only minutes to install still allows me to use my emergency brake and looks like it came from the factory it holds a 12 oz can or a small drink from mcdonalds perfectly and that is the problem a 20 oz drink bottle most medium drinks my eco canteen and every large drink will simply not fit you know those plastic cups they have at 711 quick trip and arbys that get smaller at the bottom to help them fit into older cupholders well they fit this almost you can shove it down a bit and it will stand up when you are sitting still but if you do not keep a hand on it it will definitely fall over under even mild acceleration or cornering still this is better than no cupholder at all some time ago i saw a cupholder that fit into these small ones that held bigger drinks i found the kaz e kup [ ] which is sort of like what i remember seeing if i can not find anything better i will definitely order that if the drink holes were only bigger this would be a 5-star product,200,3
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,i had the cup holder in my 1990 xj for 4 months until it broke it gets in the way of the hand brake and met it is demise by a hard yank when i parked on an uphill it will not let the hand brake lift enough to lock the wheels the only good thing i found about it is that it is made with durable plastic that matches the center console but unfortunately mounts into it poorly you are better off with one of those one dollar cup holders from the auto store,91,4
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,goodbut it has very shallow cup wells and dramatically limits the movement of the brake lever not safely usable,21,5
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,work as well as expected it was an afterthought and designed in the 80s works great compared to not having anything at all,23,6
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,did not fit in my jeep it said it would for the year mine is and it did not,17,7
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,this fit perfectly into the 89 jeep cherokee that my husband bought as a work truck it came well packaged and made it before christmas,25,8
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,if the handbrake is the maladjusted the cup holder does not work crashes with the handbrake my truck is a cherokee 88 and this not worked fine,27,9
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,purchased this for my jeep because if you have one you know that they do not have any up front only drawback i see is that the cup spaces are not quite deep enough and the smaller deeper holes are not big enough for a large sized drink depending on the cup obviously otherwise it is totally worth the money for the upgrade,59,10
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,it is exactly what i was looking for could have been a bit bigger than it was but it still works,21,11
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,fits nicely over the emergency brake handle and installed very easily with the two screws under the armrest between the front seats,22,12
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,the cup holder works and fits perfectly i was so glad i found this if ur cups do not fit as deep as you want all you have to do is cut the bottom out and this thing works perfect steal deal for the money,44,13
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,I had give this a 5 start but i had to modify in between the tabs slightly so my arm rest would latch shut otherwise awesome product,26,14
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,easy to install it fits very well very secure if your parking brake takes more then 3 clicks to hold the back brakes you will be lifting up the holder and if you need to do it you will have about 2 to hold the handle to release the brake i use my hand brake every time i park so it is bit of a pain size works great for 12 oz cans a thermal coffee cup is a bit wobble if it fits mine do not i use mine thought the summer the remove it for wiinter,94,15
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,ok so it are not perfect you will have a serious problem in finding one that is they are not out there had mine for six months and would not be without it hate those that hang on the door sill we tend to use 12 oz cans and med cups it would be nice if it held larger cups but gargantuan ones are asking a bit much so we are ok with it fit was good and installation was easy looks good need to cut the e brake hole out for a better fit but we will buy another if this one happens to break,102,16
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,finnnially a cup holder only cons are that i have to tighten the brake cable so it does not hit it,20,17
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,the cup holder will only hold a soda can bottom size i did find a thermos that fit perfectly in there,21,18
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,we bought this for our 95 cherokee country and now i do not know how we ever lived without a cup holder this is a great product the only drawback is that it does not quite fit some of the larger cups that being said it is much nicer than not having a cup holder at all great fitment and a solid mount,60,19
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,this was the best price and theshipped fast it was just as decribed and works well in my vehcicle,21,20
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,1.0,negative,soda cans is all that will fit in the cup holders and they will not stay put the holders are too shallow for a 4x4 there is not enough clearance to set your parking brake,34,21
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,the cup holder installs quick and easy and it looks pretty good but that is all my biggest problem with the cup holder is that nothing fits in it my coffee mug does not fit 20 oz bottles do not either i have tried all kinds of bottles and the only thing i have found that fits is a can of soda i would not buy again and would not recommend anyone else to buy,72,22
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,muy bueno es lo que buscaba excelente producto lo recomendare a otros porque en estos tiempos hay que estar seguro de lo que se compra aunque choca un poco con la palanca del freno hay que subirla con cuidado thanks,39,23
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,it is nice and works like a charm only draw back is it leaves your e brake virtually useless and it does not come with hardware 2 screws so all in all it was very nice for the 6 dollars i payed for it i recommend to anyone who wants a small cup holder in there jeep,55,24
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,easy to install took me 2 minutes tops works great better then not having 1 at all great price looks factory arrived earlier then expected,25,25
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,2.0,negative,picked up one of these for my 96 you will notice 2 things when installing first your center console lid will be more difficult to close second you do not have as much room for your e-brake handle and if it is not lined up with the slot perfectly it will hit the holder and crap the very thin screw mounts overall not a great product check out places like jeepforum and naxja for better methods I have seen a few that use a short piece of pvc pipe and work great,91,26
Automotive,B001EMSPW8,5.0,positive,good jeep cherokee cup holder who ever says they suck no they do not took less then 2mins to put in my 1988 jeep cherokee also they hold med cups like from mcdonalds i only got it for it to put a cup in it to dip works good and i order it last friday and just got it today not bad shipping well packaged also will order from again soon thank you,72,27
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,perfect fit fast shipping good packaging makes the crv standout with these slim but stylish deflector followed directions and some quick you tube videos,24,0
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to enable me to leave the windows open without the rain coming in on rainy days i have a big dog that needs much window space as possible after some tweaking and ligth pounding the items began to fit well while allowing the windows to fully close when wound up,55,1
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,i filled in the information online to determine if these weather tech deflectors would fit my 2012 honda crv the website came back with a green check and indicated they would fit my car i ordered based on that information when the deflectors arrived they did not fit the car even after sending the vendor a screen print of the window showing the items would fit i still had to pay the freight to return the deflectors i ordered honda oem deflectors online they fit great and look fantastic,90,2
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,would have given a 5 star rating because i think the fit could be just a little better the design is great and it stops the rain really well and matches the look of my crv black i just think it could have been made to fit into the corners a little better,53,3
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,thisdoes not fit 2012 crv too bad because i love the weather tech side vents noticed that amazon still advertises them for this model looks like more people will be disappointed and have to return them at their own expense,43,4
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,i wanted the side window deflector that went in the window channel and these did that and so easy to install love them and great here in fl as i can now leave my windows cracked and not worry about rain getting in well one of the rear deflectors is missing off my car and now weather tech tells me theyweathertech custom fit front and rear side window deflectors for honda ridgeline dark smoke did not come from them yes it did and if i want to replace it i will have to buy a pair expected that but 55 and i only had it on for one month,111,5
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,i was very impressed with this product great quality perfect fit i would highly recommend this product to anyone satisfaction guaranteed,21,6
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,I have purchased weathertech products since 2005 and they are consistently high quality this product is no different i even got a great deal although the amazon warehouse deals it said it was used but the only thing i saw that was slightly off was the box wrinkled and shelf worn the weathertech product was in new condition and it installed with no problem whatsoever functionally you can drive with your windows down to the level of the deflector or slightly lower and not get that huge rush of wind and attendant noise that comes with it you can also leave your windows cracked open so the heat escapes when it is parked and to everyone else from the outside it looks like the windows are up dark tint,128,7
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,the front deflectors fit well but they tend to rattle when the wind hits them just right the rear deflectors are terrible since they do not prevent water from entering in a 2010 honda cr-v the problem is the honda rear window design is not suited for rain deflectors i left the rear window deflectors in however since weather tech would not offer my installer a partial refund note that the metal clips that are used on the rear deflectors have permanently damaged the rubber trim on the windows be careful how you install them so you do not bend the rubber window trim eventually the rear deflectors kept coming loose and kept falling off so i eventually removed them bottom line i recommend that you do not buy the rear deflectors on a honda cr-v i also bought a pair for my wifes 2014 honda civic 4-door lx and the right passenger deflector is constantly coming loose and falling out of the window after 1 year,165,8
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,i received a different brand of window deflector for christmas but knew that i really wanted the weathertech product i ended up purchasing these deflectors at a great price through the amazon warehouse as a product that would come in a damaged package yes the package was damaged but the product was undamaged i have not installed them yet but have no doubt they will work great i really like the fact the front windows do not require any adhesive to keep them in place weathertech makes some great products,90,9
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,4.0,positive,front door shades installed easily w / easy to follow directions rear door shades had to have about 1/16th of an inch removed from the rear tab for proper fit and even then did not really fit the contour of the window opening the first time the right rear window was opened after apporximately 30 hours the shade fell in the street a little more trimming of the rear tab and it fit well enough to hold for the past two weeks i expected a better fit from this manufacturer,88,10
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,2010 cr-v ex-l the front deflectors do not stay attached i have received replacements followed the online video and talked to tech support they are installed correctly they stay on for a couple weeks but when the climate heats up in birmingham al and you close the door firmly the visors fall off the left visor has fallen off driving down the road yet when installed they feel very solidly attached they are priced right look wonderful and i am so against paying honda 230 plus labor to install the honda version but since these were a gift for my fiance i have no choice bottom line the front deflectors do not stay in i have an acura tl the weathertech visors i installed stay in and look good i have a pt cruiser the weathertech visors i installed stay in and look good,144,11
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,5.0,positive,came as described very good classy quality and fits really well 2008 honda cr-v easy to install it just took me 10 minutes overall nice deflector,25,12
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,like user james f wadford in a previous review i too received the visors in terrible condition there are deep scratches on all 4 visors and the front visors both seem to have fingerprint-like imprints in the plastic itself worthy of note the underside to all 4 visors are super clean and clear with no scratches i returned the first set and asked amazon for a replacement which i received the replacement is in worse shape there has even white film of dust on the underside of all 4 visors but none on the outside facing surface one bad batch is understandable 2 products with the exact same problem speaks to a bigger problem i returned the replacement and will look for different visors for my vehicle,126,13
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it works it fits but the double sided tape that came with it sucks just replace it with something better and it does what it says,26,0
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,a great product holds my mic and do not fall off dash in rough and bumpy construction roads i would tell my friends about this product,24,1
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,got this to hold my cobra cb radio the sticky tape does not hold more than a few paperclips before it falls off i had to use a 3 m yellow weatherstrip adhesive glue to affix it to my dash i did not want to drill holes now I shall probably have to scrape glue off if i ever want to move it,59,2
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,after two days it fell off the tape was still on the truck but the holder was not on the tape any more i put a few drops of superglue on the holder and put it back on two days later the adhesive tape came loose from the truck i was hoping to have a mic holder without drilling holes in the truck but this product did not fit the bill it is pretty much worthless if it falls off i would not buy this,81,3
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i like the product works well i have not used the adhesive part of it yet so can not comment on the stickyness of it from the way my dash is in my truck it worked better to gorilla glue it from the side so did not use the adhesive part but it fits perfectly with what i wanted to hang on it the only reason it is 4 star is because i have not used the adhesive part but it is a sturdy piece,80,4
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,came with an adhesive tape for mounting on the back my mic fit perfect inside and seems to hold strong i like that it is black and blends in,28,5
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,bought this because i did not want to drill holes in the interior of my truck to hang my ham mic reading all the past negative reviews about the tape being cheap and not sticking l went ahead and bought some 3 m heavy duty double sided tape and replaced it with the one that came with the holder over 6 months with now it is still holding with no signs of it coming off awesome holder you shall just have to upgrade the tape yourself,83,6
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,junk actually all of these adhesive mike holders are junk cheaply built the adhesive is worthless and all of these adhesive mike holders use the same 3 m adhesive use this and no matter how well you clean the surface it sticks to your mike will soon be on the floor along with the adhesive mike holder this one worked just as well as the rest of them mike on the floor use the supplied mike holder and screws that come with your mike instead threw this in the trash not worth returning,90,7
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,ok had to put new tape on back,8,8
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,these work well for holding the yaesu button type microphones models like the feet-891 feet-7800 and more the included adhesive pad is garbage and did not even last a day scrape it off and use some good 3 m double sided tape,39,9
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,it works well and looks nice does not have a lock on it like most metal ones but i knew that as other reviews said i had to replace the double stick tape it did not even last a day with the tape it came with,44,10
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,purchased this to hold the control for my hospital bed so that i am not always dropping it on the floor,21,11
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the tape does not work it keeps falling off,8,12
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,depends on what you attach it to I have moved it three times on my car 2009 cadillac cts to find a place where the adhesive will stick without loosening suffice to say I have replaced the double-stick tape a couple times before i found a good attachment point,47,13
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it is a piece of plastic with tape on it it gets the job done but it is overpriced also make sure you know where you are going to stick it before you do because you only get one shot this thing probably cost a penny to produce,46,14
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not work at all i installed and it fell off within seconds i bought this so that i would not drill holes in my dash luckily amazon gave me credit for the 2 that i bought i like thebut beyond that,48,15
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,works a treat until it does not very light mic it might hold for a day then the whole things winds up on the floor i re-stick the black plastic to the sticky back and it stays for maybe another few hours then again the whole thing winds up on the floor going to try the sticky back from 3 m command hooks and see if that works if this were just a hanger type mic i would already have used the 3 m product,82,16
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,adhesive does not hold replaced with gorilla tape mic fits clip well,11,17
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,do not waste your money the glue on the pad will not hold the holder and the mic it holds the holder just fine but as soon as you put your mic in it the holder separates from the sticky pad it is not sticky enough,43,18
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i installed this carefully after cleaning my fjs smooth dash panel and left it overnight to bond on properly as soon as the fairly light handset of my cb radio was placed in it the adhesive failed and it fell off the dash,43,19
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,just what u needed for the limited space in my jeep holds very well,14,20
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i had a place for this thank you,8,21
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,hooks great but the double sided tape did not take nothing some glue can not fix,14,22
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it did not stay stuck on clean plastic and in the shade longer than a day,16,23
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the double stick tape was not strong enough to hold my michadto add a screw,16,24
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,as others have stated the adhesive is not strong enough to support a mic i immediately replaced with some 3 m auto double-sided foam adhesive that i already had this holder works perfectly with my yaesu mh-48 mic in my car can not beat the price,44,25
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i bought this knowing that i would need to purchase better tape although i did test the provided tape first it did not stay up more than 5 minutes after a trip to the hardware store and spending more on 3 m tape than i spent on this holder everything is in place and holding minus 2 stars for worthless tape 1 star back for still providing me with an alternative to drilling into my dash,74,26
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it was an add-onso I am not terribly disappointed but it tried i guess the adhesive backing is not strong enough to do anyone any good mine fell off before i even attempted to stick a microphone into it,39,27
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off within a few hours the truck never moved from it is spot either,14,28
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i used some super glue and fixed it to my dash next to my steering column and it fits my mic perfect and has worked for me for 2 years,30,29
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,adhesive backing fell off without even holding the mic yet giant fail,12,30
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,terrible will not stick do not waste,8,31
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,even after cleaning the mounting surface the cheap tape on mic holder will not hold for very long had to purchase 3 m tape which has worked so far this product is not worth the money because you have to spend more money to buy 3 m tape to make this product work,50,32
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,this is so i inexpensive but absolutely great i attached this to my rear view mirror and love it you must buy this,23,33
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,overpriced but it does what it is supposed to the included adhesive tape is sketchy,14,34
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,fell off my plexiglass boat windshield after 3 days in the backyard under a cover glued it back on with marine adhesive hope it works,25,35
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,bought this exact hook in a truck stop what a piece i held firm for about an hour then flop ford my microphone and this thing down into the floor under my feet and looking at where it was on the dash it left a ridiculous residue took me close to 30 minutes to clean a 11 inch square if i could give zero stars i would,67,36
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,does the job very well looks better in my truck than those shiny chrome holders and you can not beat the price,21,37
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,looks good because its black adhesive does not work should come with a screw so it works,16,38
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off every surface in my car the adhesive on this is a joke,14,39
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the double sided tape is crap old news but goop glue and a few seconds and it will never move again this thing is like a rock and works great in my van even with the kids climbing all around it with the mic is on it,47,40
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the adhesive does not work very well do not waste your money,10,41
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,although it arrived on time and in good condition the quality of the product is poor the double sided tape failed after less than 20 minutes and i found my mike on the floor of my truck the tape stayed where i had mounted it but the holder fell off i replaced the original tape with a 3 m product and everything is where it should be for the price i expected better,72,42
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,i had ended up purchasing 2 of these the first one fell off not through amazon when i bought a second thinking maybe it was a bad batch of adhesive nope they all suck i did get the product a little cheaper although at a truck stop so buying 2 was not so bad 250 ea i ended up buying some 3 m double stick tape and now works great with the modified tape i would give it a 5 star but as sold defiantly a 1 star as no stars is not an option,93,43
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,there is not much to say it is a very simple solid piece of plastic but it holds my midland cb 75 - 822 perfectly the tape provided did not hold up very long so expect to buy something stronger and be sure to clean the surface well first alternatively you could also drill it into your dash if you do not mind altering your vehicle,61,44
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,cheap plastic and the mic does not fit very well i mounted it with velcro so it did not spoil my dash,20,45
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i thought this would look nicer than an aluminum one the adhesive is very cheap it will not support my mic and fell off after about 60 seconds certainly would not hold up off road might work better with some quality 3 m adhesive strips,42,46
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i bought this for my jeep a few warm summer days and the adhesive backing gives way with out any weight on it i keep my mic in the glove box while not in use so the mount has only it is weight and it still falls,46,47
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,the product was fine but i found a different the filled my needs better the size was fine adios adios,20,48
Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,I am recommending against this holder back in the olden days you could almost never count on backing-adhesives doing the job but I have been surprised over the years how much better those products have become unfortunately this product does not exhibit those improved characteristics even although i carefully cleaned the surface to which this product would adhere the adhesive failed hold almost instantly the adhesive fell apart at two points amazon did refund my account also thisshould have costs 49 cents not 379 it is just a tiny piece of plastic,91,49
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the self stick tape lasted less than one hour in my car before this thing fell off of the dash to make it works i had to by a better double back tape,33,50
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,perfect fit for a typical cb handset but will require either a screw or some real tape the surface material included is just plain poor i ultimately just drilled a small screw into my dash works perfect,37,51
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the slot is just a hair tight for the mic but I am sure it will loosen up after time looks great in my new car,24,52
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i lost my cb radio mic mount so i bought this one i read the reviews saying that the adhesive is weak no problem right away i tore off the old adhesive tape and replaced it with scotch extreme mounting tape which claims to hold 20 lbs got it at home depot the tape is insanely strong i used to have my mic velcrod to my dash and so i would always pull it straight off I have accidentally tried doing that several times with this mount instead of pulling up first and it has held with no problems good stuff,100,53
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the adhesive is very strong and can withstand the excessive use my little sister puts on it when she rides with me i really can not complain looks nice in black interior of vehicle as well,35,54
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,my husband wanted a holder to put in his car to hold his microphone for his ham radio system his old one kept falling off the dashboard this one really did the trick,33,55
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,fit the a-pillar of my 2002 audi a6 bi-turbo very well right out of the box can be molded better if desired comes with 1/4 insulator pad to take up gaps as well highly recommended especially for the price,39,0

Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,i bought a glowshift transmission temperature gauge and later bought this pillar pod as an after thought it worked great fit like a glove on my 91 ford explorer pillar post after painting it to make the colour of the interior it looks like it was factor oem a trick i learned is to heat up the pod with a blow dryer then form it to fit the pillar screw it into place and let it cool down then remove and paint to match works like a charm,88,2
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,4.0,positive,did not fit my truck but a little heat and fit perfect,11,3
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,ordered two different holders and both did not fit,8,4
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,this is not universal i had to do a lot of modifying to make it fit poorly,17,5
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,after waiting to collect theit is not a universal fit and the guage does not fit so it is totally useless to me total waste of money,27,6
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,had a good comment on this from the repair shop looks professional,12,7
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,thanks for the pillar pod i recommend this product to anyone who decides to buy gauges they fit the way they say they do and this will be the second one I have installed so far and i am very satisfied,41,8
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,did not even come close to fitting the a pillar in my car would not recommend to anyone this at all,20,9
Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,how this worthless frankenpod can be described as universal is a mystery to me i bought one for my suburban and there is no way repeat no way this thing can come anywhere near close to being made to fit the pillar i frankly can not imagine it fitting anything short of a piece of heavy earth-moving equipment such as a bulldozer or the like it is just one of those things i wrote off to experience can not win them all good luck getting any use out of it if you have the misfortune to buy one,97,10
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,these are yup you guessed it junk they are cheaply made i ripped two of mine trying to install them and they are not universal junk product do not buy these,30,0

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,i like these seat covers a lot i mainly got them to protect my light covered seats i did not really care for the colors but they are very useful the only thing i do not really like is that you have cut holes for the covers that go in the back for the seat belts,54,2
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5.0,positive,awesome totally transformed the look of my car tight fit,10,3
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,descriptions were for lexus-ls430 2006 but when i received the cover they are too small spend money to go to car dealer who were not able to put seats on also none of the covers had accommodating opening for my cay feafures,42,4

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,bought these for my niece and they are of good quality back seat covers harder to get on but that is the norm leather like material protects from liquid damage can not say how long they will she has only had them for three weeks if they hold up for a year we will be happy,56,7
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,these seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 toyota camry this camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered,33,8
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,these seat covers are pretty darn cool actually it was not that difficult to install at all the only complain is that it does not quite fit my back seats there is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat,45,9
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5.0,positive,great product and makes my suv look brand new,9,10
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,very low quality said it fits and did not,8,11
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,even being extremely careful and following exact instructions which are lacking greatly in detail they have ripped twice first set and then the replacement set and the 2nd set the primary strap that holds it in place broke great look great price but being gentle and careful when installing i would not buy again,53,12
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,when used with the included sticky rubber mat this holder securely holds my iphone or garmin nuvi gps the dashboard on my honda odyssey has a nice flat spot that it can sit very stable the material of the holder is a foam so it will not damage your electronics and you can easily squish it into your glove box too the stickiness of the rubbery mat is a downfall as it attracts dust and dirt if you would like to see additional pics of this holder please see the ones i posted in the photos section,96,0
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,whether this works for you depends largely on what type of car you drive it seems to work better in my car than in my husbands but the dashboards are totally different even in my car i did have some trouble with this falling when i accelerated quickly or took a sharp turn also it really is not an attractive device in any way but when it works it gets the job done people may want to try something like this before getting one of the mounts you need to attach or suction-cup to your window,95,1
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,this was a decent product it sits on the dashboard and holds a portable gps it allows your hands to be free for driving i find it handier for holding an ipod than a gps on the negative side it is a large block of foam sitting on the dashboard which i do not like but if that kind of thing does not bother you go for it there are several well-placed holes for running cords through it also came with a sticky pad for the dashboard to keep things from sliding,89,2
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i was truly hoping this might be a viable solution when traveling through states which do not allow for windshield-mounted gps units i have tried vent-mounts previously with relative success but found turning corners to be an issue when the vent-mount would swing away from view the concept of the commutemate navcup is a good one the execution of the concept however is poor first the cradle will accomodate only the thinnest of gps units which rules out the use of my navigon gps second in spite of power cord cut outs in the cradle for routing the cord they will not accomodate a standard length micro usb jack in the bottom of one of my gps units to say nothing of the offset micro usb jack on a secondary gps unit i own the cost of return shipping does not make it cost effective to return so perhaps my review will spare another from making an unnecessary purchase i think if heininger holdings would redesign the cradle they may have a good product on a positive note the dashgrip mat that came with it should be useful for securing loose items on my center console,196,3
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,would not stay on dashboard ended up using them in the home for my iphone 4,16,4
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,this product was ok but it is very light and when you make right or left turns in the car it slides off the dashboard to easy when you make a turn have to hold it or it will not stay,39,5
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,navi-cup does what it is designed to do put your gps where you can see but not in your line of sight on the windshield,24,6
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,fine for the gps but the iphone falls out fast delivery would order again,15,7
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i love it it makes it very easy to see my gps and it does not move or slide around,20,8
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,do not like the product at all first it does not fit on the dash of our car and second it falls overtime there is a somewhat sudden stop,29,9
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,this holds my gps and other things very well no problem traveling and handling the portable gps unit anymore may be expensive for some but it is worth it to not have to pick the gps off the floor everytime you make a turn the holder keeps it stable,49,10
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i just received my navcup yesterday and i am very happy with the ease of use the simplicity of design and the visibility of my gps unit while sitting in the holder i wish i had one of these years ago instead of the suction cup method i had been using with the suction cup i had to permanently attach a plate to the surface of my dash not good if you ever want to switch to a different gps unit also the gps unit always seemed crooked while being held by the suction cup holder with the navcup my gps unit sits perfectly straight i am not familiar with the durability of the sticky pad but if it continues to be just as sticky i just do not see any reason not to give the product a heart felt 5 star rating i love everything about it,147,11
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,not thrilled the gps did not fit well so i am not using it the cord was in the way so it did not lay correctly,26,12
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,so happy to find a way to support / display the gps without it being stuck on windshield stable yet removable if needed made of foam but sturdy,26,13
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i was skeptical about buying this but it has actually worked a lot better than i had anticipated you do need the sticky dash mat to go between this and your dashboard to keep it in one place it is worth more than it is price,45,14
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,thisdoes not do what it professes to do hold your gps unit it is made of cheap rubber the cavity is not deep enough to hold gps it has to be glued to the dash and more etc do not buy i have an extra one pay shipping and I shall send it to you free,54,15
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,the heininger 1040 commutemate black navcup presents the following problem i own two portable 5 screen gpss in las vegas nevada most days of the year are sunny the navcup angle causes the screen to be unreadable due to sun glare if you only drive at night you will appreciate it is design marvee,53,16
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i thought it looks nice and might even stay but after five minutes of driving around next left turn i took my gps was out on the passenger seat if only i can keep it on the dash the rest is fine i can route the power cable from behind through one of several holes in the back and the gps does sit on the mount cleanly now i have to put may be a velcro to keep this on the dash the sticky mat that is supplied with the product also did not work well on my camry sedan and could not keep the navcup in place for too long,110,17
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,it had a tendency to slip off the dash during sudden acceleration also the cable of my garmin 1490 interfered with navcup causing the garmin to rest crookedly in the navcup,31,18
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i have to say i am very happy with the addition of the navcup to our jeep there is no dash sliding as i take those turns a little too fast and it does not take up too much room would definitely recommend this,44,19
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,i was excited to get thisbecause it seemed like it would do a better job than the traditional suction cup method however after one day out in the sunlight i was left severely disappointed the essential problem with thecomes down to the fact it is not adjustable it convienently fit our tomtom and sat sturdily on our dashboard a rav4 it was when we pulled out of our driveway that we realized it sat too far back and you could hardly see it with the glare our particular model of rav has the dashboard swoop up in the center where you would put such anthis made it unreadable if your car is different and has a flat dashboard you may have better luck for us although it was pretty useless in the sunshine,139,20
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a holder that would allow me to access my touch screen the dashboard models are difficult to reach this really does the trick,28,21
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,there has nothing to using this tool out of the box unpack place the sticky pad on the dash put the navcup on it and you are off to the races i live in a mountainous area with lots of inclines and downgrades and turns in all the time I have been using the navcup my motorola droid has never slipped out in any direction the gps which is quite a bit larger than the droid also has never slipped out regardless of speed or direction of travel everything stays in place as if it were glued on bear in mind that this is during the height of winter and everything in the car is cold i wonder what it will be like during summer highly recommended for now update 05/17/2012 lo these many years and this thing continues operating very well the heat did not faze it one bit the rubber mat is accumulating dust rather quickly now and so requires a good clean from time to time otherwise spot on upgrading to a five-star review it deserves it,176,22
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,it does a pretty good job but it is pretty big and bulky to put on the dashboard we put our in the console area down below and it works just fine pros keeps the phone upright we use our phone with gps for navigation has a spot where you can place the charging cable through cons too bulky and light to place on the dash without concerns of it falling off the stickypad that comes with it is very sticky and i do not want it leaving a residue on the dash wish it did not hold the phone / gps so upright since we use it down in the console area it would be great if it were angled back a little bit,137,23
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,i have a 2009 honda civic and an iphone 4 with the tomtom car kit which has a suction-cup mount and charger problem is they way the charger / mount is orientated it is impossible to position in a place that is viewable or practical in my car I have decided to try the commutemate navcup gps dash mount holder while it was clearly not designed to hold the rather unique shape of the iphone when in the tomtom car mount it does the job it does on occasion come tumbling down but for the most part stays in place and I am pleased,100,24
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,i tried this in my car and absolutely hated it first of all you have to put a sticky mat on your dashboard then you put this foam cup on it i found it to be not only ugly but bulky and big i hated it give me my windshield suction cup any day,55,25
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,looking for a stable holder for your gps device this is the thing for you I have got a tom-tom gps system and i was very pleased at how well this worked with it it held it in place firmly but was it was still easy to remove there has also a hold to allow your power cord to go through so you can have it plugged into your car lighter like anyone uses those for their intended purpose anymore the holder itself is made out of a black foam substance and sits easily on the dashboard really there has not much more that i can say about this thing it is sturdy and it gets the job done,115,26
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,i am not a short person but when my gps is mounted to the windshield of my suv i do have toway forward in my seatbelt to change anything on the screen the navcup puts the gps within easy reach of the driver and lowers it out of your line of vision [ which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences and level of distraction often when at eye level drivers find themselves watching the screen rather than the road ] in the event of a wreck the gps unit may go flying as it is not secured beyond it is power cable but the soft navcup will not because harm to passengers the pad mounts easy just slap it down and sit the cup on it,131,27
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,mmmm i one of these light bulbs an i tested with my white reg lights an it show a different on them on my high beam that is were i put them because i drive at night i have a night shift but not bad at all for this product lot better then my old ones,55,0
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,I have had success with halo lights in the past but these are not so great the purple tint dims the lights so that they are not very bright in comparison they are about half as bright as previous sets of halo icis blues or nokya arctic whites that I have had if you are looking for a purple tint the best way to go is just convert to hid,67,1
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,got these bulbs for my fogs i was looking for a blue / purple light not so much white they have as muchto them as you can get legally with a decent bluish purple tint however it is still white when i changed this into my fogs i already had a blue optic protection film on the fog covers so with the film and the bulbs together it gave me a real nice bluish / purple light on the road i was looking for with a blue tint front look also they are brighter in terms of light then stock bulbs but since it is a tinted bulb to generateyou lose some of the brightness still a good bulb thyre cheap as heck why not try them out,127,2
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,these lights are amazing they are very bright and have a good purple tint to them they are also legal so that is good too,25,3
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,i purchased these 9005 along with 9006 halo these are very low powered headlights i like the 9006 low beam they work fine but these 9006 hi beam are the dimest headlights i have ever seen and i m 52 years old i have went out of city limits 5 or 6 times to try these lights and they are just plain useless i had to put my old lights back in till i recieve different lights i would sell these but they would be a hazard to use,87,4
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,these lights are just plain garbage you might be able to use them in the city where there is lights and speeds are slow but to use these out of city and where speeds increase is not safe they hardly light up the road at all and only for a very very short distance i tried to adjust them but they just do not put out any light almost like trying to drive in the dark with your lights turned off i will not try to drive with these purchased a differnt brand guess these will go in the trash,98,5
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,the number one thing for a headlight is to illuminate the road ahead these headlights do a poor job at that the light output is very faint compared to the sylvania bulbs i had previously the purple tint is cute but not worth sacrificing visibility i do hope these lamps burn out fast so i can replace them with something brighter,61,6
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,the purple lights are awsome the high / low series are so much better easy install quick shipping,16,7
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,definitely do not have a purple look to them just look like an ordinary yellowish fog light and not very bright,20,8
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,i could not tell when my high beams were on or off i went to a pitch black area away from all light sources and no difference was made when high beams were on do not purchase product if i still had the box i would return as soon as possible,48,9
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,i had a hard time finding these but I am glad i found them on amazon the purple look is very unique,21,10
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,5.0,positive,i have halo automotive purple white 9006 12v 55w bulb twin pack asome work good some do not like i love it,22,11
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,when i received thisi was dissapointed to find that it was not the right bulb as it was advertized and i now have no use for it,29,12
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,wanted some purple hids but was short on cash so went with the bulbs instead quality product ignites to distinct purple / white would recommend,23,13
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,bulb is bright but as far as purple white definitely not looks like a halogen bulb very disappointed with it,20,14
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,4.0,positive,i purchased these fog lights to replace the ones in my srt8 charger i was originally disappointed because they were not as purple as i was expecting although i did not return them and still have them on my car today they are great and have a very light purple tint to them most people i know can not tell that they are suppose to be purple white honestly they really do not seem much different from an hid light coming down the road but overall great purchase and quality is good,89,15
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,2.0,negative,i would not purchase this product not for a main head light anyway thewas ok but the light out put was terrible i could hardly see signs or the reflectors on cars they are cheap and you get what you pay for,44,16
Automotive,B002GZ6URE,1.0,negative,had purple halo headlights in my truck for a month and noticed sediment inside headlight housing found the coating of the bulbs is flaking off all over the headlight,29,17
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i bought this for indoor use with occasional exposure to mild weather the 142 size fits 09 solstice coupe fairly well wraps down to cover about 75 of the wheels even elastic band makes it tricky to put on a slippery waxed car for one person keeps dust out nicely and some oil that dripped on it from my garage door hardware did not penetrate interesting texture feels finely woven with a light plastic / teflon film coating light strong but not quite what I had call soft or velvety no experience with rain or wind yet but based on the non-custom fit i suspect it could mar the finish if the non-snug portions flap around excessively over time,115,0
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,i ordered this for my solstice and it fits great i like the fact that it covers the whole car down to the wheels and has room for the antenna i do not drive my car during the winter and this allow me to store it in the garage without letting all the dirt and dust settle on it,58,1
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i would give this cover no stars if possible i purchased in march for my lincoln and by august i had to throw it away it was rotting to pieces it got several holes that i patched withtape but that only lasted a few weeks and then more holes and rips everywhere so it is now in the dumpster i bought a good quality cover for 20 more from a large online auction site it is a five-layer heavy and durable cover like one i had up until this junky one gave up do not buy this unless you like throwing money away i can assure you that this is an honest review of a very inferior cover amazon probably has good quality durable covers but this is not one of them,133,2
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,i purchased this product to cover my car while i commute on my motorbike during the warm months although it did fit my car reasonably well it is simply inadequate for outdoor use people buying this product should be aware that it is made of paper think of the cotton paper gowns of surgeons and clean room technicians it is not as tough as canvas after only two months in the elements occasional rain and wind mostly sunshine the cover has developed punctures that i have repaired with tape it still covers the car but i predict more patches in the future and eventually the whole thing just will not be salvageable is this worth nearly 90,115,3
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,very thin does not hold up we purchased this for our 1965 mustang as it was the one that was suggested on their site for our car it was not the most expensive but not the least either when received and put it on we were not happy with the fit but hoped it would work ok it has already ripped across the rear of the trunk and looks really bad / thin and taggered with less than 2 months of use i would not purchase another of this brand wish i could ask for my money back,95,4
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i purchased this car cover for my new lexus ls 460 although the car is parked in a garage i need a cover to prevent scratch marks on the paint finish you see my cat loves to roam the garage and he jumps up on the car sometimes scratching the paint the cover is large enough and is fairly easy to put on i will say that it is better if 2 people handled the cover when attempting to cover the car taking it off is no problem but the cover is a bit bulky and does not fold into a neat little shape very easily I had say it is a mid grade quality cover if you go much heavier you would be looking at something made out of heavy canvas all in all this cover does the job for my purposes,139,5
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,the product users instructions indicate an attenna patch that once removed the car cover will lay flat with the anttena in place trouble is there is no antenna patch furhtermore the car cover is an absolute example of an I shall-fitted product such that when installing the cover i had to stetch the product and once on my vehicle good grief what a horrible result the cover does not follow the shape of my vehicle just barely and finally one would expect that the tie-down gromet holes would have been put in place during production well alas no so as the instructions state simply find a place in the cover and place the gromet cardboard and the pierce the cover in the gromet hole i will not say anymore except i advise no one to purchase this product,137,6
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i finally took the cover out to put on my car for storage today i guess i should not have been so trusting although i entered the year make and model of my car and i bought the one that was recommended it did not fit properly too small thanks for taking away my piece of mind that my car would be fine,63,7
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,car cover came quickly and was excellent quality for the price,11,8
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i wanted to cover the car while our home is being remodeled because our garage is full of stuff this cover works well good price and fast delivery it needs to be tied down when it is windy and that was a slight challenge the fit was not precise for our subaru which was based on the instructions for ordering it if i had it to do over again i probably would buy the next larger size,76,9
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,what ever i received is not what i ordered i ordered the 200 inch cover for my 197 inch challenger however what i received is impossible to be installed on my 2013 dodge challenger,34,10
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,works fine if you do not mind replacing it every 6-months mine complete disintegrated after 6-months no antenna sleeve so you must poke a hole in it for your antenna,29,11
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,material is bad after a few rain and weather storms it will start to tear bad bad material for 8000 also it does not fit my car right one side ok otherside nope in the cart does this fit my car it says it does but it do not do nt buy this product do not over priced by 6000 easy bad bad bad i can make this at home,68,12
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,budge car covers are the best at protecting my car from weather and cement dust pollution from the nearby plant this one is a perfect fit on my kia optima,30,13
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,nice to have something that fits for your car not a generic cover for just any car one size fits all,21,14
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,i would rate the cover 3 stars for durability but 5 stars for uv protection the tyvec fabric is thin and does not do well in windy areas but the sun does not get through this material it is amazing it can be 110 degrees outside and the car remains at the ambient temperature i have one for my truck in white and it is great i bought the grey one for my new car but the manufactures recommended size did not fit so i had to return it amazon is easy to deal with when you have to return a product if you need protection from the sun and do not live in a windy area then this is the cover,121,15
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,i have a lincoln mark iii 1971 it is 2161 inches long i had to stretch the edges and to rupture the she shall such that the cover sits just on top of the car if you look for a cover for a 210 inches long car look elsewhere,48,16
Automotive,B0046LOE06,5.0,positive,i gave it 5 stars because it is made very will i like it because it fits around my car great light weight so it is easy to handle i would recommend this cover to any one that is wants a great fiting will made cover,43,17
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,ours after not too long at all started flaking millions of tiny bits all over my car every single time i used it not usable now bought it walmart it was their high end offering and cheaper than waterproof high end covers at other retailers it lasted less than a year my advice if it says budge then avoid it,61,18
Automotive,B0046LOE06,2.0,negative,i purchased this car cover for the very hot southern california summers it is not even a year old but already has lots of little tears on the surface and now one large tear that is about three or four inches long right at one of the taillights it seems that this cover can not hold up to the weather and i do not recommend it,63,19
Automotive,B0046LOE06,1.0,negative,well i bought three of the budge 10 year warranty covers at oriley auto parts the first three lasted january february and march by early april 2012 they had disintegrated i returned them to oriley and they gave me three more the exact same problem by august 2012 i do not understand how they can make such a poor product i would not recommend any of the budge covers in the past i would at least get 2 - 3 years use from a 10 year cover and i could live with that but 3 months realy do they think i just fell of the truck,103,20
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i saw the promo video and was impressed i ordered two units and installed them on the helmets one fit well without the adhesive the other required the adhesive which i did not want to use the sound from my mp3 was great and i was impressed however the communication between the two units is horrible you have to maximum out the volume and you get an echo effect if you can hear the other person at all both of the units have a problem getting the plug from the microphone / speakers to stay properly plugged into the main unit if they are not plugged in all of the way the sound does not play for both ear speakers it usually will only have sound in one unless you press and hold the plug into the main unit in addition the unit has a hard time staying place in the mounting device connected to the helmet it comes out too easily i have not checked other brands but i was disappointed to find that it only has a 90 day warranty i would expect the typical year as most products have i would not buy these if i could do it over again,201,0
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,just bought 2 of them and set them up in the helmets full face the instruction was a little confusing but after the second time reading it i got it then maybe it was me I shall give them a good work out this next weekend on our road trip so far i like them but word to the wise read the instruction cover to cover oh there is one more thing i blue tooth to my iphone but i can not get both sets to play music at the same time got any answer,98,1
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i was so excited to receive my blinc m2 and finally be able to listen to tunes while riding what a huge disappointment i had the volume maxed out which causes the speakers to distort terribly and could just barely tell there was any music at all playing when riding 30 mph the fm tuner did not receive channels very well either,61,2
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,it is great to have music wright up to you are earsfm radio not to good does not lock station but ipod is perfect and also being able to answer the phone on the move,31,3
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,should have bought the sena in the first place it worked fine in the drive way but on the road not so good batter on one of the units would cut out after 25 hrs or so sound was garbled at low speed under 50 mph and this is behind a full wind screen on a stock mufflered bike with full face helmets we re adjusted re-set to no avail it was purchased from road rider of reno after he called the distributer in el monte ca mike at r / r said he would give us a refund but blinkteckcom would not it is ok around town at low speed but if you need a real intercom system buy the sena,122,4
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,radio did not receive very well liked the boom mike better than the uclear one i ended up with that has mikes built into speaker hard to set the sweet spot so for answering / talking while riding blinc was great however the uclear hbc 100 really does get quite loud without distortion much more so than the blinc m2,57,5
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i like the blinc system i purchased two for me and my husband but one does not work,17,6
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,just make sure not to install this on the throttle side for all those nonleft handers out there so far the product works great as an intercom completely changes the riding experience for those quick unplanned cruises with friends,39,7
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,super greatthanks very fast shipping aaaaaaaaaaaa,8,8
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,the sound is clear feels like surround sound voice phone and music it is great,14,9
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,it works i would recommend blinc should upgrade the background noise elimination set up,14,10
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,unit to unit pairing only worked with the m2 version not backwards compatible the purchased unit only lasted one ride for about 30 or so minutes before turning off and never turning on again even after recharge attempts while it was working i could not get the volume high enough to hear the other rider the other rider could hear me and everything else no noise canceling what so ever the website provides nearly no help thewas returned due to the device failure and not exchanged for another due to the other issues while it was working,98,11
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i could not connect to most radio stations where i live at and after a few months the plugin for the ear pieces that goes in the helmet snapped off,29,12
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this unit for the sole purpose of the fm tuner by far the worse decision i could have made the fm tuner gives me 90 percent static,29,13
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,intercom feature is really bad very difficult to have a conversation with passenger once you turn the engine on would not recommend it,22,14
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,love his unit especially the blue tooth connection with my i-phone i added a handle bar holder for the phone and i can use gps answer calls listen to my tunes and use voice commands without ever having to look down or remove my hands from the handle bars if i do not want to,54,15
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,it works for a while after two months it does not starts at all and the other device led does not work either is an expensive device for me and i had to deliver back twice they change the device and the second one have problems too i need my money back,50,16
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,garbage clip does not fit my helmet poor reception and it freezes everytime sorry but for what the price is horrable,20,17
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,a decent product for the price but not worth it in the long run i bought this product about two years ago and it worked for about 9 months and then kicked the bucket i had contacted the manufacturer and i have to this day not received a follow up the module had great sound around town but forget the music and sound quality when you get on the highway i did like the ability to change the song with the twist of the knob another thing to keep in mind with the knob is that if you twist it a little very little bit to hard the knob will strip out overall go with the sena headset more money but you will not regret it,125,18
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the cable is not long enough for the helmet part then it just turns off for no reason I am not happy with the product but i can not return it,29,19
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,just as the article said and was on time,9,20
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the only reason i am giving this a one star is because zero star is not available if you are thinking of buying this do yourself a favour do not unless you have a lot of luck like the folks who rated this product highly the are unreliable get something else any thing but this it is a total waste of money,56,21
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the way the speakers connect to the module is a malfunction it connects from the bottom just over your shoulder on the bottom of the helmet this causes the wiring to rub everytime you move your head and damages the wires i had mine for about 4 months before the wiring started to sever I am looking to buy more speakers and i will stick it to the side of the helmet with some kind of adhesive because i like the way it works and sounds just bad wiring design,89,22
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i could understand a price range of 40 - 50 but the fm function is completely useless not water proof at all never use or have on you in the rain it will short it out the charger is proprietary and a pain the speaker wire is the same as the charger so you have to unplug it and every time and there is no way to secure it the speaker wire always falls out and is loose over all worked at a mediocre level for a month then is garbage save your money and go somewhere else,96,23
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,worked great and all even tho calling and the voice communication is terrible i liked it for music but now it charges and does not turn on makes no sense,29,24
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this blue-tooth headset in september 2013 it is very rugged nice design and enjoyed it thoroughly for a few months never liked the fact that this device uses a proprietary connector but i figured with finesse it may last a good while over time i have noticed the connector has worn making the charger intermittent does not seem to charge unless monitored to make sure the battery indicator is showing the battery only holds a charge now for about 30 minutes on a good day i have purchased another headset to mount in my helmet i did like the ui and portability of this device but with having to disconnect the connector each time to set the helmet down or to charge was a turn off for me excellent product for the price just expect the battery to die relatively soon,143,25
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,the only issue that i have is that some times it has trouble connecting to my phone other than that it would get 5 stars,25,26
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,nice and great product but the manufacturer needs to provide more details on the installation process most especially mounting the device to the helmet took a while for me to figure out the mounting clip is detachable from the device will update after a month or two,47,27
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,just what i expected works wonderful it fits snug and the battery last pretty well well worth the cost certainly,20,28
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,went on a long ride to test the blinc m2 on my helmet and the one on my wifes helmet clear sound especially with my wifes full helmet i wear a half helmet and the sound came through the wind noise clearly communication spotty in some situations the fm tuner is difficult to tune to a station if the station does not come in full power you will hear a lot of static if you can even connect to a radio station,82,29
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product exceeded my expectations compared to the chatterbox but after a day of use the speaker connection started to stutter the connection for the speakers goes on the bottom of the bluetooth and it is also used to charge the unit you must constantly unplug it if you are going to set your helmet down so you do not because any damage to the connection but no matter what it is very sensitive therefore you will constantly struggle to get a good connection between the helmet speakers and the unit the clarity between helmet to helmet is not very good and after a few yards you start loosing connection once that happens the units will not automatically reconnect and you will have to pull over to synchronize them again i will recommend this product over the chatterbox which i also returned look into the sena smh10 which is well reviewed compared to other helmet bluetooth products i hope this helps,161,30
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,the product is small and very basic it does the job for a quick ride or quick dayley commuit the speaker are modertly loud as long as your bike does not havepips meaning after market pipes it does come with a fm radio mode and works with some stations meaning like 10 so you kinda learn to like new station or you can just make a play list through your phone and use that but the prouduct is what it is cheap n you get what u pay for a simple but affective device for someone not looking into paying so much money,104,31
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought the blinc m2 last year hoping that i got a good deal worked well for about 3 months and then boom it stopped working it will not turn on anymore even after i tried reseting it it just died save your money guys and do not buy this product,49,32
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i received this as a gift last year and liked it so i bought one for my wife this year works great,22,33
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,delivery was fine i went back to my country and the first day of use a little rain fell on my and the module just died in the middle of a phone call after 4 days plugged to the wall it came back again used it for two more phone calls and died again i 'll be traveling next week to miami where i expect to return it and ask for a new one,73,34
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,awesome great sound calls are clear easy to instal and the price is just right a must have for any rider,21,35
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,bought in advance of motorcycle trip purchased two first one did not charge exchanged and everything looked ok but once we got on the road realized one of them never held a charge no matter how long i charged it now on our trip we could not talk to each other used the working one for bluetooth to my iphone which worked great however if i tried to use the fm radio function it could never pick up a station even in a big city like washington washington dc when we got back i tried to return via amazon and they denied because it was beyond their return period i sent several messages to seller and manufacturer and no one will respond to me 220 wasted super disappointment do not waste your time or money,133,36
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,does exactly as advertised my only knock is that the charger is not a standard usb plug neither micro or mini so if it gets lost you are back to the manufacturer for a replacement,36,37
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i like it a lot sounds great when riding my motorcycle good product to buy if u ride ride bikes,21,38

Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,quick delivery and good packaging the product is easy to use and install i own two and have never had a problem with either of them,26,40
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,works alright can not hear very well with it and the controls are difficult would not buy this if i knew how it worked,22,41
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought one that did not work from the time i took it out of the box even tried to reset it with the key provided so i returned it and got a replacement the replacement i got would not work either the large button to would not do anything when pushed so gave up and got a refund,56,42
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i really enjoy my blinc m2 my only issue is i have had it less than three weeks and now my microphone is not working every time which makes it frustrating when trying to take a call or talk to my passenger,42,43
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the phone link works wonderful the fm tuner is well crap it will not connect to the strongest stations nor stay tuned into any station,25,44
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,too bulky hard to know if you are turn in dial in the right position and hard to control with gloves on,22,45
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,produt came in good codition but some time it getting frozen and you have to use the unlock key is working ok,22,46
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,love to ride my motorcycles but this has made the long trips awesome being able to switch between mp3 and intercom and still answer the phone is amazing,28,47
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,it was easy to mount easy to install upon testing the speakers were crackling when the music was up all the way when a call was placed i was told several times that they could not make out what i was saying even with the microphone right in front of my mouth on a full face helmet also was stationary with the bike not running i do not recommend this product to anyone spend more money and do your research sena or scala are better products,85,48
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,pros voice control compatible lcd worded display at least it is not a chatterbox cons it had no volume even cruising on my bike at 60 could not hear it at all clunky and awkward fm radio you are joking does anybody still use that it kept inadvertently getting stuck in fm mode now when I am stopped the last thing i want to hear is static on maximum volume terribleand probably the killer for this product if you want a headset that is good and has rider-rider functionality and good volume and voice / siri control go with the sena smh10 please do not waste your time on this product,105,49
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,before you pass this product up i want you to understand I am riding a punched out 103 v-twin with vance and hines headers so anything that loud your probably not going to hear someone on the phone but with that in mind i can still hear my music just fine,50,50
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,the blinc m2 is great device if only the plug for the speakers was consistent it occasionally comes out to the point where you spend the majority of your ride trying to push the plug in properly to listen to your music this defeats the purpose of enjoying a ride the fm modular is worthless because it rarely gets a good signal and all you hear is rushing noise the speakers do sound good when it is working properly for the mp3 i do not recommend this product to anyone you will whine up disappointed as i am about this purchase,100,51
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,everything works great except for when i want to forward to the next track the turning forward on the dial is kind of broken,24,52
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,it is a very helpful device for the bikers to receive and make calls when driving the intercom awesome i like it,24,53
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,bought as a gift love it mostly for listening to music never to answer phone which in theory also works may buy another set for second helmet this is transferable between helmets but prefer not to do that,38,54
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,they have a proprietary charging device that right there should make you not purchase it it should come with a standard 12v charging chord and be able to charge it via usb as well you know what everyone has on their motorcycles to power and charge devices with this you run out you have to stop somewhere or just wait until you get home to charge it worthless in my opinion i should have thought about that before i purchased it music and audio does sound alright although in my opinion i do not use it anymore although looking for an alternative trying to get my hands on a replacement propriety charger so i can sell this stupid thing,118,55
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,what the fuck is going on here you ripped out the damn headphone jack and left it as ahole without anything left and u throw this crap headphone and boom rig that plugs into the charger and it only lights blue fake ass m2,42,56
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,the radio reception when riding was basically non-existent yet oddly enough after i mounted it and tested it at home it pulled in stations quite clearly this made absolutely no sense at all my other complaints are that it was not glove friendly and the volume was insufficient to be heard when riding 0 btw i do not understand why the radio frequency is displayed on it when it is outside the helmet my old parrots which sadly died and are no longer made actually spoke the radio frequencies as it locked on them i wish parrot would introduce a replacement for the sk4000,101,57
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,everything seems to work great on it if you spend the time to tinker with the installation abit the speakers are more then loud enough for both music and voice if you make sure to get them close enough to your ear i had to put a piece of 1/4 double sided sticky to mine to get them to properly placed in my helmet i do not have any problem with it losing connection to my android phone as of yet I have only rode about 60 miles with them so far so hopefully they do not develop any problem there can not comment on rider to rider only one so far but plan on getting a second if this continues to work out the fm reciver is really weak and looses signal easy i have fixed that problem by using an old fm antenna wire from a old ati tuner i had laying around and working it around the top inside of my helmet and then wrapping the ends around each side of the earphone wires and taping them now it never seems to drop,182,58
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,we installed this product on two brand new helmets with ease however the sound quality was poor and the intercom feature is completely useless we had to turn the unit off and resort to the old fashioned method of yelling at each other we got this primarily for the intercom feature and now will sell both units also the battery life is only fair we go on long rides and it does not last we did not bother pairing with the phones as we do not like phone calls when we get to ride the music quality i although was poor at best and the fm feature is very weak a cheap set of ear buds are far better in sound quality we are very disappointed with this product soon to be sold,129,59
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,buetooth link was a snap works great some difficulty using siri but otherwise fine only drawback is that you can not hear it on the highway even with a full helmet and visor closed,33,60
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,funcional excelente practico bonito m e g u s t o m u c h o g r a c i a s,23,61
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i ordered used ones and they came with missing parts and frayed wires so i did not give it a fair shot i went ahead and got a different brand and i love that one,34,62
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i had the surprise than there is not reception on the radio I have been really disappointed with this purchase beside I have lost sound when the helmet moving to the left because the cable is not real fixed even the bluetooth is ok,42,63
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,overall this is an ok model the speakers could be a little louder but other than that and trouble pairing and connecting to my mp3 not bad,27,64
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,thisis still under review so far it works great in the city but once you hit the freeway forget about it it is useless,25,65
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,this communication device is great to have it makes riding more ejoyable it syncs easily to cell phone for easy listening of play selections in additon to fm radio securely fits on the side of the helmet the only minor issue is the loud beeping sound for incoming calls would definitely recommend,52,66
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product is ok and does what it says it is nice to have a dial for the radio that tells you the station you are on and it has worked with no issues the only problem i have with is is exactly what i have seen others already say the volume on this sucks if you are going more than 45 mph you will not hear anything or if you have any type of loud or aftermarket mufflers on your bike forget it i would find something better,89,67
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,i bought this device to enjoy while commuting around the phoenix metropolitan area it continually loses connection with my phone I have tried mp3s streaming audio podcasts music a variety of media it does not matter the source this device will not maintain a constant link with my phone i originally thought it was my phone I have reinstalled apps and players and sure enough when i use headphones i have no problems my phone plays for hours without any problems when i sync with the blinc m2 it may work for 20 minutes it may work for 2 min I have cleared and re-synced the blinc m2 with my phone several times without success heres the kicker the fm radio feature is terrible I am using this device in and around phoenix az where i can literally see the transmitting tower on south mountain this thing will have a signal for 30 seconds then go to complete static and lose the station tune it to a different channel and you may hear it clearly for 10 seconds before it is overcome by static how can i give it one star i got one phone call without a problem save your money get something better,199,68
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,nifty little gadget works well solid connection to phone notice that voice prompts from my phone do not come in over the headhones but I shall figure it out also the multifunction button is one of those buttons that can be difficult to press if you know what i mean sometimes you need to press the button or hold the button for different periods of time and it can get a little confusing when you are not sure whether you are actually pressing the button or not especially not good on a bike,89,69
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i had to order thistwice first one had a very weak bluetooth signal the m2 was also not loud so i returned thethe 2nd m2 i recieved works great amazon was great and hassle free with the exchange thanks amazon,44,70
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this unit works good for music loud an undistorted when it comes to bike to bike or a phone call forget it you will not hear them unless your stopped,29,71
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i have been using this product for a few weeks now i do enjoy it i had some trouble with the fm tuner but works well where i am now unfortunately it does not sync to gps models out there but will sync to just about any phone even my really old motorola razor that is pretty handy if you have gps on your phone speakers are great,68,72
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,these are ok but i fear ruining an arai helmet to put them in they come with 3 m tape and velcro pads i suggest they have better velcro,28,73
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,does what it says works just fine i do warn you do not over tighten the clip base i have it linked to my htc evo could use some improvement the speakers work good but would be nice if the unit had a equalizer setting not enough bass presets for the fm tuner would be great better antenna and fm and mp3 buttons are kinda hard to find with gloves on other than that it is still an awesome device,75,74
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i have a helmet with a version of this integrated into the helmet and love it my wife however did not have one and since we often ride together she had to have one too but we already had a helmet it took about 2 min to install and works great all we had to modify is a spacer behind the speaker to get it closer to her for clarity has fm radio and bluetooth capability also after pairing they act as an intercom that is one button to start and stop a conversation i think the integrated version is a lot less bulky but they added a few more buttons on this version so it is pretty user friendly and the ability to temporarily mount it with the clip means it can move to the next helmet if my next helmet is not integrated with one i will have to buy another like this one,155,75
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,very good product very clear sound when riding and easy to use connects with no issues and has great battery life,21,76
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,well the only positive thing is that it mounts nice and installation is easy speakers are weak mic picks up every noise if u have a bike bigger than a honda 50 or go more than 15 mph this product will be a let down,44,77
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,i bought thiswith the hopes that i could ride easily without breaking the law using earbuds what i got in return was an expensive and broken product support is non-existent from the manufacturer install was easy once i figured it out the instructions were not very good that came with it after 2 weeks of use the bluetooth reciever was busted i sent it back to amazon for a refund now the speakers that came with it were terrible the mic was very good although but really do not waste your money your better off getting a pair of 30 dollar over the ear headphones and modifying them to fit in your helmet like what i just did,117,78
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i listen to my music mostly and answer my calls that is all i need only one complaint is the speakers need to be upgraded or upgradeable i am still looking but i still have not found anything to replace the speakers with but once again it still gives me what i want for the price,55,79
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,the bluetooth is great if you like to listen to music as you ride and with the fm feature i can still catch my morning radio show with traffic updates too i advise every rider to get one as soon as possible,39,80
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this is a great product from any way you look 1 it has fm radio function is great the only point against is that every so often about every 25 minutes off i guess this function for saving energy security in case you forget to turn off 2 excellent volume but this aspect should be very careful for safety and to hear the other cars around us the sound of this product is very good but a bit lacking in bass when you plug your phone as mp3 player it is great fun and makes you a ride or simply the way home or work 3 the multifunction button does not seem very strong construction so you must use care not to damage it the button is very easy to use even if you use gloves to handle your motorcycle 4 for sure if you need to leave and locked the helmet on your motorcycle you can remove the bluetooth 5 the battery lasts a very short two days if you do not use a lot without many calls or listen to radio,182,81
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,this product is not universal if you got a hjc helmet forget it the instructions are also poor quality that do not thoroughly explain the installation process disappointed to say the least,31,82
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,i purchased 2 of these and i feel it was worth the money i can hear the music at highway speeds clearly however the intercom function is a different story it works well up to about 40 - 50 mph then there is a lot of distortion overall i am pleased with my purchase and i would recommend this product to others by the way i have full faced helmets,68,83
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,i compared kher products and they just do not hold up the blink is easy to nstall and has the longest battery life out of all the bluetooth devices I have ever used,31,84
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoy robin hobbs work but i do not know if i can truly say i enjoyed reading forest mage it turns everything we saw in shamans crossing on it is head and indeed shamans crossing becomes simply a prologue to nevares ongoing story the book itself is relentless and challenging and i suppose that serves to give us someof the life nevare finds himself facing at the end of shamans crossing we thought nevare had triumphed over multiple adversaries and he had but won those battles only to lose the war we meet new characters and old friends return almost all changed for better or worse save epiny who is the strange combination of selfless and selfish she always was lastly the magic of nevares world is really a character all of it is own in this book in a way rarely seen in fantasy fiction forest mage is an enthralling story but one that is truly in the mold of the empire strikes back only bad things happen and the protagonists world is in ruins at it is end i look forward to the final soldiers son volume and hope to truly enjoy reading it,198,0
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoyed reading forest mage the storyline was well written and character development good i look forward to reading book three i would recommend this book,26,1
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,a very disappointing story if you have already read robin hobbs fantastic fitz and the fool series there are flashes of her incredible skill with words as she weaves some beautiful forest imagery but the story drags and could have been much shorter i did not read the first book and will not read the third in justice to robin hobb every writer has to begin crafting her talent somewhere let us have more novels of the same quality as the farseer trilogy can not wait,82,2
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,ok it took me a little while to get to the end of this series but the journey while mildly uncomfortable leads to a conclusion that is profound and touching i was amazed at the talent displayed here because it seems the author is treading such a fine line most of the time there are certain times in the book when you know that if it had been written differently it would have been offensive and/or uncomfortable to an utterly extreme level but the artistry behind the way robin herds your brain into thinking about something a certain way is plainly astounding it is an intelligent book and it requires a certain appreciation for the writing that i think might escape some but for others it is well worth the read,130,3
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,hobb effortlessly transports you to a new world to follow the life of a soldiers son in gernia beautifully captivating and incredibly detailed side note you will get hungry,29,4
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this is not my first time reading forest mage but it is my first time really giving it enough thought to review it i do not know that i can be disappointed with hobbs works it just does not seem like a possibility for me the balance of introspection and activity makes this book a true first-person wonder the richness of the world around nevare rivals our own world gernia is a real place it is that simple it is just a different reality from ours forest mage truly feels like hobb has traveled to that place plucked a book from their world and brought it back for us to enjoy this is simply a masterpiece of storytelling and one i am pleased to have uncovered fantasy lovers hobb is well worth your time i promise it,132,5
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,the entire story in this book could be summed up in a few chapters and tacked on to shamans crossing or renegades magic i love robin hobb and I have read all of her farseer-related works but this series is just painful to read book one was not a masterpiece but it had promise it was slow but i thought it was leading up to action in this book except this book is even more ponderous more plodding more woe-is-me no action 50 different ways of saying the same thing until she has filled enough space to sell it as a trilogy i wish i could say to slog through because book 3 gets better but honestly it does not although at least the plot has action in book 3 in this one it is just pages of introspection and pity partying i read through the series just so i could have resolution but i do not think I shall pick it up again,157,6
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,the creativity of robin hobb never ceases to amaze me when so many writers are incredibly predictable she continues to keep you guessing,23,7
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,the second book keeps you on your toes following all the characters it is another great book by robin hobb,20,8
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,great book by one of my favorite writers robin hobb weaves sociological issues seamlessly into her novels without disrupting the narrative this book put me in the body of a big fat man with all of the self loathing and prejudice from others that goes with it her hero goes from the usual fit young soldier-officer-student into a morbidly obese misfit i found myself cringing and understanding what it must be like a writer of courage and vision,78,9
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i have never read an author male or female who takes such pleasure in breaking down the main character in such a way that she does after reading the tawny man trilogy i tried to start th e soldiers son books i loved the fits so i finished the series even although she tortured that poor kid but as soon as i got to the part where the main character gets fat and loses everything i realized this author hates guys period,82,10
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this is the third book of the soldier son trilogy and just like all of robin hobbs other trilogies it is brilliant the depth of the storyline is mind blowing and each and every character is poignant real and intrinsic to the story,43,11
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i have not had to read as much repetition in any book ever the writer ether has alzheimers or believes the reader must,23,12
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i feel like you could skip this entire book because nothing happens i still have not read the 3rd one because I am just bored with the whole series i love robin hobbs writing definitely and the forest mage is full of beautiful descriptive language that really makes you see the scenes and you really understand nevare but the thing is i guess i am used to fantasy where the hero accepts the strange magic dumped into his life sooner seriously you do not spend 2 whole books with frodo refusing to believe the ring is magical or rand althor wandering in the forest refusing to believe any of this has anything to do with him i am annoyed by how reluctant nevare is to accept that magic is real so yeah i think you could skip this book and just go to the third one because nothing important happens just read the wiki instead,152,13
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i loved all your other books / series i got this one because of that but i found none of the great qualities of your writing in this book at all i surprised your publisher allowed it really a disappointment,38,14
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i enjoyed other books by robin and so i bought this one it is an interesting concept and although it is draw out at times i like the book,29,15
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,this series is fantastic i love the changes with the characters through all they have to endure will have to try out another series by this same author,28,16
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,it defies logic but i could not put these books down even although i thought they were quite awful hobb is that talented at writing if you want a quick review of this book it goes like this he nevare gets fat people laugh he gets fatter people start to hate him he gets fatter everyone hates him he gets obscenely fat and realizes it is due to speck magic yes being able to use magic turns you into an obese creature whom i can only assume resembles jaba the hutt from star wars yet i still read it because hobb writes so well it lulls you in trust me it is totally not worth it,113,17
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,it become very boring and tended to draw out in so many places i know however this needed to happen once i started book 3 this one was disappointing,29,18
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,robin hobb writes such a good book this series is slow to start but then not long and you are hooked you fall in love with the characters well maybe not in love but you have so much empathy for them you just have to know what happens and you want to know them all of them enjoy this series soldier son will stay with you for some time,71,19
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,another good story from robin hobb charactors so real they leave you frustrated with them a easy to read novel that leaves you wanting to pick up the following book to see how the saga will end,37,20
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,just was not what i thought it was going to be i loved the first one this just turned into how bad can we make neveares life and it was not fun to read,34,21
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,very underated by most reviews I have read if you like hobbs you will like this although it is not action packed throughout she makes up for it in stunning detail and riviting story I have read nearly everything she has put out and never even knew about this series until i dug a little deeper in her website I am glad i did because the story of nevare burvelle is one i will always remember,71,22
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,another excellent book from robin hobb a well written final book in the soldiers son trilogy strong and interesting characters riveting plot and great imagery hobb is one of the leading authors in the sci / fi fantasy field and this series is amongst her best work,45,23
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge robin hobb fan especially after reading the farseer and liveship traders trilogies i also really liked shamans crossing the first book in the soldier son trilogy but after reading forest mage i am afraid to read any more of robins books forest mage was a brutal and awful book with very few redeeming qualities there is so much more that could have been done with nevares character instead i found him obsequious disgusting and cowardly and that opinion has not a thing to do with the fact that in this book nevare is battling magic-induced obesity it has more to do with his depravity he was an amazing character in shamans crossing but now i actually despise him and do not want to read another word about him i kept hoping as i read on and on skimming some of the worst passages that things would improve that nevare would do something to make me like him again but it never happened if i had not been on an eight hour transatlantic flight with just this book i would have stopped reading it which is something i rarely do robin hobb what were you thinking,198,24
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,once again i read reviews bemoaning lack of action and emo if you have read the first book you know by now that there are not any epic battles with swords or guns you also know that you are journeying with a man through all of his thoughts and fears what is different in this book is the emotional intensity of navarres experiences relationships are destroyed i mean not just killed but ground into the dust revived and then beaten back down for good measure navarre is often helpless frustratingly so and i yelled at him quite a bit although a lot of the time I am not sure i would have made a better decision the problem is none of the choices are great choices there is nothing that will make everything right that is true enough in the real world but in this one there is powerful magic to distort and magnify everything little is left for human dignity well this book kind of took me through the emotional wringer in a lot of ways and it is hard to believe there is another one i read it pretty much non-stop,189,25
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,I have liked hobbs other series but had not read the soldier son trilogy i read the first shamans crossing and thought it was not quite on the same high level but ok I shall reserve judgment I have just read forest mage and will not read the final title forest mage shows the hero at the beginning as in a bad way removed from the past prospects that he originally had he is essentially down and out the novel then proceeds to show him failing at every single test at the end he is a despised fugitive from society his family the law all of this is unmerited and he is entirely passive if anyone enjoys reading a fantasy of complete destruction of the main character then this is the novel for you making it even more amazing he is touched with magic but never comes to the smallest understanding whatsoever about himself or the nature of the magic nicely written as always if the reader is not depressed at the outset then his / her depression is guaranteed by the end of this sodden fantasy no stars a failure,184,26
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,amazing world beautifully described and fast-flowing this book is one of the very few i have ever read twice ranking with enders game lord of the rings and orwells 1984,30,27
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i was disappointed in this book partly because my expectations of robin hobb are so high her characterisations are excellent her plots full and thought provoking she writes with a passion and makes you think about your own assumptions and actions but in this book nevare burvelle is fitzchivalry farseer the protaganists are so similar that it quite spoiled the book both are procrastinators both are cursed with an unacceptable magic both are forced to break all ties with their family and end up being believed dead by the ones they love both share a similar morality the list goes on robin hobb has simply recreated a character that she lovingly brought to a conclusion once before i still enjoyed the book enough to read it and the next one but this will not be one of my all time favourites unlike her previous works,146,28
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i got very engrossed in this trilogy the second and third books more than the first however i think it is worth noting that for some readers these books may be triggering for body and eating issues however if you are okay to read books that discuss eating and body shame forge on the series is fascinating and unique,58,29
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,received within two weeks which is excellent at my location small city in mindanao island southern philippines condition almost as new give highest recommendation to this supplier i did order anotherbook 3 in same series from a different supplier unfortunately not available at this one but still waiting for it to arrive,55,30
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have a 3 hour commute each day and survive that by audio books i am so excited to hear robins work that i can not wait to get on my way each morning john keating is a gifted storyteller and robin must be happy with his treatment of forest mage as well as the rest of the series what i am most in awe of is robins swift arrow to the bulls eye of being fat and how the world looks at you as one who is overweight and has been for most of my life this work has stirred me the story is fascinating to me with rich real characters and a stunning world of magic and misery you rock robin,122,31
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,although i read the whole series i did not particularly enjoy it I am not sure what kept me going but i think it was my loyalty to the author I am a huge fan of her other series including liveship and assassin / farseer this series could have been written by another author the characters were too few and too simple one of my most favorite things about hobbs books are that her characters are so dynamic you can relate to them they change over time and there are so many while technically this world is as creative and as original as her others i did not find the overall reading experience pleasurable most of the time i was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines if you are a fan of hobb and looking to explore this series I had say you are better off missing out if you are new to the author please for the love of god start with another of her trilogies,162,32
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have read a lot of robin hobb and believe she has to be my perfect soul mate the story of the soldiers son is compelling as usual i really like her character development and believe that the individuals who gave marginal reviews of this book are simply not developed characters themselves yet I am still a work in progress too the philosophy of her main characters the good guys clearly illustrates the battles we all wage on the road to being good people and does so in an entertaining fashion the bad guys are extremely frustrating and well constructed call me robin,102,33
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this has got to be one of the biggest bore i have read in many years i actually have read her farseer series and enjoyed it til the end and enjoyed the first one of the soldier son trilogy but i agree with also known as diary of a depressed fat man s review this is absolutely one of the worst books i have read in ages and i tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else i could not stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up not going to read the final book it is that depressing i started on way of kings instead and that is so much more satisfying,121,34
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i agree with gr johnsons review with one addition of the characters total stupidity i have never wanted to smack a character so bad in my life,27,35
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i greatly enjoyed other series by this author for examplethe farseer series but this series has been a big disappointment i thought the 1st book was ok and hoped the forest mage would break free however this volume crashed and burned for me i do not understand the authors equating obesity with magic maybe it will all come clear in the last book but i will not read it so i will not know it sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight this book was hugely depressing and i can not fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book i lost interest in nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing as well as having many obscure plot moments what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the plains folk magic weird once i find an author i enjoy i generally trust them and buy future books without much thought however I am afraid i will check the reviews very closely before i buy another one,173,36
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,again i was surprised that i enjoyed this book i had read the reviews for the second book and was again cautiously pessimistic at what was to come with that said i must say that i enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one i enjoyed the pacing and story my only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking other then that i like the world she created and the characters as well if you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you he is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero he has kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation i find it entirely very interesting although i think the author is at her best with this story the story might not be as enticing as the farseer series but her writing is topnotch,171,37
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i personally need to see a protagonist to get through a book and this series offers none i never cared about the main character and by the first quarter of the second book i hated him the characters seem to follow a script rather than a pattern of normal behavior and this becomes blindingly obvious when he gets fat and everyone rejects him to the point that they want to kill him conflict is driven by a malicious unseen force that no one has any hope of overcoming it is like reading about a hobo who walks along a train track knowing that he has going to get hit by a train and he keeps walking and he has got his wife and kids with him but i do not care about the hobos family either because i have no reason to there is no good or bad it seems just a constant force of nature that is going to kill everything but it happens three books too late i did not finish the third book i got so sick of all of it do not waste your time with any of them bad plot devices and worse character writing tied together with an awful story,199,38
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this book was part of the authors last trilogy it was good but not as fascinating as the twelve books in four trilogys that she had written before i will keep them and add to my permanent library but just saying it is not my favorite,46,39
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,definately not up to the standards that her previous books have set the story was intriguing but the entire series seemed to drag on and on and on could have done this easy in two books,36,40
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,ok i set this book down at page 211 i had pretty much given up hearing about nevares weight issues come on already i started reading another book and i just could not get into that one so i decided to pick up forest mage again and give it a shot well long story short I am glad i did i enjoy the depth of characterization ms hobb creates for the most part i also enjoy the story of the day to day struggles of nevare and his ability to overcome nevare is flawed which makes him a more interesting real subject as are all the others in the book ms hobb has a gift for fleshing out the characters and the story a sign of a good book for me is reading at every opportunity forest mage has turned into that type of book i look forward to the next installment,148,41
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this book was completely depressing as well as utterly dull wasts of time and money,15,42
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge fan of the earlier books that hobb wrote when i discovered this series i immediately bought both books the first book seemed to drag a bit for the first 60 of the book but i soldiered through it giving the author the benefit of the doubt that it was setup for the larger story i started the second book glad that we got all the setup behind us and could move forward how wrong i was this book was a challenge to try and get through and i have no intention of buying the third book I have been punished enough already,106,43
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i am a huge fan of robibn hobbs and consider the farseer and tawny man trilogies among the best books i have ever read i have not read the liveship series because they sounded sort of dumb i had high hopes for this book because i really enjoyed the first one in the series hobb has a way of really bringing believable characters to life and shamans crossing was more of the same however the more i read forest mage the more appalled i became the minute nevare began to gain weight he was insulted and shunned by everyone except the specks i think only one character at the end was nice to him i am hoping that the reviewer who called nevare a fat slob was being fasecious and not as insulting as hobb i wonder if hobb is working through some issues of her own and chose to explore them in this text i will not be wasting my time with renegades magic and although i will continue to enjoy the previous trilogies again and again i will view her future novels with skepticism,186,44
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,the first book had the small benefit of leaving hope that a plot would eventually start to evolve or at least characters would become interesting to the reader after the first 100 pages of the second book in the series it is obvious that this is going nowhere beware the 5 star reviews who admit it is slow but it is tedious period,59,45
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i was not sure what to think at the end of book 1 but I am hopeful for book 3 now I have accepted that i do not like these characters or the settings as much as her other trilogies but i think finally i can get the main character and finally we get to the meat of the books the issues that the main character faced were interesting but quite frankly i found them uncomfortable once i decided that i was really into the book although i realized that it gave the novel a pretty unique twist,94,46
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i consider the ' assassins ' series one of the top ten fantasy series I have ever read and I have read a lot therefore it was with keen interest that i picked up the ' forest mage especially after reading the first book ' shamans crossing this book should have been titled ' diary of a depressed fat man yes i like complex character development it is one of the reasons why the assassins series was so good but give me a break i stayed up till 230am finishing this book not because it was so captivating but because i could not believe it would not somehow get better and justify the time i wasted reading it let me save you the time he gets fat everyone hates him he discovers that he has magic but does not know how to use it he is still fat,139,47
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i noticed that a lot of people are giving this book bad reviews i wholeheartedly disagree with them it has been ages since i have picked up such a well-thought out book in the fantasy genre hobbs nevere faces challenges which frankly any of us would have trouble with live the way of your own people and be scorned or adopt a new culture who welcomes you with open arms and betray your people the fat stigma which nevere faces was well chosen as this is something that hits home with readers our culture too despises fat readers can face the same internal loathing as nevere there are no easy answers no sudden magical solution no sugar-coating just good insightful writing,119,48
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,nevare was the least likable character in the book arthur w jordin in comments to other reviewers keeps telling people to become more familiar with western history as if the world of nevare is real get real art this is fantasy and not very good I shall keep slogging in renegade just to find out how it all ends but will probably just skim it there were other more interesting characters in this book that could have been developed to make it a good read epiny yari actually nevare was portrayed as a poor stereotype of a female from some misogynist novel,101,49
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,forest mage by robin hobb takes up where the first book left off and it does not miss a beat i was so caught up that i could not put the book down good stuff this is what i call fantasy at it is bestshamans crossing book one of the soldier son trilogy forest mage the soldier son trilogy book 2 renegades magic the soldier son trilogy book 3,73,50
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,if you enjoy books about characters who have a million and one problems but never seek out solutions for them congratulations forest mage just might be the book for you imagine a man who is slowly being overtaken by a controlling magic he does not want is being impinged upon by an unwanted personality who makes him do evilly evil things any other writer might make their main character fight their own fate but not robin hobb and we love her for it and do not worry even if nevare seems to be making an attempt to turn his life around take a deep breath and relax because he will not hell have sex with a speck instead and then complain about it later,123,51
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,after having written 9 of the greatest books of all time i can see how anything else she wrote would pale in comparison but after struggling through the first book of this trilogy and looking forward to some substance i was disappointed it was more ameteur romance and it took forever for anything to happen basically i read 700 pages to really only get excited for the last 6 i will still read the last one although and i still love robin hobb,83,52
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,you go into this book and you think a certain event is going to occur that moves the story along you think it will happen in the first 100 pages but at the very worst by the end of this book but here it does not maybe this event will happen in book 3 meanwhile 500 pages in which 400 of them serve no useful purpose in moving the storyline along this is a classic filler middle book of a trilogy it is not very exciting not very interesting not worth reading this is sad as when megan lindholm is on it she rocks she has not here,105,53
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i love reading robin hobbs but my god is she gut wrenching i love the outdoors and forests are a real treat for me but after reading forest mage i wanted to buy a chainsaw and head for the nearest redwood what the main character in this book went through and all the people that died around him because of his curse was just terrible rarely does a fantasy book get so gritty but that is what robin does best in a time when the bookshelves are loaded with mundane writers robin shines can not wait for the next one,100,54
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i love robin hobbs previous books but this trilogy does nothing but dissapoint sure the writing is still wonderful and williams style is essentially unchanged however the main character is just so unlikable he is whiny melodramatic and annoying this made it really hard to get in to the book because you just do not care what has going on all of the genuinely likable characters seem to throw themselves in the way of the often well deserved troubles of the protanginst all in all the books well written imagary and well rounded characters just can not save this book from it is protaginist,100,55
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i love robin hobbs books she writes wonderfully and attaches you to the characters in her story when i started reading forest mage i was once again pulled in by her first person writing and attention to detail i could feel nevares pain and humiliation unfortunately the pain was to acute and i could not make it past page 200 when i realized that he would never loose the weight that he had been cursed with from the speck plague hobbs writes this tale of a man cursed with majic fat this fat can not be lost through diet or excercise the fat changes the way people perceive him gets him kicked out of the academy and disowned by his family i would love to know all that happens but the first person telling of this poor mans distruction was to difficult i stopped reading this book several months ago but i can not get nevare and his plight out of my mind i mourn the loss of this book and hope that one day i will be able to confront nevares life again i highly recommend her other three series i could not put them down,195,56
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this had to be one of the most relentlessly miserable and depressing books I have read in a long time absolutely nothing good happens to anyone and it spirals into one disaster after another with nothing to redeem it or any of the characters I had strongly recommend avoiding it,48,57
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,every time i pick up a robin hobb book i seem to lose days of my life i just finished forest mage and somehow read the 700 page book in less than 3 days do not tell my boss i was very sad when i finished the farseer liveship and fool trilogies luckily the soldiers son books have brought me right back to the vivid worlds of hobbs imagination no the soldiers son books are not in the same world as the farseer ones were but the world is just as imaginative forest mage the second book in the series follows nevare as he travels home from the academy to widevale for his brothers wedding he expects a happy reunion in much the same way he expects a happy and promising future afterall he survived the speck plague and defeated the tree woman and severed her power over him or so he thought no doubt about it this book is tough to read because nevares suffering is brutal but you will not be able to put it down,176,58
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,the soldier son trilogy is nearly as good as the farseer / liveship stories the first book takes a little effort to get into but the second one is strong from the first page this prolific author deserves praise and attention,39,59
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,robin hobb does not disappoint in this latest offering i was transported into this delightful saga i did not want to come up for air more please,25,60
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,interesting characters well developed storylines great imagination i was a bit disappointed in the darkness of this second book of the series but ms hobb is an excellent storyteller,29,61
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,a really long awaited sequel to book one i could not wait to get my hands on it i was not dissappointed vintage hobb read it practically in one session yes i guess it is crazy but books from this author do it to you definitely a must read book,50,62
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this book is serious fiction it deals with some very difficult issues in an interesting if not entertaining way a great writer will sometime make a difficult subject easy to read hobb is a good writer so the story sometimes seems hard to read this is not a book to take to the beach but it is a very important book and well worth reading,66,63
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,hobbs tale casts the forest and human progress as antagonists neither are without sin the peoples of the forest and of the king suffer but no one suffers more than nevarre who is caught between the two worlds in volume two hobb abandons any pretense of a heroic main character turning him grotesquely fat cutting him off from home society and all that could give him support the pacing is slow but the telling is rich nevarres slow understanding and acceptance of what is happening to him and his world is all the more believable for his not accepting the changes too easily too quickly,105,64
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,gosh but i feel even more sorry for this guy hurry up and write the third,16,65
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i have read everything that i could find by robin hobb and this latest installment is great i do not know of another sci-fi authoor who can weave a story with such complexity and still allow the reader to care about the characters involved forrest mage is full of suprizes as well as explanations and i can not wait for the next book to come out,64,66
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i absolutely love robin hobbs style you may actually dislike a character or what they are becoming but still can not stop reading in this book the main character struggles between two worlds and you actually struggle with him even to the point of disliking what he is becoming but in the end when the final decision is made you want to stand up and cheer for him overall a very enjoyable book from start to finish,77,67
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,forest mage is a refreshing exception to the usual fantasy book formula the narrating character is wonderfully and believably imperfect the plot revolves around challenges to and changes in his psyche detailing his internal journey of self-discovery rather than relying as so many books do on a clear-cut good-versus-bad conflicts i imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow but those who take an interest in a characters internal development will have trouble putting it down although i must add that once you adjust to the pace there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy with a touch of horror for spice i found it quite gripping robin hobb has once again demonstrated her masterful skill in creating complex and fascinating characters and everything from the storyline to the setting reflects this an excellent read,151,68
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,this story has no redeeming value at all the primary character is portrait as a fat slob who can not do anything of significant not only is his life a waste but this story is a waste do not buy it,40,69
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,excellent i loved this book but i love all of robin hobbs books to date i can not wait for the next book in the series the thing i love most about her writing is you can close your eyes and see exactly what she has describing she has a one of a kind writer if you have not read anything by her you must if you have then you will love this series as well i still miss fitz,76,70
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,this is the second book of robin hobbs latest trilogy but it reads like she has trying to start right over again in less then three chapters the young cavalry officer from the first book turns into a self hating tub of lard theof a fat hero is rather original but the appeal ends there he just gets fatter and fatter more full of magic and periodically makes some social blunder or has sex with a who are the sex scenes are both frequent and disgusting with far to many details i was considering throwing this into the donation bin at a libaray or perhaps a book burning but i did eventually finish it the suprise ending is somewhat original even interesting but not nearly enough to save this train wreck hobb was clearly trying something new here and that is always something that should be cheered but it might have all worked out much better if she would stuck with the handsome naive officer cadet instead of the depressing loathsome fatass,171,71
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i was not sure i liked this book in the beginning nevare was not a character i especially liked in the first volume of this trilogy and i thought my feelings for him were not going to change and they did not not until the final few paragraphs of forest mage a few paragraphs that i found such a perfect ending that it completely redemed nevare for me as for the rest of the book i did not find it depressing at all just totally engrossing i did not do much of anything for a day and half but read this book i love robin hobbs world-building her way of creating such marvelous cultures and mythologies this book was no exception the forest the specks the walkers i loved all of it and would happily have continued reading for another 700 pages can not wait till volume 3 this story is going to haunt me until i can finally read the ending thanks robin for another enthralling story,163,72
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,i loved this sequel to shamans crossing ms hobb takes her time developing characters some readers find that tedious i love the way it unfolds as the story unwinds you find yourself swept along whether you really want to be or not whether you feel empathy or revulsion you are on a roller-coaster ride of emotions ms hobbs characters are flawed and sometimes you end up slapping your forehead over dumb decisions they make but the point is that you care about them anyway at least i do i can feel the bouts of power and helplessness that navarre struggles with the farseer trilogy is one of my favorite sets of reading i can see similarities between what navarre and fitz suffered is it magic or fate self-sacrifice or hopes for the future i may not always like thecharacter but i can not put the book down because i am always pulling for him i can not wait for book three,161,73
Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,i enjoyed shamans crossing but the main character is quite dense and unlikeable in this second of the series it is something you would read to initiate major depression i was disappointed,31,74
Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,i am a newcomer to the fantasy genre i finished reading george r r martins song ofand fire and while waiting for the next book in the series happened on shamans crossing by accident i was immediately sucked into nevarres world and came to care about him his friends and wanted the mystery of the specks to unfold i found forest mage to be a satisfying continuation of nevarres story there are still many questions unanswered as a mystery fan i love that and nevarre is maturing into a truly flawed but real young man i think with the exception of martin and charlaine harris books i have not looked forward to a sequel with this much anticipation in a very long time,124,75
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,a very solid second novel in the soldier son trilogy robin hobb has once again provided her readers with a rich and brilliant world to explore I have heard slow and tedious many times from people knocking her works farseer and soldier son both but hobb fans will tell you that neither are true and that she is one of the very best at taking the time to develop a world for her characters and their conflicts i highly recommend this novel to any fantasy reader and especially to those who have loved hobbs work in the past,97,76
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,i loved the farseer series it is in my top 5 of all time this however disappoints it is boring tedious long winded and has a main character that is hard to like not through any fault of his own i did not like and unfortunately will inspect all of robins works in the future more closely before buying,59,77
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed with this book i was over 150 pages into the book before i was past what it said on the book jacket i also did not like that so much of the book was contrived and i did not think there was enough happening i thought there were a lot of loose ends too i will definately not pre-order his next book before thumbing through it myself,69,0
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,much better than his last novel very hard to put down a real page turner,15,1
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,as a big koontz fan and one anxiously awaiting the third book of the moonlight bay trilogy i had missed this title for some reason and i eagerly checked it out to read when i discovered it for the most part i was disappointed i only give two stars because the first half of the book which unfortunately is nothing but a ridiculous red herring the boyfriend of the mom should be in different book really actually had me intrigued enough to read on i also did not mind the plot twist regarding the doctor but not the way it was resolved however i was largely unsympathetic towards the protagonist and his love interest and the ending failed to resolve anything in that regard in fact the ending i would almost classify it as an epilogue was so bad i almost tossed by tablet down in disgust oh and the supernatural element does not really work in this book,160,2
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this is my second reading of this book mr koontz always keeps your attention the way he uses subtext as he has educating you on subtext was so clever the entire time i tried to figure out what he was trying to saymr koontz for another great read,49,3
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a dean koontz fan so good bad indifferent i enjoy his books for what they all are at heart entertainment i would read again buy again and buy from same vendor book ordered and arrived in manner i expect when making purchases on amazon,45,4
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,that said i wanted to stop after 100 pages 150 pages should have stopped after 200 pages am kicking myself for not stopping after 250 pages and more etc and more what a complete bore i hated the stupidity of the story i hated all of the characters the book was not thrilling exciting scary or mysterious a snoozer,61,5
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,worst dean koontz book i have ever read very disappointing i think nowadays he is just writing to make money,20,6
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,really really enjoyed this book all the way through except for the ending i think most people will love the ending but it was not what i was hoping for definitely going to be reading more dean koontz books,38,7
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a big dean koontz fan so i can say with some authority that this book is terrible do not waste your time,22,8

Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love it he always keeps you guessing,8,11
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was not a huge fan of this instead of the in-depth characters and plots that koontz is known for this was a book that just lightly skimmed the surface of his normal writing it was bland with characters that were vanilla and boring and several things just never worked with the book including plot points that went nowhere and a total lack of compassion or caring for the characters things happened that just were not logical but the reader was supposed to just follow along and it just did not work overall unless you are a die-hard fan of koontz skip this one it is far from his best work and it really was a disappointment,114,12
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this novel is a bit different from the usual koontz novel as always it is well-written and it keeps you guessing until the end,24,13
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,now i have two of them oops can not get enough of dean koontz,13,14
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,good book not one of koontzs best but still entertaining,10,15
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i can not help but feel uplifted after reading any of mr koontzs books this one was no exception i love how his characters develop and become more human to me as the story progresses,34,16
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,took a few unexpected twists and turns as always well written and a page turner especially in the last half,20,17
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,awhile ago i started to read this book and when i was just over half way done the book started over i guess it was a problem with the printer anyway i can not believe it took so long to read this book i loved everything about it so many twist and turns i wonder if i would have been able to read all the clues nevertheless i enjoyed this book very much,72,18
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,the main character ryan is a self-made success living the good life in the middle of it all he becomes I shall needing a heart transplant after the operation strange things start to happen and soon it is obvious that someone is out to get vengeance for the donor of that heart lots of suspense and also very sad at times enjoyed it,62,19
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have to be honest and say up front that i did not finish this book instead of the heart thundering suspense that i normally experience when reading something by dean koontz boredom was the only thing i felt i can not give away any spoilers i see at least one review that has done that already i was little more than halfway through when i decided to check the reviews something i usually do not do until i finish a book the details about the second half which were revealed were enough for me to know that i need not bother finishing i have a couple of odd thomas books waiting to be read i would have given only one start but so many of the descriptions of mundane things were so well-written as in other books koontz was able to paint many pictures with far fewer than a thousand words still it was just boring,154,20
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this story was a real let down i thought from reading the description that the book was going to be a heart-stopping thriller instead it was more like boring amateur hour in book writing the characters were 2 dimensional at most no one was complicated they were either good bad or confused the plot flat-lined and could not be brought back to life this book was a waste of my time and energy but at least i only paid a dollar for it,83,21
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have come to expect witty repartee complicated but clear story lines from dean koontz this book to me was overly complicated with many passages bogged down by expansive and unnecessary rhetoric when violence pops up like a deranged whack a mole it seems out of place in what dragged on as a psychological thriller I am sure there has a life lesson in here somewhere I am just too word-weary to care,69,22
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,got this for a gift for my son he is a big dean koontz fan he highly recommends this book,20,23
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,rather rambling and boring hard to pick it back up once i put it down really did not like it,20,24
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,did not like this at all too predictable and trite just the same old theme used by many authors with no new angle and spoiler alert super rich protagonist giving it all up to live as a monk come on,40,25
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,perfectly writtenof your seat wonderment as only koontz can do highly recommended reading you will not be able to put it down,23,26
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,really a good read pretty scary but truly a page-turner,10,27
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,very interesting and suspenseful but not sure what samantha wanted from ryan it was not clear to me and really did not understand the ending but it held my interest to the end also makes you think about where organ donations are coming from guess if you need one you need to ask that question,53,28
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,fascinating book by koontz i know a lot of other people do not like the book but i think they are reading it like an early koontz rather than his more recent work which is more spiritual and philosophical the underlying moral question this book poses is how complicit are we in others suffering because of our wants the corollary question to the answer is then what do we do about it when we recognize our complicity you are not going to find these questions addressed in your typical thriller or mystery i agree that the supernatural religious part of the book did not quite fit but neither did it reduce the power of the message I shall gladly take a book like this over dark rivers of the heart any time,129,29
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the book but it was not as scary as i am used to from dean koonts but still a good read,23,30
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i had read some reviews that said they did not like this book i loved this book as i have loved every dean koontz book i have ever read he is amazing and my all time favorite author thanks mr koontz,41,31
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,good book i like dean koontz because what he writes really could happen it is possibly science future fact and not really science fiction he makes it interesting and hard to put down,33,32
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,such a wonderful read very spiritual i am a fan an this going down as one of my favourites great,20,33
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,dean always keeps me on thewaiting i would have loved for a different ending but enjoyed this book thoroughly,21,34
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a huge reader and thought that this book had a poetic feeling anyone who thought this book was not believable does not realize that a person would do anything they could to preserve life truly one of koontz best books i think the others are quick reads this one has an added depth,52,35
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this was ok i have read more interesting or kept my attention i was about to stop reading but finally got interesting almost over half way,26,36

Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,bravo to dean koontz for having the nerve to cover such a sensitive and important topic I am sure it is not a easy to write about the real-life crime of chinas organ harvesting alongside the complexities of the most profound spiritual movement of our time thanks dean,47,39
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this book is amazing once i started reading i could not stop check i did not want to i can not wait to read another one of his works,26,40
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been the biggest fan since the 1st book i ever read of his love his books and will continue to read as long as he continues to write them,31,41
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,this book has ranked as one of my three favorite koontz books tied with phantoms and watchers the ending was so beautiful i cried i do not understand why people did not like this book it was so creepy and scary that i could not read it at night until i got close to the end and as i said before without giving it away the ending was absolutely beautiful but sad in all i highly recommend this book,79,42
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,this was a gripping story as have been all the dean koontz books I have read to date i have read 4 koontz tales becoming a big fan,27,43
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,enjoyable read for a while kept me saying one more chapter just one more the second part does drag a bit but there is just enough action to keep you going the ending is sweet and the whole book comes together nicely i rented this free on my kindle fire from my local library i noticed it was for sale for 999 i personally am glad i did not spend ten dollars on it i find it is not worth that much money overall if you can find it for free or on sale then it is worth your time happy reading,99,44
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been a fan of dean koontz since i was a kid i think i have just about ever book he has ever written if you love a good story that you can not put down give one of his a try you will not be disappointed,46,45
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,the story was pretty good and kept me engaged i would recommend this book if you are a koontz fan,20,46
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as usual never disappointed in any of his work my favorite author once again proves to anyone why he is,20,47
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i liked the morality aspect of the book the story like threw me a curve because i was sure he was doing the things the candy the lockethimself,29,48
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as usual dean has written a book that is hard to put down until finished keep up the great work,20,49
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,ryan heart has failed and at 34 he has found himself on a waiting list for a new one impatience for life gets the better of him and he searches for a new doctor dr hobbs finds him a heart in record time and the transplant is a success a year later things begin to happen to him that make him wonder if it was all worth it this is a book filled with love suspense danger and a little poe thrown in for good measure this is not my favorite dean koontz book but it is not bad either i think that it was a little slow on the upstart but the ending was fast paced and well worth the reading of the rest of it the subtext of this book is that you can not buy life you just have to live it and let it be as it should be i would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy romance horror and drama i bought this book from a used book store,174,50
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have been trying to catch up with koontzs books for the past several years now although i am still a very long way from completing that task what I have come to expect from mr koontz is well heart his books are far less focused on cheap thrills and gore than some of the other authors that I have read and the results can vary from time to time there is usually a good amount of hope behind his work with this book the heart is there i really do not mean that as a pun but it takes a different form it twists the story and the character in a way that i was not expecting and i quite enjoyed seeing that play out i do not want to give too much away with this review so I shall just leave it at that,139,51
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,to me this is not so much a thriller i guess many would have been disappointed with the mediocre treatment of the story there is no gory death scenes no chasing around the globe adventures and certainly there is not even teeth-gritting intolerance of injustice there are however a good build up of characters a good surprising twists to events and the love between the two protagonists is endearing i have never been moved emotionally by a thriller but this one almost moved me to tears at the end there is forgiveness giving and redemption a very high value of human nature indeed how on earth does dean koontz add these two elements of thriller and spirit all in one novel may not be his greatest work but i like it,131,52
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this review will contain spoilers so be warned this is the first koontz book I have read and thankfully i got it from the library and did not pay money for it the ending made no sense so an internet billionaire up and decides to give away all his money and live in a monastery for lack of a better word yeah sure also it bothered me that the nutjob violet did not get arrested and did not have to pay for her stalking assaulting and near killing him i really wanted violet to get a smackdown so bad yes it sucks that dr hobb was a slimeball and should be persecuted but that was not ryans fault if this is indicative of koontzs stuff I am wary of trying out any more of his books,130,53
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this is without any shadow of a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read oddly enough it is written by an author who has written some of my favorite books I have been a fan of koontz since i read watchers about 25 years ago from that one to odd thomas to life expectancy one of my favorite stories dean koontz has consistantly put out very readable works this one stands alone i oftenor give books I have read and enjoyed to friends and family this one went straight into the garbage as i could not subject anyone that i like to the horrible waste of paper this was i do not know if this was just a publishers deadline book but i can not possibly see what anyone would take away from it as the ending began i actually looked back thru to see if i had missed a portion of the book it failed on so many levels,158,54
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love dean koontz but this was an unexciting read the story line seemed interesting but there was no suspense because i could always see what was coming next i found the ending to be very anticlimactic frankly the entire book felt that way this is a book i wish i had not wasted time on and that is very unusual for a dean koontz book the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because a it is dean koontz and b the story line was interesting,88,55
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,once again koontz concocts a story filled with intrigue and had me guessing as to how it would all turn out the ending to this tale was much much more satisfying than many of his works that have superior writing this was a fun-filled book the pacing of it is a bit different from many of his recent thrillers but it was singular,63,56
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i read koontzs earlier books in the 80s and 90s and pretty much like them this is his 1st book which I have picked up in yonks and i must rate it as a poor excuse for a novel it is extremely draggy and plain boring after the 1st couple of chapters i was wondering if this is the same writer who wrote all those earlier hits this has turned me off getting further koontzs stuff,74,57
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i do not know where this came from but i was disappointed with this read i love to read his stuff but this was not even the same author for me i could not get into the characters and the story it did not capture me at all i kept reading to give it a chance but it never came around i would definitely skip this one there are too many amazing books to read and so little time,75,58
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i read this whole book only because there was no dog in it what is wrong with samantha for breaking up with ryan some how she mysteriously knows he did a really bad thing by using his money to get a heart quickly this woman is supposedly in love with him but then decides he has a piece of garbage for not waiting around in line to die for a heart transplant to top it off she will not even tell him why she broke up with him i do not know why either there is no possible way on earth she could know the circumstances involved around getting his new heart the villain is the sister of ryans unwilling heart donor my question is why go after the rich guy who really does not have a clue about the heart go after the surgeons or his doctor or the organization in china that is killing political prisoners to harvest organs typical women never know where to place the blame,166,59
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i agree with several of the previous posters poorly and no doubt quickly written sorry i just realized most of the postings were over 2 years ago i recently purchased this book in paperback to read on a road trip and this is the first time i have posted a review of a book I have been a fan for years but have to say nothing he has written in the past few years has done anything for me the heart transplant plot could have been taken so much further such as the true stories of heart transplant recipients taking on the habits traits personalities and more of the donors very disappointing,112,60
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,the storyline just did not have enough glue to hold it all together and bounces too far out in too many directions there were many variables that left me thinking that the author was trying to grab for something that was just too far out of reach the first half of the book is a little slow the last half picks up with action but is thin an adjectivally tedious skimmer but that is just my view having said that dean koontz is still my number one author someone sitting next to me could read the same book and easily rate it five stars,103,61
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i actually liked this book mr koontz has always been one of my favorite prolific authors he has changed style as he has gotten older this is a perfect example the plot is a very good one and has a tendency to make one think ryan perry 34 has it all he has made a fortune in the dotcom business he suddenly finds one day he has in dire need of a heart transplant he receives the transplant successfully now his life begins to become very strange and begins unravelling although a very goodfor a story there are parts in which the author leaves loose ends dangling no justice for dr death who apparently murdered ismay clemm the beauty violet for the most part simply vanishes shortly before the end the end holds no great surprises in fact it may be a bit over the top as the love of his life samantha re-enters his much altered life alas possibly too late it does carry some of lifes lessons and may very well leave you thinking of your own life and mortality i just wish the story was packed a bit tighter without the loose ends i still enjoyed the novel,200,62
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,the first 200 pages are summarized on the back of the book seriously it is a horrible sloppy mess of a book that fails to captivate me the ending was immensely unsatisfying this book is a huge disappointment and you should not buy it if you want a good dean koontz novel check out odd thomas or the good guy but stay clear of this monstrosity for it will consume your time and yield no satisfaction,80,63
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i just need to say it what happened to mr koontz I have read almost everything by dean he has one of my favorite writers however this novel is the bottom of the barrel for me these suspense novels are falling short not because they are poorly written but because the dean koontz standard is so high deans imagination is the thing that first drew me to him where are the strange ideas where are the tales of terror where is the cross-genre genius of dean koontz this novel your heart belongs to me is not dean koontz at least the dean koontz that i long to read this story is nothing more than a novella that was fattened-up with endless descriptions of decor lighting and weather i will continue to read koontz but this is not his best,134,64
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,silly book reading it is a waste of time probably his worst yet,13,65
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,sorry but add me to the list of people who thought this was just a really bad book i found myself doing a lot of skipping throughout it because it dragged so painfully slow a lot of parts of the book just did not fit in with the story and once i finished made it more clear just how they were not needed in the book at all he has gotten in the habit of trying to paint a picture for you using a lot of flowery language that make you lose track of what the story is about because you find yourself skimming just to get back to the plot at hand i used to love dean koontzs books and had just started reading him again and so far this is the third book in my list of his latest books that made me wonder what happened to the dean koontz i loved in the 90s,157,66
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i can not believe this was written by koontz his writing is usually uplifting and leaves you better for reading it the ending of this one left me feeling empty and trying to forget i read this at all if you are a fan i strongly recommend you avoid this book it will leave you cold and lacking,56,67
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i enjoy dean koontzs stories although his characters often seem a little too good to be true i actually liked ryan perry because he was a real guy that is not perfect i was hoping the female protagonist samantha would turn out to be the baddie but no such luck this book turned into a rant against the evil moneyed west exploiting the people of the third world yawn and i am getting so tired of surfer lingo and golden retrievers,80,68
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,your heart belongs to me is different than the other dean koontz novels I have read the main character is not as likable the story does not move at as fast a pace in the beginning as most of his tales ryan perry does not know something inside him is broken that something is his heart he needs a transplant but i do not want to say anymore and ruin it that being said the story is brillant i love it just as much as his other novels I am glad i continued reading because if i had stopped in the middle it probably would have recieved three stars very low for a dean koontz book but when near the end all mysteries were revealed and the subtext became clear this was a story of redemption that will stay with me for a long time it deserves five stars,143,69
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this is the weakest koontz novel after reading about two dozen of them I am not saying do not read this one but it should be one of the last koontz books that you read as for recent koontz novels i recommend the husband and velocity over this one the only thing that really saved the good guy was the entertaining serial killer that left me laughing out loud this one here is slllloooooow you have to read 150 pages before something significant happens there has lot of things that do not make sense and once the villain was revealed and her motives i felt cheated i even stopped within the last 10 pages to brush my teeth before bed before actually finishing the book something I have never done with a koontz novel if you have read everything else by koontz by all means read it but i do not recommend paying more than a few dollars for it definitely get it second hand,156,70
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i am wild about the fast pace of koontzs books but this one it started ok but then slowed to a crawl and just dragged on and on before the main character even got his heart transplant the book was half over before anything had even begun to happen then very little does happen the supernatural element was vague confusing and pointless and the climax was like no climax at all it simply left me scratching my head wondering what koontz was thinking the climax ended so abruptly i kept thinking it would start again in the next chapter but no then then romantic interest was a disappointment too the book jacket was better than the book worst fiction book i have read in long time sorry dean love you but this book was bordering on awful but i give it too stars just on your reputation,147,71
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was really disappointed as this story lacked the usual suspence and thrill of a koontz book i kept waiting for the good part to start i was over 3/4 done before i flet i had a hint of that my suggestion is to pick a different koontz book to read,51,72
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,with this novel koontz puts his spin on human transplant donation the story might turn some off to becoming donors or it might even encourage others to become donors so that that happens in this story does not happen as I am sure it does it is like buyer beware especially when it comes to getting body parts story also covers paranoia to the extreme as a paranoid myself it shows how ones mind can do so much harm taking a person to places where no one would ever hope to go fast reading with an interesting main character who starts out as the guy who has everything money can buy but ends up happier after losing almost everything including his own life if you like koontz this book will not disappoint,129,73
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i will agree to the dragging a bit at the begining but i do not agree that it was disappointing the unpredictablity keeps you guessing til the end,27,74
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i thought this was pretty good a little different for dean but good very interesting concept,16,75
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is been a while since I have read a dean koontz novel most of his work s are great however this novel was very slow and hard to get into not the dean koontz that I have enjoyed this book took forever to really get to anything interesting if you really like to wait until the book is almost over for any action to occur this is your book but it really left me a feeling of huh this book did not win me over at all i do not recommend this one sorry out there to all the dean koontz fans,98,76
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,to quote dorothy parker out of context there has no there there this book has no substance whatsoever and whatever suspense is built up in the first half is completely misguided and unfulfilled this is the worst dean koontz book i have ever read stay away it starts out promisingly enough but then you realize it has denigerated into hints of a good book that will never arrive,68,77
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a huge dean koontz fan and was looking forward to reading this book it could have been a really great story but the read turned out to be extremely tedious i skimmed through many many paragraphs which is something I have never done in any of his previous books the story took way too long to tell his never-ending references to subtexts was annoying the characters paranoia with regard to people out to get him was repetitive and extremely tiresome the end was a letdown and all in all the book was a waste of time are we sure dean koontz even wrote this mess,104,78

Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,spoilers i do not have much to say about this book that has not already been said by the other one and two star reviewers I am an avid koontz fan so please do not think i have a vendetta against the author but heres all i have to say you keep me up into the wee hours of the morning with the knowledge of cadaver art and you do not give me the payoff of having the lovers reunite for a happy ending cadaver art without true love prevailing that is just cold,88,81
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love to read dean koontzs books because i never know where they are going to take me they have an underlying theme that runs through the book but is not stated but implied this book is about grace and mercy and that there are consequences to each of our actions when we extend grace and mercy to others it is extended back to us i do not want to say more because it would spoil the ending i simply enjoyed the reading,81,82
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,may not be the sellers fault but this book was a misprint changes in the end to the beginning never did find the end of the book,27,83
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have two favorite authors of the macrabra kind stephen king and dean koontz write alike and hold people enthralled to the last word dean has out done himself with your heart belongs to me i found each chapter to good to put down i had nowho was tormenting him then the end was a real surprise i read this book in three hours my husband was not happy with me but it surely was worth it keep on bringing these books out dean i love them,87,84
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,anything koontz writes is always entertaing from odd to supernatural his heros and villens both will keep you turning the pages trying to determine which direction the story is taking you,31,85
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i needed a book to read on a continental flight from houston back to sacramento so i bought this book at a wal-mart near the hotel i finished the book in 39 minutes and spent the rest of the flight about 90 minutes or so enjoying boeing 747 safety card and continental sky-mall magazine did you know that you can buy a davinci code cryptex for 195,67,86
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,big fan of koontz disappointed in this one usual guessing game but this one is way off base closes the loops in the last two chapters after going all over the place during the whole book and the answers will leave you like say what did he have to go do something and so he just needed to end the book various theories and hints leave you guessing in all the wrong places only to end up with oh that is all sorry if you liked this book but it is nothing like his classics I am going to,94,87
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i enjoyed this book i always prefer koontzs non-supernatural books and at first i thought it was going in that direction it was a very good plausible plot and an enjoyable read,32,88
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,great book as always dean koontz leaves you on theof your seat worth while reading,17,89
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i could not be happier with the speed and condition i received my book it was packaged great and turned out to be a good read thank you,27,90
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i can not believe that those who gave this book great reviews and i read the same book it is an okay read but definitely not one of koontzs best it was a little slow to develop thecharacters were kind of bland and the ending was dull i think the premise of the book is a good one but just was not developed as well as one expects from koontz a lot of the events seemed totally unrelated to the main plot and characters i felt let down when i finished this book rather than saying wow I am really glad i read this not quite a waste of time just do not expect much if you are a big fan of the author,120,91
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,koontz is a favorite author of mine this book is a good one although not one of the more eccentric stories,21,92
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,as a long-time koontz fan i was excited to get this book unfortunately is was a huge disappointment and the story did not even make sense he writes about ryans love interests mother and the mothers boyfriend as if they may eventually have a part in something nope just turns out mothers boyfriend has a creepy house also what was the point of developing ryan and his girlfriends love story at all they do not even end up together apparently deep down she knew he was the kind of shallow guy would who take an unethically harvested heart and the ending was irritating too i get that ryan was trying to make up for his previously shallow / money-rules-all existance but come on an orphange real believable for someone who can write books like intensity false memory and life expectancy this book was just not up to par a double disappointment since this was the first hardcover koontz that i ever paid for,159,93
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,first half paranoid rich guy gets himself a shady heart transplant second half paranoid rich guy gets himself a stalker real or supernatural if you have got this far in the book you really do not care you just want it to end,43,94
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am sooo glad i borrowed this from the library the thought of having spent money on it makes me I shall i love dean koontz but this was junk halfway through the book you think you have someof where it is going where ever you think it is going i promise it will not wind up there the story never comes together in a way that makes any sense lots of loose ends even a new character quickly tossed in near the end to help wrap-up a book that i think dean koontz himself was sick of writing part of me wants to say shame on you to dean koontz but part of me can not even believe that he was the author that being said i do still love just about every other book of his that I have read,136,95
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a huge dean koontz fan but could not make it through the first chapter i usually can not put his books down but this one was absolutely terrible wish i would have listened to the other negative reviews read the good guy instead an excellent read,45,96
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like so many other reviewers i was disappointed it reads like it was written by someone else perhaps dean koontz actually died and this book was put together by the person who received his heart but not his brain on so many levels it does not work number one is the hero yawn who cares if he lives or dies not me that is for sure and the girlfriend the amazingly talented novelist who has about as much empathy as a rock another dud and then there has the plot or is there bring back odd please,97,97
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read a lot of koontzs work but in recent years been disappointed with many of his stories while the premise of this one was intriguing it took way too long to get to the meat and potatoes there were many questions that were not answered spoilers ahead what was the point of isme clem coming to ryan before the surgery when she could not have known about lily why did violet have to have the final showdown at ryans dads house a character we never really heard about until that last scene why did she get up and leave after beating him senseless and torturing him what about all the focus on euthenasia and the fascination with the pictures in the folder why the poe fixation these are just some nagging questions while i found the premise intriguing about killing people for their organs it seemed overly prosaic and pretentious at times dean buddy get back to psychological thrillers already watchers false memory heck even straight-out horror like phantoms enough of this happy lovey-dovey cockadoodie,174,98
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i usually like dean koontz books so when a friend gave me this one i was more than happy to read it yet when i was about 75 pages into the book i called her and asked her was this book really going anywhere it does not there is no real incidents in the book the ones that happen are never really explained the relationship sours and you are left hanging with no solid understanding of what happened then out of no where comes another character and you are left shaking your head to me this is a what happened book i did not like it too many unanswered questions,110,99
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i loved this book a lot of subtext intriguing premise and well the fact that koontz created this one make it a great read not without it is downsides it is not one of his best it still is a good solid read definitely recommended,43,100
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,a am a big fan of dean koontz I have enjoyed the new directions as he explores his life-and-love-centered philosophy but this book was no fun it bothered me that the protagonist was so difficult to like i suppose koontz was experimenting with an unlikeable hero but this guy was so irritating that it was hard to care about what happened to him one reason i love koontz is that his good guy characters are personable funny good-hearted this character i could not understand what motivated him and in the end i did not care it is wonderful that koontz continues to experiment with his writing but i hope he will populate future experiments with likeable characters,112,101
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i have been reading dean koontz since i was in high school I am so impatient for his new books that i can not even wait for them to come out in paperback i look forward to every one and this lived up to my expectations great book,46,102
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have been a fan of dean koontz for some time and he has not had an impressive book in so long that i can not tell you what the last one was that i read i long for some good old fashion koontz that kind of stuff that has you clinging to your seat and peeking out your window wondering if they are coming for you too do not waste your money on this one oh the one about the woman leaving her husband was decent i can not remember the name although the cover was very colorful,96,103
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i love it when dean koontz does something different and writes such a thought provoking novel one part of me wanted a different ending but i completely loved the one i got dean koontz has such a deep sense of honor i believe i would like him as a person if i ever met him maybe not he probably writes books all the time laughing out loud,65,104
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,if you have read the description of the book you know the premise however by the halfway point of the book which is as far as i got the main character still has not had his heart transplant this book was so slow so tedious and so devoid of interest for me that i saw no reason to continue after 160 pages the main character is a total jerk who you would not want to have lunch with and his girl friend has been given zero characterization koontz has written some compelling novels but this is not one of them it belongs in the recycling bin i checked this out of the library so i did not waste any money only time but i wish i had those 2 hours back,129,105
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,gaping holes in the plot preachy and egotistical narrative unsound and petty moralizing one-dimensional characters events that make absolutely no sense it leaves the reader wondering whether this was ghost-written by trixie koontz via ouija board i got this used for only a couple of bucks and still regret the purchase as well as the time spent reading this disaster this is definitely one to skip by far the worst thing he has ever written and that includes his early megaflops,79,106
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i am sick and tired of reading customer reviews that just complain about this book not being like every other book dean koontz had written i bet these are probably the same people who would write a review about a book and say this book sounded just like his last book get an originalalready as a writer I am sure he wants to experiement with different styles and different means of telling a story i loved the book and thought that psychological aspect was riveting even although at times the main character was not always likeable for me that made the character growth even more rewarding in my opinion this book was one of the better books of his i have read i admit i have not yet read everything he had written but I am working on it i am currently readying the darkest evening of the year and your heart belongs to me blows that one out of the water i hope to see more books of this caliber,171,107
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,in a nutshell skip this one the plot concept lured me in but it was really a waste of time it is written in a nearly incoherent style and the parts where there should be suspense sit there like a dead fish there are far too many stretches which left my mind confused,52,108
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love koontz i have read or listen to all of his books that i know of over these past many many years i have always liked the good guys against bad guys approach and the positive endings i like how he has portrayed christians and people of religion including earth mothers who love nature but this book who will love this book folk who feel that succesful people are ruthless and selfish who have class envy and wealth jealousy who love to see a rich person get what has coming to him and in the end to see that person humbled and contrite like the re-education camps for the land owner and business classes in countries that have been taken over by the communists or if you prefer keynes over friedman who will hate this book people who have worked hard and become succesful seeing myths about themselves being continued by an author who seems to be drifting politically left with this work maybe he will catch up with steven king i will re-read koontz other books where it is the government that is the potential big bad guy and not a self made business man,195,109
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,while i am a huge dean koontz fan this book did not do it for me the book dragged in the beginning and i was wondering how long before the plot starts to pick up well the plot did pick up and suddenly there were a number of different seeming subplots which i found very interesting but alas in the end all the subplots fizzled i was quite dissapointed with the way the book wrapped up,76,110
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i really loved this book sometimes it is hit or miss with dean koontz but this ones a winner i really could not put it down interesting characters and an interesting ending i highly recommend this book I am a koontz fan from way back but often he seems like different authors this koontz book is written by the author i like,59,111
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this is a poor outing by the usually reliable dean koontz a thin story stretched to novel length it might make a tight short story but there is too little plot and too much padding,36,112
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,dean koontz is such a gifted writer my husband and i share his books and every now and then we will poke each other to read aloud a phase that is just too eloquent to remain silent your heart belongs to me does not disappoint it is another winner,47,113
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have enjoyed every koontz book written until now as publishers weekly notes this one is a major miss the main parts of the book flow well but the conclusion leaves just about every issue open endings do not always have to be positive but this ending is miserable i read the final chapter three times to see if i was missing something i went back to tried to tie in other chapters no links i will probably buy the next koontz book but my advice even to fans would be to skip this one,95,114
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i have always enjoyed novels by dean koontz and until the ending i felt the same about this one i loved the suspense and the medical twist as well as the romance i did feel as did several other reviewers that the ending was preachy and perhaps made the point that wealthy people are always self-centered and deserving of bad luck i truly pitied the protagonist of this story everybody loves an underdog and so do i however we need to remember that many wealthy people have paid a great sacrifice to achieve their success and to enjoy their demise is simply unkind and un-american lynette fleming coauthor of lunch buddies buddy up for a better diet,119,115
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i love dean koontz i think i have 90 of his books but i was disappointed in this one the story just does not seem to go anywhere until 3/4 through the book and the characters are not very compelling skip it,42,116
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,my title actually says it all i found the book a compelling read until koontz revealed what had actually been going on without the reader having been given necessary information along the way sorry that is bad writing,36,117
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,having read everything this author has written although not finished with the book as yet i know it will satisfy,20,118
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,the characters were stilted the writing was stilted the premise was stilted hated hated hated the ending i felt that i had wasted my time and my money,26,119
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,tedious is to kind the book is a complete bore i expect more from the man who wrote dark rivers of the heart,23,120
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,dean koontz has been a favorite of mine for years but this book was such a disappointment i got through about 2/3 of it before i just did not bother going on there was a plodding story plot a not to likable hero and a very undeveloped love interest luckily i just borrowed it from my library where i waited for a few weeks until a copy became available i pity any koontz fan who actually laid out good money for this book,82,121
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,dean koontz is by far one of my favorite authors but this recent contribution is almost an insult to his body of work i tried to like this book i really did but the descriptions are just overwhelming and the plot and characters underwhelming you do not need page after page explaining how the light reflected through a pepper trees leaves or how the sun dappled across a window pain to reveal yet even more reflections enough get to the story when the story finally pulled through there really was not much of it a story more adaptable to a daytime soap than anything but despite me not enjoying this book i know even more die hard fans than me will read it as well so i will not post any spoilers mr koontz your absolutely amazing this just does not have the magic you normally exhibit,143,122
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,well this is not spooky koontz of the 80s or 90s nor the more intriguingly bittersweet adventures of odd thomas but the new koontz exploring mortality and ambiguity similar in tone to stephen kings duma key the story starts out with ryan the 30 year-old dotcom millionaire having fun with living his life he falls in love with the driven writer sam an identical twin whose sister died and here his trouble starts sam is just not that into him then the mysterious physical symptoms start to anyone who has faced life-threatening illness you can identify with the fear suspicion need for control well ryan steps up to take charge with the bestaround all the while feeling something is not quite right well you have to read to see that indeed all was not quite right but the story evolves and you are left wondering what was going really going on what was the subtext of the story as sam the writer would say the book gets high marks for chronicling ryans introspections the development of mystery and revelation but the ending a bit hard to believe still well worth reading,190,123
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this book is the most inane piece of tripe from koontz yet and that is saying a lot since i think it is been a while since he has produced a good book i swore after the last one that i would not waste my money on his latest yet i succumbed never again i found myself skimming over pages and pages of this book that just had descriptions and idle musings on what the wind the menacing trees the weird noises that never amounted to anything and as others have noted there are so many things that are brought up and never resolved not only is there no plot and no character development but this just does not make a whole lot of sense in the end it is disappointing to me how low koontz has sunk I have read all of his books and i still re-read some of his earlier ones one of his books lightning is my favorite book ever as is one of his short stories strange highways what happened to the koontz who wrote those bring him back please or just stop writing altogether mr koontz do not sucker your faithful readers into wasting their money on drivel like this just stop,200,124
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i have to begin by saying that i have always been a huge fan of dean koontz going way back to whispers and have rarely been disappointed not this time around what a dopey book while i will give him credit for roping me in from the very beginning the book eventually falls flat very flat the ending is beyond lame there are always dogs to wash stables to paint lawns to mow did he really say that at huge eye roll here truth be known i do not know how this book got published i guess they figure koontz can slap his name on anything and it will sell this may be true up to a point but anymore like this and fans will begin dropping like flies save your money,129,125
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,this was the first time i had ever read a dean koontz novel i used to read horror novels before i became a christian but i have not read any in over 20 years i was impressed by the vocabulary and excellent poetic descriptions although both slowed my reading speed guess I am rusty i was not too spooked by the book the worst parts for me were spencers apartment and the violence near the end those parts were quite creepy but that is to be expected in a horror / suspense novel at the very end of the book do not read this if you do not want me to give a large chunk of the end away the author missed the point of life and faith and all that and i am going to write to him and tell him nicely where he went wrong it is my privilege to witness to him and tell him no one can redeem oneself by good works if we could do that jesus would not have had to die on the cross right it is his righteousness imputed to us that we need in order to be saved yeah,192,126
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,definitely not the best koontz book I have read it is slightly depressing undertones are not the biggest reason why you should not undertake a read the minuscule character development and lack of an engrossing plot line however are,37,127
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i am an avid dean koontz fan and eagerly await each newly published book in your heart belongs to me the author introduces too many eerie unexplained events that he never really ties into the ending i found the ending very annoying that ryan decided to do what he did ryan was after all an innocent victim he really did not know that anything was not on the up and up regarding his heart transplant and given the ending there was no reason to introduce some of the creepier events that took place earlier in the book like the eerie rapping ryan heard or the feeling of deja vu he felt at the church in denver all in all a very forgettable book,122,128
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is funny i just finished reading duma key by stephen king before reading this book i thought to myself how wonderful it is that king can still write a fully fleshed out novel like duma key and how i have become increasing dissapointed in koontz efforts to do the same and after reading this book i feel even more so that his recent books feel like the work of a lazy writer or one who does not have the discipline anymore to really get down into it and produce rich complex stories i kind of liked his dogl book last year but that may be becuase i love dogs he is certainly off his game these days,117,129
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am a huge koontz fan and rushed to buy this book when in was first released i read the short synopsis of the book on the back cover and then began to read the back of the book basically told me everything the first half of the book was about i felt that there should have been a warning on the book that if you read the dust cover please skip to the second half of the book for the rest of the story in a nutshell i did not enjoy this book at all and hope that when relentless is released in the spring it will redeem koontz and make all of his fans as happy as he usually makes them,122,130
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,it was riveting until the end i did not like the ending of the story,15,131
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it is time for this writer to retire and start spending some of his money and stop pretending he has anything more to say what a waste of time,28,132
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,to this point I have read everything dean koontz has written that being said it seems like with the last few books he has just been going through the motions of writing and your heart belongs to me is a prime example a largely unsympathetic main character contrived plot and overtly preachy tone pervading the book made this the first dean koontz book i have regretted reading please dean abandon the multi-book-per-year business plan and get back to crafting the intricate and thoroughly polished prose your fans expect I shall take quality over quantity anytime,92,133
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a huge fan of dean koontz books he had me hooked when i was back in high school and i read phantoms it kept me awake for three nights over the last few years his books have taken a new direction and feel and I have enjoyed that maybe because I am growing older and my taste in reading material is changing with me but like another reader i look foward to every spring and fall for a new book from dean and this time i had to force myself through the book got to the end and wound up saying huh I am not sure i get it this is not to say i will not keep reading his books but i have to say in all these last years this is my least favorite of his books hopefull and waiting for the next one,141,134
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,as always dean koontz has kept me glued to the book till the end i almost did not want to pick up the book because i knew i would not be able to put it down till i was finished i was right great story great suspense,46,135
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i used to love dean koontzs books unfortunately i do not think he has written a good one since the first christopher snow this book was simply awful i do not plan on reading the next one he writes,37,136
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i spent the first half of this book not liking the main character why was he so paranoid can someone tell me and why did it take so loooooooooooong to get to a simple point the first half of the book can be summed up in a sentance he has a girlfriend he gets sick then goes all paranoid unfounded the reason was never made clear and uses his money to invade the privacy of almost everyone he knows was i supposed to like him also his girlfriend what was the point of her character she seemed so angsty but why why did they breakup is there a point here this seems like what i kept repeating as i read i got so fed up with the book that i went trolling for spoilers to see if this was going anywhere i found out that it does not i will not likely finish it by far my least favorite koontz book awful anti-climactic at best save your money,167,137
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,how about mr koontz whittle down part one into about half the length what a waste of pages wandering and going what you hope is somewhere but by part 2 realize was just a bunch of filler to get to a ho hum ending in part 3 urg guess he needed some extra cash,51,138
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a big fan of dean koontz but i can not recommend this book to anyone unless they are trapped on a deserted island and there simply is nothing else available to read too much mystic philosophical rambling too many loose ends that were never really resolved and an ending that was unsatisfying do not waste your time and please mr koontz return to the thriller genre that is your forte,69,139
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,this book was a waste of time from beginning to end it seems that becoming a best selling author gives you a license to write junk like this,28,140
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book there were some unexpected twists dean knows how to entertain his readers i could not put it down he is one of my favorite authors this guy knows how to grab your attention i will read this book again,43,141
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,can a man be greedy if he is happy with his life ryan perry has great wealth a beautiful girl friend that he keeps trying to convince to marry him but when he is told that he has maybe a year to live unless he has a heart transplant his life changes is it a genetic fault or is there a sinister reason for his heart problems using his wealth he begins to hunt for the truth trouble is that he misses a truth that is the most important one of all a year after the transplant strange things begin to happen gifts begin appearing inside his ultra secure home all with the same message your heart belongs to me and i want it back it is not till the end that he finds the truth that he missed and it is not a pretty one again mr koontz has given me something to really enjoy as well as something to think about,161,142
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read every single book dean koontz has ever written and i will continue to do so but i have to make a comment on this one it was terrible i know it did not follow the same themes as his others books and that is okay i like variety but i think he was trying to get in the popular mainstream and write books like other popular authors jodie picoult-change of heart i am not sure what he was trying to do but this book was not well written the book left so many things hanging so many loose ends so many things were brought up in the book and you never know why no excitement thrill very little chemistry between the two main characters and dean is usually so much better at that i love dean koontz please write the next frankenstein novel I am still a fan just did not like this one,152,143
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,I am a huge dean koontz fan I have read 50 of his works and look forward to many more i got this book for christmas and plowed through it pretty quickly I am not sure i let everything sink in the first time this is a very interesting koontz and a little different from a lot of his the protagonist ryan is a complex character and the story is told with a very tight focus around him many things go on in the beginning to middle of the book that really are not understood until the end and even then you should not be expecting the answers to slap you in the face the understanding of these things is more deep and subtle than a cursory reading will at first reveal it is there and readers should dwell on the meaning of this one a bit overall this would not be my first recommendation to someone new to koontz but a good read for someone looking for something worthy of deeper consideration than the typical industry thriller there has not a ton of action but more psychologically taut scenes that flow one to another thank you very much dean for another top-notch novel for thinking readers,202,144
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i am a big dean koontz fan but this book was a real let down it was contrived and full of cliches i listened to the audio book and not only was the writing sub par but the narration was poor if you want a good dean koontz audio book get life expectancy,53,145
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i think I have read every book koontz has written in the last 20 years has it been that long i continue to buy his new books because of how much I have loved the stories along the way at this point however i am going to re-consider surely stop putting out the money for the fresh hardback unless it is of the odd series those are both classic koontz and yet a very fresh take this story just did not grip me at all and i rely on koontz for that type of effect i did not find his prose nearly as evocative as has been his standard and the characterizations were very limited in scope i was definitely disappointed,114,146
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,not recommended I am an avid koontz fan but not of fare like this disappointing plot was good story was too politically correct money is evil pleassse,30,147
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i just finished koontzs book your heart belongs to me i kept reading and reading thinking it would surely get better maybe even make sense the only cents it finally made was for mr koontzs bank account this book is horrible if koontzs name was not associated with this book the publishers and public would be laughing at this work of words please do not waste your time and money on this hogwash that said if you truly must read it get it from a source that will not cost you a penny trust me on this,94,148
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i will not be long winded i normally really enjoy dean koontz however this was just outright poor the plot was weak it felt like he changed his mind half way through as to the direction of the book i will carry on reading him but i wish we could get some more christopher snow or odd thomas soon i also adored twilight eyes wish that had been followed up as well,75,149
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,another dean knootzs novel i enjoyed it kept me in suspense until the very end dean knootz did it again written another novel i really enjoyed i highly recommend if you enjoy dean knootz or suspense novels,37,150
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting through this he is starting to get too philosophical like stephen king not much ever happened definitely not the usualof your seat page turner like usual i was disappointed with this like i was disappointed with stephen kings duma key only worse it was the 2nd time in my life i considered not finishing a book,64,151
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,I am a big koontz fan but this ones a dud perhaps koontz filled it with his own personal meaning but it does not make it through to the reader and i really do not care to reread the darn thing to search for worth i hope mr koontz has not decided he knows better than any editor he will end up writing worthless best-sellers if he stays on this path,66,152
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I have read every single dean koontz book and I have loved most of them i really did not like this book it may be his worst one yet i did not care for either of the main characters the book started off promising but the last portion of the books was so contrived that it was a real let-down the ending was a real disappointment,63,153
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,I am a big dean koontz fan but this one just does not work the premise was a great one and i looked forward to reading the story but it drags from the start this is the first time I have actually skimmed over paragraphs in a koontz novel and the intertwining of supernatural with reality just does not fit together this time the story picked up a bit post-transplant more than half-way through the book although but the ending is a major disappointment no spoilers here but there are certain events that just do not make sense the supernatural seemed out of place and the ending itself is extremely unrealistic and unfulfilling koontz can do much better and hopefully next time he will,120,154
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i read with great enthusiasm jumpy exited riveted and then what happened thud you forgot what you were doing too many loose ends no reason for spirits you forgot to end the story,31,155
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have read every koontz book out even all the old ones in my opinion he has gotten better with age until this book it never seemed to come together at all and the ending sucked,33,156
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,your heart belongs to me surpassed my expectations that were low due to some poor reviews that i had read about this book i thought that the plot of this book was exceptional it was mysterious i had nohow the book would end without giving away details I shall just say that i liked where koontz went with this book take a chance on this one i am glad that i did,73,157
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i listened to the unabridged audio version of this book koontz has been right on the top his game the last few years churning out one terrific spellbinder after another however he stumbles with this one the initial plot line is intriguing but there are so many loose ends left untied that i acutally wondered if i was missing part of the audio program it would have been better to leave out some of the distracting but ultimately irrelevant plot twists and kept this one to short story length,89,158
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,it was hard to believe this was a dean koontz book the story never really grabs you i did not care about the characters and kept wondering where is this all going it is all over the place not what i expected no one bats 1000 so with the amount of times he comes to bat and delivers i guess we can forgive him,62,159
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,dean koontz usually writes great books but this surely was not one of them this one spun around and around and never seemed to find it is center red herrings were all over as ryan flit around from place to place in his very own special jet being a very special rich person so did the story line suspense built and then it just crashed and burned dead bodies sealed in acrylic and on display as sculptures a hippie father monks jet setting life style of a spoiled dot com guru identical twins harvesting organs poisions a panic room chinese secret agents ghostlike appearances of long dead nurses special needs children security systems edgar allen poe i will pray for you ouch this novel was all over the place enough all ready,129,160
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,absolutely loved this book could not wait to get into my car every day on the way to work to hear the next chapters on the book dean koontz kept me fascinated from start to finish with the great descriptive emotions running throughout the dialogue in the book and the surprise ending definitely a good story to keep you entertained the narrator had a very good connection to the heart of the story,72,161
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,mr koontz does his own variation on the stalker thriller i do not recall another of his previous novels with this plot line which is good since lately some seem to repeat the same theme this reminded me of misery by king only in that it explored the disturbing twisted mind of a stalker who becomes obsessed with someone as usual deans humor is laugh-out-loud funny and the suspense builds and builds and grabs you by the throat until you are gasping for a breath koontz is hands down the best psychological thriller writer this country has produced his prose nears poetry at times and his insight into the human dilemma is unparalleled watchers,116,162
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,if i could even begin to author a book laughing out loud i would probably want to get the all over the board type of reviews that this book seems to be getting it is a thrilling and keeps you guessing type of book i have to admit it is a little confusing at the end and i can see why some would be disappointed since the ending does strech it alittle bit overall although it is a great book with some frays at the sides of the fabric but overall worth the read,90,163
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like others here i have read most of koontzs books and enjoy them this book however was a major disappointment i can only assume he cranked this book out for the holiday season due date there is no subtext to this review posting inside joke if you have read the book I shall state it plainly wait for the paperback or borrow this book from someone do not waste your money the story starts out interesting it grabs you but does not deliver in the end the characters are not well developed the story is choppy and implausible the surprises and twists are simply ommissions in the plot narrative that are revealed at the end not every book a great modern author writes is a great book i understand that what bothers me is what i perceive is the seemingly obvious reduced effort or rush for a book to meet a deadline or satisfy a publishing contract sorry dean if this was not the case I am making excuses for you i know but i hope it was the reason for this lackluster effort,179,164
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i look forward with high anticipation every fall and spring for the new dean koontz book the night before it comes out in stores i can barely sleep and I have even called in sick to work when i get my copy of deans lateset book your heart belongs to me was very disappointing i did not even want to finish it but i did out of loyalty to dean it has to be the only book of his i did not thoroughly enjoy sorry dean,83,165
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,this book was so promising until it fell completely flat it was as if the last 50 pages or so were taken from another story that just did not fit my mother recommended this book to me as she had just purchased it and was halfway through it i finished it and picked up the phone my mother knew i was reading the story and when she answered all she said was I am so sorry i did not know how bad it was until i finished it last night i love many genres of books and will read almost anything i hope the next book by koontz that i read has at least a fitting ending to a good story,118,166
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i have been a koontz fan since day one but this one just did not keep me fascinated and i really did not like the ending it felt like koontz did not really know what to do with the characters and so basically took the easy way,44,167
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i was discussing with my wife how great funhouse and intenisity were i can not say the same for the last few books as far as your heart belongs to me koontz has let me down as a reader i was full blown interested until the last what 3 pages koontz books should end with a bang not a whimper with the exception of the first odd thomas book they ended with little to enjoy i was excited to read a non-odd book i guess i can not express in words my displeasure of the ending of this book and i consider myself one of koontz best fans,103,168
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,your heart belongs to me by dean koontz is a pretty good thrill ride from this talented and seasoned writer i have read many of his books this one reminded me of his older books which i prefer the characters are likable and the twist ending is nicely done this is not a perfect suspense novel but i enjoyed this story than some of koontzs more recent ones the main character ryan perry goes through many changes in his life and i think he learns lessons that others would not be able to tackle with such grace check this book out sometime enjoy,102,169
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,koontzs your heart belongs to me comes at the precise time that americans are grappling with the realization that they may have played a part in the meltdown of the global economy greed takes many forms and for those of us who play by the rules it is hard to assume responsibility for the breakdown of such a huge entityby such crafty manipulators but koontz does a masterful job in illuminating how the five roots of violence can play an insipid role in our lives so through the journey that protagonist ryan perry takes to self-awareness we see in ourselves how a cultural psyche can mislead us to believe that more is better and at any cost and while this tale is not about wall street it is a testament to the power of those human failings of lust envy anger avarice and vengeance and worst of all the denial of truth thought-provoking as always another must read from dean koontz,162,170
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,for a dean koontz book 4 out of 5 is actually not that good buy it but in paperback or kindle save your hardback money i was so excited to get my copy downloaded to my kindle the day it came out and even made sure i had time to really sit down and devour my new koontz book i have to say i was a little disappointed maybe it is that I have read everything written since the late 70s thanks public library and I have become a bit spoiled by the genius that is dean koontz the whole withholding where the transplant took place and the shallow girlfriend really bothered me and the ismay clemm thing was wonderful but not worked out fully i felt i have to say by the end i almost wanted ryan to get shot in the end and take the whining girlfriend with him but maybe that was the point a hero we do not want to like but do not worry dean I shall still be getting my pre-ordered copy of your books because frankly i think you would make a math textbook sound interesting,185,171
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,i will not bother to provide any detail about this book it was a total waste of time the only line i can recall was that a poet said sleep is a little death i expectantly wait for the next book,41,172
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have been a koontz fan for many many years i have been reading and collecting koonts books since i was about 12 i think in the last few years i feel like some of the magic has left deans writings between the really thin plots and the collaborations and the plots that tie up in only a few pages i have been disappointed for at least a few recent books that having been said i think this books is pretty good i give the book 4 stars because it is a return to his previous form his writing was descriptive and thrilling and the ending was unexpected,107,173
Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,i was disappointed with his last book which seemed to be more of an effort to write a book than a product of inspiration and i thought went to the odd thomas well one time too often not this one this is koontz back with all his creative juices spinning out twists and turns reverses and double reverses an unusual love story where the intimacy becomes less but the true love becomes more intense it was refreshing to share the life of a dot com billionaire for a change instead of the good simple poor odd thomas but the evil is the same truely wicked and twisted the moral is better check where your new body parts came from you might not want them if you know a truely weird truely koontz book and even with a surprise feel good ending good job,145,174
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,wow shockingly bad novel I have read them all and this is easily one of his worst it is awful on pretty much every level plot characters depth you name it I am glad i got this from the library instead of wasting my money I am starting to fear that dk has written all his good books already because i have not enjoyed a koontz novel in a long time,66,175
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,like so many of the writers i am a huge dean koontz fan that is one reason why this was so disappointing he is all over in this book and it appears he did not know what genre he wanted to write in there is the spooky atmospheric beginning the gentle love story the psychological mayhem and the violence you find in his other books but they do not go together in this book it just jumps all over the place and the deus ex machina explaining it all is just too bizarre for even him out of the clear blue sky comes a reason for everything that is been going on and it was not even a good explanation it is like violet is pulled out of another book and stuck in to wrap it all up i was really disappointed i wasted my time on this book,143,176
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i kept waiting for the story to build to a climax and be resolved but it never did no climax no resolution yet when i finished i felt satisfied think odd thomas not midnight,34,177
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,i purchased the audio version of this book expecting it to be well worth the price nearly 1/2 of this book was so incredibly boring that i wondered why i did not wait to read the reviews instead of pre-ordering if I had rented the book I had have given up i wasted my money so why waste my time if it had been any other author I had have quit rating it with 2 stars but not recommending it to anyone that might expect it to be anywhere near the excellence of mr koontz previous books,93,178
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,I have read a number of koontzs books although admittedly not all of the ones I have read this is my favorite and the easiest read of all i love a good scare and started reading his books for the shiver although not of the horror genre this one did not disappoint i got all the thrills and chills I had hoped for and it carried me through a number of other emotions i was not expecting i would have given it five stars but it left me floundering at one point and i felt that part might have been handled differently but then that is my perspective over all a stellar read i definitely recommend it,111,179
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,warning spoilers below i have a hard time believing acould be so stupid and shallow as ryan he supposedly researched transplants so how could he have believed he was on an international donor list and not be suspicious when he gets a heart after 1 month in shanghai his security firm supposedly researched dr hobb and did not mention anything fishy also too may loose ends what about dr death and justice for ismay whom koontz strongly implied was murdered lastly is running an orphanage really supposed to make up for buying a heart from a murdered political prisoner,101,180
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,having tossed aside koontzs novels since the husband it was with great hestitation that i purchased this novel i was curious to see how he would rebound after the odd series and his previous tedious dog story i was surprised and happy to find i actually finished this one and while it lagged in several places it held my interest koontz defintely did his homework about heart transplants and cardiomyopathy so for those interested in such it gave a glimpse of the disease i was a bit confused with some of the early apparitions and other strange happenings in his home but when i put that aside i found i wanted to know the outcome all in all this novel is more like the old dean koontz although somewhat flawed and confusing at times my rating is based on the moral of his story one we all need to take to heart in these times,155,181
Books,0007267568,2.0,negative,a rare miss by dean koontz far too much buildup and not enough payoff,14,182
Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,while reading this book i thought there was going to be a great payoff at the end there just had to be after pages and pages of filler i would not even bother to read the first part of the book as it has nothing to do with anything after the transplant there were too many loose ends to count the ending was very unsatisfactory why is it that a whole nation plus countless others were responsible for the big bad thing koontzs villain only blames the rich hero i also find it very unlikely once the hero figures everything out his life is changed so profoundly i think we are at the start of a new political correctness being ashamed of and having to apologize for being rich,128,183
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,i liked this book koontz earlier books were his best and the odd series i found tedious but this one is more like it i enjoyed very much and it kept my attention i know when a book is good when i can not put it down until i have finished it I am still waiting for frankenstein 3,57,184
Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,charles cummings the hidden man is certainly the finest espionage novel I have read while i love the works of littell deighton greene mccarry ignatius and le carre as well as cummings own a spy by nature the hidden man is unique in how effectively it deals with the effects of cold war espionage on very ordinary people the main characters in cummings novel are not spies ambassadors or diplomats but a businessman and an artist nor does cumming succumb to having them turn into james bond history simply reaches into their lives and unravels them even one is not interested in that particular theme one will be treated to a fast engrossing drama by page fifty cumming has amassed so much intruiging plot with remarkably little prose,127,0
Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,once you have read all of john laclare your man is c cumming you will thank me and devour his books keep them coming chuck and thanks for resurrecting the hidden man,32,1
Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,this is one of charles cummings early books which has only recently become available on us kindle it is a tense satisfying story of dysfunctional father-son and brother-brother relationships that become enmeshed in an mi5 investigation into a russian organized crime family as anyone who has ever read any of gerald seymours books knows whenever amateurs get involved in the world of espionage and organised crime the outcome is rarely a happy one you hope that they will emerge safely but deep down you know that they will not once you know that this is one of cummings early efforts you do feel that the degree of cynicism that comes through in his alec milius stories is still in it is early stages of development here but the way in which mi5 and mi6 fail to even talk to each other let alone cooperate and the fatal consequences this has feels all too real if this is one of cummings books you have not yet read then it is definitely worth your while filling in that,175,2
Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,although the plot suffers from too much coincidence and too much omniscience amongst the cast it is still a good read a bit of it is time but that is actually well done,32,3
Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,not his best i can see why this novel was not released prior it is not a fully developed suspense thriller probably cummings weakest to date,26,4
Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,i will never read another book by this author i will also be more selective in what i choose to read the ending ruins a fine novel of espionage brother ben a main character in totality simply disappears by the failure of the ending goodbye mr cumming,54,5
Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,a very cynical look into the british secret service but considering the time frame 2003 who could expect any less cc writes great books,24,6
Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,boring beyond words two bungling whining brothers spend more than five indeed pages whining about their father the murders spying plot have no motivation an unsatisfactory ending trash it,29,7
Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,i expected more from cumming this rehashing of an old novel is not worth the read there is a reason this book was never published in america until now it does not work,31,8
Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,highly disappointing not at all in the same league as some of his other books,15,9
Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,although i liked his two alec milius books fast-paced and easier to follow better all cummings spy thrillers are fun changes of pace his characters are always well-drawn and intriguing as he ably puts his everyman heroes in challenging situations this tale of two estranged sons seeking the truth of their hidden man dad leading to friction between the brothers as the russians more business than political spies here play divide and conquer satisfies,78,10
Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,cummings writes good solid mysteries and i like that enjoy reading his books,13,11
Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,the worst book i have purchased from amazon can i obtain a credit,14,12
Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,i had enjoyed other books by charles cumming bu this one was a big disappointment the plot felt contrived to me and the ending was predictable the brothers in the story are not very interesting or believable i am one of four sons and their interaction is unrealistic and not that interesting a big yawn think i will put mr cumming aside for a few years,66,13

Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i would give this one 3 1/2 stars but amazon will not let me i love cunninghams writing style and enjoyed this read but it was not my favorite as it felt like a rather thin plot still anything from such a great author is still better than 90 of everything else out there flesh and blood was much better you should definitely read that,64,2
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,a book with interesting albeit quirky characters fun to read and get involved with,14,3
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,oh my this book was so hard to read in fact i gave up halfway in i did not care what happened to the characters and had nowhere the book may be going my book club agreed it was awful it was depressing and not in that tug-at-your-heart stick-with-you-and-change-you sort of way,54,4

Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,an interesting read that awakens the senses and challenges the intellect the exploration of the relationships of the characters is extraordinary cunninghams mastery of language is what brings me again and again to this author like each novel from this author the snow queen is impossible toaway from once you have read the first page the character of beth is the heart of the story but one is drawn to each of the characters in a different way i highly recommend this book in fact all of this authors work,92,11
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,michael cunningham is a genius i do not say this lightly i never write these online reviews in fact this is my first i have read and re-read cunninghams work and i go back to his language again and again simply because it is so beautiful i highly recommend,48,12
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,compelling story line strongly drawn characters moving yet dispassionate there is so much to recognize in tyler the purpose of his life remains an elusive quest the book opens a window onto the enigma of being alive and in love it offers no obvious solution,45,13
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,as with all cunningham novels a challenging and worthwhile read,10,14
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,i had not read any other of michael cunninghams other books except for the hours so i thought i would try this one although well written i just found it extremely drab and a story that did not go anywhere,39,15
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,this is a book that returns to your thoughts for a long time the struggle of ordinary people to find meaning and hope i wil read it again cat,29,16
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the content because the detailed descriptions of both homosexual and bi-sexual activities did little to promote the rather thin story line actually i can not rememeber a book which has disappointed me more,36,17
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,very disappointing book I am do nt know what this book was about it had a beginning a middle and end that is the best i can do for this book the character development was very poor the subject matter very depressing i kept on read hoping to be introduced to the snow queen to no avail over all a bad read,60,18
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i loved this book it is not the kind of book you can really describe you just have to feel it as you read i loved these brothers and their friends and would have followed them around for another three hundred pages at first you think it will be a quiet story and then you are pulled into a complicated spiritual domain a world of mystery love ambition and even wonder then there has the language there are words I had never seen used in sentences before words i had to look up and then marvel at the construct some paragraphs read like poetry humorous laugh outloud poetry other times serious if there has such a thing as a true literary novel this is it,120,19
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,the novel takes a while to get into but once you read on the prose is beautiful,17,20
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,love every other book by michael cunningham and i am very glad he chose a different way to produce art but it is just not for me i could not follow the multiple hipster characters and did not really care about them maybe that was the point,46,21
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,the novel is really quite philosophical although i did not think of that as i was reading the title and the prologue a quote from an hc anderson tale suggests that our surroundings are that of a beautiful but unyielding landscape an absolutely frozen lake the novel suggests how different characters in 21st century bushwick brooklyn adjust to such an environment some find escape through alcohol and other drugs one longs for a kind of transcendence a need to believe that there is a power out there that is aware of what we do some try to stay forever young one considers suicide the best we can do is follow the example of the two brothers now middle-aged at the center of the novel who look out for one another their mother had understood the nature of our world and years earlier had sworn each of them separately to look out for the other,153,22
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,could not get into this book at all,8,23
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,michael cunningham is at his best in this gorgeously written intimate portrait of two brothers and their close-knit group of friends and lovers set in new york city this contemporary tale follows the lives of two brothers who are very different from each other and yet very closely connected cunningham is a master at breathing life into his characters each one unique original deeply flawed and totally sympathetic I have read all his books and this one is a favorite in some ways reminiscent of the hours the authors intertwining of his characters less-than-perfect and often painful lives carries the reader through the difficult sad events of the story these people are bound to each other by a profound love and caring for one another and also by a communal sense of hope which i interpreted as a metaphor for the childhood belief in the existence of a benevolent snow queen,148,24
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,interesting character analysis but the story does not come together in a meaning way,15,25
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,this was so boring that i quit reading it seemed pointless characters were not well developed i could see some of the same plot lines from the hours would not recommend as a good read,32,26
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,i was disappointed i like michael cunningham but i found his characters unlikeable and they truly did nothing during the entire novel beth was sweet but not a large part of the story,33,27
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,this is really well written prose but i just never got involved i almost did not finish it but pushed on to the end to see if i could get more engaged it never really happened i know that michael cunningham is reputed to be a good author but it just was not for me,53,28
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,the writing is beautiful and for that alone i would recommend it here are living breathing characters not the movers and shakers of the world not people who will ever really reach success in life and yet i cared about them the entire book read like poetry to me and it seemed so real,54,29
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,dull dull dull stereotypes abound trite contrived notion of some vague blue light over the park an internal struggle with an external who cares all over it the hours was cunninghams shining triumph he is slowly devolving this is the worst one yet i could not finish it my husband did finish it and considered a waste of perfectly good time in which he could have been reading other things i do not recommend it at all to anyone,81,30
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,could not finish it gave up halfway through lifeless characters leading rather listless directionless lives at least as developed by cunningham endless descriptions of nothing of any interest you know like sidewalks unkempt apartments and more that did not take me anywhere as a reader not good reasons to read a book not my first cunningham book just the first i could not finish,57,31
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,michael cunningham is a rare writer beautifully felt beautifully expressed,10,32
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,a book about nothing i really wanted to like this as i loved cunninghams past work save your money,19,33
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,so self-consciously artful and faux serious as to be difficult to plow through even for a relatively short and light but not lighthearted work,24,34
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,good not his best but richly written and well paced,10,35
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i began this novel with high expectations but was barely able to finish it perhaps i was missing something but i never engaged with the characters who were mainly self-indulgent 30-something has living in new york the opening lines with a vision appearing over central park seemed to promise an interesting read but this was not fulfilled in the rest of the book,62,36
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i could not get into this book after reading the first 100 pages i discontinued reading it it seemed to be well written but just did not capture my attention,30,37
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,pretentious shallow overly intellectualized pointless meandering some interesting character development,10,38
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,mr cunningham is one of my generations best writers but this slight story about gen xers who can not find themselves is just basically pointless the hours a home at the end of the world and specimen days all show his strengths as a writer who knows human compassion and has a gift for beautiful / inspiring language but this novel is as aimless as it is characters yes boomers were just as lost as these characters but the theme is tired and transcendence is very hard to make interesting in a novel i will continue to buy his works but look forward to another novel about the people and themes i can relate to in his works mainly boomers who still have not lost the dream of a better world outside the smug milieu of a big city,133,39
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,he has a great senstive writer i love his work,9,40
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed michael cunninghams the snow queen i had nowhat it was about but decided to take a chance it a very good it was a study a family and it is problems very thought provoking,38,41
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,michael cunningham is not stingy with words quite the opposite but i did not want this beautiful book to end and it will think about these complicated and vivid characters for a very long time he takes real chances and uses almost flying trapeze-like paragraphs to weave his story you need patience and grace when reading this book it is not easy but that is what i love about cunningham,68,42
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,very unrewarding there were passages that were quite lovely but overall it was huge disappointment hardly worth the time it took to read it,24,43
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,michael cunningham is such an excellent writer i feel i really know the characters in snow queen his descriptions are so articulate but not overly lengthy i highly recommend this book,31,44
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i liked the snow queen i either disliked the characters or did not get to know enough to either like or dislike them it felt like being at a party and thinking is there anyone in the room i might enjoy yet i stayed with the snow queen and was glad i did michael cunningham did a great job of depicting new york in the beginning of the 21st century and of making his characters come to life if not to like but i wrote that already i also enjoy the way he writes dialogue my only in my eyes major criticism is his choice of vocabulary i found myself asking could not it have been a little less pretentious,118,45
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i found the development of the characters in the snow queen most beautifully written also the author offered very good descriptions of a certain type of new york living not to much happens in this story and yet so much happens michael cunningham tells this so well,47,46
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,michael cunningham creates beauty with our language i loved the prose but i did not really find his characters or story line terribly fascinating,23,47
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,this story of two brothers meanders with no true conflict or resolution frankly i never cared much about the characters,20,48
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i am so in awe of how beautifully michael cunningham puts words together that i find myself embarrassed to even write anything about his work my four stars here is relative to his other work which i have found more moving than the snow queen but please do not misunderstand that to mean that this is not as good or worthwhile i found myself a little disappointed with the ending which i found somewhat fizzled rather than ended and left me wondering what i was supposed to think / feel but that is quibbling about a book with such richness such depth and intelligence and such passionate writing,103,49
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the writing very elegant and at times breathtaking however i never came to care for the characters and the ending left me very indifferent i love books that leave me wanting more or that make me sigh and close my eyes when it ends this was not the case,52,50
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,generally love his writing but this book was slow inane and boring did not care about the characters plot was thin / non-existent,20,51
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i kept reading in hopes of discovering a plot concept and the i got to acknowledgements and wonder what no ending very disappointing,25,52

Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,michael cunningham mesmerizes with the thoughtful elegant prose that is this book the reader becomes so close to it is characters the reader feels what these brothers feel beautiful and tragic a book that will stay with me for a long long time thank you again mr cunningham the hours remains at the top of my list and the snow queen is another gift to your readers,64,54
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i really liked a home at the end of the world and the hours but i could not finish this book which is really rare for me who can read a paragraph like this with all it is parenthetical information a time-snap their mother reclines on the sofa which is here now right here in their bushwick living room smoking cheerfully bleary on a few old-fashioneds barret likes her best when she drinks it emphasizes her aspect of extravagant and knowing defeat the wry amused carelessness she lacks when sober when she has forced by too much clarity to remember that a life of regal disappointment while painful is also chekhovian grave and rather grand barrett is nine his mother looks at him with drink-sparked eyes smiles knowingly as if she has got a pet leopard lying at her feet and says you are going to have to watch out for your older brother you know could not it just be a time snap their mother reclines on the sofa smoking cheerfully bleary on a few old-fashioneds barrett is nine his mother looks at him with drink-sparked eyes and says you are going to have to watch out for your older brother you know,198,55
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,there are many beautiful insights in this work about what it is like to grow up and be happy with who you are independent of anyone else in all honesty although i was really disappointed with this novel and grateful that it was short i am still trying to pull out some enlightening metaphors from the work and figure out what i missed but this is wishful thinking on my part wanting to see more from what is not there to read full review visit [ ],85,56
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i love words a novel using beautiful poetic language holds my attention until the very end and when the end comes I am sorry that it is over,26,57
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,my curiosity and compassion for these characters deepened with every page cunningham channels a bit of virginia woolf here in the beauty of his language and his elegiac evocation of the random details that add up to life,38,58
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,have not finished loving it would make great film his writing is like a screen play great summer reading as inhis books new york plays a role,26,59
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,who could deny mr cunninghams literary gifts not i who barely passed a creative writing class that said this book is filled with so much descriptive prose that whatever narrative there is moves at a snails pace and i felt bogged down by all the well-chosen and considered words as well as by the characters with one exception who seemed to live life on the fringes of their exquisite sensitivity i would call this novel contemplative or meditative many scenes had great visual impact and i wished that i had bought the book rather than the kindle version which has the tendency to propel the reader forward rather than encourage lingering,112,60
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,this book is about the relationships of 4 people they are all unusual the writing is great and the story is very strange almost other worldly,28,61
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,this story was written so well the enjoyment of the authors style superseded the story line the clumsy insertion of a political opinion was unfinished within the works the intimate workings between close siblings and their friend liz was compelling the story seemed to end unfinished,46,62
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,i found this book to be disappointing the writing style was hard to read and the characters not fully developed,20,63
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,a quiet book with gorgeous writing a wonder of a read michael cunningham is a superlative writer an american treasure,20,64
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,in michael cunninghams earliest books he wrote to tell a story he wrote beautifully and movingly but to propel the story in his recent books although my sense is that his writing has gotten progressively more showy more hey-look-at-me-I am-a-really-serious-writer too bad especially in this book all that showiness just entombed the story,53,65
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i am a long time cunningham fan and this book is as eloquently written as his other works strong similarities to a home at the end of the world if i had a physical copy it would be soaked with highlighter i only wished it was longer,47,66
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,i was browsing the library and saw this book on the new releases shelf the cover and title caught my eye so i figured identification give it a shot i have to say i was disappointed I am not familiar with michael cunningham writing i only saw the movie the hours and the middle of the book the writing was not too bad there were moments i wondered if i would bump this book up from what i had categorized it as just tolerating it but towards the end the novel definitely waned physically it is a short book but it is not short cunningham is a sophisticated writer but the book was almost too metaphorical for me it reminded me of play / book the raisin in the sun which was not one of my favorite bookstoo much symbolism and the mundane set of character in the same dreary setting throughout most of the book it did not inspire me i would not recommend this book,162,67
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,interesting story line but format somewhat distracted and chaotic also left leaning political diatribes are interspersed in the text and are completely out of context without any necessary purpose,29,68
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,such incredible writing michael cunninghams book so touched me it is inspiring to read such a well written absorbing novel,20,69
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i have read all of his novels and through teaching he has learned a greater craft having grown up in new york city i have experienced the awful lure of the energy of an oncoming train in reading cunningham you become aware of the draw of an open window to fall or to fly,56,70
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i love the way michael cunningham is able to weave a story about characters who are caught in the paradox of life in the midst of death without sounding preachy or smug like most of us barrett liz and tyler are searching for some kind of transcendence but it is the narration cunninghams ethereal language that pulls his readers into the thoughts of his characters and their need to find that elusive unnamed something that drew me in i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would read it again,89,71
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i do not know which was worse the plot which took quite awhile to discern or the writing which was confusing i began to read this while i was at the beauty salon and i remarked to my stylist i sure hope i did not pay a lot for this book because it is pretty bad well sad to say i did pay a lot for this book in my opinion and i kept reading it after i got home hoping that maybe it was one of these situations that sorted itself out as you read along not the case for me my expectation was well i do not know now what it was i guess i thought that if i had seen the light that i would have made some sort of change in my life or that at least if an author was going to write about an experience like this that we would have been able to hear about a change i read 3 - 4 books a month and this is the first time i have ever given a one-star rating now i am sure others disagree and perhaps i just missed the point of the book entirely,196,72
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i love all mr cunningham novels and i am always eagerly awaiting the next one this being said the snow queen is very gripping i the two brothers are linked by what their mother said and then later on in life they are linked by the girlfriend sickness and maybe her sacrifice which liberates them i could not put it down,61,73
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,the revelation of tyler and liza was the icing on this most beautiful of gluten-free cake and for those who love,24,74
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,readers who enjoy finely written prose are those most likely to enjoy reading michael cunninghams novel the snow queen set in hip brooklyn the novel presents the contemporary life of a closely knit non-traditional family protagonist barrett meeks shares an apartment with his brother tyler who lives there with his lover beth barrett and beth work together in the vintage shop of another character liz whose current paramour is more than twenty years her junior there has a yearning among all these characters for coolness and meaning yet their behavior remains more adolescent than adult after being dumped by another boyfriend barrett pauses in the park to look up and observes a light than both captures his attention and disturbs him is this the light that erases the feelings of darkness beths cancer draws all the characters away from themselves and toward understanding rating four-star i like it,147,75
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,this was a visually impactful read for me the characters were developed well and the story was contained in a way that was easy to follow the ending insists that you pay attention to the details so you can draw your own conclusions about what might happen next a bit sad but not mawkish i liked that i lost myself in the story and that the imagery lingers,68,76
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,so much internal dialogue so little plot and character development no surprises and an ongoing past political diatribe that does not advance the plot where is the voice from his amazing early story snow angel from a prize-winning author of literary work i expect more,44,77
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,the book started with a very interesting well-written premise barrett one of the main characters unexpectedly sees an otherworldly light and that seemed to tie in with the title and i thought i was in for an interesting read how wrong i was the books interesting well-written start really had nothing to do with the rest of the book the title had nothing to do with anything in the book the snow queen tries to meander through the lives of it is four main characters but it all struck me as pointless these people are tiresome there has very little plot some of the sentences are nice but that alone can not save this,112,78
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,I am baffled that people enjoyed this book it was very short but seemed endless as the insufferable characters thought in circles always about themselves i made it through to the end but it was a close call,37,79
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i usually enjoy much of michael cs books but this one forget it the characters are dull self indulgent losers except for one saint like heroine about whom we know very little except that she is dying of cancer i made myself finish this book hoping there would be some amazing denouement that would save it there was not there is one moment in the book when one thinks one of thecharacters is about to kill himself unfortunately he does not,79,80
Books,0007557787,1.0,negative,i kept reading and reading finally 3/4 in gave up is it because i am old that i just did not see anything of interest in this book maybe i missed it in the last quarter which i did not finish,39,81
Books,0007557787,4.0,positive,i was not sure when i began to read it that i would keep reading and then it unfolded in an interesting way and i grew to like it and look forward to continue reading it very much to my mind characters and situations of the moment that so many can in so many ways relate to and think about while reading,62,82
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,a successful novel uses language to create a credible world that is peopled by characters about whom i find myself caring cunninghams novel does all that his words are exquisite evocative and selected with precision his mid-2000s brooklyn is depicted with all it is tedium charm and grit his characters although flawed are sympathetic this is not a novel of immense action lofty ideas or seismic moral teachings it is much more a slice-of-life tale albeit seasoned with dashes of mysticism spirituality and pathos a great read,86,83
Books,0007557787,5.0,positive,i stayed up all night reading wonderful rich prose almost like poetry it is a story of a few moments in time in the lives of 3 people and their few friends there really is not a plot which is refreshing just their story highly recommended to anyone that enjoys good literature,52,84
Books,0007557787,2.0,negative,I have been a fan of michael cunningham for a very long time and have met him at readings in washington and provincetown i was very much looking forward to his new book i started and have only gotten to page 12 and am not sure i can make it the rest of the way the problem is those long endlessly convoluted sentences that go on and on and on and on and on it is turned reading into plodding I shall keep going as long as i can but i fear it is not going to get any better very sad since i have enjoyed most of his previous books very much perhaps he needs to get out his copy of strunk and white and give it another read,126,85
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,it has the necessary things to take the test,9,0
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,the book offered many practice tests thatto successfully passing the afoqt however it did not offer suggestions on how to improve on sections that proved challenging all in all this is a great resource to help prepare for the afoqt,41,1
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,this manual provided valid study material to prep any potential military officer for the officer qualifying exams along with provide excellent practive exams to test ones timed test taking abilities however it does not cover absolutely every aspect of military knowledge specific to each branch of service,47,2
Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,this book is great for preparing for the officer candidate tests one important thing to note is that it does not contain any of the sections that only pertain to flight or other specialty scores it only contains sections related to math vocabulary and more that will be on all of the tests,52,3
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,you are better off researching free information online this book is total waste of money if you need something specific like i did then this book is not the way to go this book gives you a basic at best outline of becoming an officer for each of the branches you can get more information by visiting the respective websites if you are looking at this book as a study guide which is why i bought the book originally do not you can find more valuable information simply surfing the web and that is free the only thing i can say about this books is i want a refund,106,4
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,if you are going to study for the exam for any of the armed services this is the book you want it covers all the topics that will be included in any exam,33,5
Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,this book is the best book i have ever used even better than the sat guidebook like the title i am not lying is the best and most knowledgeable book i ever used it explains everything you need to know for the military tests and how to be an officer of the us armed forces the greatest military in the world and even better than pr china the book isin detail and covers everything you need to know if you want to be an officer in the us army navy air force marines or coast guard so i recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be an officer for the armed forces of the united states of america and i hope everyone uses this book because everyone should join the military it is your american duty to do so nevertheless this is a good book and i encourage everyone to buy it because you will not be sorry and it will also be one of the best investment you make in your life,175,6
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,for most people attempting to get into ocs occ or the like this book will be valuable to you however i will give you this much this book is great for the standard officer testing in that it covers what is basically the officer equivalent of the asvab however if you are applying to the air force or if you are interested in being a pilot buy arcos military flight aptitude test book officer tests like the afoqt are desgined to check for pilot and navigator candidacy so it is recommended that if you are looking into a job like that or are applying to a branch like that then i recommend that book however if you are joing the army marines or navy and instead are interested in other fields this book will give you the chance you need to succeed,142,7
Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought this book to help him study for the afast test it was a great tool and the mock test was very accurate i reccomend this book to anyone who will be taking the afast,39,8
Books,0028621735,5.0,positive,i recieved my order on time but i do not like the shipping company dhl they do not have very good service amazon is a very good site,28,9
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,several probelms with the book first changes were made to the navys dco program prior to 2004 that were not included in this printing second the astb has changed it is format when i do not know so that may be a problems with timing however of the sections of the astb that the book states are on the astb only two 2 sections were given in the book to practice on the others were not inlcuded i am ticked of and felt i wasted my time waiting for this book and money on it check out online prep services,98,10
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this book because there are a lot of errors in it i found the newer edition and was disappointed to see the same typos in it this was particularly upsetting because the typos that i noticed are in the math sections although i am sure they are elsewhere too it is unfortunate there are few resources to choose from for this topic the explanations in the math section are also poorly written i am honestly worried about the real exam because this book gives me very little guidance,93,11
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,the book is a good resource for practice before military officer candidate test amazon however did not carry the book but still charged my bank account i have requested a refund and get the usual we only charge for what we send I shall tell you they charge for what you order and put the responsability of proving otherwise on the consumer this was the first and last time i will use amazon i also encourge others to shop elsewhere,80,12
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,as some of the other reviews have already stated there are multiple math answers that are simply incorrect and arguably a few verbal questions as well although verbal questions are naturally more subjective for the math problems the book does not explain the logic behind any formulas used rather than helping you understand the material it wants you just to memorize it questions and explanations in the verbal section are equally confusing and illogical on the mechanical section many of the diagrams have printing problems making it difficult to answer any question involving measurements circuitry and more regarding problems where you have to identify the correct tool the explanation tells you what the correct tool is and it is function but explains nothing about the other tools and their functions therefore unless the same question comes up on the real exam you are likely to get it wrong again bottom line for the math / verbal sections you are better off with a gre or sat prep book and for the mechanical section try to get ahold of a high school physics textbook the arco book is good only for the practice exams which you can take under timed conditions,193,13
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,when i got this book i thought that i would help me prepare for the afoqt as best as possible thank goodness i thought about getting the sat book as well the only things this book showed was the type of questions that you may have on the test along with the answers for the math portion it did not show the steps thatto the answer just the answer itself i recommend that you study the sat book in preparation for the test it explained why the answer was the correct one and it even gave you formulas that you may have forgotten for those of you who have been out of school for a while like myself it also stated hints as to how to take the test the officer candidate test book did none of this the sat book was a big help the oct book was a waste of money,155,14
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,i bought this book because i thought it is prepare me for the test the reality is other the book was not good i took the astb test for navy officer and the test is completly difference,36,15
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,a screw has 8 threads per inch and amust travel 2 inches along it how many revolutions must the handle make 16 right the book says 18 with no explanation of the mysterious missing threads do you have to spin a couple of times to get going in short the explanations stink the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps and there is not enough background material or pointers to references the entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the navy used there is no online companion to this not even an errata so the authors could point out some of their mistakes i take this exam next week and I am scared,137,16
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i studied this book inside out and learned the hard way that it was worthless try the sat or gmat for real help,23,17
Books,0028621735,4.0,positive,this book is great for those who do better on batteries that they can actually see or practice with prior to test day i was able to take a number of sample quizes and it really let me know on what to work or focus after using this book and the military flight aptitude test book from the same publisher i scored over 90 in each section of the afoqt so the practice works however other books would come in handy since this book only provides reviews of the tests and samples with no instruction on concepts as other reviewers have said a book which explains certain math problems or english theory would help those who find they are lacking after taking a couple of this books sample tests i would agree that an sat book might be helpful as a companion also the verbal portion of the real afoqt is much more complicated than the examples given here so make sure you are a good reader and adept at pulling meaning out of passages so again brush up on basic skills with another book but practice with this one good luck,192,18
Books,0028621735,1.0,negative,out of 16 subtests of the afoqt this book provides practice only on the 6 academic ones with very few practice problems with even skimpier explanations the only reason arco is still managing to publish this rip-off is because they have no competition the most you will get for your money is a goodof what sort of questions they will ask and how well you can expect to do in the allotted time for each subtest but you can get that for free on the net for serious study purposes i strongly recommend you spend some quality time with barrons sat study guide i scored phenomenally well on the afoqt and i owe it all to barron,117,19
Books,0028621735,2.0,negative,i bought both this book and military flight aptitude tests to prepare for my naval officer specimen battery i think that this book is nowhere near as helpful as the other even if you do not want to be a pilot the other guide is much more comprehensive,47,20
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,this is a classic romance novel not an adventure story as we might expect from uris while the story of the early days of the marince corps is interesting and very well researched there is virtually no action i strongly suspect in spite of no official word from the uris camp that this book was finished by others re-read earlier works for your uris fix and pass this one by,70,0
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,i had never seen this book in the days when uris was popular it is a little departure from his normal style but an excellent story well worth the read,30,1
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,this is a wonderful book one would never guess what a difficult beginning the great united states marine corps had this book will be liked by all readers who enjoy military history it is also a wonderful love story,39,2
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,i have long been a fan of leon iris this book is not his best but it certainly is readable and an interesting history lesson paddy and zach are a typical irish father and son with all that implies add in the marine corps and you have a recipe for good fiction there are layers and nuances to unfold and much food for thought,64,3
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,good novel about the early days of the usmc not as much action as other uris books but still not a bad read,23,4
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,i love leon uris books this was even better because it is about the early marines i have a vested interest in the marines it is a great story,28,5
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,this book is outstanding fun zreading leon usis has outdone himself in this his final novel as a marine who served in combat in the pasific during ww ii the author has done his homework with regard to the marine corps before during and after the civil war the characters are real and the story is alive with terrific characters,60,6
Books,0060568755,5.0,positive,i received a hardback copy of this book as a young lance corporal it motivated me then because it is an easy read now that I have read it again years later it reminds me of all of the optimism that we share as marines it is an uplifting book that i recommend to all marines,55,7
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,my partner brought me this to read while i was sick in bed i thought well leon uris this should be good the writing was lousy it was self-indulgent and preachy but more to the point it was just lousy at times i skipped whole pages and then there were the things we were asked to believe not only historical inaccuracies but adonis-zachary the shining hero of the book predicting the japanese invasions that would occur half a century later or an entire church full of ex-slaves interrupting their service to gasp oh god how beautiful he is i paraphrase many times i wondered if the author was in the last stages of alcoholism finally the ending was not only unrealistic and poorly done it was an abomination to the art of storytelling i really do feel as although i have just wasted a part of my life by reading this book,152,8
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,this book has one of the poorest endings I have ever read it seems uris did not know what to do with it the last two chapters made this book a flop,30,9
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,you can not tell a book by it is cover the synopsis sounded good and the book started out in grand epic style by introducing a host of characters the interest stopped there the characters were undeveloped and the lapses in time were confusing dialogue was stilted and love scenes were sappy there did not seem to be much craft used in developing the plot it appeared that the author had done his historical research and then needed to share that learning through the dialogue of his characters writing in hindsight the author had material the characters would never have known nevertheless the information was inelegantly expressed through the words of the speakers who sounded too prophetic and preachy to be real i did learn something of the origins of the marines but the price of the knowledge was too high do not bother,141,10
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,having always heard great things about uriss writing i was excited to read this work about the us marine corps and while it started out well the book falls flat with sappy interludes and silly situations i had hoped for a story of the united states after the civil war although the development of the corps unfortunately what i got was a implausible love story told in flowery overemotional language that more suited a romance novel i would definitely not recommend this book,83,11
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,unfortunately old age or laziness finally caught up with leon uris his final two novels a god in ruins and oharas choice rank as the two poorest novels that i have read in the past 5 years not only were the plots sketchy and improbable but the main characters were contrived stereotypical and forgettable his attempt to push a certain modern political agenda through his books conflicted with events of those times and in the process alienated many of his faithful readers who enjoyed his previous agenda-neutral historical novels you would be best served to read all of his earlier works which i found masterful and riveting and forget these two books that only show the sad decline of a once-great author,125,12
Books,0060568755,1.0,negative,trinity may not be leon uriss best book but personally it is my favorite book that being said I am not out to trash uris but oharas choice is a waste of time I shall leave character development and plot intracacies to other reviewers my focus is the story itself as the book unwound i was reasonably well captivated i wondered along the way how much actual marine history played into the story in terms of the fight to keep the corps alive interested enough to research that later the problem is that the story was not compelling enough to have an ending that was not supported by the events thatup to it 390 pages of showing someone has emotions progressing in one direction so the reader can be tricked with a gotcha at the end well that is fine if the gotcha seems plausible but in this book it absolutely did not slight spoiler the ending reminded me of the partner by grisham which had the same problem i do not read grisham anymore because to me that was a big let down the last two pages were not reasonably supported by the first 390 or so and to me that makes for a bad book,201,13
Books,0060568755,4.0,positive,uris death three months prior to this books publication not only cut short the career of a great novelist but also another sequel i loved his novels trinity redemption and qbvii they were great stories spun in the tradition of historical novels his story-telling ability and character creation communicate the humanity of the age and culture about which he writes oharas choice is no exception patriotic duty and family loyalty duel in this tale set in the gilded age that followed the u s civil war leon uris was a great writer he had the ability to create characters who communicate the age and times in which uris set his novels the worst part of coming to the end of this book is the nagging awareness that this is the last uris novel the reader will read,137,14
Books,0060568755,2.0,negative,when i stopped to think of the time i wasted reading this trash oharas choice was worth exactly what i paid for it thank god i got the book as a gift i have to agree with a disappointment s review i expected a better ending and it crossed my mind whether someone other than uris had finished writing the book it was a drippy romance followed by an unrealistic usmc twist topped off with a ridiculous ending,76,15
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,in nf clancy uses too many acyromens and leaves too much to the reader to figure out on there own nf does not tell you how the vr works or give you a good concrete villian that you really like to hate like in past clancy books maybe the new childrens versions will be worth a peek but if it is anything like this book count me out,66,0
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,the detailed research and realism that tom clancy brings to his other fiction titles seems to be lacking here the net of 2010 being a hash of weak acronyms and forced-sounding slang that is supposed to convince us these net-riders are hip it may just be that where william gibson and neal stephenson get to make it all up clancy and pieczenik are not making as drastic aforward a solid premise and interesting concepts as the selkie suffer from limited exploration and even the villain seems a bit cardboard a smattering of technical errors michaels instead of michaels virgil instead of virgil among others distract the eye from the presentation making it seem like the book was rushed out the door to coincide with the abc made-for-television production there are at least two net force juvenile titles out but i wonder how well the titles will fly with the real net-savvy kids out there,154,1
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,appearently tom clancy has been reading william gibson this reads like a gibson novel but not quite with all the pizazz the rest of the book is classic tom clancy but he could have left out his version of william gibsons version of the future nothing new here seems like mr clancy is reaching for new material and is falling short just like he did with rainbow six,68,2
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,full of predicable quasi stereotypes pc silliness and overblown internet wet dreams beyond this it is just plain old bad writing i suspect that this is a lot more the work of mr piecznik than it is of tom clancy i have enjoyed clancys work for some time and i found this to be a huge disappointment no real insight into the technology just pure fantasy on every level when the 2nd degree black belt man meets the small well trained women can you guess who gets beaten thoroughly it is not predictable it is downright boring do not waste your money,98,3
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,i enjoyed this book the new net world is fresh and the characters engaging I had sworn off the non-clancy clancy books after the last op force book but this one is good enough to stand on it is own merits,39,4

Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,i enjoy all of tom clancy books i think they are great i would like to know how they get their information they are so close to what is happening in our world,33,8
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,i love the amazing body of work of tom clancy but this book just is not very interesting it has some interesting bits to be sure but not enough of them to carry the work some of the complex plot has holes that are too large to ignore to be generous i started the series with book three perhaps if i go back and read one and two the relationships among the large cast of characters will make more sense i hope so many if not most of clancys stand alone novels are rightly ranked in the five star range this one comes up only to a below average for the genre two stars i have avoided the spinoff books that clancy outsourced to other authors for years and it seems that i was right to do so there is a romantic interlude between a british and an american intell officer that is so forced that it is almost painful to read,161,9
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,not the type of story that i associate with clancy clearly sci-fi,12,10
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,different but good more realistic than I had like to think,10,11
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,a good read but a little confusing the difference between vr virtual reality and the real world in the story got a little fuzzy for me usually clancy books are easy reads this one required a little more effort since i read as a method of escape i had to work a little harder than i wanted still a good clancy book,62,12
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,after tom clancys original works the successor authors like this one are far below the benchmark set by tom,19,13

Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,please people with the money if you buy a new book include a used one in your shopping cart that will help amazon enormously in their storage and it can help you too at some places the price can not lower to lesser a penny take a used book for a 001 anywhere it has many usage including cash4booksnet recycle it or burn it for survival heat use two books as spacers to raise your monitor because it is always better to view at eye leveled to the center of your screen even better send it to donation any library would take it or the third world too do not fear a book because it has no teeth when you open your used book wear gloves if you have to then you shall realize this book are not that bad after all good read and peace ricky,145,15

Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,i am astonished that clancy allows his name to be attached to this juvenile disconnected piece of waste paper the only conclusion must be that he was I shall when his co-author wrote and had this published before clancy set eyes on it utter nonsense technically and totally confusing sans plot,50,22
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,tom clancy at his utmost best it is a honor to be able to enjoy his masterful work must read,20,23

Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,there are moments where the book shows promise but when they switch to the virtual reality world it just loses me i really do not get why someone needs to travel around in the internet in a virtual car or motorcycle really corny,42,25

Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,there are many better written sci-fi out there but if you are insisted on clancy I had suggest you to stick with the original jack ryan series whoever wrote this garbage in the 90s has no clue what internet is,38,28
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,this book messed with my head there were times when i could not tell when i was in the real world and virtual reality,23,29
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,the first part of the book i thought was slow and boring it did start to pick up a bit towards the middle through to the end i struggled with being truly interested but am an avid reader so i kept going it was not a memorable book i have defiantly read better written books,54,30
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,i am a huge op center and splinter cell fan and having read all of them i decided to try one of these boy am i sorry it will be the one and only net force i read i can not say i did not enjoy parts of the story but involving this stupid back and forth from the real world to vr was silly then add the stupid kids who helped and the book was dumb hopefully they will create a few more splinter cell and op center books to read,90,31

Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,this series may not be written by tom clancy but you will surely get a lot of info from it from legal stuff to history to medical stuff to physics and oh yes pentjak silat,33,37
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,everybody likes to cry over how this is not writen by tom clancy and blah blah blah right at the bottom of the title it says created by tom clancy and steve pieezenik writen by steve perry if you can read the book at least read the credits before you whine so much after that being said this is an excellent series and i highly suggest 4 stars could have been 5 but a couple chapters were really really bad and kind of confusing it is one of those rare books that even if you are dead tired you want to get to the next chapter to see what happened next,108,38
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,this is the very first clancy novel I have tried and i was not much impressed basically a sidney sheldon melodrama with some science fiction tacked on also there were some unnecessary subplots that were weak and irrelevant the colonels son the agents love triangle the female monk these took theaway from what i thought was going to be a to-the-point intense scifi-thriller not a complete waste of time but not time well spent,74,39
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,this books actually not written by tom clancy but mostly dr pieczenik and that is the point just ignore the name of tom clancy written on it and you have got a perfect book and be sure to read hidden agendas right after this one without ha it seems to be rather incomplete,51,40
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,this story is out of reality at any time it has an almost love story almost fbi thriller almost futuristic almost childish and i can keep going about almost everything apart of that you can skip almost half of the book and you will understand it so to resume this review this book is a complete not almost complete waste,60,41
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,tom clancy is a genius at research on any topic and he excels in the futuristic world of the virtual world computer if you enjoy the science of computers the possibilities of virtual world then this is a must read it will be a scary prospect when considering rw real world against vr virtual reality but brace yourselves because clancy has hit the nail on the head if you are a fan of his writing do not miss this one,82,42
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,not up to clancy standards the main premise is compelling what might happen if a technological advancement were developed which could quickly break large prime number encryption upon which the security of the world depends a real theoretical possibility this premise kept me reading right to the anti-climactic end some of the characters are interesting like the russian fellow who had a great subplot going but even his ending is a letdown the 2 main love stories are tiresome detract from the main plot and take up way too much ink the virtual reality subplot is aof faith not worth reading currently reading without remorse which is much better so far,113,43
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,tom clancy is an amazing author we have begun to expect thrilling novels from him net force is just aabove the rest the book begins with the assassination of michael day the head of net force net force is the governments computer control agency believed by some to be ore powerful than the fbi and cia the assassination is the spider in the web of events leading to the exciting conclusion there are five main characters in this novel the selkie who is an assassin trying to take out the replacement head of net force plekhanov who is trying to take over ukraine alex michaels who is the new head of net force and toni fiorella the martial arts master this book has some very thrilling moments like ruzhyo placed the wavering crosshairs on the mans chest and he turned and saw the old lady with her cane held over her shoulder like a baseball bat ready to belt his head into the bleachers are just some of them i suggest you read this literary masterpiece it will keep you on theof your seat,188,44
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,I have read the spanish translation this book is very poor elemental there is no emotion no thriller some argumental threads become suddently dead I have not got any pleasure reading this book,31,45
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,net force by tom clancy is a fantastic and interesting novel i loved it because it is supposedly based in the year 2010 a time when computers are the superpowers of the world gee that sounds like fiction it made me wonder is congress going to create a special computer security agency within the fbi anytime soon we need someone to enforce the net laws this book got me to read again before i thought that i would never find a book that could give me the pleasure of adventure but then a friend gave me net force and i fell in love with it it reminded me of how fun reading can be who would not call a book dealing with computers causing famine chaos and death awesome and cyber terrorists crashing mainframes across the world who ever controls computers controll the world that has been true for the last 3 decades and computers are only getting started so if your the type of person who loves books about government agancies cyber terrorists sabotage assasinations famine chaos and death then net force is the book for you,186,46

Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,tom clancey is a master of putting suspense reality action futuristic worlds and thrill all into one novel the book gets of to pretty quick start set in the year 2010 when a middle eastern assassin kills the director of the net force fbis new system for crimefighting this killing causes alex michaels the new director of the net force to track down the assassin who had killed the director on his way to seeking out the assassin he finds that he himself will soon be the next target and while all this is going on there are internet terrorist and hackers who has intent is to destroy and create chaos throughout the system this is the kind of book that will make you not want to put it down and will have you asking for more,136,49
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,on the whole this novel may be one of the worst mass market novels ever published wasting a decent if predictable premise clancy or whoever it was who actually wrote this has concocted one of the most poorly written works produced in some time full of the worst kind of schlock cliches it is disappointing in nearly every respect to add insult to injury the attempts to authenticate the technical aspects of the book include ridiculously stylized language and a nearly incomprehensible vr environment for a fan of some of his earlier works this novel is a significant disappointment and not worth your time,106,50
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,tom clanceys net force is a breathlessly exciting novel undoubtedly clanceys best that i have read starting strong then it built me up to a shocking climax i could not belive it this is a really good book in the ending when the cyber-terrorists betrayed each other that was great i never saw it coming if you like sci-fi suspence then i reconmend this book to you it is really good i give it four stars,74,51
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,i just finished two tom clancy thrillers op center and net force were actually the worst i had ever read by him he used to write a crafted novel that was well researched and had suspense at least he has not stooped to using sex op center is slow and plodding and actually pretty dull for a bloody thriller net force has all too much blood and gore to be actually about the web the techno window dressing was put in to sell sell sell he has become a product and his books are no longer literature but formulas for the best seller list,106,52
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,this can not be a tom clancy book it is simply appalling frankly i was more than dissappointed i feel ripped off having wasted my time reading this until this book i was a tom clancy fan now i doubt I shall read another of his books certainly none of the net force series the plot if you can call it that is hopeless characters are 1 dimensional and the purile sub-plot about inane high school kids romance is irrelevent do not waste your time,84,53
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,have you ever listen to a dishonest politician speak that is the feeling i got from this audio book it is like you asked a legitimate question and he is going round and round with you and giving you stuff that is hardly relevant to the subject matter if there is a rating for minus stars i will give it the 5 stars one audio tape would have been more than enough for it tom clancy is getting greedy,77,54
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,well this book was okay it just did not leave up to expectation like books where people get killed in furious action do not look here like character development not here either do you like a shotty attempt at explaining what possibly the net will be like in 10 years look here one point of the book the ending is entirely anti-climatic unless you are into technothrillers aimed at preteens there is not any reason to read this if you want some true clancy pick up rainbow six or clear and present danger,87,55
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,theof the computer-world being brought to it is knees is an intriguing one this novel however does not begin do it justice i did not find the characters as well-rounded as other characters that have shown up in clancy novels but it could have happened if the writing team had devoted more pages to the book allowing the necessary details that were not there does every female have to be drop-dead gorgeous and every male fantastic in the use of guns unfortunately the plot suffers a lack of detail as well i rated it two stars because i did finish the book in just a few days but it was not nearly the riveting read that executive orders and others were,119,56
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,i started to read this book not knowing who tom clancy was or for that matter what he had wrote the title was the first thing to captivate me as i was studying computers at university the course itself was starting to get a bit mundane and since reading netforce i really woke upto what i was studying the information was very easy to digect and not to technically intimidating but still being within the bounds of reality the way in which tom describes the advancement of technology and the importance of internet security still captures my imagination some years know since reading it the action is fast paced and revolves around three storyline angles the long drawn out romabnce between the two main fbi agents takes you along a rollercoaster ride mixing in with the selkie nicely the selkie the daughter of an ira hitman who was murderd before her childhood eyes makes you do nothing but fear and admire her the book certainly makes you whant to read and read if you are interested in this area but if your not into computers as such there is still plenty of otherelements to keep you on theof you respective,204,57
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,most of these other reviewers are right it is not the greatest book ever written on the other hand it kept me up pretty late you kind of have to read the earlier books to find out what has going on there is a young boy that had his first heartbreak a russian man that they still have to catch from book one i think what i enjoyed best about the book was that these are starting to become old friends i would not want to read all the books at once because then it would become monotonous but like this is great,100,58
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down great book from beginning to end what else can i say netforce takes place in the near future 2010 and computers control everything netforce which is part of the fbi is well you can call em the net cops the team works together to fight cyber-terrotists and such clancy will get you to a climax of a storyline and then switch to another storyline wanting you to rush through and get back to that other storyline you will love it trust me,96,59
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,although i would not consider myself a huge fan of tom clancy i have read and enjoyed some of his previous works but i would have to say that i was disappointed by this one for the most part i found the tempo to be too slow the buildup was about fifty pages too long also clancy seems to be very found of using barely disguised political opinions observations within the narrative if you are in the market for a good tom clancy book i think that red storm rising was far superior to this book,97,60
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,i do not read too many books but i found this one to be exciting and it made me want to keep reading i have read the book and have seen the tv mini-series the book is much better than the movie because the book gives a more detailed story line than the movie the movie is good but could have been better i highly suggest this book if you want the full net force experience go with the book rather than the audio cd or cassette due to the book is not abridged like the audio cd and cassette are,100,61
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,clancy can get pretty boring with his 900 page doorstops although he has written some of my favorite books patriot games hunt for red octoberthis thankfully short piece of trash should not bear his name written for the quick read it has no substance boring action and lifeless characters pick from many other great action books out there oh and the computer stuff was way off being a computer guy i spotted it caught ya tom i called my review debt force as this book reeks of getting a quick buck off the name so there must be some debts to pay,108,62
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,this book is devoid of clancy there is no hero the villian is vanquished by another villian who is vanquished by another villian the depiction of cyberspace patrol even in a vr world is totally unrealistic the net force team gets absolutely nowhere with their case the reading is slow the action boring and the supposed good guy loses out in the end there has even a totally unrelated side plot consisting of a petty teen relationship definately not clancys teams best clancy is know for being realistic and having done his homework this book is not worthy of that name if there were a zero star rating this book would get it,112,63
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,coming from the author who wrote hunt for the red october this book is down right pathetic do not waste your time reading this book also there are horrible inaccuracies in this book one example moksha is translated as enlightenment moksha actually means release from the cycle of life and death,49,64
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,tom clancy should fire his ghostwriter before he puts him out of business i found this book almost impossible to read the characters were bad and the plot was terrible i hope he starts taking his writing career a little more serious i pray that bear and the dragon were written by the old tom clancy,56,65
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,I have always been a huge clancy fan and admired the way he could take a multitude of complex plot sequences and tie them into a coherent and exciting tale his net force this book included has not let me down if you are looking for the grinding detail and intricate plot that is classic clancy although this might not be for you it you want something fun and easy to read this was great i enjoyed getting to know the characters better only drawback to this book was that it did not quite have the bite of the first and second in the series,101,66
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,i have to admit this is one book that i did not finish and i usually read a book all the way through whether i finish it out of duty to the author or plain stubbornness I am not sure however in this case i made an exception to my rule it should have all been there intrigue hacking and more etc but i just could not get into this book one iota i could really care less if everyone in this book gets shot and all the computers blow up and can we stop with all of the dodge automobile placements was this sponsored by dodge i just could not get all the way through this and i do not think going any further would have changed my mind I shall give it a star that is just for the premise,136,67
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,this book was good very good it was far better than the other two net force books net force 1 and net force hidden agendas i was reluctant to buy this at first but i enjoyed and will buy the next one if you were burned by the first net force you will like this one,56,68
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,i can not beleive that someone like tom clancy can actually lend his name to such drivel the research in to this book seems to have been derived from a boys mag and some of the sub plots seem rather childish the selkie is described as an utter proessional who never makes a mistake big laugh two stars for a couple of good chapters highlighting the dangers posed by cyber terrorists but all in all one for the little kids,78,69
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,i read this for a reading assignment and was immediately hooked I am not sure if it is part of the op-center series but if it is you would never know it mr clancy does a great job tying in the characters net force is a book anyone who likes computers would like and the lingo is not too hard to understand for those who are not into computers enjoy this is a great book,70,70
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,hey i work in the field of technology and computers true the net force book is fiction some reviewers may need a dictionary to understand that word but it is not far fetched i have seen similar technology being used today look what 10 years of refinement has done for computer storage media that kind of a jump can happen in vr netware in there is an external influence which drives it the book itself was excellent the relationships between toni and alex as well as tyrone and bella were right on the money sgt frenendez and col howard gave it the guts or glory energy it needed and when you finish with this book read the second in the trilogy net force hidden adendas it deserves 5 stars,129,71
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,i am a big tom clancy fan but just could not get into this one the net force characters were unbelievable and to my eye pretty inept the hero / main character was not likable and the plot did not pick up the ending is just that an ending again not up to tom clancys usual energy and level i would not recommend it,60,72
Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,this is the first net force book i read and i have to say i liked it i was browsing the other comments and altough sometimes the action is slow and the yarn turns slightly childish i think the series is a good work by this talented writer i have enjoyed op-center and rainbow six to the maximum and have just ordered two more net force novels can not wait to see vr net surfing for real at the rate we are going,82,73
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,this book had everything a good storyline a mystery type format with tons of tech stuff about vr and assassains lots of action it hooked me in the 1st chapter when steve day got killed net force leader and this guy alex gets appointed leader and he wants revenge on his death it seems like it could happen it is a little sci-fi with the vr but it is not like way off it uses current weapons and is really good I am 12 years old and i only buy tom clancys books after i read the hunt for the red october i was a true clancy fan,105,74
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,after i saw the commercial on abc for the miniseries which i still have not watched yet if someone could tell me how to get a copy please email me i just had to read the book i thought it was such a great book that i read it twice another one of my favorites from tom clancy is rainbow six,61,75
Books,0060746955,2.0,negative,why tom all the books such as sum of all fears clear and present danger and more fantastic 5 stars these net force books very poor tom you are not a romantic novelist so do not try to be one i just read 400 pages of romantic nice drivel i buy jackie collins for that also this futuristic nonsense is at best interesting and i would say boring where has the action where has the thrill where has the suspense clint eastwood was an a1 actor and all his western films and dirty harry films were a1 then he had to get all arty on us and try to do what he is not best at directing and the films he stars in are just ok not great tom clancy is following in these steps with net force and to a degree op-centre artists should stick to what they are good at and not kid the public into buying lesser grade novels just because of the writers name i have read all clancys books but this is the last one unless he goes back to writing what he is good at,190,76
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,i am wondering what everyone was expecting by reading a book that was set in 2010 many of you have decided the book was not realistic enough but there is absolutely no way of knowing what the future will be does the term fiction not mean anything to any of you anymore can not we still read a good book to escape the real world for a while does it all have to be true to life now if so what is the good of reading when we can walk outside and watch a murder the book was a wonderful book and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone it is fast-paced and full of descriptions of every detail,118,77
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,i do not know what the he shall all those other guys problem is but this book is unbeleivably intersting and not wordy and not not wordy it is right smack in the middle perfect you should read this book no matter what anyone says,42,78
Books,0060746955,5.0,positive,this was the first book by tom clancy i have read and now he is one of my favourite authors this book is futuristic but is not quite science fiction in this there is a man called alex michaels who is chucked into a job because of his boss getting assasinated and alex must find out who did the crime while trying toa life i now really want to find the sequel but I am not sure wich book it is and if you do get a chance to read this book i would because it is brilliant,98,79
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,mr clancy would do well to carefully consider to whom he lends his name this has got to be one of the worst efforts yet i had trouble staying awake during the tv mini-series which resembled the novel in name only the book was much worse i would not recommend this book to anyone,54,80
Books,0060746955,1.0,negative,i have always thought myself as a die hard tom clancey fan unfortunately all that stopped when i read this book there was absolutely no development of the plot or of the characters I am confident that most people know that created by does not necessarily mean that tom clancey is the author of the book however it would be nice to know that he might have at least read the manuscript prior to putting his name on it blatant errors such as giving a male name to a female russian secretary just is not clanceys style a total disappointment,97,81
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,after so many great books and after such a long time between books this one was a big letdown save your money,22,0
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i am a big fan of mr lehanes work and i can only conclude that he had nothing on the shelf when his publisher needed to publish I had say two of these stories are worth reading which makes this hardcover release an absolute joke in my opinion,47,1
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,I have enjoyed all of mr lehanes work and appreciate that he writes in a number of genres i do not usually read short stories i really read this book because i enjoyed mistic river the patrick kenzie novels and shutter island so much i think these stories are well written and interesting i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys other lehane books,62,2
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,extremely weird can not find a story line goes off in dumb directions real negative aura i very seldom write a review but this was awful,25,3
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,i really like the short story format from authors it provides a different perspective on their writing i especially enjoyed the adaptation of the story to a play,28,4
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,i love lehanes writing often i only want mystery not prose however his characters are always breathing flesh and blood people,21,5
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,i started reading this book but did not stay with it too long it seemed to be filled with short stories that were not my type of reading,27,6
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,lehane has written several excellent novels but this is not one there is a weird short story that is meandering and vague this is followed by a self indulgent ramble concerning a play i was unable and unwilling to finish it,41,7
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,i usually stay away from short stories they are not to my liking i loved these dark yes but like a train wreck you can not look away,28,8
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,the stories were about low life characters without morals the stories were interesting but i did not like the endings the endings were to abrupt and left me wondering what happened to the characters at the end of the story,39,9
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,so it never ends they are so good alas i do get to the end but on the bright side lehane keeps writing,22,10
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,first let me say that i think lehane is a fabulous writer having read mystic river a given day shutter island sacred and the other kenzie and gennaro thrillers however i started reading coronado twice and suffered through half of two stories wondering why i would want to read about these terribly ruthless thoughtless brainless misfits who are killing and destructing without a second thought i did not even feel pity for them just utter disgust oh it is certainly well written i just do not want to read about these people there is enough of that in the press unfortunately,100,11
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,dennis lehane is a very talented writer but i do not understand his sensibilities i loved the first story running out of dog for about 10 pages then i wondered why he writes about these characters i can not see their appeal and the story is over-developed it seems to me i do not need the coda at the end the wrapping up there are good insights into human nature and into the nature of male love and lust good insights into elgin and blue and the way they feel about the woman jewel and why they do what they do but all in all it seems like a tragedy without meaning maybe that is the point but it does not make me want to read more this is the opposite of a sermon but it also is not a very satisfying story not because it lacks meaning but because it lacks a well developed aesthetic sensibility there is just too much here about these losers reminds me of justified a tv series about drug dealers and hillbillies in appalachia i do not care about these people this is more than i want to read,190,12
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,if you are a dennis lehane fan be sure you do not pass up coronado his book of short stories and one play these stories are not new they have all appeared in various publications before but you probably have not read them for me these short stories were my fix to tide me over until lehanes next full-length novel i enjoyed them but they were not enough to satisfy me,67,13
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,rarely does a book of short stories hold my interest but coronado did the short stories ranged from good to outstanding i was quickly drawn into most stories and the writing was better than in most of his novels the only part of this collection that i did not like was coronado the play scenes at the end my two favorite short stories were running out of dog and until gwen those two alone make this collection worth picking up,80,14
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,these are great stories that show how far lehane has advanced from the unrealistic potboilers of his earlier work powerful stuff that reminds a little of carver,27,15
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,this is my first dennis lehane book and he is a fine writer he explores many aspects of human nature in his stories occasionally with a subtle touch of irony the themes of the stories are sometimes depressing but they help one gain insight into other people other places,49,16
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,dennis lehane is quickly becoming my one of my favorite authors and i was very excited to see something new for him short stories but these just are not very good some stories have potential but they just do not get developed and others are just boring if you have never read lehane i recommend him highly just do not start with this book,61,17
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i have been a big fan of dennis lehane over the years and have read all of his patrick kenzie novels and was hungry for more of his writing i saw two books by him on amazon that were not part of the kenzie series and bought them just because lehane was the author the first book was shutter island and i loved it the other book was coronado and i thought it was horrible even although dennis lehanes name is on the cover i have trouble believing that the same man who wrote all those other great books wrote this trash if coronado had been the first lehane book i read it would also have been the last and i would never have known his true talent,128,18
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,I am struck by the response of other amazon readers i agree that coronado is not the equal of one of lehanes novels but short stories and short plays are seldom the equal of a novel particularly a novel crafted by a writer as gifted as lehane each of the stories here is dark and each is haunting in it is own way like any reader i have my favorite s but the collection as a whole carries the lehane touch i waited awhile to buy coronado because like most readers i was waiting for the next lehane novel paging through the book it felt odd to me particularly with a two-act play that grew out of one of the stories i should have read it earlier any collection is a priori uneven but each of the stories held my attention and running out of dog and before gwen are unforgettable the stories also take lehane away from his geographical base and demonstrate the range of his talent I am still waiting for that next novel but coronado has given me enough of a lehane fix to help me tolerate the wait,188,19
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,a collection of short stories and a script this was very disappointing dennis lehane is among my favorite authors but these stories fell far short of his usual great reads it seems like these were old stories that were lying around and there was a thought that if they were bundled together in an attractive package a quick buck could be made ugh,63,20
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i had read every one of dennis lehanes books and was so excited to see that he had a new one coming out i preordered it and could not wait to dive into it well i was bitterly disappointed this book seemed to be written by someone else entirely it was depressing and lackluster as if he had been forced at gunpoint to write something his other books are brilliant I am hoping he will write another one with patrick and angela wonderful characters and great plotlines,85,21
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,I have read dennis lehane since his kenzie and gennaro detective series one of which is being made into a movie as i write this if you have read lehane before you will not be disappointed here this guy is easily one of the best american writers of the current day,48,22
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,having consumed the kenzie and genaro series followed in quick succession by the rest of his works i left on a high with shutter island awaiting his next release this is a case of really not worth the wait if you are new to lehanes work then invest in his back catalog skip this book in it is entirety if this is your first dl book then do not measure him on this the book starts well the first short story is not a bad read i really felt that it went down hill from there sorely disappointed,95,23
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,as one who owns copies of all the published work of this writer i found the stories and play technically adroit they are replete with good dialogue pace surprising plot lines excellent settings pointed descriptions and believable characters for anyone interested in observing a first class novelist explore a different medium this book is recommended,55,24
Books,006113967X,4.0,positive,my interest in fiction with a boston setting led me to discover dennis lehane some years ago when i learned that we are alums of the same high school thirty plus years apart i was hooked his boston tales are authentic and jsut plain fun to read his flair for the language and skill at crafting plots set him apart from other writers in coronado tales he stretches westward and stretches his imagination and the readers a good deal also these five short stories and the play-script reinforce lehanes reputation as an artist and story teller and remind us that the short story is an art form itself,108,25
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,i bought this book the day it came out dennis lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors what a letdown he is so talented i will buy his next book the day that it comes out however this one does not showcase his talent,46,26
Books,006113967X,5.0,positive,i am truly surprised at the negative reviews this collection of short stories and one play has received maybe it is because people do not like to see one of their favorite authors deviate from the norm in any way or maybe it is because it is been a while since shutter island came out I am not sure but i do know that i happened to have loved this collection i thought all of the stories were original and unique and i particularily loved the play coronado i would have loved to see have seen this performed live i do hope however that we have not seen the last of patrick and angie how about another book in that series dennis please,117,27
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,two of the short stories in this book running out of dog and gone down to corpus are not new stories running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr l writing about ironies and tragedies of average people but it should have been noted that 40 of this book is not original the others are average reads over before we have any understganding of the characters mr lehane writes so well about none of the others are full of tension irony comedy tragedy and suspense we have all come to expect they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the authors excellent reputation we waited a long time for another lehane this book certainly does not showcase his talents,124,28
Books,006113967X,2.0,negative,while i love dennis lehane his prose his timing and generally his stories these stories get more and more depressing as you move along,24,29
Books,006113967X,1.0,negative,disappointment quickly followed excited anticipation after reading the first story hoping it would get better i kept going just to become more and more exasperated and frustrated i realized that i was actually angry at having been taken for a fool in my opinion mr lehane used his fame to bring back some of his previous work which sounds like lines written with no purpose other than to lose the reader or even worse a small attempt a la steinbeck in out of dogs which came too close to of mice and men which was a great story,98,30
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,in the gene re of detective / police novels i think that faye kellerman is the best ms kellerman writes elegantly and she does a thorough resereach of her subject matter in the mercedes coffin you get the feel for the life and language of the hip hop crowd i entertained my teenagers with some of the words that are used in the story my favorite is nomasayin it is sit at theof your chair kind of book the ending is very surprising i will not tell you more buy the book and enjoy,93,0
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,the mercedes coffin by faye kellerman is the seventeenth peter decker and rina lazarus mystery having read most of the preceding mysteries this is like visiting with old friends and very enjoyable peter decker is asked to investigate a fifteen year old murder that is now a cold case that of a very popular guidance counselor from a los angeles school who was found in the trunk of his mercedes shot in the back of the head execution style interest in the case has been raised because someone else has been murdered in the same fashion and found in the trunk of their mercedes faye kellerman always writes a well plotted interesting mystery and the mercedes coffin is no exception i enjoy reading about the decker and lazarus family as much as i enjoy the mystery the only fault i found with this book is that rina lazarus did not play as important a role in this book as she has in others I have read but that said i enjoyed the mercedes coffin very much and it kept me turning pages until the end highly recommended to mystery lovers,189,1
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,money can not buy everything but a billionaire can try when she reads about a murder genoa greeves is reminded about her high school guidance counselor who suffered death by the same mo fifteen years earlier and she is prompted to do something about it so she makes a deal with the lapd offering a million-dollar endowment if the original case is revived and solved who can resist such an offer certainly not the cash-strapped police department so the stage is set for another peter decker-rina lazarus novel and a marvelous tale it is complete with the customary references to the couples orthodox jewish beliefs and culinary tastes lt detective peter decker is assigned to the task and he quickly becomes involved in both cases with a little assistance from his detective daughter cindy the task becomes complicated with additional murders especially those of one of the original detectives as entertaining as the novel is it is intriguing in it is composition keeping the reader perplexed amid the lies deceptions and relationships among the cast of characters it is an exciting read among the series best and the twist at the end is as tasty as a raisin challa highly recommended,199,2
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,love faye kellerman and the peter drecker books very good,10,3
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,i have not read a faye kellerman book in a long time so glad that i rediscovered her this one did not disappoint,22,4

Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i was disappointed in the way the ending happened i was given this book by my mother having never read ms kellerman before i was pleased with the plot of the book yes the pace was slow however i carried on i just was so disappointed at the fact that there was never an ending,56,7
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,kaye could not get through the book she did not know how to resolve it so she killed the end very boring and no satisfying ending i feel gipped,29,8
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,one of the lazarus decker novels i love this series always a good mystery along with the development of the younger characters a good read,25,9
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,story dragged a little but the plot was interesting,9,10
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,this book seemed like it got into unending talking about almost unending possibilites of connections between the various characters finally getting to the end was the best part in my opinion,31,11
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,too many different names to keep track of the middle of the story was mostly fluff and filler i almost quit reading it several times the authors books seem to be getting more bland,33,12
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,too many characters too much irrelevant detailing not worth the time ending fizzled,15,13

Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i was quite disappointed with this book especially the ending there were too many characters to keep track of too many rambling discussions of what might be going on in the case blah blah blah and a final wrap-up that is accomplished via a discussion between characters it was as although time ran out to get this to the publisher,61,33

Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,this was my first faye kellerman book to read it will not be my last the author did an excellent job of writing this police procedural story she took the reader through a cold case with precision i will be reading more o her books in the future,48,45
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,the book was pretty good the dectective work was stellar once again the husband wife team and the daughter was very interesting getting peter to finally go on vacation,29,46
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i found this mystery to be rather predictable i was always aahead of decker and his detectives as for the charming part of the series the relationship between rina and peter and their orthodox lifestyle there was hardly any of it in mercedes coffin as a mystery and as a window into a unique culture the book fails on both counts which does not leave much to enjoy,71,47
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have read all the decker / lazarus books and sorry but this is the one I have enjoyed least lack of action until the last few pages and then a bit implausible give this one a miss,33,48
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have been a fan of faye kellermans in the past but this book was bad the plot was boring very unbelievable overall the book was a big blah wish i would not have spent the money,36,49
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,the book starts off well there has a cold case of a body stuffed into the trunk of a mercedes 15 years later there has another under somewhat similar circumstances ms kellerman needed to stay focused on that premise halfway through the book the author is still introducing more characters you will need a scorecard to keep track she also gets heavily into the members and secondary characters of a punk rock band yep no kidding the dialogue becomes very repetitive and boring there are no twists at the end the ending just shows up it just did not matter by the time ms kellerman decided to end this travesty i just did not care who did it or why ms kellerman would have done well to drastically cut the length and characters to make this into a short story in it is present form it is tedious at best,144,50
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i agree with many of the previous comments i read the first 3 books of the series and remember enjoying them i was pleased to notice this one at the library and was looking forward to a few hours with the appealing decker family i was not bored until the middle of the book but then i kept waiting for something interesting to happen nothing happened i skipped to the end of the book and read the denouement it was anticlimactic and i was glad that i had not bought this book even as a library read i can not recommend it,100,51
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,this is the most boring book I have ever read with the exception of textbooks nothing happens there is no suspense no action and the writing is awful i mean please it was the juiciest turkey sandwich he had ever eaten and the bread was very fresh I shall never read another book by faye kellerman again,57,52
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i enjoy mysteries and cop dramas which this was however the book had typos in it right and left there were numerous scenes that appeared to attempt to flesh out the story line but seemed particularly useless in driving the plot the conclusion was entirely unsatisfying the denouement was boring and lackluster take my 2 cents and spend it wisely,60,53
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,there are few things that disappoint me more than a great story marred by poor writing i thought the premise of the book was great and it had great potential but i just could not suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the story what was up with the endless descriptions of what everyone was wearing every time someone walked in the room we got the dime store paperback pseudo blackwell fashion review he wore a blueshirt and brown slacks his wiry arms still sculpted with defined musculature orthopedic sandals were on his feet she wore a kelly green silk blouse and a pair chino pants her feet were housed in rhinestone sandals yawn so heres the other thing my guy has been a police officer for 32 years the conversations in an investigation just do not go the way they did in this book i read a couple of pages to my guy and he rolled his eyes nuff said i tried i really did i hung in all the way through but the book never redeemed itself I am a little bummed that what could have been a great story was killed by the flat writing,197,54
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i really tried to like this book i did but it became increasingly obvious that without a map i would not be able to find the books direction it had too many details about too many characters it was hard to follow the plot line because of all the boring overwritten unnecessary details having just finished it about the only thing i remember is that peter was married to the always perfect rina the rest of the book was bogged down with such minutia that i was praying for a syllabus or maybe i just prayed for it to end sorry ms kellerman you just lost a reader,107,55
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,peter decker and rina lazarus series as the seventeenth faye kellerman book in the peter decker and rina lazarus series the mercedes coffin was a complex book that addressed the current exercise of solving of cold cases as someone that is very interested in the jewish faith i was a little disappointed that we did not see more of rina in this book the story line has peter investigating a 15 year old file of the murder of dr ben little a school vip his department was asked to look into the case because of a request received from a very wealthy woman who promises great things as a reward when a second victim is also found in the truck of his mercedes there appears to be a tie-in to the previous unsolved murder faye kellermans books always have twists and turns and solving this mystery is very complicated and takes thinking outside the box you must pay attention to what every person says who is questioned the clues are there hidden in their statements as a fan of faye kellermans decker and lazarus series i look forward to her next book,192,56
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,as other reviewers have noted faye kellermans latest should at best be checked out from the library or borrowed from a friend it really is that bad I am glad that I am a fast reader and did not mind wasting a sick-at-home afternoon on a mystery that was not much of a mystery with characters you remember liking but in this outing having difficulty remembering why and a plot that felt like the product of a bad computer program it is understandable that kellerman could be running out of steam on her decker-lazarus series there ve been enough of them still if you were to read the dust jacket blurb a cold case turns red hot threatening to consume everyone it touches including los angelespd detective peter decker and his wife rina lazarus in the spellbinding new thriller you would have to wonder if the blurb writer read the same book you had spellbinding thriller and poor rina is barely peripheral if you have never read one of faye kellermans books check the publication date and opt for one of the early ones at least then you will understand what the acclaim is all about,190,57
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i really do not like reading faye kellerman but will do it if i am hard up for something to read which is what happened this time i think the reason i do not like her books is because reading faye kellerman is kind of like being at jesus camp for judaism by force it is not that i have anything against judaism it is just that i do not like being proselytized to or having religion constantly shoved in my face and that is what kellerman does with her constant references to orthodox judaism the family values the good woman slaving in the kitchen and sacrificing for her children and more it reminds me of accidentally picking up one of those christian fiction books and finding myself in the midst of some characters who talk about nothing except how they are postponing sex until marriage how they can be born again by giving their souls to jesus what they are wearing to the purity ball and more i wish kellerman would just tell her stories and stop trying to be the tim lahaye of judaism,177,58
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,I have read every single book in the peter decker / rina lazarus series as has my mother i love her books but we both gave up on this one boring boring boring i tried to slog through this one but i ended up giving up it just was not worth it if you have not read her before do not start with this one if you have you might want to pass on this one or at least do not buy it check it out of the library dull and tedious,88,59
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,this book was received in a timely manner and in the condition i paid for,16,60
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I have been a fan of she and her husband for years while hers started out with more characterization they are quickly dwindling to weary plots dragged out dialogue and unsatisfying endings unfortunately this one fits in that category decker just comes across as ready to enter into retirement at any moment ms kellermann please bring back the passion you used to have for these characters or just give us a new character that all of us can enjoy,78,61
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i had not read a faye kellerman book for many years i really enjoyed picking this one up and starting it the beginning was great then it moved so slowly that it was almost painful i had to set aside time to finish it which is unusual in a mystery the plot took a very long time to unwind and i had to admit i was not interested in any of the characters as others said i was glad i borrowed it from the library,85,62
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,this is the first faye kellerman book i simply could not finish after a promising start it became very confusing with all the extra characters that were simply referred to by their first names or last names without the hints that most authors give i only had a little more to read but i lost interest so much i just returned it to the library do not waste your money on this boring book,73,63
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,disappointing the best that can be said is i read a library copy so all i wasted was my time the beginning was great and then the book deteriorated into a complete bomb with discussion after discussion that could not have been more tedious and boring so much so that i really did not care about anything anyone skipping those discussions lost me nothing and the ending was simply too too boring incomplete dull need i go on sorry about this review as i have read the entire decker series very happily over the years will definitely give second thoughts after this one about what I shall do with the next title the supreme irony here for me is that i long ago stopped reading her husbands books for a very similar reason oh well there are enough really good writers out there that we have many other choices,141,64
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I have read most of faye kellermans novels and have liked many of them especially straight into night but this one is well bad i kept laying it aside and picking up again forcing myself through the tedium when i finally made it to the last page the outcome was disappointing vague see for yourself there could be no murder conviction based on the evidence presented keeping the characters straight was a problem there are all sorts of low lifes without much to distinguish one from another then there is a great deal of extraneous material what characters wore every time they were presented a disciplining editor should have cut a hundred pages or so of fat off this the plot is not all that good either even if this were edited better kellerman tries to write a gritty police procedural but it is not up to the standards of ed mcbain or michael connelly or to kellermans previous work the grit somehow does not feel right i recommend that people skip this one especially faye kellerman fans,170,65
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,as others have said there are too many characters in this book each one is referred to by first name last name and often a nickname sometimes in the same paragraph there has a rudy and a ryan melinda and a marilyn not to mention cal and cal j a red herring that went nowhere and so many times i said to myself who has mudd again i love the series but the last two books have gone downhill,78,66
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,first and foremost i have to say that i am a big fan of the authors i have followed this series forever i was so excited to see a new novel with this cast the reality of it is that the only enjoyable part of this book was kind of catching up with the cast the whole story dragged and was so confusing with the million and one characters i found that the story was slow to develop and many times i had to re-read a section just to wrap my mind around the cast of characters there were just too many names being thrown around essentially i would say there were too many threads being pulled on at once i did not enjoy the book at all and although i am an avid reader it was like pulling teeth to get myself to finish reading it hopefully she can do better in the next installment,155,67
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,i especially enjoy reading books when the author has the main characters the same people in their books,18,68
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i generally love these novels this one just did not hit the mark for me overly long and way too much time between beginning middle and end and the ending was not satisfactory after suffering through the book to get there,38,69
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,a smart mystery kellerman develops her ongoing characters with every outing in this series,14,70
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i have enjoyed the decker series since the beginning what happened it is as if faye kellerman was not writing the book i have enjoyed the characters and learning about the jewish faith but something is very wrong i could not keep track of the characters i thought it was me until i read another review that said the same thing i have not even been able to finish the book although i am trying faye we love you please take note of this and bring back the old format in the next book your fans will be back i hope you are to,100,71
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,i am a big fan of faye kellermans books with the peter decker / rina lazuras continuing characters being my favorite while this is a fast paced intriguing who done it i was fascinated with the current day exploration of a case tied to the past ms kellermans plots and characters are always fresh with current events tied in appropriately her research and authenticity ring true for me i also find it a real treat to try to get a small glimpse into the beliefs and observances of an orthodox jewish family and i enjoy the real family values that these characters portray especially in this day and age i would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story that is exciting a bit philosophical and has a great underlying message about the importance of family i applaud this effort and greatly appreciated this book,145,72
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I am a fan of fay kellerman I have totally enjoyed her decker lazarus books in the past this one should have come with a map a real big map this story grabs you from the beginning the first third meets and greats the characters but there are too many characters sometimes referred to by their first names and sometimes their last that i had trouble keeping them straight so many plots discussed over and over that i really can not even begin to explain the plot i wanted to like this book however i just wanted it to end tear out the middle third and you might enjoy it,107,73
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i am a huge faye kellerman fan and have read every book in the peter decker rina lazarus series but i have to say that this is probably the last walk I shall take with these characters after reading the last book the burnt house i held out hope that this next book would be better but it was not i m glad i checked it out from the library instead of paying for it i was so incredibly disappointed definitely not recommended,81,74
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,sorry to have to be negative but i have read everything that faye kellerman has ever written and she is allowed to have her off days this book finishes it for me i could not keep track of all the characters the family life of rina and decker was not flushed out as i used to enjoy forget the picnic basket contents it was not worth the effort this time and i am beyond disappointed seems she is writing to the new generation and i am certainly and happily not one of them could not recommend this book i wonder did she really write it or was it a surrogate,108,75
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,for those of you that gave a few thumbs down to the past 2 or 3 books by this author do not give up this is the old faye kellerman with lots of action and what ifs in it this was a very good read and i recommend it the storyline was quite realistic in this day and time hannah is a teenager with all the angst that goes with it cindy is a detective and helps peter with a cold case that he was assigned,85,76
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have loved all of the faye kellerman books except this one the characters were flat and the plot even flatter it is as if she had to put this one out in a hurry it took me 8 days to read it i kept waiting for the plot to get interesting it never did,51,77
Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,great story this is the first faye kellerman I have read but i will definitely read more of her work,19,78
Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,fifteen years ago dr ben little a very popular school vice president was murdered execution style and found in the trunk of his mercedes the crime was never solved one of the students whose life he touched is now a very wealthy woman when she reads a current article in the newspaper about another man found dead in the trunk of his mercedes she believes the two crimes are somehow related she offers a million dollars to the lapd to take another look at the cold case the story follows lt peter decker who is assigned the task of finding dr bens killer through a maze of relationships that tie known associates to both of the murdered men the story contains a lot of layers as the puzzle pieces come together this is the first book I have read by the author i very much appreciated the mystery aspect of the story which was well thought out and was surprised at the outcome i also appreciated that triggers were pointed out to us during questioning of various people giving us a betterof what the detective got out of it instead of having it explained to us afterwards,197,79
Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have read all of faye kellermans books this is the first one that i found boring i thought that it was way too complicated and could not follow the characters and plot i missed the family connections and traditions that were in her other books i thought the novel was too drawn out and had to push myself to finish it i was very disappointed,65,80
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,faye kellermans detective peter decker seems more like a woman with every new book a likable and competent woman the male / female contrast that we saw in the earlier novels is lacking rinas presence in this book is slight and it is okay because we do not have any need to balance peter he has gone over to our side,57,81
Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i have been a long-time fan of faye kellerman peter and rina and their family have been familiar characters for many years through many books this one started out with a compelling mystery two men were killed 15 years apart in a very similar manner both of them were found dead in the trunks of their mercedes automobiles peter decker tries to solve the two murders about half-way through the book the endless talking of the characters starts the detectives were working very hard trying to come up with viable suspects who had a motive to kill both men there were so many names to discuss where they went to school how they knew the murdered men where they were when the crimes were comitted what they were doing now and more for the last half of the book that is all they did discuss i was so glad to see the end of the book that I am not sure i could even tell you how these different characters were involved to quote the book the author said on page 331 that was detective work hours of mind-numbing tedium followed by that compensatory glory-hallelujah once-in-a-blue-moon shot-in-the-veins adrenaline rush i never got beyond the mind-numbing tedium,200,82
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,i had the chance to read this book over some time off recently just so happened i was waiting for a fine dining restaurant to open so i could start serving again after reading this very enjoyable book i felt extremely confident in jumping back in to the industry i look forward to her next offering with hopes that she will carry on in the same vein and this one,69,0

Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,damrosch describes food service and love as the arts that they are with a touch of poetry that is never heavy handed i was amazed amused and moved the slices of behind-the-scenes life at per se cheesemaking in vermont and a blossoming romance in new york city make for a very satisfying journey it almost made me want to become a waiter,60,3
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,this is a very readable book and kind of fun did you know that a waiter at the per se resaurant in new york city makes a 6 figure salary plus benefits do you know diners pay 20000 for a meal there occasionally the wine can cost a lot it was not clear how the sommolier knows anything she says he got menus from many restaurants and then picked the wines that appeared most frequently as being the best duhhh how would you like to eat a 20 course meal includingit sounds like fun even although some of the diners fall asleep at the table or throw up over the balcony onto the diners below and our waitress called a captain has to dress like charlie chaplin complete with bowtie daunting identification have a heart attack if i had to eat in french laundry the mother of per se which is probably even more extravagant,154,4

Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,this book will help you understand why people pay so much for food in a fancy restaurant they are paying for more than the food it is the ballet of the service by a highly trained performer one can only compare it to an evening at a broadway play that will leave lasting memories also the book serves to underscore the importance of provenance fine food comes from fine sources i learned a lot by reading this book,77,8
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,service included by phoebe damrosch a kindle book i started reading on august 8th while glancing to and from my knitting i had not expected so much woe-is-me indecisive chick-lit julie and julia prose from the get-go an almost immediate turn-off but hey i thought I had hold on and see if the juicier waitressy parts of the books got any better the book started to gain speed after the author landed the job with per se but spends so so much time on that same woe-is-me and now everybody-is-smarter-than-me helpless numb hapless prose that makes diners of restaurants feel like they are asking for so much without meaning to in fact i glazed over so much of her personal life this guy against that guy and her random michael pollan-like organic cheese rant to come back fresh anew and with surprised blinks at more description about the service at per se that turned out to be the real nitty-gritty the silk among the floss of this book wheedling aside lady people really want to hear more about the food,177,9

Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,you will never look at waitresses and waiters and other domestic workers the same way again very interesting book loved it,21,12
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i have mixed feelings about this book the behind-the-scenes look at the precise and methodical orchestration of a high-end restaurant with it is many players was really interesting and complex and showed the reader that there is a system to it is success as a hospitality industry albeit for a very select few what disturbed me was the authors frequent need to bash people who have political and philosophical ideals different than her own and which had absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand other than to expose the author as a hypocritical morality bigot it would have been so much more entertaining to read about the restaurant industry rather than to have to put up with her moral relativism republicans and diamonds are not okay but paying 20000 for a single amazing meal and people who vomit from the excess are is the per se restaurant experience art or pretense or both ruth reichls books about food and foodies and herself although way beyond my ken nevertheless drew me in and kept me entertained and wanting more phoebe damrosch however alienated me and ultimately i walked away disappointed ps I am not even a republican,195,13
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,i loved reading the backstory to such a famous restaurant the author did a great job of describing it she deftly handles the story of working at per se along side the story of her romance with andre,38,14
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,love the tips on what to do or not do in a restaurant description of the menu and behind to scenes action,22,15
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,i highly recommend this book i laughed and i cried her voice and writing style are intimate which makes it feel more like a conversation than a one-sided story this also provides for a very quick read which is sad because i did not want it to end,47,16
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i was really excited to read this not because of some chick who wrote it because of thomas keller and his new york city restaurant it spent 75 of the time talking about her little fling with the sommelier really disappointing i t did get into the training there and that was pretty interesting if you want to read about tk check out michael rhulmans books,64,17
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,mildly interesting when the author is discussing food and the restaurant not so much when she has discussing her love life which is a lot of the book also her political jabs are kind of annoying and the story about eve and the condom was revolting but the strongest feeling i got from the book was what planet are these people living on it describes an environment where the pleasure of good food is elevated to an obscene and sometimes ridiculous level of snobbery,83,18
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i was given this book by a colleague who knows my high level of interst in gourmet cuisine the book essentially covers two serparate things an intimate discussion of working at thomas kellers per se restaurant and unfortunately a semi-intimate discussion of the authors life story in regards to the first other than a poor ameturishly condescending writing style the information contained is really informative and interesting she provides a high degree of detail for the operation of per se which had me rivited for the second she provides a dreadfully boring insight into her totally uninteresting romantic life coupled with pointless jabs or ouright rants on her political views can she possibly think anyone cares and her convenient catgorization of people based on career appearence and more per se and thomas keller are interesting the life of a nasty sophmoric opinionated trust fund baby is certainly not,146,19
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,this book has way more negative reviews than positive i wish I had paid attention beause i would have saved myself a truly boiring experience the author goes from boring stories of her personal life to boring stories of her work this book promised all sorts of insiders secrets on the fancy restaurant world do not believe it,56,20
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,to be 100 honest i did not finish this book i tried twice but i found the writer too full of herself and there were no especially interesting insights into the restaurant world and i have to say that when i have something that is light reading i am not especially interested in political feelings it was a bargain bin book my tip is avoid this dreck,67,21
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,never got passed the forward where the writer said offensive to republicans well that is me so i turned if off and erased it from my kindle thank god i downloaded it from my library so the writer did not get a dime from me,45,22
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,poof anyone can land any job and that most pretensions are only that the higher up you go in the restaurant industry the easier and less stressful things actually are in fine dining you are apart of intrinsic team working together to provide that level of service all parts of life should be like that come to think instead of running around trying to balance many tables you are focused only upon a few although since people are simple to appease that is humans do not require a 17 course mean nor is it necessarily healthy you might say that communion with good friends over dinner and wine at home is the best experience of all,113,23
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,we fought the american revolution to end the oppressive monarchy of king george and abolish the entire concept of an aristocracy this book is witness to the new american aristocracy being waited on and fawned over on the level of blue bloods of the past the status of this new aristocracy derives from the ridiculous wealth 1 of the population now controls in our new gilded age no one no matter how rich they are needs to have their a kissed like the customers at this restaurant instead of discussing how immoral and revolting the whole concept of this place is the author makes only a passing attempt at defending such an establishment at per se restaurant in manhattan a table of 8 people according to the author regularly drops 20000 for dinner frankly this is nothing short of disgusting my suggestion is for these people to go to mcdonalds and donate the rest to charity,156,24
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,sure many of us have been temporary workers at a restaurant but have you ever professionally worked as a waiter in new york city at thomas kellers per se phoebe damrosch shares the trials of working as a waiter full-time in a nerve-wracking male-centric workplace while still loving the job it is fascinating to read about the knowledge and routines damrosch had to pick up to be a professional waiter at such an upscale venue and thomas keller fans will especially enjoy the detailed descriptions of the food served at per se despite still having serving-inspired nightmares to this day service included almost tempts me back into the food industry,109,25
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,oddly written with awkward transitions and no actual eavesdropping secrets and i could really have done without the patronizing tips for diners particularly the last few pages of the book,30,26
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,this book was shipped quickly and in even better condition than advertisd i loved the book and wish she had more but congratulations for finally hanging up your apron and writing this book I am intersted to know if you are still with andre and are you are working on another book darlene,52,27
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,the service from the vendor was great i wish i could say the same about the book it was poorly written and did not come anywhere near to the synopsis given basically it was about the authors lovelife instead of her career as a waiter at a high class dining establishment,50,28
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for this book like many reviewers i enjoyed the inside info about the restaurant industry but could have done without the unfocused commentary around it i wondered if someone else wrote these chapters or if they were more generously edited could not quite figure out what the book was trying to accomplish which means the author likely did not know either,64,29
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,but a certainly enjoyable review of working in one of the most demanding and rewarding service jobs where perfection is expected not just on a daily basis but on a moment-to-moment basis balance this off with stories and fears of a burgeoning romance and you have a both enlightening and fun look behind the scenes at a job that would send a lot of people screaming into the night after two hours due to the expectations involved,77,30
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,as a student about to graduate culinary school and is going to work in the front of house this book was very helpful and elightening i had the unique and rare opportunity to interview with per se twice and was able to observe a night of there service from both the kitchen and the dining room this book is very accurate in decribing what goes on at the restaurant and how things are done could have been more detailed seeing as per se is deailed orriented but i would assume she would not want to bore those who are not in the industry for the people that are in the industry we understand this book pretty well written although,118,31
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,well i agree with a lot of people here stay away from this book what a disappointment she writes a lot about her own personal life which really nobody is interested in gives stupid tips to restaurant guests at the end of every chapter please do not steal the waiters pen please do not ask us to microvave your wine tip 20 percent or more control your limbs and the little things she writes about per se and the training she got are mainly boring and lame what a waste of time and money,94,32
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,this is a very fun in depth look at the world of 5 star restaurant servers and the way the industry shapes their lives phoebe does a great job of weaving the personal and professional experiences of her life into an enjoyable read that anyone especially professionals in the industry can appreciate,52,33
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,good book especially if you have ever been in the foodservice or hospitality industry good writing style did not want to put it down not quite as juicy as expected based on the preview and title interesting still,33,34
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,do not make the same mistake i did read these reviews first i was under the impression that this would be a book mostly about the experience of working at per se unfortunately only about 30 of the book is that and while that 30 is good the rest is so bad it really is not worth the money for some reason the author goes out of her way on a few occasions to rip republicans which seems odd given that it is always completely unrelated to the topic at hand amusingly she also warns readers never to ask a waiter what else do you do assuring us that waiters live full lives in their chosen profession she then spends the next 200 pages proving herself wrong as we are treated to all of the details of her shallow life strange book she has a pretty good writer i just can not imagine why anyone cares to hear about her affair when she clearly had a much more interesting topic at hand oh well i made a mistake but you have been warned,176,35
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,if you are interested in the food and service industry this is a good and quick read the author starts her journey before she began at per se and how she got the job i did expect more on her daily life at the restaurant and a little less on her personal life outside of it although overall it is a goo read but i wanted it to sweep me off my feet and it did not,75,36
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,poor shallow sheltered insecure and oh-so-modern phoebe finally gets a job where she blossoms she gets to be a waitress in a fancy restaurant where she can ogle the rich and famous at their tables and fondle the wine steward in the back room whoever thought this trash was of enough value to actually publish should be canned or fried or roasted phoebe should be embarrassed and ashamed the book is boring and petty with glimpses of triteness masquerading as incite the occasional tips to the reader about how to properly dine out without looking like a fool sprinkled throughout the book are the best part and they are as ridiculous as they are condescending do not waste your money on buying this book or your time on reading it if you happen to find someone elses copy in the trash,141,37
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i thought that the book was about per se a behind the scenes look at the restaurant the clientele and and more i was mistaken roughly half the book is about that the other half focuses on the authors love life about which i am not interested i enjoyed the parts about the restaurant but there was too much self-involved discussion of her life away from per se no offense to ms damorsch but i doubt that most readers are looking for that from this book,85,38
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i found this book to be worth reading once but not one I had come back to re-read i liked the parts about training service anecdotes and the vermont cheese field trip she also made me curious about bone marrow i could have done with less verbiage on her love-life and the gratuitous slaps at people who do not share her politcal views oh well red-state people do not patronize 4-star restaurants or buy books either do they,75,39
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviews the torrid love affair was boring at best the most interesting parts were few and far between and were always related to the restaurant this book only got published because it is about per se and by default thomas keller the author does not impress me and her need to insult her red-state readers led me to return the book totally unneccessary and obnoxious,70,40
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,billed as a front of the house kitchen confidential but sadly it was not at all mildy interesting but without any of the juice that was promised not recommended by me,31,41
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i could not even make it as far as the romantic part i suspect the problem lay with the nature of her restaurant rich people overpaying to be seen does not do it for me,33,42
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i really wanted to like this book and this author but what started out promisingly ultimately fell flat into a heap of who cares about your personal relationship with the sommelier the insight gleaned did not feel revealing as the book was so hyped to do and i ended up actually disliking the author by the end who in turns came across as smug condescending and even small i wanted this to be a book i was glad to have in hardcover instead I am just left regretting i dropped the cash and did not read the amazon reviews beforehand instead of just the critics at the risk of being cast out of some community i far preferred amanda hessers book about her latte-loving boyfriend to this one which ended up being in my mind a book about phoebe damroschs wine-loving one,138,43
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,what i really want to say is that someone who is brave enough not afraid of being blacked-balled in the restaraunt world needs to write what restaraunt workers are really like you get a glimpse of the truth in bourdains writings but the place for the misfits the addicts the alcoholics the nearly homeless your favorite restaraunt does not matter what or where it is that waiter who looks so dapper and well-schooled at 9 pm will be a buzzed and boozed wreck at 3 am i know this family members are the real eavesdroppers,90,44
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,i thought this book was flat-out boring and a long long way from what was promised there is little very singular about per se nor about keller there has not much drama either and you might expect more given the kind of clientele they have to compare this to kitchen confidential is criminal it is a kind-of sweet story about a young woman and her new york job which could be in almost any upper-end restaurant from the way the book is written there seemed to be much more about her romantic relationships than about her work which is fine except the book is supposed to be about her work she has not a bad writer and probably has a future writing other chick-lit books but if you are looking for an entertaining read about this very famous restaurant you need to look somewhere else,140,45
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,i took this book camping and finished it in a days time phoebe is really quite funny and keeps your interest throughout the story,24,46
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,this was an excellent book I had highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the food world and in the effects of food on the human experience phoebe had me laughing from the first page to the end her writing style is honest and clever and delightful to read if you are looking for a biography of thomas keller or a historical account of the per se restaurant go read an encyclopedia this is as the author describes it creative nonfiction and in my opinion this book is one of the best,92,47
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,i picked up this book because i am a former waiter chef and caterer owner i have never worked in a 4-star restaurant but have dined in a number of them having spent countless time in restaurants it was fun for me to read about her experiences and they brought back memories although i basically hated waiting tables the fun began after work what i liked most about the book was when she wrote about eating high quality food that is organic free-range and local as an environmentalist who eats organic and local food this was very appealing for example her description of artisan cheese from a small farm in vermont was terrific author ofaward winning book harmonious environment beautify detoxify and energize your life your home and your planet,132,48
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,I am still dragging myself through this one only because i spent money on it i could live without the political opinions,21,49
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,i can see how this got published it is a greatfor a book in theory unfortunately it is derivative and boring there has barely any more about per se or thomas keller than you already know from reviews and magazine articles there has more about the authors relationship also boring than anything else and even that narrative lacks an original voice by parts it is a poor imitation of most of the recent food-related bestsellers if you do decide to read this book you will be reminded of why you liked ruth reichl anthony bourdain and yes even amanda hesser better for a much more interesting treatment of the same subject try shaws turning tables,112,50
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,i could not put this book down there were a few times that i laughed out loud because the situations were similiar to my own the author was able to tie in love family dreams and the crazy customer stories so well that i was done before i knew it great book little do people know that are not in the industry is that this stuff really happens everyone dates each other hates each other forget their family forget what it is like to have a real life and know every late-night spot in town one thing that we all learn is passion you can not work in this industry if you do not love it the author was in love with her job her determination in learning how the little things count such as product knowledge service and covering for a customer when they do not know what the he shall they re talking about was little in an outsiders eyes but major in ours,158,51
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,a highly entertaining book that has a bit of everything a how-to guide to entering the world of the elegant gormand forks wines behavior as well as how not to take it too seriously how to get the best service wherever you go dining service etiquette is a two way street an inside look at artist / youth life in new york city and a good serving of fun stories make this book worth buying go for it you will enjoy it,77,52
Books,0061228141,2.0,negative,another annoyingly overrated memoir about as badly written and in some cases very similar to gael greenes insatiable but from the other side of the table the only reason to read this book is for a handful of interesting details about the food and service at per se otherwise this tell all tells nothing the story of the relationship with her sommelier is beyond boring and she has impenetrably discreet with her recollections of customers and the other staff at per se she does not have the courage or wit to name spill or dish oh truman where are you when we need you the tips for diners at the end of each chapter are just ridiculous do customers at per se really make faces when the server recites the evenings specials if you want truly useful dining-out tips read the engaging and informative turning the tables by steven shaw instead,150,53
Books,0061228141,1.0,negative,the author is mean-spirited towards half the country the book is not advertised as a political diatribe she is also pretentious i purchased 23 books in the past month sorry i bought this one what a waste of trees one star for this book is being generous due to the holiday season when i really would like to give it a minus five star rating spend your book budget on better books and support more worthy authors,77,54
Books,0061228141,4.0,positive,i for one enjoyed how the author travels the reader to and fro her job her heart and the late-night dinning scene in new york city next time i am in the city i will be sure to conduct a few bone marrow comparisons winners as well as losers will be posted as for her relationship with the wine guy in the book who can blame him at lest in the beginning for what having a good time you are young presumably pretty good looking you know how to take a woman out to dinner and dessert and you live in new york city if he had not had some fun you would all be wondering if he was hiding something in the end it is a fast enjoyable read and a tasty stocking stuffer,133,55
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,this book made me hungry for gourmet food and true romance a great read for the beach or for curling up by the fireplace,24,56
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,i have read many books about restaurants chefs cookbooks and more most of the books are either from the chefs point of view or the other cooks in the back-of-house this book comes from the front-of-house point of view which makes it a particularly interesting read the author is a waitress in one of new yorks greatest and most famous restaurants chef thomas kellers per se she takes us through the training through the opening through the new york times very important review of the new restaurant and her intimate relationship with a co-worker at per se along the way we are treated to her other relationships both in and outside of the restaurant her love of her brooklyn apartment and her after-hours dining destinations all with her humorous and personal writing style i recommend this book if you have an interest in reading about restaurants and i hope phoebe writes another food book in the future she obviously know a lot about the subject,164,57
Books,0061228141,5.0,positive,service included four-star secrets of an eavesdropping waiter excellent read i enjoy great food which also requires great service to make it work this book provides insight into the inner workings of one of the countries best chefs and his restaurants my wife bought the book and could not stop talking about it the author writes so well i also could not put the book down i have always had the utmost respect for those who choose to serve and do it well now i even have more,89,58
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,let me preface this by saying i have been an elizabeth lowell / ann maxwell fan since the harlequin days i have all of her books and always look forward to her newest release i purchased beautiful sacrifice soon after the release date I am 10 into the kindle book and so far i do not like any of the characters the plot is so ridiculous I have sent the book back to my cloud really our heroine is going to be ruined and is being blackmailed by our hero because she looked at some pictures of artifacts seized bywe have a crybaby immigration and customs enforcementofficer who is going to be fired for losing the artifacts there has absolutely no proof mind you only the word of his boss ms lowell came up with better scenarios for her silhouettes i can not remember the last time i could not finish a book at some point i may try again if i have the time after december 21 2012,166,0
Books,0061629863,4.0,positive,the book is riveting and wonderful and the plot is very similar to jade island donovan book 2 elizabeth lowell is my favorite author when it comes to romance novels although jr ward jessica bird the billionaire next door silhouette special edition is a very very close second in lowells more recent books her husbands background as a crime reporter has really shown through there has a lot more information on crime in this book than her other books what i like the best about this book is that in some ways it is like a crime report the coverage of the violence and drug war in mexico is superb that is something that I have researched for school for example research on ciudad juarez and the effect on residents of el paso tx and read books about for example rosario tijeras spanish and the depiction of mexico right now is spot-on she reused the name hunter from autumn lover but the bedroom scenes with him and lina are sizzling as in all lowell books it is better than blue smoke and murder,188,1

Books,0061629863,4.0,positive,beautiful sacrifice by elizabeth lowell was an archaeological thriller-romance read that had me on theof my seat throughout the read the romance was hot and heavy as lina and hunter yielded to their need the story was rich in mayan culture and belief and violence as blood was she had in sacrifice lowells characters were rich and well developed strong in their individual rite the story was shrouded in mystery and very intriguing as hunter and lina searched for the missing artifacts returning to linas childhood home they were met with an ailing grandmother a selfish mother and a temperamental father and a cousin lost in the traditional mayan ways of the past the most perfect most beautiful of all sacrifices was to be the mayan princess unless hunter could somehow stop the event from happening his entire future depended upon it this was a very intense read and as a result was very enjoyable lowells writing style although very informative was smooth and easy to follow,168,4

Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,i usually adire elizabeth lowells mysteries this was disappointing the storyline was interesting but the two main characters were rather blah really lina was quite mousy in spite of her allegedly smouldering looks hunter felt like a cipher of a thousand romance heroes gone before my advice get this book from your local library,54,18
Books,0061629863,4.0,positive,good story line for this point in time a nice quick read kind of wish it was longer i would love a second book with these characters,27,19
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,save your money and do not waste it on this boring book if i wanted a class in mayan history I had sign up at the local college the author gets so lost in the details of the maya that the story gets lost very low interest in the relationships and very little excitement I have read a lot of her books and this is not close to some of the others she has written,71,20
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,i am a fan of e lowell have almost all of her books gave this book a low rating because it did not even read like an e lowell book i feel one of two things may be at play here either el was under contractual pressure to get it published in a hurry to take advantage of all the21 2012 hoopla or it was mostly written by a ghostwriter if not and this el book is simply a result of the inevitable i am running out of inspiration and enthusiasm for writing syndrome then a loyal buyer through the years like myself is certainly entitled to rate it low if the next book is as disappointing as this one it wil be the last el book i purchase a sad day indeed,135,21
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,i read two books in between this one and usually when i do not care for a book i still suffer through it to the end eventually I am not so sure i can do that here i have not gotten very far but nothings making me want to continue so far the characters do nothing for me i neither like or dislike them the lectures on mayan civilization i can definitely do without when i pick up a book it is for mindless enjoyment if i learn a thing or two along the way great but this is way beyond necessary i do not care to learn about it and if i did I had def not read a romance novel or whatever this is supposed to be i have never read this writer before so i do not know if this is the norm and so far not sure if I had like to go back for another to find out,155,22
Books,0061629863,5.0,positive,elizabeth lowell is one of my favorite authors i try to read as many of her books as possible great read,21,23
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,as a long time lowell fan i find myself wondering if her evil twin wrote this the romance was more bad first time harlequin than experienced novelist with it is wham bam thank you mam get the sex on immediately throughout and of course ending with it no subtlety sensuality reasonable build up in fact no reasonable story line toss in lots of blood and guts and the totally unbelievable plot comic book like characters and mostly tedious commentary i can only assume ms lowell is under contract to produce within a certain time frame and as she also writes with her husband as well just ground this out i can only hope she finds her muse again along with respect for her loyal readers i love mystery and romance or mystery or romance if plotting and storytelling is good i did like her characters or wanted to but they became simply caricatures i do not like writing bad reviews especially of a writer i admire but i do not see any way around this one where the heck were her editors oh yeah sitting back relying on her name I have read much better first time authors on kindle,196,24
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,elizabeth lowell has been on my must-read list since she wrote as ann maxwell but she is quickly starting to fade from it her latest novel felt more contrived than anything I have ever read from her and i absolutely hated the premise i am grateful that i had enough hesitation about this title that i borrowed it from my local library instead of purchasing it outright i usually enjoy her books and will gladly sacrifice a few hours of sleep to live a little longer in her worlds but for this book i had to push myself the entire way instead of closing it for the last time with a happy smile i just felt relief that it was over do not waste your money,124,25
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,i have never taken the time to write a review before but in this case i feel i have to let all of the elizabeth lowell fans know what they are getting into i wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing this book first of all i have been an avid fan and have most of her books even as ann maxwell i realize that her books have contained much about the mayan culture but this was overkill i appreciate learning new things through her books however when the topic becomes all about history it overshadows all other aspects it was predictable there was an over abundance of discussion on mayan history that dragged on and on which made it very hard to read this is the only book i have ever purchased that i had to force myself to finish it truly makes me question if i were to purchase another of her books in the future i would not automatically pre-order as i have in the past and definitely read reviews before i purchase another of her books i would not recommend this book to anybody very disappointed,191,26
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,let me start by saying i have read and enjoyed almost every book ms lowell has written until this one the editorial mistakes concerning geography are so bad they completely threw me out of the story houston texas is not a border town south padre island is not a hop skip and a jump from houston south padre island is several hours away from houston south padre island is not an exit ramp off of i-10 these jarring errors could have been easily corrected by looking at a map of texas there are no long driveways anywhere on the island which is just a spit of land the houses are not built on stilts the gulf of mexico is not usually called the ocean it is the gulf I am only halfway through the book so who know what other inconsistencies will appear okay now it is just too much have read further and hunter and lina have landed in cozumul an island and are driving to tulum on the mexico mainland please ms lowell really lost credibility with this book and i wondered how credible her other books are,186,27
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,i love elizabeth lowell books but this one is so disappointing i will not rehash the story I shall give you my pros and cons pros both the heroine and the hero were like able no excess baggage or games it was well written now the cons it has almost no action or plot there has one short part when something actually happens the rest of the book is about the mayans the worst part is in the author notes at the end she made up most of it if you have read elizabeth lowell before and do not want to be disappointed skip this one,103,28
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,yet another favorite author has been removed not only from my autobuy list but my autoread list lowells books have become increasingly terrible reads with each new book worse than the one before this book was the first one of hers i could not even finish i almost always finish a book i start but this one was so bad i could not get past more than 50 or so pages before i gave up on it no continuity facts and characters just tossed in with no real connection to the story no flow to the story just got tired of trying to keep up since it has been several books since i found one of lowells books to be an interesting read I am just taking her off my list of authors to read in future seems like elizabeth lowell is just the latest in an increasingly long list of authors more concerned with pushing out yet another book as fast as she can instead of crafting a well written story that her readers will enjoy,174,29
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,i realize that was not to be st kilda but did it have to be this off the mark the book was written like a text book leave out the romance and your there the st kilda books were short on romance but you always knew the people were attracted to one another and cared she did not finish the st kilda books before she moved on it was a bad mistake I shall be more careful before i spend the money buying a first edition I shall wait for the review i have never done that before,96,30
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,i was excited about lowells new book even although it was not about the donovans or st k however i was only a few pages in before i started skimming and skipping pages i thought the set-up was ridiculous the background ridiculous and the dialogue especially ridiculous i think this is her worst book and it does not even compare to her best I am not sure what happened but I shall be waiting for the next one,74,31
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,as a avid lowell reader i could not wait to start this book from front to back i felt like i was reading a documentary on the mayan culture very little depth on the characters boring and very disappointed,38,32
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,i normally love elizabeth lowell novels but this was definitely not her best work the plot was thin the characters shallow and the flow was pretty bumpy it seemed to jump around a lot for no particular reason it sounded like a good premise from what i read before the book came out but i was pretty disappointed,58,33
Books,0061629863,2.0,negative,longtime fans of elizabeth lowell might be happy with her latest work it seems like a book she wrote a decade ago left forgotten in a drawer and published in 2012 the story referenced the mayan calender event of 2012 but it was frequently marginalized as peasant superstition the story was interesting with mayan mythology but it overwhelmed at times the villain was predictable from early on and was too over the top to be believable at the climax it had one redeeming feature the main characters they were wonderfully written and had nice depths they were the only joy in the book the plot line was predictable and pedantic i have been a devoted fan but i found myself disappointed and let down thankfully i did not pay hardcover retail prices if i had i would have returned the book,141,34
Books,0061629863,4.0,positive,beautiful sacrifice takes the story of the 2012 maya prophecy to new heights dr lina taylor is descended from the maya and spanish who conquered them she is the daughter of two very strong and complicated people and the current heir to the reyes balam lands in south america she has studied the maya on digs with her archeologist father and now teaches about the complex culture when hunter johnson formeragent and a sometimes student comes to her with photographs of stolen artifacts she is drawn quickly into the hunt and into the treachery and fanaticism of those who worship the ancient maya god kawail whose nature and rituals are shrouded in mystery bodies pile up as the blood of sacrifice rains down because a power-hungry entity known as ' el maya wants to usher in a new world order with the maya as victorious this time plot twists and heart-stopping action entwined with a developing relationship are masterfully rendered by ms lowells hand while sometimes surreal each discovery and person fits seamlessly into the story giving it a real-life feel as we come inevitably closer to december 21 2012 and it is myriad possibilities,196,35
Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,i have been reading elizabeth lowell since her loveswept days and she was for years an autobuy then she got away from any romance in her books given that they are supposed to be romantic suspense that is part of what you should be able to reasonably expect from the book in this book she goes back to having some fairly hot romance and it almost got me to finish the book but the research / droning on and on and on about the mayan history was sooooo boring I am sorry I had rather reread any of the books she wrote 20 years ago for the 10 time than finish this book,106,36

Books,0061629863,1.0,negative,i have read elizabeth lowell / ann maxwell since the beginning of her career she has had good very good and excellent tales this book is so bad that i would throw it in the garbage if i had not ordered for my kindle please do not buy this book there is no substance it is boring,53,38

Books,0061661287,2.0,negative,marianna rode on the coat tails of martha stewart for over 20 years any other average human being that wanted to be treated like a puppet or a second class citizen could have riden along for the ride as well I am shocked and saddened that marianna ignored all the rudeness ugliness and made excuses for marthas behavior can you say bury your head in the sand most of us would have punted ms to the curb years ago but i guess if you wanted to visit all those exotic places and meet the rich and famous you could not possibly stand up to a ms and not pay the consequences please where was mariannas backbone,113,0
Books,0061661287,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the book i doubt that i would like martha as a friend but i sure like her taste,20,1
Books,0061661287,4.0,positive,very interesting things about martha i was not aware of for sure I am glad that i bought the book easy read,20,2
Books,0061661287,4.0,positive,more of a self-examination of one womans tendency to allow herself to be abused and denigrated both in public and private in order to enjoy the privileges of knowing the friends of the super rich i found this book to be very interesting a genuine peep thru the curtains of an extremely private sad using survivor of abuse who seemed to be unable to commit to anyone or anything from house to house to house friend to friend to friend we follow her with marianna who is too caught up in the glitz and material gains her association with martha brings her to stand up to her rudeness smack her hand when called for or leave her in midstream even when the safety of her own children was involved i wish them both well but what sound and fury signifying nothing,142,3
Books,0061661287,1.0,negative,I am a fairly fast reader and normally breeze through books this one took me three weeks to finally finish 395 pages of self-congratulating name dropping and hermes-wearing she leached off of martha for over 20 years and her final parasitic act is to write this boring one-sided account of a so-called friendship filled with metaphors flowery prose and way too many quotes from others,64,4
Books,0061661287,1.0,negative,expertly polished in cover girls nile red trembled as i turned fascinating page after page of this tome in a non-perfect world or as mary worth pointed out a less-than perfect world mariana pasternak stands head and shoulders above lesser mortals such as you or i like a nova a glittering shining star bursting and twisting into the black ink of the solar system past a multitude of stars or in the words of carl sagan billions upon billions of stars our heroine takes it on the chin from the abusive and dismissive stewart reading this story i was reminded of my youth long winter evenings spent dining at a private table in my college whatsamatta u cafeteria frozen peas boiled potatoes mystery meat under glass and of course a flute of sprite to wash it all down and listening to hall and oats maneater while wearing a superb ensemble of dress barn evening frock fashion bug ford pinto faux red alligator bag and payless stilletos watch out man she will chew you up yes indeed,174,5
Books,0061661287,2.0,negative,obviously ghostwritten you never have the feeling that you are reading the writing of a romanian exile paskternak comes across as pretentious and disingenuous she is also very disloyal although she sings regular hosannas you can can feel the venom beneath just plain jealous i already knew that martha could be a witch but i still admire the wonman you do get a view into her lovelife you get to see where martha is vulnerable i came away admiring her even more i rate the book a 2 but martha gets a solid 10,94,6
Books,0061661287,1.0,negative,the best of friends martha and me what has happened to loyalty mariana pasternak as well as her daughters have been the recipients of the generosity of martha stewart in numerous ways without her ms pasternak would not have had the exposure to opportunities and the finer things of life i question anyone who makes herself out to be a saint while tearing down her best friend every story has two sides and i would love to hear marthas i believe highly creative people can be demanding and difficult but ms pasternak does not show any of her own personal warts or weaknesses i disliked this author immensely she is self serving she is not authentic or believeable and is trying to cash in on her relationship with a celebrity friends with mariana pasternak no thanks,139,7
Books,0061661287,1.0,negative,while it started off fairly interestingly it did not take long for me to start asking what marianas problem was she repeatedly let martha walk all over her but then came back for more time and time again it does not sound like the sort of friendship i would want to be involved with it is obvious that mariana stayed friends with martha over the years in order to take advantage of the social and travel opportunities afforded her by martha but mariana then has the gall to complain about all of them she tries to paint martha in a negative light by saying that she is first and foremost about the almighty dollar but mariana proves herself to be just the same mariana certainly did herself no favors in this ridiculous book,131,8
Books,0061661287,1.0,negative,when i read all the negative reviews i thought perhaps those were written by loyal friends of martha and i was curious to read the book after reading the book i have increased admiration for martha stewart her energy drive generosity adventurous and positive spirit and her vulnerability while conversely nothing but the lowest opinion of the author summarized in one word contemptible anyone with the least shred of decency would not stab in the back a friend of 20 years much less in public and for profit no person with any self-respect would reveal private information about another such as this author does furthermore after all those years the author really has to sift and stretch to find any dirt to dish and if martha is not an absolutely perfect person well guess what neither am i this mean-spirited attempt to smear martha just ends up revealing the author for the mean-spirited snake-in-the-grass that she is ps the book describes the sneaky deceitful cruel way that andy stewart left his wife and marriage of 27 years the very definition of weasel,186,9
Books,0061661287,5.0,positive,well written interesting author mariana pasternak is very intelligent and i learned a lot vacationing vicariously through her book,19,10
Books,0061661287,2.0,negative,i am about to give up on this one i am a third of the way through on the audio version not unlike her friend martha mariana is extremely self-serving she goes on and on about her life which is not why i bought this book her references to martha are filled with backhanded compliments in truth these two are too much alike to ever be real friends i admit it i bought it for the dirt i am not a martha fan and feel that much of her fame comes on the backs of those who work for her she is famous for taking credit for what they do and they are all too afraid of her to say anything this book is badly written and disappointing the reader sounds like she is talking to a class of pre-schoolers another real turnoff skip this one,147,11
Books,0061661287,5.0,positive,this book was well written and super interesting it all read as perfectly true to life and insightful easy to see how a regular person could be caught up in marthas world but not being martha it could also be difficult to be exposed to that grand life without the cash to fund it plus martha did not seem too inclined to share or even too generous the only part that seemed a little hazy was the legal wrangling at the end somehow none of that rang exactly true to me the author remembered theof the ducks on marthas socks 15 years before but could not remember who said what about the stock deal i read a lot and this book had me rushing home from work to read the next chapter it was a fun look into an interesting life,141,12
Books,0061661287,5.0,positive,highly recommended helps you to understand what drives martha stewart and the sad consequences of how money and power can in my opinion and what appears to be a little mental illness drive away even those friends who did not care about your wealth in the first place just goes to show as well money can not buy love or true happiness a very big must read for martha stewart fans,71,13
Books,0061661287,2.0,negative,this book actually made me like martha stewart which is amazing because i always assumed she was just a rich obsessive-compulsive diletante but no she travels in her non-existant spare time to places like peru where she visits a guinea pig farm and eats guninea pig with her traveling child realtives telling them it is chicken fricasse she hails transport on her own in egypt with more child relatives in tow gets abandoned by said transport and partakes of a meal and makes friends with a local woman in her humble home there are a lot more such stories i was impressed i travel a lot but i tend to be careful about what i eat the woman who wrote this book is truly annoying what female can not relate to the pain of a backstabbing jealous former frenemy read it but do not pay for it check it out at the library in a few months,154,14
Books,0061661287,5.0,positive,this honest well written memoir is more than a book about martha stewart it is a travelogue a social diary and a story of women friendship this page turner is chock full of intimate details and entertaining glimpses into the lives of the rich and famous although these two best friends seem to have it all in real life they struggle with the same issues all other women worry about men family and career through hilarious stories the author offers us a look into the real martha stewart sharing secret hopes and disappointments passions and vulnerabilities every woman will find herself in this cautionary tale of female friendship loaded with historical and literary references everyone attracted to marthas life-style will feel as if living the pulse of marthas world women who like to travel will follow dream-itineraries women who love entertaining will devour the nuances of martha dinner parties and women who like to decorate will enjoy the bargain hunting and antiquing tales whether you are a martha fan or not you will be absorbed by this captivating tale,180,15
Books,0061661287,5.0,positive,even if one did not know who martha stewart is this book would be fascinating due to the authors knowledge of literature art history design and international destinations some of which of course was gleaned from friendship with martha the style is intelligent with many references to the source vivid descriptions and celebrity tales most people know perfectionists and their behavior in many ways this book demonstrates motives for the dominant and submissive manner in relationships and shows how everyone uses everyone else,83,16
Books,0061661287,4.0,positive,i thought this was a well written honest look at a friendship between 2 women i do not really understand the extreme negative reviews i felt that mariana was freshingly honest in her look back at both of their lives and how they related to each other she never asked for anything other than friendship and paid her own way with interest on the many trips they took together mariana lost her livelihood her home and many of her friends when she told the truth at marthas trial again i do not understand how people can accuse her of riding on marthas coattails for 20 years are these marthas friends or employees writing this i have also felt that martha was a driven person who sometimes probably did not understand how her actions affected others and this book confirmed that i pass no judgement on martha she has flaws just as the rest of us do and as mariana does I am sure but it is certainly interesting to take a look at her life her homes and her relationships by the way i listened to the audio book of the best of friends which i thought was excellent the narrator was a joy to listen to,203,17
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,this book was a totally different change of pace after some of the predictable ones I have been reading recently disturbing but a great read and will keep you thinking,29,0
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,small but perfectly formed that is al guthrie for you this is one of the splendid series of novellas published by five leaves in killing mum carlos morales does odd jobs for people several of those odd jobs involve offing people when carlos receives a padded envelope one day it is a good news bad news sort of affair the good news is that a mystery client will pay him 20000 to kill valerie anderson the bad news is that valerie anderson is his mother oh and there has more bad news he suspects the woman he loves of being the one who wants his mother dead dark warped and funny and with a surprising number of twists and turns for such a short book i read it in one sitting alternately giggling and gasping strangely enough i had a whole train carriage to myself by the end of it loved it loved it loved it,153,1
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,you have to keep mum about killing mum because as other reviewers have noted it is hard to say too much without spoilers it is about a for-hire hit-man who is given a lot of money to kill his own mother he has both cool about it and curious he has prepared to do it but would like to know who wants him to do it is it his wife is it even the mother guthries writing is strong on dialogue which many writers find hard to do convincingly some writers talk tough but their characters just end up sounding manufactured elmore leonard is a master of great natural dialogue and while guthries characters are a world away from leonards they have that same tough-sounding realism i liked what one reviewer said about blood simple that is a really good comparison like the coen brothers movie it is gritty noir yet also occasionally comic and the characters are totally real by the way one reviewer referred to problems with the kindle version but I have read the kindle version and did not see any problems at all or maybe i was just too engrossed in the story,190,2
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,killing mum is a short sharp shocker true brit grit the novella is as tight as a very tight thing and is a spin off from guthries cracking novel savage night it is the story of a man who is paid to kill his own mother like savage night killing mum takes a violently absurd and tragically comic situation and gives it a couple of dark and bitter twists it is like having blood simple transported to modern day scotland and is a rush of a read five bloody stars,88,3
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,killing mum immediately sucks you in with a dark calculating main character that nonchalantly embraces his life as an assassins agent a quick read that you will not be able to put down the kindle version seems to have a few errors that are periodically annoying hopefully they will be fixed in a revised version,54,4
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,a true modern master of noir and crime fiction allan guthrie packs a wallop with his gut punch of a novella a sweet little package from crime express called killing mum carlos is a man who arranges killings for a fee of course a letter arrives addressed charlie a name only his wife and mother use for him the letter contains the down payment and instructions for a job but there has a hitch the intended target is none other than carlos mother and it all goes downhill from there guthrie is able to amp up the suspense right from the get go and it just never let up throughput the 96 page run and yeah thank the maker it is not a novel length story because damn it will nearly wear you out as it is any longer you might just need an ambulance the plot moves swift and we for the most part learn about the characters via dialogue and action it is a tight and tense story and without fail one you will not soon forget,174,5
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,liked the story line here was just incredible i can not write too much as i do not want to give spoilers i will say that the character development is very good for the main character i enjoy the way this author draws you into a story forcing you to turn just one more page to find out what happens next disliked again hard to tell without spoilers so i will just say that the author used a particular type of formatting that kind of gave away the twist way too early overall a terrific fast read length novella rating r for violence language and sexual references,105,6
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,this starts out great but in the end is so convoluted that it is just a narcissistic piece of junk it is sad that most of the story is made up of swear words maybe if more time had been spend on the storyline and less on how many times the f-bomb could be dropped,54,7
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,the beginning was ok but the story never took off and it got quite confusing can not say i liked it but it was short and free,26,8
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,it was really interesting but just different from crime novels also intriguing only thing i did not like was the way it ended not knowing who really wanted the mother dead,30,9
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,i felt that it was off the wall and not worth the time to read it the guy is crazy at the end and i did not understand why it had to be that way,34,10
Electronics,1905512694,4.0,positive,the storyline was well written it had me interested quickly and kept my interest throughout the book i think most people would enjoy this book,25,11
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,the book jumped from one thing to another the cursing in the book just made it worse i did not enjoy the book at all,25,12
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,this book did not have a real beginning or an ending weird left the reader with a lot of unanswered questions do not recommend anybody killing their mum,26,13
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,story has no redeeming feature complete waste of time i gave it a one because zero was not an option,20,14
Electronics,1905512694,1.0,negative,i love mysteries but the mystery should be what the story is about and not trying to understand the story i still am not sure what happened in this book one good thing it was very short,37,15
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,it started out okay and went down hill from there ridiculous plot but i kept hoping for more and kept reading waste of time in my opinion,29,16
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,guthries fiction is tough dark and extremely funny not for the squeamish if you like noir fiction you will like guthrie,20,17
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,short story so a short review dark witty tale set in a slightly surreal edinburgh hitmen tanning salons wee neds with guns and body bags it is tarantino with salt an sauce and at 74p less than a bag of chips,40,18
Electronics,1905512694,2.0,negative,killing mum started out to be a really great story but kind of went downhill from there maybe i just do not do well with short stories the first chapter was good in setting up what promised to be an out of the ordinary thriller then it seemed as if the author just wanted to get it over with because he tried to cram too much information into the next two chapters the book became bogged down and confusing it is a shame too because i did enjoy the writing style at first and thought that i had stumbled onto another good author,101,19
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i am a musician i found these speakers to be very limited in range i bought them because of the raving reviews by customers they are very high ended lacking in mid-range and have no low end sound,39,0
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,wow these babies are smaller than i imagined i put them in a cd bag with 10 cds my mp3 player and still had room stereo in a pack the speakers are crisp and the surround sound is phenomenal give me more of this for my travel lifestyle thanks,49,1
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,for 20 these are very impressive little speakers they look a lot chaper than they sound the cardboard-like grill did not impress me but give them a chance they impressed me a lot once i truned them on and i am an audiophile the mid bass and the highs are much cleaner than i expected there is no deep bass but i expected that also the surround effect is nice especially when you have the spakers placed on your work table at near-ear level great for travel as they are very compact however if you want pounding bass you should maybe look into a subwoofer design but then again those will not be so compact and inexpensive good job sonic,121,2
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,just spent the last month checking the internet for portable speakers to take on vacation i wanted something as small as possible good sound and a modest price when i first saw the price of the si-5 i thought they can not sound very good for that price but after reading all the reviews on amazoncom and a few other sites i decided to purchase these if they turned out not so great sounding i could return them and start my quest all over again i bought them this past saturday at bestbuy and hooked them up almost immediately to my sony md walkman all i can say is what a surprise i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for compactness good sound and an incredibly great price in travel speakers i only regret not waiting another day because circuit city here had them on sale for 1799 and i also had a 500 off coupon which would have brought the price down to 1299 that would have been an even more incredible bargain for what you are getting for the little bit of money being spent,187,3
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,these speakers are well designed and give a good but not great sound highs are bright and crisp but slightly wobbly midrange is fine and bass is present but somewhat weak sounds best at moderate volume one of the key things for me is portability and here is where this system shines the speaker / amp package is great for travel or just toting about town to start with it is very light the form is also also thoughtfully designed the two speakers clip togeather to form a package slightly thicker than a standard cd jewel case this also protects the papery speaker fabric the tiny amp is sculpted so that it fits your hand and the wires are plugged at poth ends and detachable be sure to have a clip or rubberband around to keep the wires together after you dissassemble i can not belive how inexpensive it is you will not be sorry if you buy this but even if by some odd chance you were it is not much dough out of your pocket,173,4
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,i bought these to use with my ipod i just could not see spending the 100 - 150 for the high end altec lansing and creativ speaker units especially given the fact that reviews seem to be love em or hate em for those models as well i quite like these speakers the sound quality is good and reasonably full with jazz classical or rock music true given the rather limited output these would not be suitable for a display at a convention or a raging party but they are perfect for a hotel room quiet dorm or office yes there are three wires 2 for the speakers the other from the music source ipod mp3 but the advantage is that you can space the speakers farther apart then with other speakers I have seen the unit does not come with a power adaptor but has an input for one which can be purchased on the manufacturers website [ ] otherwise it uses 4 aaa batteries,161,5
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i read mixed reviews so i rolled theand bought these absolute garbage in their little bag they are 3 thick they sound very quiet no bass expected and no mid-range not expected the front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet they certainly are 360 degree speakers they sound equally bad from all directions even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables my original comment to my wife was twenty bucks how can i go wrong well my answer now is i could have still had my 20 now i just have to find someone to give them to as they are not worth the space they take up i know you get what you pay for but if that was the case here then should have been on sale for half off at the 99 cent store,144,6
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i got this for my frequent backpacking trips with my buddies and the quality of these speakers blew everyone including myself away every time i turn this on i still get amaze with how some 4 oz speakers could sound so rich and loud relative to it is size and weight if you are a outdoor freak and weight on your back is away an issue go for this and prepare to amaze your friends when they hear a live concerto streaming out from inside your tent total weight with batteries 1 pound 4 oz carry it on my 38 pound bag not an issue battery-share with my walkie eating real food and listening to a live concert while your friends are having problem trying to start a fire to cook instant noodle priceless,137,7
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,when you look at their size they are the size of a cd jewel case you would think they can not be that good but these speakers are great the sound is awesome of course you would not expect a great sound in a large room but for a small office or bedroom they are fantastic the only problem is the unit which connects the 2 speakers this contains the on switch and batteries if you forget to shut the switch off you drain your batteries rather quickly and it is easy to do this at first otherwise the speakers are great and quite portable,103,8
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i bought these speakers to take on vacations with my mp3 player and they actually have pretty good sound for their size however after only two uses one of the speakers lost it is sound unless you press on the face of it i would suggest buying any other speakers but these,51,9
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers are the worst that i have ever come across and broke down a week after i got them the sound is decent in the beginning but nothing around above average standards no way i would ever recommend any one buy one of these just are not worth the dough looks decent but that is where the good stuff ends,59,10
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,these speakers are the best the best for your money the best for sound quality and the best for dvd portable players if you are looking for bass spend more money and get good advice as to what you need for what you are buying for thoughs who under rate these speakers go get a job and put your sound system in the garbage,62,11
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,i bought these speakers to use with my toshiba satelite 2805-s402 laptop unfortunately i found that these speakers were not a significant improvement over my laptop speakers they are very small and they snap together handily making them great for traveling but i would only buy them for use with a discman mp3 player or something similar that has no speaker function,62,12
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,yes these are small and light now the bad news the separate amplifier and all the wires going everywhere makes the connected assembly look like a science lab project especially if you opt for the usb power connector yes the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my ibm thinkpad but not nearly as good as your typical 19 desktop computer speakers the problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange bass is nonexistent it is like listening to a pair of big tweeters the enthusiastic reviews are a mystery to me,100,13
Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i enjoy watching dvds on my laptop but lugging my desktop speakers in a bag did not appeal to me now i literally slip these speakers into my laptop cases outer pocket and I am on my way they snap together and are one and a half inches at their thickest i show off these speakers every chance i get and the reaction is always one of amazement now while they are not the equal of my desktop speakers they are 25 times better than my laptop the surround sound effect makes a real difference when heard for the very first time while a bit pricey for most people if you own a portable dvd player or a laptop you will increase the value of your product and your audio-visual experience many times over i also use them with my mini disc unit in new york city where things have to be just a little bit louder to be heard these speakers impress,150,14
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,easily the best portable speakers out there and probably the only portable speakers that are not more then glorified headphones the sound is rich and full although the bass will hardly rattle your teeth the speakers are incrediably compact about the size of a double cd jewel case the i-mac-esquescheme is an aquired taste am i the only one that misses the days when computers and electronics only came in black silver and putty for a pair of speakers to throw in with your laptop mp3 player or portable cd player there has nothing better pros superior sound very compact easy to set up fairly long battery life cons [ light ] plasic and cardboard construction somewhat pricy weak bass questionable looks seperate amplifier this is a very good effort and i hope sonic impact tries again make it with heavier plastic integrate the amplifier into one or both of the speakers raise the bass a tad bundle it with a compact dc adapter or better yet a usb power option and lower the price into the sub-50 dollar range and this would be a breakthrough product,194,15
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,the unit works well after sorting through all the wires thefrom the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity the biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling also the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and i found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss a neat gadget for the price sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness,81,16
Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers would have been a perfect compliment to my portable dvd player due to their size and portability however the volumn was minimal even after purchasing new batteries these speakers were beautiful in appearance but wiring could be more substantial speakers should be shipped with dc power supply to improve performance,52,17
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,honggang ma is exactly right i saw this product in a store loved it is simplicity 31 mpixels for an incredible price i thought what has the catch then i asked about the type of memory the store clerk had nohe climbed a ladder to find the box and still we could not make heads or tails of the info i used the web to find all sorts of reviews nothing specifically mentioned the memory then i found the previous review here at amazon great reviews this settles the issue for me what do you do when on vacation and you simply must buy another mem card with this camera nothing if you are not concerned about this issue then definitely buy this camera you will not find a higher resolution for the price be aware although this is a point and click snapshot camera only,145,0
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,the main reason i bought this camera is because it has a sd / mmc card i looked at the more expensive dx-3900 and counted it out it did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me i own a palm m505 and want to have compatibility with that and my mp3 player even although the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed i think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds i purchased a 64 mb mmc chip at amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm the mp3 player and the kodak camera go figure at least kodak gave us the option in the dx3700 others should but the dx3900,127,1
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,i did a lot of comparison shopping before eventually deciding on the dx3700 the price of this camera is awesome considering it is in the 31 mp range i was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards my fears were quickly subdued when i did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new mmc cards as for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards these prices came directly from kodaks web site a 16 mb compact flash cost 2599 compared to the new mmc at 2699 also comparable were the 32 mb cards with about a two dollar difference in price I am sure as more cameras begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also this camera was extremely easy to use i was taking pictures about five minutes after i unpacked it and the picture quality is unbelievable,172,2
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,the pictures are excellent in fact they are among the best for 3-mega digicams this is where the virtues of this camera end the 3700 uses an sd or mmc card that is hard to find once you find them in some retail stores they cost 3 times more than their compared to counterparts sd or mmc are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization yet this camera is bigger than kodak 3900 an excellent camera that uses compared to card therefore this card format does not make any sense another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the sd card is 64 mb as compared with 512 mb for compared to card since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution i tried to order a 64 mb sd card the price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more now i have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever i go the purchase turned out to be a disaster,172,3
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,first kodak makes you buy aextra 80 bucks although this camera does take good pictures when daylight is sufficient this camera lacks features and with problems no zoom no timer of course no video which is ok here are some real problems 1 this camera makes dark pictures when there is not ample light yes flash is on regular 35 mm even those made by kodak cameras can do much better than that 2 battery life is short do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good you will run out after taking a few shots if you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours 3 upload from thesometimes give mysterious i / o errors frustrating you may have to try a couple times,146,4
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,we received this camera as a gift and like many other reviewers have had horrible experiences trying to get the batteries to charge customer service replaced and recharged the battery but to no avail it is sitting and gathering dust do not waste your money,44,5
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is a great little camera that gives quality photos the only dislike i have is that there is a slight delay once you take the picture before it actually takes the shot so sometimes i have to shoot and reshoot to get the shot i want,47,6
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,my wife and i bought this camera about a year ago right from the get go it had problems we bought it on line so there was no recourse from the dealer if you buy a camera go to an actual store there are real people in case you have a problem kodak customer support is a joke if not down right rude and offers no help the problem withthe camera is that the batteries last for only 3 or 4 shots if you buy the kodak lithium cell 2000 it lasts for about 20 shots if you do a little research you find that the camera requires 33 volts at up to 25 amps no combination of aa cells deliver 33 volts rechargables deliver 12 volts per cell and even lithium cells only deliver 16 volts and anything south of a d cell will not deliver it is rated voltage at 25 amps for very long the long and short of it is that the dx3700 was a defective product from the start and short of fabricating an external battery pack with d cells you better look for another camera,187,7
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,this camera is great for everyday use the 31 megapixels effective make it a worthwhile buy definitely a graet camera,20,8
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,i have a different model kodak camera however they all use the same easyshare software running windows xp i could not get the software to work properly after several hours on the phone with kodak tech support they could not get it working either they said they are aware of the problem on some computers running windows xp it is now several months later and they still do not have a fix they do not really seem to care either it might not be a badto consider other brands instead of kodak since if the software will not work properly then what good is the camera,104,9
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,please do not waste your money on this camera it uses a set of batteries about every 5 - 10 pictures the docking station is a joke as it only works part of the time and has never charged the camera it has been back to kodak but they did not do anything but put in new batteries and send it back the few pictures that it does take are good ones but it is not worth the hassle and please do not depend on this camera to record an important event because i can bet you will be disappointed,95,10
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,not much good to say about this camera complained to customer service with no resolution awkward styling eats batteries cameradosent charge batteries software lacking in features do not buy it,31,11
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,things started out alright but the led screen burnt out and then the camera stoped transferring pictures to the docking station so far the camera has had more down time then up time,33,12
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is a nice camera for the price 31mp and takes good pictures with some practice be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics although also there is no need at all for the docking station the camera plugs right into any usb port and shows up as a drive on the computer you can then just pull your images off without having to use kodaks software as far as recharging the batteries i picked up some ni-mh batteries and a portable charger and I am good to go I had also recommend getting an additional memory card,101,13
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,i have upgraded to xp however the software does not work with xp i tried to download new software but i had problems doing so i wrote an email to kodak but they would not send me new software and did not really care seeing that insead of fixing the problem they tried to sell me a newer camera in addition the battery life keeps getting shorter as the camera gets older it is also very diffucult to get a shot of something in action since the camera takes about 2 seconds to autofocus i would reccomend a different for people serious about their photography,104,14
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,this was not my first experience with a digital camera after receiving the kodak 3700 i thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on the main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas unless very close the picture was very dark just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program the delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired the final reason for returning the camera was the incompatibility with the latest mac technology just released when all returns are cleared i am going to opt for a canon 110 or a20 or nikon coolpix family members and friends have these and are very satisfied,123,15
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,i purchased the dx3700 somewhat out of desperation many models sold out but was intrigued by the high resolution i also purchased athe sd card was sold right alongside the camera and was not a price or availability issue i took the camera on a trip and had 56 high res photos on the 64 mb card with room to spare i thought the camera was a bit bulky and was not thrilled with the battery life but decided to wait until i saw the picture quality when i downloaded the pictures to my laptop i was pleasantly shocked by the beautifuland detail of the photos and the macro close-up shots were excellent pros low price for 31 megapixel camera ease of use quick battery recharging less than 1 hour great picture quality excellent macro shots decent if slow software consmore or less required so-so battery life somewhat bulky,152,16
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,i am extremely pleased with my purchase of the dx3700 even those it uses the mmc cards i do not care really I am sure a higher mb cards will be coming out soon reading the other reviews i realized how much people are upset about that aspect but you must remember every time something new comes out it is this way they will constantly improve the product and the price will go down right now the highest mb card is the 64 mb which only allows about 75 pictures for a 31 mp camera but hey who needs to take more than that unless you are on vacation and do not have access to a computer which i do not worry about i did not care about the optical zoom which this model does not have the model that did have it was [ amt ] more now with technology constantly changing it is better to be on theand in a few years when I am ready to upgrade i will not feel like I am losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment this camera only cost me [ amt ],175,17
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is my first digital camera i purchased this camera so my wife and i could take picture of our grandson this was a christmas present for both of us i have had trouble finding memory card for this modelbut plan to put it to good use i picked this camera because it is user friendly thanks charles mclendon,59,18
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,the dx 3700 is very easy to use and works well with windows xp qualtity is best for the money it compares to expensive digitals with qualtity that matches if not exceeds the only negative comment is that a docking station is a must that sales people do not tell you about to keep batteries charged and transfer images to your computer,63,19
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,i have been putting off buying a digital camera for months i was debating on the sony mavica but the pixel quality just was not there 31 pixels for such a low price true it does not have all the bangs and whistles that other digital cameras have but it has the most imortant feature oustanding pictures it does not have an optical zoom but i seldom use that anyway the camerasold separatly is a must a simple push of the button on the docking station and the pictures are in your computer ready for emailing or printing what more could you want for so little money,106,20
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,got it for a couple of weeks it has been great took me a while to figure out how to connect to my reciever for the 51 feature picture quality has been excellent tried it with a vcd and it works fine but i think my vcd was a poor quality vcd karaoke works too so far no complaint from me,61,0
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,last week saw the ad tried to order and can not sucess so tried again a moment ago but the price was already jumped up 1000 that means if i do not order to-day and to-morrow will jump up again so may be i have to wait another month wait for it for sale then i am going to order thanks,60,1
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,this is a good unit but beware it has trouble playing variable bitrate svcds if your svcd bitrate drops below a certain level the picture will freeze and the audio will emit a high pitched squeal if svcd playback is important to you get a different player otherwise you will be ok with the ad-800,55,2
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this is a great dvd player it has everything you want even comes with mp3 at a price you can not beat it has a karaoke mode which is a lot of fun it is such a good buy it is easy to set up and easy to use a great first dvd player for anyone who is thinking of getting a dvd player i would not use it on my hdtv home theater but if you just want something simple that looks great this is the one it has good sound and picture for the price have not had any problems with it what can i say i love it it was cool big truck,111,3
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,i bought this unit the day after christmas i have since spent many hours in front of it besides playing almost every format of disc known it is firmware upgradable so it will likely keep pace with new formats as they become available one reviewer said that it was not user-friendly do not confuse a great degree of user-selectable preferences as being complicated novice users can play it right out of the box but power users will find it ultimately enjoyable plus with progressive scan i will be able to use this player even after i upgrade to a digital tv and the price speaks for itself apex is breaking new ground by offering high end products at k-mart prices keep up the good work,125,4
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,it is probably the best around for the price although it can be sluggish and tempermental it gives you an unbelievable amount of control from zooming and panning to speaker tweaking you can do anything you would ever need to with the touch of a button the mp3 control is very strange and almost old fashioned but it puts out great sound the remote is interesting and takes some time to adjust to but gets the job done and the unit itself is freakishly huge it is almost twice as big as my vcr but not that intrusive so if you like having complete control over your dvd viewing and love features galore this is definitely the dvd player for you,121,5
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,my new apex ad-800 provided good picture and sound on dvds but could not read half of my vcds commercially produced vcds i think the laser is out of alignment i found the unit to be very user-unfriendly the remote control is poorly laid out and performing a simple fast forward / reverse task is painful the unit does not automatically switch between 43 and 169 aspect ratio wheras my panasonic does so i have to manually set the aspect ratio each time i switch from a widescreen dvd to a vcd or a 43 dvd i have read reviews that tout the ad-800 as a great toy for a technical person due to it is many user-adjustable parameter settings but i think the unit had so many user-adjustable parameters because it lacks the intelligence to set them automatically the karaoke function is very limited as it has no ability to adjust the key and no vocal assist function i had high hopes for the ad-800 due to it is many advertised features but i am quite disappointed by the poor quality control and user-unfriendliness,181,6
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,had this dvd and worked until red lines appeared on led screen took unit apart and noticed exploded power supply component the unti still plays cds but can not get a dvd to play apex tech support is horrible they want be to ship the unit back in the original box,50,7
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,i have had my ad-800 for over a year and it works well there are 2 versions out there that i am aware of the newer version works better than the older one the beauty of this is that it does a great job converting pal ntsc while not region free it has the complete look feel ' and quality of the malata in fact if it was not for the apex label it seems like it is exactly like the [ expensive ] malata it does the 169 correctly in pal ntsc and you can adjust the aspect if needed great features for the price there are some issues with the progressive scan but overall it does a relatively good job heck i would say that for the price it does a fantastic job also with some of the newer high-end tvs some of the deinterlacers on the tvs are better than the dvd players anyway so you may not need it in the future i tried svcd and vcd and both worked well for me note i do not use mp3 or photo,178,8
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,if you are thinking of buy this dvd player for the progressive scan do not i have a 57 toshiba hdtv and when you turn on the progressive mode on this dvd player the picture gets worse it is grainy blurry and dull interlaced mode looks better plus this player will sometimes burp meaning sound / picture pauses or seems to skip a second or two like it can not keep up i thought i was planning for the future when i bought this player but i wished i saved my money for a better player later,91,9
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,i bought this player due to reviews in last years consumer reports it worked ok for about 9 months and quit working after that i took it to the electronics place and they said time to buy new too expensive to fix i guess you get what you pay for definitely think twice on this one,55,10
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,based on a positive review by the2001 issue of consumer reports magazine i purchased the apex ad-800 from circuit city as it was the only recommenned progressive-scan dvd player that i could afford i do not have a hdtv however i plan to buy one in the near future dvd disc sound and picture when hooked up to a typical television set are excellent i put a music cd disc in and it also sounded great it is a very good value for the money the only problem i have had with it occured when i tried to play a dvd disc that i rented from a supermarket it was just too scratched up for it to be played according to consumer reports some dvd players can play damaged dvds and damaged cds i suppose that also depends on how badly they are damaged i would reommend the apex ad-800 for those people who want a very good progressive-scan dvd player and who do not have a lot of money to spend on it,175,11
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,works great only thing that was a small hassle videos show in black and white until you change a setting tech support responded right away with the correct setting good thing because i would have never guessed how to set it up great picture and sound easy to hook up to the tv,53,12
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,the ease of operation and the crisp picture and sound playback are the qualities which because me to be very happy with this dvd player and i could not beat your price anywhere,31,13
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,any single women out there like myself will find this apex ad-800 a breeze to install and operate it should take no more than 15 minutes at the most for you to have it up and running i have never heard of apex but thought i would give it a try this is my first dvd player i am absolutely pleased the picture quality is very good and stable if your a novice like myself this is an excellent starter dvd player i do not see how anyone could go wrong purchasing this product and for the price the performance is excellent,101,14
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,just like others worked great for about 4 months then red lines appeared on display now it does not read at all what a joke same results on trying customer service who keeps original boxes anyway also the shipping cost would be very high to send back will never buy apex again,52,15
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,absolutely no problems for the first 6 months it worked beautifully one day for no apparent reason red lines appeared in the display window and now the dvd player can not read the disc i contacted apex to no solution they told me i had to ship it back in it is original box which i do not have at my cost and probably the problem would not be under warranty all this after being on hold for 20 minutes during a long distance phone call no 1 - 800 it really discourages me from buying apex and especially buying on-line,96,16
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,i purchased this dvd because of the ntsc / pal feature i thought that i would be able to play europeans dvd i was wrong this player will play europeans dvd with region 1 encoding which is us and canada in brief you will not be able to play foreign dvds with this player i quickly offered it as a gift to my sister and purchased one of those dvds [ ] now i can watch dvds from all over the world with my new dvd i noticed that the apex was not all that good whenever you want to change an audio language subtitle option the movie will stop it is not instantaneous also it has no rewind or forward you can only jump from chapters to chapters and finally it is almost impossible to decipher what has written on the panel the inscriptions are too small be careful know what you want,149,17
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,dvd player this thing should be called a multimedia player it will play almost anything flawlessly even vcd karokes i got from the philippines like having a blast at the famous karoke bars in southeast asia and it has plenty of outputs in the back so this thing is ready to take on the hdtvs too progressive scan another bonus mine has performed flawlessly a really good dvd player at less than half the price of the big brand models,77,18
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this apex is the most advanced dvd player around if you want the most out of your money this is it be warned although it will take you more than a few days to set this player up becouse it is detailed down to the last sound decimal i have not figured it out totally yet but the sound and picture just get better and better each time i figure something new out this player can be completely reprogramed if your an expert at that if you want to have total control of your sound and picture this one is the one to get but if you just want to pop your dvd or cd in and play it this is not for you,123,19
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,1.0,negative,i got this as my first dvd player not knowing what the differences between the various products are i figured that the cheapest would be just fine that was one of the most naive things I have ever done the sound is delayed from the movement so it looks as if the movies were dubbed also it has a major overexposure there are also many times when it skips on brand-new movies all in all i would not reccomend this even to non-enthusiasts,82,20
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,2.0,negative,i bought this unit to play my pal dvd disks along with ntsc disks this unit is advertised as being able to play pal-formatted disks however this is not true it will only play ntsc region 1 disks this was verified to me by apex tech support,47,21
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,5.0,positive,this is my first dvd player purchase and i am glad i bought the apex ad-800 i have an older home theater system so i needed the dts decoder in the dvd player i have not seen another dvd player at this low price with all the features and dts decoding i have been using it for three months now and would buy another one if i needed it I have recommended this one to my friends my only complaint is that i do not like the layout of the buttons on the remote but on the other hand i have seen very few remotes that have a good layout,107,22
Electronics,B00005T3HJ,4.0,positive,i had my eyes on brand name dvd players but after read reviews on amazoncom i decided to get this one nothing disappointed me yet i have lots of my home-made vcds in pal signal and it plays them all without any difficulties amazing how it plays a normal mp3 disk with a list of songs from different folders on the tv screen and you can turn it into a karaoke session easy plugand play many kinds of connections to choose from with all the cables although the manual is quite bad with very few details this might be that you need not to do much to operate the machine i tested it with ntsc pal dvds and vcds no problems at all nice for money,127,23
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,the blink camera is so tiny i carry it in my purse the pictures are of reasonable quaility but the detail is lacking the software is easy to use and transferring photos is easy transferring 92 full size photos only takes a minute do not expect to take action photos as the there is a delay with the shuttle quite nice for a pocket digital camera,65,0
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i like this product because i can send pictures online to my family and friends also you can use this product for making family videos it is unlimited video if connected to your computer that what has makes it fun please try this product thank you,44,1
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,this camera is great if you want to take pictures at day with lots of light at a park beach and more is really usefull because it is as little as you can see at the picture you can take it wherever you want without problem the resolution is not the best so if you want to take super quality pictures this is not your camera as a webcam is really good too so it is great if you want a webcam and a photo camera 2 in 1 i could not ask for more for this price,96,2
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i bought this after seeing someone else with it it is very difficult to take clear photos due to the size of the camera the only way is with the tiny tripod which is pretty impractical i saw that people were recommending this for kids i would not bother go with something a bit more substantial that they can steady for a real photo,65,3
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,if you are looking for high-end quality pictures you are looking at the wrong place but if you are looking for a regular quality shots and do not want to spend a lot of money the stylecam is the right one how can you ask for a great quality pictures for less than even a film camera taking good pictures can cost you about to the software is very easy to use but do not have a manual the camera is even easier to use and it works great as a web cam be sure to hold the camera very steady because it has a slight shutter lag of about half a second this can be annoying but after a while you will remember this automatically,121,4
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this camera takes fair pictures in perfect conditions as long as you have good light the subject is not moving and you have hands of steel you can get a good picture it will not take in medium light conditions if you tap the button while taking a picture it will blur and if you taking picture of something moving at walking speed it will be unrecognizable works well enough as a web cam as long as whayever you set it on does not move,84,5
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,uses up battery way too fast but greatjust needs long term use changes,14,6
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,i had this camera although is adorable and it felt as if i was a james bond movie person it took horrible pictures the inside pictures if it did not have the right amount of light the camera would not take pictures at all and when i took pictures outdoors it woould have a blue outline around the images the saying you get what you pay for is very true,69,7
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,just really cute to look at but would not download on win xp windows prevented product from installation after reading the reviews on this page i am not really sorry that microsoft found a way to block this product,39,8
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i have just bought a sipix webcam 3 for my sons birthday the driver software did not install on windows 98se i asked sipix for technical support all i got were questions asking me if i had tested the driver contained in the empty folders it had set up on the advice of amazoncom i tried to download the driver from the sipix site after 45 minutes of download all i got was a manual advising me tothe software from the non-working cd-rom supplied with the camera is the camera itself any good i can find out,99,9
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,it is cute as heck but after a week i had to return it even although it only cost me that is money that needs to be spent towards a usable camera what indoor shots i managed to take were dark and heavily pixelated no matter what quality i tried plus until you upload you do not know which shots were actually taken the shutter speed was abysmal i could not stand still that long much less a child even outdoor shots were disappointing,81,10
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,for great design really small easy to install superb software extremely easy to use quality tolerable against refuses to take pictures indoors even on inside mode unless your room is very bright therefore can not capture any night time events so it is not for students will flash up error size would make it ideal but as it will not take pictures it is useless for this quality is limited proper digital cameras 13megapixel overall if they added a flash or even made it work in low light even if results are not stunning it would be a great little gadget as it is I am dissapointed because I have taken it out and it will not take pictures it may fit into your pocket on a night out but it will not work taking fireworks tonight proved impossible it still thought it was too dark for daytime use it is great for web pages but the quality is nowhere near a proper digital camera then again the resolution is better than competitors no other camera this small takes better pictures,177,11
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,i think this camera is excellent the best part i think is it is size I am an adult but my hands are very small this camera not even being 2 inches square fits nicely in my hand when i first got it i took a few pictures and set up the program on my computer i was so surprised at how great my pictures came out I am really looking forward to the holiday season i have a nephew who is almost a year old and i am excited about taking his picture and sending it to our extended family that lives several states away if you are thinking about buying this camera but you think that the low price means that it is just junk think again you do not have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good deal,138,12
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,people who rave about this thing either work for the company or are vision impaired i bought one on a whim so i could take it with me on vacation i can honestly say that of the 100s of pictures i took with it not one was a keeper the shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless your pictures are blurred i found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures the camera crashed often and i needed to take out the battery to reboot it this happened a lot the camera worked in sunlight but pics taken indoors were way too dark this thing is not ready for prime time not even at these prices,128,13
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this is a fascinating little product carry it in your pocket without any weight i love carrying it along to kids games and the kids want ones of their own it has a few drawbacks however some expected some that need fixing in the next generation the expected but still a little disappointing limited focal length lens means that elements outside the very center of the picture are blurred barrel distortion no flash for low light situtions the real problem it loses your pictures when the battery drains down that is it is memory is volatile flash memory is so cheap why did the designers make this choice there is no early warning actually no warning at all when the battery is too low in fact if the battery gets low it will still take pictures as normal then it freezes up and all your pictures are gone caveat emptor here a great product in so many ways but make sure you replace the batteries early that is every 50 shots or so it is not a cost issue but you will lose your pictures beyond hope for recovery even although the camera seems to continue to act normally,201,14
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i bougth this camera 2 weeks ago i was looking for a cheap digital camera that would allow me to create web quality images would be portable and easy to use the sipix stylecam has all of it the size of it is very small which allows me to wear it even in my keychain the clip is also provided in the package and it is 640x480 quality is enought for my actual needs also to point out that thanks to it is usb connection to the computer the download of the pictures taken is really quick it has although a couple of inconvinients which are that whenever you push to take a picture the camera takes a variable amount of time to actually take it so you can not take movement pictures or move much during it or the pictures will end up all messy the second inconvinient is that inside houses when the light is not perfect the camera shows an error and is unable to take the picture presumably because of the lack of light as it does not have a flash incorporated with the package it also comes a stand to use it as a webcam,196,15
Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,i was skeptical about this camera but it got enough good reviews that i thought it might be a fun thing to have i was not expecting to use it to take artistic shots to keep and treasure forever and ever but i did think I had get something other than shapeless blurs unfortuntately i think this camera will get little to no use because it just is not worth the trouble of checking to see if the battery is dead usually yes taking the pictures and uploading them onto the computer if they have not inexplicably disappeared using the awkward poorly designed software with no documentation whatsoever i have gotten a total of zero useful photos with thisif you want a digital camera do not buy this one you still will not really have anything more than you started with,137,16
Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,this camera has not satissfied me even as a toy it works only under sunlight else it blurs the image and it requires too much time to take a pic under room light also the sides of the pictures look round it is still very small but there are others in the market better with the same price,57,17
Electronics,B0000691LX,4.0,positive,i could not believe it wen i first saw it is lil toy in skool my homie was carryin it around da skool n showing off a lil n taking gurl pix i was like wooooww neither do my other friends so i decided to get one for myself too u noe to capture pretty gurls pix convincely n i did got one it works find for me under it is affordable price just the size of it is worth it already make ur life better n easier with it is small size cute lil camera tell u a lil secret gurls do like it a lot hehehehe so con get it while itz still in low price i personally will get more for my friends b-day or as a gift or anything like datitz fun to carryin it around n take shotz or wut eva u think is tyte i captured a shot of britney spear at a movie theater n a shot of kobe bryant outside of stable center w my homies in it,170,18
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,I have had a great time with the sipix blink digital camera took it on a family outing over the labor day holiday and came back with great pictures to share with the family nothing publication quality but certainly good enough to show people what the kids did for fun over the weekend the blink lens distorts the images around the edges but for snapshooting it is at least equivalent to the old instamatics and polaroids it is surprisingly good in low light tho the shooter must take extra care to hold it still it is main advantage is it is size and weight both of which are negligible coupled with the generous memory 100 to 400 images depending on resolution it invites you to carry it constantly and shoot pictures of everything two points to remember 1 it is easy to wrap your hands around the camera slr style and make your fingers part of the scenery 2 it is so small and handy that it is easy to lose i have a nightmare of leaving it in a shirt pocket and sending it thru the washing machine,182,19
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,i have not received the cameras yet but judging by our grandchildrens parents choice these must be excellent my daughter works in market analysis and I am sure she would pick only the best and most educational camera for their twin sons ninth birthday gift from us,46,20
Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,absolutely fun little camera spent the first day after getting it on an impulse buy making little avis of the new kitten in my house the included software makes this a snap no the quality is not fantastic at those resolutions but making mini videos with a package this size for this price is going to be tough to beat keep the battery fresh and you are good to take it just about anywhere great fun little product and probably going to be christmas gifts for everyone this year,87,21
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,if you use the windows key on your keyboard then this is probably the mini-keyboard you want siig makes one that is decent but does not have the key adesso makes other keyboards like this one and which one works best for you you probably depends on what keys you need and where look at the bottom row look a the enter key there will be variations from what you may be used to after using this keyboard at work i bought one for home sure it does not have the normal numeric keys but i reach for the mouse a lot more often than i reach for those and it is considerably closer now i recommend this keyboard,117,0
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i hate wide keyboards with a number pad they force me to reach too far for the mouse this keyboard minimizes the distance between home row typing position and my mouse it also lies very flat so my wrists do not have to bend upwards the fn key does not duplicate the functionality of my ibm laptop fn key also with my laptop it seems numlock and fn are both needed to enable this keyboards number pad but i do not plan to ever use that feature anyway occasionally i bump the fn key in the corner which causes some of the number pad keys to not work but another press toggles things back to normal i might pop the case open and tape over the fn key if you install the provided software you get some bonus keys along the top some people might not like the feel or size of this keyboard but it works for me,157,1
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,this keyboard is awesome as a gaming keyboard i do have problems with the keys registering but that is because i am stubborn and like very few items in startup so i do not run the software for it i do not really use it for the multimedia capabilities but they all work if you run the software i use it for gaming the footprint is small but the keys are large / wide i have and still beat this thing up playing pistols on ravenshield everyday and i mean everyday i have many keys that do not work well from all the use but i have switched out the rubber pieces under the keys that i use in the game for fresh ones from less used keys it still just kicks and so do i in the game i highly recommend it if you like to have extra space clear in front of you i am back at amazon looking to purchase another one adesso pwns,162,2
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,had this keyboard connected to my computer for only 15 minutes keys did not register when pressed or had to be pressed several times very hard i may have just got a lemon but i am not buying another adesso keyboard,41,3
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i use an under-desk keyboard support and need to squeeze a keyboard and mousepad into a 19 space since i do not use a numeric keypad anyway this keyboard is perfect it is not quite industrial strength keys stick after a couple years and the letters fade away but i love it anyway and will just replace it when necessary if you just have one or two sticky keys try swapping the rubber doohickey under the key with one from an underused key for example home also adesso provided excellent support when i had a problem with an earlier keyboard,99,4
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,i spend all day drafting on the computer and was in need of a shorter keyboard for less distance between the mouse and letter keys you get used to the top numeric keys that is how we used to do it on typewriters and overall quality is good the keys are quiet and it has a good number of shortcut keys that worked immediately with my windows xp,67,5
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,I am not particularly hard on keyboards and bought this one only to use at work all the same this keyboard did not last more than 6 months before the space bar key ceased working entirely not recommended,36,6
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,we needed a compact keyboard for a limited-width keyboard tray for our secondary pc we use mostly for pc gaming it works great and gives us the room we need to place our mouse on the keyboard tray as well a welcome improvement the keyboard is similar to a smaller laptop keyboard but works beautifully for that which is was intended,61,7
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,excellent mini keyboard for pos system or small desk nice layout of keys except the delete button but you will get used it pretty quick,24,8
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,this keyboard is the best I have ever used after almost four years of using this keyboard I am purchasing a second one as a back up even although my current one is still functioning the print on a few keys is worn off but that is a minor thing for over fours years of steady use the size is perfect the action of the keys is great everything works as it should I have become a real fuss budget when it comes to the placement of the delete key can not stand keyboards that hide the key that most of us use so often i do a lot of editing and find that things like well thought out key placement are really important for anyone who does writing and editing this is a great keyboard,131,9
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,keys started failing after about 2 months and some of the key markings rubbed off too not recommended,18,10
Electronics,B00006B753,5.0,positive,one of the wireless keyboard i had I am able to control my laptop from 11 ft away with no problem i have my laptop connected to my tv,27,11
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these within a few months of each other because i love this keyboard because of the small size it is set up great one of the best keyboards in the world the problem is that the letters / numbers on the keys come off in 3 - 6 months making the keyboard worthless extremely quickly and then you have to go out and buy new ones i do not use the keyboards much so the letters and numbers on the keys should not wear-off so quickly but it is a big flaw of this keyboard because it is happening with the 2 that i own,101,12
Electronics,B00006B753,4.0,positive,i had no problems installing the keyboard hooked it up with an adesso ps/2 to usb adapter i got the drivers off their website and installation was quick and easy i was using the keyboard in minutes so far I have been using it constantly and have not had any major problems with it but i do not really use the multimedia functions the multimedia buttons in particular feel kind of cheaply made and the rest of the keyboard kind of does too but i have not had any problems with anything breaking so far the extra space on my desk is absolutely great although it took me a couple of days to get used to the size of the keys definitely a good buy if you are looking to conserve deskspace and do not need a full keyboard,132,13
Electronics,B00006B753,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the keyboard i like the size but the quality of keys and response is very bad i got a defective piece where the keys were just getting stuck i am currently using a microsoft keyboard but needed a smaller footprint to match the size of laptop keyboard,52,14
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,the sound it produces has low quality i bought this and a panasonic at the same time the sound of the last one is incomparably better i do not recommend maxel headphones at least this one,36,0
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones are comfortable but the volume is low even on the highest level compared to other headphones i have used,21,1
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i know these were cheap but with the brand name i expected a little bit more poor quality for sure not even worth the 3 i paid for them just wanted some back-up headphones I had say they only seem like they would be worth 150 at best can not believe maxell would even put their name on them,56,2
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,they are made of 100 plastic the right side did not work on first use they also feel very delicate in my hands like they are easily broken but for the price hey i might have a different opinion if they worked out of the box,44,3
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,nothing special about these headphones cheaply made with pool audio quality i bought similar items at our local discount store for 5,22,4
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,okay quality for the price i use this for my new hires to watch training videos so not a lot of wear and tear,24,5
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,this headset is horrible i brought it so my kids could use it in school and they said it hurts their ears now they refuse to use it and i have no use for it,36,6
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,fell apart first night my son used them i contacted the maxell people because they have a lifetime warranty but it is a joke because not worth the stamps to send them back,32,7
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,they work well they are kind of tight on my head,11,8
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i wish i could give this a negative 100 stars i got it for a big surgery so i could sleep soundly to my favorite relaxing tunes the 1st night it worked great then the entire right side speaker went out never to be heard from again,47,9

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,i teach 6th grade and bought these for my classroom they are a little small for my students heads but adjust to fit ok works well enough and we managed to afford a full class set,38,16
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,tiny like they were made for a doll very very quiet as well could barely hear anything at full volume did i mention they were tiny,26,17

Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,awful quality i guess you get what you pay for,10,21
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,it is a good thing these are so inexpensive at the price i can not complain too much but i will not be buying them again,23,22
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i like the thinness and the sound is crisp i like these when i lay on my side in bed and listen to otr,24,23
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,can not be beat for the price respectable brand name and functions as expected not anything to write home about as far as sound quality but they serve their purpose as cheap semi disposable headphones great for people who constantly lose and misplace headphones,43,24
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very cheap one of ear pieces was already broken off in the sealed package when received,17,25
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,arrived on time i bought these for use at the office to drown out the sounds of my office mate singing along to the radio and to discourage him from engaging me in conversation it does drowned out the singing but some people can not take a hint,47,26
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,ear piece is too tiny not very usable,8,27
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,for the price these obviously will not be the best mega-ultra-bass option for listening to music at high volume but they are great for podcasts and audio books you can fall asleep wearing them comfortably enough which i can not do with earbuds or the giant beats style fashionable headphones that are all you can find these days,54,28
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,lightweight and durable enough to utilize in classroom each day,10,29

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect for use at school where headphones are constantly broken or lost so far neither has happened,17,32
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for i need a more expensive pair of headphones,14,33
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,the maxell lighweight stereo headset has for the time i have owned it proven to be the true lightweight good performer that i was looking for others that i have found on the market are cumbersome and provide distorted sound the maxell is the lightest that i have found and provides true clear sound without weighing down the head,59,34
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,we bought two of these one for my mother in law and other for my father in law after hardly a month the fabric from the ear parts started to come off sound started to go dim and then do not remember right or left ear side totally stopped working elderly people were using them with as much care as it was possible even then they hardly worked for such a short time one positive thing about these are that they are very light and do not burden ears,89,35
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,great sound but very small and the so called padding on the head phones are very uncomfortable cheap material and painful on the ears,24,36
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the side strings keep coming off sound quality is good although,11,37
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very bad reception the sound is like a tin can and breaks up a lot,15,38

Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,this headphone set is really small better fitted for a kid,11,40
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,should have purchased a more expensive pair got what i paid for headphones were broken within a week due to the thin plastic at the headband-earphone connection,27,41
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these head phones are not worth buying they do not work at all and are a waste of money,19,42
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones work ok but when i extend the ear pieces to fit my head the plastic pieces that are part of the extension mechanism end up pressing on the sides of my head it is a design problem stemming for the manufacturers apparent attempt at saving a few pennies on each piece i do not recommend these headphones,59,43
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i was not expecting these to be of super high quality because of the price the problem i had was when i opened them up and realized how narrow the space was to fit around your head as i stretched them apart i thought i was going to break them do not buy these if you are looking to use them for an adult,64,44
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,I have tried numerous headphones for my daughter after a series of purchases that i was not thrilled with i decided to just buy the cheapest pair i could find they are not fancy they do not fit great there has a weird plastic piece near the ear that rubbed against my head when i tried them on but they work they have already lasted longer than most of the other pairs I have bought for her,71,45
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,my son wears hearing aids and prefers these headphones to my panisonic headphones these sound much more tinny or have much more treble than i think most people would prefer for music but the treble amount is easier to her a person speak or figure out lyrics if wearing hearing aids,51,46

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect for my 2nd grader that needed headphones for school i expected them to break so i purchased 2 pair but they seem to be able to take the torture a 7 year old can give them very satisfied,39,53

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,fine quality for the price my 8 and 5 year old use them to play on the ipad let us me not listen to minecraft videos which is a blessing worth far more than what i paid kids like them just fine no problems not super sturdy headphones but again for the price they were well worth it,58,59
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,my spare pair which i have not opened yet but which i will when my current simple headphones gives up the ghost,22,60
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i buy these for my kids because they are cheap and expendable they sound cheap they feel cheap they look cheap and they are cheap bump up a whole 3 to the panasonic on-ear rp-ht21 headphones for a significant boost in sound quality build construction and aesthetics,47,61
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i do not like these it feels like they were built for a little kid the sound is good although just not a good fit for an adult head,29,62
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these are way too small for an adult and should be clearly marked as child headphones even my 10 year old daughter complained about the size arrived in an opened and poorly re-sealed package,36,63
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,for a cheap pair of headphones for a kid you can not beat the price,14,64

Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these headphones are pieces of crap they fell apart within the first month of course it was just after the return period ended the sound is terrible and they are really cheaply made i had purchased another set for almost the same price by jvc and they are 100x better,50,68
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i have bought these headphones 2 times they are too small for the adults in the house but work great for my 4 and 6 year olds the first pair were stepped on and broke so we bought another pair obviously not a product issue but a little kid issue the 2nd pair is still in use when the kids get some vegging time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows esp my daughters favorite you tube videos which can get annoying since it does not fit our heads i do not know how the sound quality is or how loud it can get but my daughter has some audio sensitivities and she will use them so it must not be too bad,131,69
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these headphones were a waste of money the sound quality was very bad always sounded too low them the cord from the right side of the headphones fell out so now it is total garbage these did not even last 6 months i have a pair of panasonic headphones i purchased from amazon in 2013 that are still working very well i expected better from a brand name like maxell i might as well have bought a generic pair from my local drugstore,81,70
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,can not beat them for the price but keep in mind less than 5 many times better than what you would get at dollar store but if you are a stickler audio file might want to try higher quality,37,71
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,cheap and foam on earphones wears out quick,8,72
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,fabulous sound super lightweight i really like them great price too,11,73

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,super fast shipping and arrived exactly as expected,8,75
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i know i should keep my expectations low given the price but these are probably the smallest least comfortable and lowest quality headphones I have ever had spend an extra 2 and get a better pair,35,76
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very comfortable horrible sound quality i could not return them after tossing the box so they went in the trash,20,77
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i bought these instead of other ones I have purchased for my classroom in the past these when my students pulled the foam off the ears had wires exposed at least the other cheap headphones i had were just exposed plastic speakers when the foam came off i would not recommend these to anyone,53,78
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,foam is really thin and flimsy very uncomfortable for my students,11,79
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i actually ordered 5 pairs for my father he uses headphones every waking moment especially on the weekdays with his news talk shows on the radio so he goes through headphones a lot either they get worn and the speaker goes out in either side or one of our 3 cats get a hold of it and chew it to pieces dad cracked up at the fact that i got him so many because he knows how much he goes through he loves them,84,80
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i bought these for my three kids tablets you get what you pay for these were the cheapest pair i could find and they are made just that way cheap they serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on i heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side he has to do that every time he puts them on i guess I am going to adjust them to his 9 year old head and tape them my younger kids have the same problem,112,81
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,cheap enough for a 4 year old when they break your are not out a lot of cash,17,82

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,if you are looking for inexpensive lightweight headphones these work well i just needed a pair of very lightweight headphones to listen to am talk radio and i did not want to spend a lot so i bought a couple of these so far so good i have other mid to heavy duty headphones when i want to listen to music and want the sound to be higher quality i have been using one of the pairs that i bought daily for the past several months and it is holding up well,92,85
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones sound fine but came with a wire protruding through one of the ear pads i was able to bend the speaker wire back into the plastic covering and hold it in place with hot glue the price is great since they cost less than some places charge for ear pad replacements,53,86
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect cheap retro headphones for my halloween costume sound is adequate too,12,87
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,i work in a middle school special needs classroom we have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various childrens movies and tv shows they usually watch the same clip over and over and over it gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously they were using ear buds when watching their clips but those broke before the holidays after a week of no headphones i decided to order these for them i actually ordered 3 pairs one for each of our classroom computers these are not super high quality headphones but they are working great for our students yes it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice padded over the ear earphones but we do not since these were purchased with my own money this was what was in my budget I am not sure i would order these for myself but for the students they do the job,163,88
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,not too expensive so not such a loss when kids break them at school i bought some others that were almost 10 each and was really upset when they did not last more than a couple of weeks,37,89
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,it is not good buy panasonic volume is lower they are smaller and fragile they fit any size head but they are small and too flimsy pictures make em look bigger,28,90
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,cost ok fits flat on ears with wire to left side one wire a good thing reasonably thick with good male plug wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement sound is not loud and is not as good as my other cheap memorex padding is thin foam which probably helps by providing friction to keep the speakers in place on the ear,89,91
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,the sound is not good and it is too small and tight do not feel comfortable when you put it on,20,92

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i have already written a review for these little headphones they are small and you get what you pay for i love them because they fit my pea sized head they are also cheap enough that if i sit on them or they do break i can replace them without tears the sound is not incredible but definitely okay i use these more than the more expensive pairs i have bought they are small enough to fit a child and if you are hard on your headphones these are a great little extra pair to have around i really enjoy mine,101,106
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these headphones were defective when they arrived only one side was working and the volume on the other was very low amazon replaced them but the replacement had the same problem,31,107
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these do not fit tight enough to really hear the music,11,108
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i know i did not spend much on these headphones but they are incredibly flimsy bend easily and do not stay on,20,109
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,love these yes head phones wear out and break but these last pretty well and are light weight,18,110
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,these are in the goldilocks zone just right-just right-just right they are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old both of whom have breakable tendencies six of these lasted 9 months an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets i was buying based on an assumption of robustness these are just right so that they can be hauled around dropped kicked jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back it takes quite a lot to do them in and in the meantime blessed silence since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house does not have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end a lifesaver on a plane roadtrip and more for ears too small to accept earbuds these are the perfect compromise the sound is tolerable for games or light music listening not a lot of dynamic range for this price point but that is not what I am praising them for,173,111
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,my son got this for christmas and loves it it is very lightweight good buy,15,112
Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,great head set for the price I am not suggesting that they are pro level sound but work great and have good sound quality i also like the single cable as they stay out of the way more you can not beat it for the price and if you have prime you are almost getting them for next to nothing thanks amazon,60,113
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,great product buying process was smooth and easy shipping was fast a pleasure to do business with i would recommend this company to everyone,24,114

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i like these headphones lightweight i am ordering another pair and the price is reasonable,15,116
Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,cheap cr p you get what you pay for the chord is short the sound quality is atrocious the snap that holds the moveable part broke in a month,28,117
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these were great headphones i am on the phone most of the day and these headphones are so comfortable i can hear the customers crystal clear,26,118
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these headphones were great for the money i use them to run of course the sound quality is not great look at the price i broke them the other day and was not even angry because at this price i can just get another,42,119
Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,good sound fit nicely kids all loved them better for your ear s then the ear buds for sound and for comfort,22,120
Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,big disappointment with maxell they should sell these at the dollar store this is one of those products where you wonder why did they even bother,26,121
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,warning maxtors warranty claims that they are not responsible for any data loss experienced by using their software to upgrade to the new drive translation after having my original functioning working win2k sp4 system corrupted by the maxblast 30 software following all instructions maxtor has refused to respond to my complaints in a satisfactory way the total cost was 20 hours of my time completely reinstalling my system and programs suggestion do not use the software provided research other hard drive vendors who make similar products but have better warranties,89,0
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,first thought no one should be able to write a review on a hard drive until it is a year old if that were the rule you would see almost no positive reviews for these new maxtor drives purchased 5 drives over a one year period and have had three fail maxtor replaced those without any issue except that the replacement drives which were refurbished also failed within 3 months quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data btw each drive had dedicated cooler fan and pcs were onso there are not any excuses there has a reason why these drives have one year warranties beware,111,1
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,I have been buying maxtors for years now and have had them come through earthquakes in ca a move half way across the country and being carted around in two hurricane evacuations other than during severe weather they run 24/7 and are usually retired because of size not failure i know nothing of maxtors customer support as I have never needed them this one is running like a champ quiet and fast seems to run hot but pretty much every computer component these days is putting out a lot of heat good ventillation is a definite must,95,2
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,if you like to fryon your hard drive use maxtor if you do not like the heat get out of the maxtor kitchen and get yourself a real hard disk like seagate or wd i work in the it field and can not count the number of dead maxtors I have seen over the years i doubt very much that maxtor uses tqm six sigma or the toyota way to produce their inexpensive hdds,73,3
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,what an awful experience I have purchased five of these drives from three different sources not a bad lot or anything within 15 years three of them have corrupted data I am tremendously lucky that I have got them in a raid-5 array and never had two fail at the same time i was only able to get two of them replaced on warranty do not touch this drive or probably any other maxtor for that matter with a 10-footyou will get burned,82,4
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,i have had three of these hard drives so far one is years old and works fine the second lost all data and will not work the third i put in a computer i built by myself it worked flawlessly for 6 months then would notthe os properly it is final day in my computer it lit on fire while my first one has had zero problems the second is a fancy paperwieght and the third is useful for lighting candles buyer beware,82,5
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,learn from my mistake do not buy a maxtor drive do not buy anything thru amazon their shipping is horrible i was not in a hurry so i did not use expedited shipping maybe if i had it would have taken less than three weeks but i would not bet on it being less than twothe drive did not come with the ata card as advertised and it is already making strange noises after just 2 mos be wise i found a 200 gig seagate at wal-mart today for 70 and tax no shipping and it has a five year warranty,96,6
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,this drive was too good of a price to pass up when i needed more room for pictures and videos i was actualy a bit leery about this purchase given the size of the drive at this price but i have been very satisfied the drive installs easily enough for those not afraid of taking the cover off the computer and should work with most computers,66,7
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,some one has their facts wrong i have used maxtor drives for years without issue,16,8
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,i would not even give it one star but that is the lowest score possible this is the second maxtor drive that failed after just over a year you think that i would have learned by now after crashing a couple of times already the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash of course as another reviewer noted the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive this may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run i would not use a maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time i spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups never again maxtor,137,9
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,i bought this drive at staples 130 less 30 instant discount and 30 mir thus costing 70 it did not come with a card but my new dell 4700 can handle drives larger than 137 gb capacity i put this drive into an external usb 20 / firewire case i bought from cusa for 40 after connecting the usb cable and flipiing the power switch to on it was recognized instantly by my win xp media center dell 4700 pc i used software it came with to set up the drive and it was ready in less than 5 minutes total formatted capacity 203 gb so i have a 200 gb external drive for barely 110 less 12 staples customer appreciation discount this week,118,10
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,1.0,negative,drive was slow to open and got the click of death after 13 months maxtor only warrenties for 6 months seems they know something you should know,27,11
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,was concerned with the specs listing a drive that would not fit my computer did some checking and this unit is a standard 35 inch wide drive so bought it installation was quick and easy to do necessary to point out that one does need to first verify what is in their unit by using information from systems device match the drive you need to the drive interface that is in you unit to avoid problems,77,12
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,I have owned this drive for many months and it has performed flawlessly it like other large and fast drives gets pretty warm after running for a while if you just make sure your case is well ventillated you should not have any problems I have built many systems with many different hard drives and have only had a couple fail they were not maxtor but it just as easily could have been if you value your data either back it up or go with a raid system failures can and do happen no matter what brand of drive you buy as far as the whiners that gave this drive poor marks what can i say looks like instead of rating it on the merits of the drive itself they took out they frustration because of either poor marketing or an obvious case of not reading their own system manual before making the purchase make no mistake this is an great drive for pcs built in this century and when on sale offers ample room for drive hogging chores such as video editing and archiving i highly recommend it,185,13
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,and this one is no different i had purchased a 160 gb samsung to start building my new pc i took this drive home only to find that their partitioning software that you have to download from their website did not even work instead of searching the internet for third party software to do this i took the drive back to the store and got the 200 gb maxtor instead installation was simple i just popped it into my pc and it was recognized immediately i installed the maximum blast software and the drive was partitioned formatted and ready to use in less than 5 minutes note your registry has to be modified to be able to recognize drives larger than 137 mb but the maxtor software does this for you i will always buy maxtor from now on great products with no bs,142,14
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,I have had this drive in my system for about a year to store mp3s and videos i should have backed up all of my files because my old harddrive has failed and with 200 gb of storage you will not run out very quickly mine came with the ata card and it was easy to install it has worked fine and quietly ever since and i am pleased with the purchase,69,15
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5.0,positive,this is a great drive it is fast about twice as fast as my other 2 and 3 year old 7200rpm drives and it is silent and seems to be reliable it is also at a great price for the capacity and it is maxtor a trusted name in hard drives i got the ata card with mine but i used another silicon image card i purchased previously it has the same features but gave less problems my computer took longer than it should to start up with the maxtor ata card the maxblast software worked perfectly and never gave me any trouble all those giving bad reviews because of the software or lack of card need to stop complaining the point is the actual hard drive is great and you will not go wrong purchasing it i like it so much i decided to purchase the 160 gig version to replace two of my other hard drives,153,16
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2.0,negative,i figured an amplified antenna would be better than a regular one i was wrong the unamplified antenna i have produces the same quality picture or better for half the price very disappointing,33,0
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,i was putting this together when the antenna just broke off they have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off this also has a huge clumsy ac plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space when i returned this to the store i saw another person retuning this exact same model also ge has a much better model that i bought instead that does not break and does not have any ac plug which works wonderfully do not waste your money on this rca antenna i give it zero stars,96,1
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4.0,positive,i bought 4 amplified antennas to test which one worked the best for my home this was the least expensive it had some shadows but it also had up to 2 channels as good as cable i had to changing it to get a good picture but not bad audio was good but so were all the others i almost kept this one it would be a good buy,69,2
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,it actually made my reception worse the amplifier in the back distorted my picture to the point where i saw nothing but snow who actually wants to put 39 inch antenttas in their house i know i do not want to look at them espeicially since they did not even make my signal come in any better this is funny although having the co-axel cable just hanging out by the window not only was more attactive than the 39inch flag poles but gave me much better reception i would not recommend this product,89,3
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2.0,negative,was trying to get a tv station about 27 miles away with no luck so it requires going to cable,20,4
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4.0,positive,the antenna was new and a quality product the cost ratio is very good i would recommend buying this antenna to anyone interested in buying a very good reception product,30,5
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5.0,positive,well made just follow the instructions to the letter and you will agree it is a five starenjoy recommend to all,21,6
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5.0,positive,i bought thisalong with the rca dat-800b1 tv converter box this review is for both items if you live in a metropolitan area you will have no problems receiving over the air television stations and watching them on an analog tv both items were easy to set up and use i purchased these items because i was tired of paying for most of the things i did not watch on cable i can get all of the major stations so when news and weather is a must have it is all right there if you feel you do not need cable tv and you still have an analog tv set you do not want to through away thisand it is companion will save you money and extend the usable life of your old tube tv set one months cable bill will pay for both items as for internet i use dsl it works good enough,154,7
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4.0,positive,i have not used the current purchase but have on bought several years ago so i could get local channels whenever the satallight service goes out because it eventually will for periods of time it has always worked fine so recomment it,41,8
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5.0,positive,i have had this antenna for a couple years it does a perfect job bringing in all the local channels for my hdtv i undoubtedly benefit from living within 3 - 5 miles of all local broadcasts if you live any farther away i suppose you will need to rely on other reviewers it is a little bit of an eyesore like almost any indoor antenna but I have managed to discretely stash it near a window the low price is also an obvious plus given my experience i would definitely recommend the antenna to anyone living near local broadcasts who is looking for an alternative to cable,103,9
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5.0,positive,I am addicted to tv so while I am at work i like to listen to my favorite re-runs during the day my office does not have a window so it is really hard to get reception with the converter box and an antenna I have tried 3 other antennaes that only provided partial channels for some reason this is the only antenna that brings in all channels for me this is the second time I have purchased this one i used the first one for so long that it burnt out for my situation it is the best,92,10
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2.0,negative,this antenna has served it is purposed well for me watching basic stations like fox nbc abc and cbs it has trouble picking-up pbs sometimes which really annoys me it was an improvement over the previous antenna i had that was meant for analog signals however i bought a 20 ge flat panel antenna at target and it worked much better than the rca i find sometimes i need to adjust the rca for it to get a signal it also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room no problems with the ge i even attached a signal amplifier to it and it did not seem to help much i would just get a another antenna for a little more money,123,11
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,i got this antenna when i bought the digital box converter thing at first i thought i lived in an area of bad reception i could only get 2 watchable channels and 2 with really bad reception so for 4 months i had my antenna connected directly to my tv getting regular analog signal after reading the reviews which are better of the passive rca antenna that is basically this one but withouth the amplifier i decided to connect it back to the digital converter without plugging the antenna into the power to my surprise i am know getting 20 perfectly clear channels can not believe but it is true go for the unamplified rca antenna which is cheaper,117,12
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4.0,positive,great for the converter box the powered antenna boots the reception to view more avilable channels,16,13
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2.0,negative,i purchased rca ant301 to replace the old one also rca bought 5 years ago that has one of the rods broken however the new one is worse than the old one even with a broken wing the screen becomes blurer with many flies flying all over i have to replace it with the old and broken one i do not know which of rcas is worth buying for the old one is now obsolete,75,14
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,purely all-around awful performance this rca antenna looks like it is supposed to do something metal poles ring that goes around in circles wire jack electric plug and little dial on the back but any spare piece of wire stuck into your tvs antenna jack will do a significantly better job than this horrible rip-off I am embarrassed to say that i bought it in good faith from a big box store it should not be for sale anywhere boo hoo my poor dollars went pay for this swiveling piece of crapolla what has the point of plugging it in and turning some little gain knob when all it does is makes the picture worse than if you had no antenna at all i can not say enough about how terrible this is and how ashamed i think rca should feel for pushing this on distributors i will not buy anything made by rca in good faith again because of this stupid product,160,15
Electronics,B00008V6JO,5.0,positive,this was the third antenna i bought in attempt to get an hd signal in my apartment i was unable to get a solid hd signal at all with the first two after almost 30mins playing with each however with hardly any fiddiling at all this one worked great picked up all my major stations with maybe 5 mins of moving the antennas around,64,16
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,this antenna is a huge waste of money i live in a strong signal area 5 miles to the towers on an analog tv this antenna produced an extremely noisy picture due to the poor amplifier without the amplifier this antenna did not produce a picture on a digital tv this antenna did ok however a cheap pair of rabbit ears with a uhf loop greatly outperformed this antenna both on digital and analog tvs i would not recommend the rca ant301 to anyone even if were free,88,17
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2.0,negative,i am about forty miles from the broadcast towers the ant301s uhf reception was very good but vhf reception is poor it picked up one of the five vhf channels in the area i disconnected the power and there was no difference in signal strength so it is no more amplified than a normal pair of rabbit ears if you are looking for an inexpensive amplified antenna the rca ant1250 is a better choice,74,18
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4.0,positive,i was trying to get local hd channels added to my dish network setup i tried a directional nonamplified antenna and after 30 minutes of fiddling for the best angle these are the signal strength numbers i got fox 68 cbs 63 abc 59 fox was the only one that was watchable at this strength i bought the ant301 and plugged it in and after about 5 minutes of fiddling here are the new strengths fox 78 cbs 83 abc 73 all three channels are watchable now with no issues i would recommend this antenna if you are just within range of your hd channels and want to get a better signal it will not work miracles but it does improve the signal over nonamplified antennas,131,19
Electronics,B00008V6JO,1.0,negative,i decided to get rid of cable too expensive living in downtown milwaukee i should probably get many channels with an antenna one would think unfortunately i didn have one so at first i hooked up a two three foot coax cables to a splitter to create a dipole type thing and i hooked this up to the tv i got okay reception from this time to pick up an antenna i just bought the 301 from best buy the sales dude said it was the best on the market and he had no complaints or returns hooked it up in place of my coax cable contraption it faired just as well if not worse i am returning the antenna and getting the 25 channel cable plan for 1300 the one they do not tell you about,136,20
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,very simple if you want your life to be in peace please do not even think to buy this i literally had to throw this in to the trashcan it worked nice for a few months 2 then the nightmare started losing connection every 15 minutes then the left ctrl key stopped to work then the left alt key i reinstalled every thing several times without any success finally to get this nightmare worst 2 key pads came out i wrote several times to logitech no answer i decided to throw it away very very disappointed and it was not a 25 keyboard,102,0
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,this keyboard has a wonderful feel but the mediapad does chew up the batteries the decals have begun to come off the keys in a serious way after just a few months too very disappointing given that we have had over a century of manufacturing experience with keyboards,47,1
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,the mouse had a good feel and nice response that was the only thing i could get to work after much effort i did get the keyboard and keypad to work briefly but once i installed the software as directed it was only the mouse for a while eventually it quit too i spent a couple of hours following their limited directions and finally went on line to find automated support that said it must me defective return it i will,79,2
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,64 mb of software constant checks for updates items in my system tray just for a keyboard and mouse ridiculous i kept this keyboard / mouse going for about a year on a home theater pc but am retiring it now it was nothing but trouble constantly losing contact after sleep or reboots requiring lots of fiddling with windows and logitech configuration interfaces an additional wired mouse at least is required to maintain your system i do not know if it is a microsoft or logitech problem but I shall avoid buying new bluetooth gizmos from now on i replaced this with a non-bluetooth rf keyboard / trackball combo that i love also the separate keypad eats batteries much too quickly now I am just trying to salvage the bluetooth usb dongle for use with another bluetooth device i foolishly bought but i do not want the huge logitech install just for that wish me luck,148,3
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied these are thewhich is not sold in japan,13,4
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i have not experienced many problems with this setup at all I am gone from home all day but when i get back it is just any random keystroke and my bluetooth is back online I have had it for several months and only had to change the batteries once the mouse lasted significantly long before it needed to be recharge my only issue is it is intermittent ability to function before the os loads,70,5
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,this really nice keyboard and once you learn all it is features you enjoy it,14,6
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i love the way this product looked it was slim and sexy the reality was that it was a battery hog the media pad was basically useless there were frequent bluetooth disconnections and i actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working i am not a gorilla typist i eventually gave up on it i give it 2 stars because it was a nice design but it just did not deliver,73,7
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,it looks great but the media pad makes it too wide the battery on the media pad does not last very long so i ended up not wanting to replace the batteries again just not using it i usually use the number pad so this was a real inconvenience the mouse is also too heavy for my liking I am buying something else,61,8
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i bought this for the size and the bluetooth it is thin and fits nicely into my keyboard drawer my notebook has bluetooth and they paired up nicely as a keyboard it feels like a high end board and works perfectly the mouse is nice as well but not great for switching hands the only feature annoyance is that they did not bother putting a scroll wheel on the keyboard as in the elite duo if they added that feature and a dozen or more programmable buttons this board would be perfect oh ya do not forget to update the software / drivers before you even begin amendment so now that I have had this for several months i would give it 2 stars the setpoint software fails on all the computers running ms office outlook logitech help is useless several hours wasted the bluetooth is still great and the feel of the board very nice but without setpoint you can not use most of the features shame on logitech,164,9
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,the included receiver has very limited range if you already have another receiver i did you might be able to live with this set there is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad lcd the media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for itunes and windows media player however the useless lcd can not navigate song titles it simply displays the currently playing title would be great if you could scroll down a list of artist / tunes and tag for play,83,10
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,this keyboard is just perfect for me i love the seperate numberpad everything works fine,15,11
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i had read several reviews here before purchasing this product but went ahead and bought it anyway thinking that logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted i was wrong after a few weeks of satisfactory use long enough to get past amazons reasonable window for returns the space bar started working intermittently incredibly annoying and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes even before the space bar turned against me i was unimpressed with the feel of the keys i use a dell wireless keyboard an apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my ibm x-series laptop bottom line the thing looks great on a desk and it is nicely compact but it probably will not do what you need it to look elsewhere,131,12
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,1.0,negative,i bought this and hate it the mouse works intermittantly and is too heavy the numeric keyboard beeps and displays incoming emails and ims seemingly at random and usually several days after the messages arrive it also ran out of battery power after a weeks use also the keyboard feel is horrible and it is impossible to key in numbers quickly and reliably with it same goes for the main keyboard the space button frequently will not work oh and the first time i use the numeric keypad after some time of non-use it often sends two consecutive numbers with one keystroke example i type 123 and it comes out as 1123 i will say the design is very cool too bad this product is useless,125,13
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,i just got this one from a local store at 94 my mouse is the mx900 that has been discontinued for a while initially it was the mx900 got my attention at this price mx900 costs about 80 alone if you can find one before it was installed the pc has g7 and ms bluetooth already so after installed battery and plugged it into usb port the software detected them all i just configured some mouse and keyboard buttons to the way i like the keyboard / remote are very well built in both style and quality as well as key touching even on the bigger keys such as shift and space the mx900 is very similar to mx700 that i have been using daily along with g7 while the bluetooth mx900 features long range coommunication it suffers from very short battery life 1 day for normal usage which is unacceptable today however the battery charge is also very short too 1/2the remote keypads is handy as remote control for dvd / cd playback i guess logitch will put this keyboard together with g7 as another product,184,14
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,this is one beautiful keyboard but underneath the pretty skin a beast lies within many times over i had to restart my computer windows xp pro after coming out of suspense because bluetooth failed to reconnect i got the latest bluetooth software from logitech but still having issues and after a while the left ctrl key started to give me problems i had to press the key hard enough otherwise i would just type against or cs when i try to copy or paste that got annoying real quick since with my work i use a lot of keyboard shortcuts i am not using the keyboard or the mouse anymore i replaced the keyboard with an old dell and the mouse with mx1000 which is working fantastically 2 stars that i am giving is for the design and the effort logitech put into it,144,15
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,the aesthetics are the 1st thing i notice with new products the dinovo is no exception the build quality is outstanding the feel of the keys themselves quite solid and i have had no trouble to date the connection to the bluetooth hub takes a second or so to connect when the computer boots up but so what it is not a significant issue that should discourage someone from considering this product the mouse is also terrific excellent ergonomics comfort plus it has thoughtful and well located button features if any technical failures happen I shall update this post but so far it is worked flawlessly certainly makes typing enjoyable and there is zero timelag with the bluetooth once connected it is immediately responsive to keyboard input and no messy wires running across my desk,131,16
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,overall a great product had a little trouble with the first one the mouse would not charge the batteries but a new one was sent bby amazon with quick shipping this setup has so many uses not sure how i got work done witout it,45,17
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,i recently built a new pc for my boss and decided to go with this keyboard being as he is all about new and cool stuff so wireless and small was good i hooked it up had it running in about 5 minutes and it felt great i did not want to move so the boss could use his computer it is great so far we have only had it for 3 days and if anything goes wrong like said above many times i will let you guys know for now buy the damn thing,94,18
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,4.0,positive,I am a tech geek so this sleekly designed keyboard was a must-have for me i noticed that the mouse that came with mine was very generic and the price is about 100 less than what I am seeing advertised i bought a laser mouse instead this is my first wireless keyboard my reason for buying it other than the design was that i feel retrained by wires when using my keyboard and mouse the only drawback to me is that there are no indicator lights for the caps lock or any other keys to indicate whether or not they are active and honestly at this price I had like the entire keyboard to have a backlight option,115,19
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,i was first stricken with the beauty of the design of this set logitech hit the bullseye with the look once i got the set home and got it installed all without a hitch i might add i found myself most pleased with the feel of the keyboard it is a very comfortable keyboard and it is very quiet but after about 2 months the beast began to emerge to my dismay and shock i have been a loyal logitech user for sometime never encountering any serious problems with any of their products but after 2 months the left ctrl key just stopped working nothing i could do to fix it i also encountered frequent connection troubles with the bluetooth mostly with the mouse i would often have to wait a few minutes after boot for the mouse to be connected the sudden malfunctioning keys issue seems to be common among many users of this particular logitech product as well as the connection issues in light of this i strongly urge buyers to look elsewhere for a keyboard and mouse set,181,20
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,2.0,negative,a beautiful product but not so comfortable the feeling of keystroke is very similar to gerenal notebook keyboard the mediapad is not a goodfor non-western language you will get for all non-western character and i get my mediapad rmaed twice a tedious procedure that i will not mention here theof media center is not as useful because the software is tightly integrated with ms media player so i can not get any benefit from my itunes if you do not use keyboard often and need some beautiful gadget on your desktop i would recommend this otherwise find other robust keyboard,103,21
Electronics,B0000UV0JA,5.0,positive,a bought this keyboard a week ago and it is working fine i have a ibm t21 laptop with a sony flat screen and windows xp pro i use my computer 30 to 60 mn a day i plugged the bluetooth hub on a usb hub connected to the only usb port of my laptop it took me 20 mn to do the set up both the keyboard and the mouse worked perfectly right away i did not need to install the logitech driver i have still not installed it yet and i think i will not i may not have all functionalities but it does not matter to me i did not notice any pb with the batteries so far i like the design of the keyboard it is a pleasant touch the mouse is nice but a little bit overweighted in my view it has back / forward buttons which are usefull for web navigation,154,22
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,it is difficult to write an objective review on an hdtv antenna because reception will depend on your location however i live in a house on the outskirts of town and i am able to receive all of the local network affiliates abc cbs nbc fox cw pbs with this antenna it even picks up a weak signal from a fox affiliate over 50 miles away i also tried the terk hdtva indoor amplified high-definition antenna for off-air hdtv reception but found that it did not perform as well as the rca it also took up more room was not as stable it was prone to tipping over and was more expensive than the rca,113,0
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i got two terks the 525 and the rca 111 and tested all 4 for number of signals and for signal strength the cheapest 111 came out head and shoulders above the rest not only did it receive 3 more channels than any other but the signals were stronger plus i save on electricity because i do not have to plug in the 111 i returned the 525 with a big grin on my face 5 antenna and great signals from 25 - 30 miles,82,1
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i recently installed one of these on our new hdtv the reception is excellent and the amplifier is great for boosting the signal from otherwise unwatchable stations,27,2
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,as the specification says 45 gb gain is really works for me supplied cable is bit short but if you can manage it go for it led indicator is bit bright very little noise hd is great and works on my tv,41,3
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,the ant525 is the perfect ota antenna for me i had tried 3 others amplified antennas including the highly rated terk hdtva prior to buying this one and the ant525 worked the best i placed each antenna in the same location and the ant525 increased my signal strength by 10 - 15 points over the other antennas the ant525 is very solid and stable I am using antenna for uhf only so i removed the vhf dipoles which really increased the aesthetics of the antenna i highly recommend the ant525 i wish i would have started with this one and i would have saved a lot of time returning inferior antennas,106,4
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,this is a solid product great reception with it good for me with the channels that have football i would have to agree about the short cord although i have a table close that i put the antenna on and it works fine for me it would have gotten 5 stars with the cord length up more i mean come on it is regular tv what more can you ask for,70,5
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i bought this antenna for a spare tv i wanted to be able to get some of the channels i know are available to antenna tv only and not through our comcast connection guess what i got three channels one worship channel and two ion channels i was astonished i although that might be all i can get in my area but i borrowed another antenna and viola there were all the local channels plus the cable channels i had been looking for all i can say about this antenna is that you must have to be right on top of a big tv station antenna to get that station i live outside boston and there are three network affiliates within 10 miles of my home plus a fox affiliate within 5 miles yet this marvel could not pick any of them up do i recommend this antenna no emphatically no it might seem like a good buy but it is a bust,164,6
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,the antenna works okay on about five channels in my area it frequently loses the signal the problem could be location not sure,23,7
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,researched the internet and picked this one regretfully for me it does not work very good difficulty getting a signal and then if i can the picture will not come in clearly or without lots of lines and more very disappointed and a waste of money for me,45,8
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,do not lose your money rca indoor amplified tv antenna transmits only analog signals 10 to be precise in my brooklyn new york location absolutely no digital reception for my new hdtv i have 2 new hdtvs 2 jensen antennas more than 10 years old work beautifully for one of my new hdtvs as well as for my non-hdtv vendors should withdraw this product from amazon market place to prevent unsuspecting customers from losing money sellers impose all kinds of conditions to forestall taking back the product once the box is opened even although the product does not work transmit digital signals thus no longer viable as a useful product amazoncom should exercise it is power to compel the vendors to refund their customers fully for moving useless product to uninitiated and frustrated customers eager to view hdtv programs sooner rather than later,138,9
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,the rca amplified indoor antenna was a complete disappointment i tried it in upstate new york about a hour outside albany and it failed to pick up any digital tv channels and i returned it even my original rabbit ears antenna picks up two digital channels,46,10
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i bought thisto use with a digital converter box it worked well for the first day or two since i do not use this tv quite a bit i was not happy to find that the power supply had shorted out or at the very least was not working and the reception was horrible i went online to amazon to return it and found that the window for returning it had closed slam i would think that since it is defective that the window for return would be 30 - 90 days as it is for most electronic devices that are defective needless to say my days with amazon are over guess they do not need my business and i know i do not need their attitude,124,11
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,did not see any difference compare with my rabbit ears that come with my tv tried many different locations directions angles still receive same amount of channels,27,12
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,2.0,negative,this antenna did not help my area does not pick up a signal that well but it did not work better than an older antenna i have been using for a long time only thing going for this product is the look of it,44,13
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i am really impressed with how great the reception is the picture quality is as good as it was with cable in the past i was never able to get a good picture with an antenna but with this antenna i get a beautiful picture and also pick up stations i never could get before,55,14
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,50 miles west of st louis and nearest towers i get all local channels and could not be happier,18,15
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,I am very satisfied with my choice of tv antennas I have been doing business with amazon for many years and i am never disappointed both the merchandise and delivery are superb i recommend amazon anytime,34,16
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,we are very satisfied with thisinitially it took few and more minutes to set it to work properly but then when we finally did the quality of channels has improved we do not use cable / dish so this helped in amplifying the news channel the most,45,17
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,5.0,positive,i switched from regular rabbit ears to this antenna today and now i get all of my regular tv channels perfectly i also get nine more channels that i did not get before it is amazing,34,18
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,i did not know if an antenna would work out here in the suburbs but it did can not get perfect reception but better than paying dish prices for 2 other t against,32,19
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,i received this product in a timely fashion and i am pleased with the performance of the antenna so far currently i am able to pull in tv stations within 100 miles of my apartment which means i am able to pull in local analog and hd channels from three cities the powered amplifier certainly helps,56,20
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,if you read my other review you will see that this one works good but is better when you use the booster and then i attached it to the rca flat large antenna good reception crystal clear without the second antenna the reception was fair especially in the compromised area of the house,53,21
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,1.0,negative,i lived about 20 miles from the tv towers i found that the signal is weak there is always some snow on the analog channels my digital box shows that the signal strength is about 55 when i found this antenna it had 5-star rating but i am wrong about this as soon as i turn it on the snow is all over the screen for the analog channels for the digital channels the converter box show the signal is jumping between 0 to 5 i do not think it will cut off the signal the only thing i can think of is that it amplifies the noice too without turning on the amplify feature it works the same way as other 10 rabbit ear antennas,125,22
Electronics,B000AKVJCI,4.0,positive,excellent antenna i wish i knew about amplified antennas a long time ago i used to get some channels pretty good and now they are totally clear and i used to get some channels not so good with a lot of fuzz and snow but now they are pretty good highly recommend investing in one of these the only reason i did not give 5 stars is becasusei saw a generic brand one for less cost but rca is good so I am glad i bought it,83,23
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,i bought the nanofor my ipod nano you must buy thisbecause it is not original with the package and you do not want to end up having your nano on the bed or the desk or in the dogs mouth theis cool for charging and sync purposes know that thehas input for charging and output for headphones and fyi the headphone output has a fixed volume level so you can not control the nano when it is docked to increas / decrease the volume one last thing is that when you sync the nano you are not able to use the nano as it will be in charge mode do not say where has the power charger because it charges from the usb cable chao,127,0
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,thisstation is great i got one cord going from theto my computer and i sure can use less wires around my computer i love the fact that my ipod is charged and synchronized all at the same time with out having extra cables the station is small and sleek and takes almost no desk space be aware that if you order theit does not come with an adapter for the 1 gb nano and it does not come with any cables either thisis worth the money not to have your nano moving around you desk or even running the risk of knocking it off,111,1
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,this little unit allows you to play your nano through any radio or dvd player with either rca jacks you will need an adaptor stereo pin plug to rca jacks or a stereo pin plug bear further in mind that unlike many so called docks it does not charge your nano so you will only have the time your batteries last to play before recharging,65,2
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,you bought the ipod nano basically for it is looks buy this for the same reason it is so cute and fits your nano exactly as you wish i bought anfrom another company and although it was cheaper it looked dirty on my computer table this one has the apple looks,51,3
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,this merchandise is very helpful in a sense that you can charge the ipod nano on the wall without operating your computer in that way your worklow in using the computer is not being interrupted and still having the ipod being charge,42,4
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i do not find this to be that useful the only benefit is that it holds the ipod upright it has a line out feature but that is not why i purchased it and i will not use that i assumed incorrectly that it came with it is own power cord so that it would by itself charge the ipod you must purchase a separate plug or use the usb jack that it came with i wanted an addition means of charging the nano had i known that it was just a base i would not have purchased thiscertainly not for 30 for me the utility of this is not worth more than a few bucks and I am not exactly the miser type,119,5
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,2.0,negative,yeah the nanois useful however be aware that it comes with no cords whatsoever this means that you have to purchase yet another accessory for it to be of any practical use boo apple there is absolutely no excuse for following in the footsteps of microsoft,48,6
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,theallows you easy access to the nanos line-out interface and it makes it a lot more convenient to sync your ipod with a computer instead of rummaging around for cables you just set your it down in theand you are done on the other hand like most ipod accessories it is outrageously priced it is nothing more than a molded block of plastic with a couple of wires running through it can not cost apple more than 5 each to make while it is useful enough that it will probably be worth 30 over the long term it still feels like a ripoff,102,7
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,i got to say this tiny littleis amazing it makes it so easy to hook your new nano to just about anything that will receive a stereo mini jack i tried it at the apple store at the local mall before i bought it at amazon they had it connected to a variety of computers speakers and other media devices it is fantastic how this tiny interface increased the flexibility and usefulness of the newest addition to the ipod family it is so cool get one at this price buy two,90,8
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,i tried hooking up my ipod nano to the home theater system and had to crank up the volume way up both on the ipod and the ht system to get desired levels of sound with thisthe sound is backmatched with the ipod this is a recommended accessory for all who want to listen to their ipod songs on a bigger sound system my alternatives were buy a bose soundock 299 for direct usage or a bose ipod129 to use the way i am using it now via the apple ipoda third alternative which i have used in the past is to use altec lansing inmotion desktop speakers which are pretty good but can not compete with bigger sounding ht can not go wrong with a 15 price tag on this and a 15 mir when it appears,148,9
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,works perfectly with nano excellent for holding nano when downloading from itunes highly recommended,14,10
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i got this as a christmas gift today i was excited at first but I am afraid that I shall have to concur with the other bad reviews here that hurts because generally I am an apple fan but my new aluminum nano just barely does not fit and although surgery may work I am not going to fix something that ought to work correctly in the first place yes it says 1st generation but the buyer has to be pretty alert to realize that the new ones are very very slightly the wrong size to use this and the lack of a power supply cord is galling apple gets a lot right but they dropped the ball completely on this one,117,11
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,it is crazy that it does not fit the new nanos is not it i put in my metallic green 4 g and the width of the opening is about 2 millimeters to short i thought let us see if this thing can stand a little plastic surgery i bought my husband one of those dremel drilling tools for christmas last year and it works like a charm to drill out the excess plastic at first there was a small ridge that was making my ipod connect and then disconnect from itunes that puppy has got to be completely flush so he took it the dremel tool to it again and it works just like it should of course I am betting the one-year warranty on theis now void hehe,127,12
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,the new aluminium nanos just does not fit in theunfortunately this is not mentioned anywhere on this page as far as i can see buyer beware mines on the way back to the warehouse as we speak,37,13
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,1.0,negative,i agree with the comment below i was under the assumption as the previous reviewer i would pay about 5 with no shipping but no more it basically is more cosmetic than productive,33,14
Electronics,B000BB80TQ,4.0,positive,theworks as promised the only hitch to me is i have to remove my nano from it is case to place it one thei purchased the apple brand rubber slip-on case to protect my nano and it is a very very thin case however i must still remove the nano in order to use theyou would think apple would provide a small amount of room to accomodate thier own accesories,75,15
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,I am using the v400 on my g5 desktop comp at work and i love it it tracks well is a perfect size and feel and is lightweight i also love the horizontal scrolling highly recommended,35,0
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,works great with vista really good cursor focus works good on textured surfaces,13,1
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,this product have a very good grip and handle the size it is correct and they function bottoms are good the usb connection work propertly,24,2
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,i had this mouse for half a year i suffered from this mouse a lot first of all the battery will not last for a week if you keep mouse awake i am using rechargeble battery sanyo ni-mh 2100 mah i also have a microsoft mouse even although it uses two battery instead of one as v400 the battery can support me for half a year second the focus of v400 is not good sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement these days i found a new big problem the mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up i thought it was xps problem eventually i figured out it was my v400 mouse i had a very good impression with logitech but this time i will double think when i buy anything from logitech,138,3
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,what can i say i bought this mouse from amazon under the new and used category it came in the mail i opened it put a aa battery in plugged it into my macbook pro and it worked right away the product did not come with mac drivers but they were easy to find on the logitech website i installed them restarted set up the two extra buttons the way i wanted used expose functions so it is pretty much like a 30 dollar mighty mouse the only thing that I have have problems with is that the side-scrolling can not be adjusted and it is really really slow I have gotten good and just clicking it over to make it go faster but otherwise the tracking is amazing the scroll wheel is really nice the buttons are great it is perfect size very portable good mouse,141,4
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,i did not experience tracking and long wake up time problem as other user has reviewed i tried some different types of mouse pad and i think it is doing fine however i think this mouse is too small I am used to use large mouse when i use it i feel more tired than use large mouse and I am not used to the back / forward button position,64,5
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,logitech so far always appeared to me as being a first tier supplier of quality mice i am shocked how logitech could dare to release such a product they are actually back to the good old days where users would need a mouse pad in order to get proper performance the v400 does not work well on dark surfaces it does not work well on light surfaces and it does not work well on tablecloth i have actually bought the v400 because i did not like the scroll panel of the v500 to my surprise the v500 with conventional red led works well on all mentioned surfaces where v400 is a nightmare it is a darned cheek when logitech claims to have introduced the v400 all terrain laser tracking technology,131,6
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,like most other users here the tracking problems I have encountered have been aweful light or dark mousepad or not two different pcs latest setpoint driver software it does not seem to matter also by comparison i have the mx500 corded optical mx700 cordless optical and mx1000 latest cordless laser on various machines and all work perfectly on the same mousepads and surfaces upon which the v400 fails the mx1000 works perfectly on the same laptop with the same setpoint driver software on which the v400 fails bottom line it is definitely the the v400 the v400 mouse will work fine for a while then if you stop to type something like the paragraph above then go back to the mouse and move it the cursor just stays put you have to move the mouse around quite a bit to get it to recognize that it is being moved clicking the mouse seems to wake it up immediately but of course that may not be appropriate depending on the application you are in as far as I am concerned i have loved everything logitech that I have ever owned until now in my opinion the v400 is a piece of junk,195,7
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,i just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now it works well as a mouse but it is very uncomfortable in my hand having to use your index finger for the forward and back buttons is awkward it also does not fit your hand well i would not recommend this unit i am returning the v400 i originally had a microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use but i was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward and back buttons the v400 seemed a gooduntil actually using it I had love a smaller version of the mx1000 note the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward and back buttons to work with the mozilla firefox browser you have to download a 47 mb update from the logitech support site,147,8
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,this is the only 5 button notebook-sized wireless mouse i can find and so i gave it a shot besides the fact that it does not work on a glass table this mouse delivers the tracking is in fact very good on most reasonable surfaces money well spent,48,9
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,I have had the v400 for about a week now and I am generally pretty happy with it the ergonomic design fits my hand well and the rubber grips make it easy to hold the addition of the back / forward buttons is nice although their placement means that you need to use your index finger to use them another minor complaint is that they are not two separate buttons rather the two buttons are part of a single rocker that tilts back and forth making it slightly more cumbersome to use that said I am happy they are there at all as most notebook / travel mice I have looked at do not have these additional buttons aesthetics are subjective naturally but i prefer it is clean simple lines to microsofts blobby I shall-defined but otherwise comfortable notebook mice regarding tracking I have noticed that the v400 is stymied by darker surfaces and textures dark wood and granite are two surfaces where it seems to get easily confused however on lighter surfaces the majority of the surfaces i use tracking is flawless i docked a star from the review because of this caveat not really the all-terrain performance as promised on the package,192,10
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,hi all i have both the v400 and the microsoft 6000 the v400 has many problems seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go the tracking is awfull constantly stopping and restarting the precision also is too bad is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse more if you try with cad applications any person even the basic pc user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism is true is a nice looking mouse i have many logitech products that are really good from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one this v400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had kinda disappointing I am uploading pictures of my mouse logitech v400 orange so if you want to have a mouse to look and show the v400 could be a museum object but if you want a extreme machine the microsoft 6000 is the one to go greetings sergio claver from lima peru,165,11
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,i tried using this mouse for several days thinking that i would get used to it i bought it because i liked the usb that snaps in i tend to lose things easily the extra buttons are a great feature i also thought the laser would give me better accuracy well I am not a fan the accuracy is not good compared to my cheapo logitech optical mouse the tracking is awful plus it is not very ergonomical my wrist started hurting after only 30 minutes i returned it,88,12
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,i do not use mice everyday instead preferring to use a drawing tablet mainly i use this mouse when with my laptop i am probably not a picky about mice as the other reviewers that said i have not had any real problems with this mouse it has worked great for day-to-day tasks and the extra buttons make it little nicer to navigate on the internet on the downside it is not a sensitive as i would like for detailed tasks like drawing and photo editing i do not think i would want this as my only mouse / input deviece considering the amount of graphic design work i do but it is great for word processing spreadsheets and web browsing for everything else I shall stick with the tablet on my desktop,126,13
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,i have the same problem others reviewers write down here before me a pitty i did not listen them before the accuracy is terrible awfull many times i move the mouse and the pointer star to move erraticaly or does not move at all no precision and do just the contrary that the add says all terrain i have many friends that have the microsoft mouse for notebook and they no have problems where i have the relatively good news is that with time if you play a little with the setup you reach an acceptable beahvior but nothing compared to a normal old logitech mouse eduardo,106,14
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i so satisfied on this product i think it is low price and high quality,15,0
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,this is a great inexpensive option as far as webcams go i have purchased others with more features and a higher price tag but find myself seldom using the extras this product does the basics and i think that is all that most people really need zero problems,47,1
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,picture is very grainy and running the camera often causes a two-second delay in chat audio on skype but it does a pretty decent job for the price the vendor inexplicably sent me the skype version which has a blue circle instead of a black one and the word skype on the package but no other obvious differences from the plain quickcam chat,63,2
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,my brother and i have video chatted over the past few months but his frame rates were very low and the video pixelated he has a cable modem so speed is not an issue so it was quite a shock when we video chatted yesterday evening his video was not only clear but streaming nicely with full motion and the built-in mic picked up his voice clearly the performance was annoyingly close to my expensive camcorder doing double-duty as a webcam he is not using bleedingequipment either a pentium iii e-machines with usb 10 ports if this camera can put some life back into that old goat then this webcam is pretty darn good,112,3
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i thought this would be an ok cam but it actually has a great quality and it comes with the earphone microphone it has been great,25,4
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i ordered this webcam the 12th it was a weekend it did not ship till the 16th which i figured was because i ordered on a weekend and vday today is the feb 17th and i got it within one day of shipping the quality on it is actually pretty good only thing that is wrong with me it has like a a second or half of a secondit seems but it is not a big deal i payed 499 and free shipping for my webcam so i did not expect it to b this good,101,5
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,if you want a really clear picture do not buy this but if you want a basic web cam and just are using it once in awhile go with it otherwise buy something more updated,31,6
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this camera was a very contraversial one i bought 2 cameras one for me and the other for my boyfriend and my camera and mic worked perfectly fine but my boyfriends did not his camera had a terriable quality i could barely see his face it was so blurry and his mic did not work at all i suggest you save your money and buy a better webcam,65,7
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,if you own a mac do not get this camera there are a lot of uvc compliant webcams these webcams will work on the usb network without a driver this is not one of them,35,8
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter so she could talk to my son while he was in iraq it certainly came quickly and was as promised she did not tell me she had any problems installing it so i know it was easy to do,45,9
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i just bought this web camera from this seller i can not get it to work well basically it was a rip off i had a very difficult time installing the program after that it started working but not the way it should the speakers and the camera part of it work but it was unclear and made myself look unusual but i just can not get the built in microphone to work do not buy this it is a waste of my money and now i can not even use it please i hope i convinced you not to buy it,99,10
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,the product shipped was not in a box just in a small plastic bag cd missing to download the webcam very poorly packaged thrown in a small bubble envelope may have been the reason why the cam did not function returned hopefully we got our refund,46,11
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,this is a great camera for the price now do not buy this camera if you are looking for high-definition video from it i have this camera just to be able to talk to family and friends out of state and out of the country it is reliable and provides the video i need to be able to see and talk with the people in my life you can not beat an under 20 camera with this quality do not forget about the reputation that logitech has I have been using their products for years and love every single one this camera comes with software that has some great features like low-light adjustment brightness contrast andif you need a great camera and a great price logitech quick cam chat,127,12
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,it says right on the f and box that it works with windows 2000 when i tried to install it it said please update system to xp i was so pissed this is a fraud product,35,13
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,this camera is a waste of money i got it because it says directly on the box that it works with windows live messanger do not know aim can not find webcam setup and yahoo messanger wrong i got this webcam to chat with my brother on yahoo meassanger and it will not even connect with yahoo i tryed the help that yahoo suggested and nothing do not bother wasting your time on this even if you just want to make videos with it because unless you get perfect lighting the video is grainy as he shall and often eather way too dark or way blown out crap crap crap I am dead serious this is a waste of money,112,14
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,the cameria it is self was good the mic that cam with it it is not good have hard time working,19,15
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,i would do a video review except the microphone that comes with the damned thing does not work compound tht with the fact it has super low resolution and is ghosts horribly and this camera just is not worth your time the only thing preventing me from rating this one star is the ridiculously quick and easy installation,56,16
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,the title says it all if you want a cheap camera for video chat then this is a camera and it is cheap but the quality is not very good at all also does not pick up well at night in a lit room i often resorted to getting a desk lamp next to me i got this cam to work on mac os x,65,17
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,the camera works so well gives clear and non fuzzy image and has perfect light controls,16,18
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,easy to setup easy to use i got what i expected get skype,13,19
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,as with most things this webcam proved to be worth what i payed for it which was not very much it is decent for using with a messenger just to talk to someone with but i would never rely on it as a camera for photos it is an ok webcam nothing special but it works,55,20
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i bought this webcam about 7months ago but rarely used it initially it was working fine but i do not know what happened i dint even drop it or mishandle it the picture quality is horrible i do not even bother using it anymore i paid 27 for this piece of junk total waste of money,47,21
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,the video quality is nowhere near what i expected and i am disapointed enough to return it it is got a good swivel and that is about it the content that comes with it is so-so and the headset is pretty minimal,40,22
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,this camera produces a poor image that is grainy and hasproblems even in decent light the picture is much worse than images from the logitech quickcam for notebooks in the same light i am returning my quickcam chat but keeping the quickcam for notebooks,46,23
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,the quality is as advertised and there are drivers available to get this to work with a mac although you have to pay ten dollars for them,27,24
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this was one of the worst cams i have ever purchased since learned my lesson going to save up for one of those digital handheld camcorders instead with better resolution and megapixels this was aweful the picture was grainy horrible experience would not buy another i use them mostly to do my expotv product reviews this was not working for what i wanted it for so i am saving up to someday get a aiptek digital handheld camcorder or one of those flip ones instead this is okay maybe for yahoo messenger if that i definitly like my creative live one better my other logitech which was the quick cam I am messenger or something the gray one my boyfriend gave me worked alot better had better resolution this one would not recommend it get what you pay for kind of a thing,140,25
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,easy to use and worked perfectly i was pleased at how rapidly it was sent highly recommend it especially at the very reasonable price,24,26
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,logitech quickcam chat this product performs as stated easy set-up immediate results and you are on-line you can chat on various sites such as aim my space and more i love it,34,27
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,2.0,negative,this one is just not up to par i have a logitech camera with built-in mic that is in the 50 range and got this for my office the room-light picture is far less competent and the camera ghosted pretty badly I have traded it in for one with a better picture and am much happier i recommend as temptimg as it is to save money if you want to use a camera inside for sype-ing or something similar that you got for a camera a bit more competent than this even although it means spending a few more dollars,99,28
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i already have 2 webcam of logitech i bot this one for my friend have used this product for past couple of months it is really great good deal reasonable price branded company you can not expect much for this price if u r not brand oriented then u cud look out for something else but brand n reasonable price compared to others this is the deal u shud be looking for,61,29
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,that is right december 31st 2007 right after work 7ish i was rambling through this mess in my computer desk thing and i found the disc that i had missed since my mom threw it away I am so happy but one thing leaves me puzzled and it has nothing to do with the device itself per se it has a 3/5 rating why this magnificent thing does it all audio and video online yahoo aim and msn still pictures are great with proper lighting my room has little lighting so i needed a second source quick capture shading hues video mute I have been using it for one day not even and i know it is early but this thing has endless possibilities it was about as expensive at wal-mart then as it is here looks b if it was black or gold it would be an a or a respectively features a re-check all it offers price a 475 stars overall a i will adjust the score as i use video and shading i also boosted the rating from 3 stars to 3 1/2,185,30
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i bought this webcam tried it once and packed it neatly back in the box for return it has good light that is about it for me the quality is very fuzzy and the speed is far from quick it is more like still images moving slowly i was not happy with this product and surprised because it is made by logitech i strongly suggest trying another logitech webcam not this one,67,31
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,those who say this camera is great obviously have no standards whatsoever all you get from from this camera is choppy blurry grainy dark and poorly colored video if i did not know it was me on the screen i would not be able to recognize me it is without a doubt the worst camera I have ever bought in fact so bad that even my kids will not use it for fear of being laughed at by their friends,76,32
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,guess those who say the webcam is good are first timers this webcam is just too blurry and get worse under low lighting conditions thesays it is 640 x 480 pixels that is wrong the best is 320 x 240 even that is not clear the grainy image is enough to spoil your day one of the worst logitech products do not even know why it is sold in the it stores this should be contraband from the it world real big flop real big flop it is lesss than 1/5,87,33
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,i looked for the cheapest thing on the market and it works just as great as any of the 100 cameras good product,23,34
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,i just bought it and checked it out it is horrible apparently there is no such thing as a free lunch it is cheap for a reason the picture is grainier than the videos of bigfoot,35,35
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,small and cute it is cable length is long enough to be put at some distance away this works with mac,20,36
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,as a linux user I have all too often run into poor hardware support from vendors who only know of or support ms windows so it was with some trepidation that i recently looked for a reasonably priced webcam when i saw the logitech quickcam chat i figured it was hard to go too far wrong for the price but as it turns out i was pleasantly surprised to find that it works fairly nicely and it was surprisingly little fuss to set up i merely followed the instructions in the suse webcam wiki at [ ] and i was up and running in a few minutes chatting with kopete on a yahoo connection to a friend in another state i rate it at 4 stars only because the quality of the images is not as good as it could be but for a cheap webcam it is perfectly acceptable,148,37
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,it is pretty good quality easy to set up and use but you get what you pay for the video quality is pretty good and it adjusts to my indoor lighting pretty well sometimes i have to shine some light on myself but usually it is no different than when I am doing homework i do not really use the microphone because i already have one that is probably better hoever i do have one issue the focus on the camera is manual so you have to adjust it yourself it is fine when you are just going to talk at the desk and usually just sit there but if you want to move around and show things it will be a major pain but i guess it is good for what you pay for sometimes the light indicating that it is on will stay on all the time but that is usually on start up once you open a program that would use the video like skype it will turn off after you are done all in all good value and does just fine for video chatting easy to clip onto the laptop even if it is not the most secure but it is not like i move the laptop around everywhere while I am talking,204,38
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,i bought it used a couple days ago and just received it let me tell you it is better than most first of all it is logitech that says alot also it is clip is very unique can be put on laptops pcs even end of tables or anything where it holds at an angle,52,39
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this outdated camera yes you are visible with this camera but the quality is so poor grainy and blurry it made the whole experience quite disappointing spend a little more for a better product,39,40
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,1.0,negative,super noisy unaccpetable viedo quality worse than built in camera of my laptop,13,41
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,nice cam for the price i got a better picture quality than i expected,14,42
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,very easy to install as you can select to either install logitech software or just the drivers i went by the second options as my wife and i keep linked by skype whenever she has on a business trip even the video quality is not a wow i think it accomplish the purpose of see your other call party for what you pay,62,43
Electronics,B000FU0XAW,5.0,positive,when i ordered this webcam i never know it would be so easy to install and use plus the clear images pictures and videos are great now I am enjoying my pc more than before the mic and headphone are so great and helpful too awsome,44,44
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,there has a reason this is 30 cheaper than the neuros mpeg4 recorder 2 plus it does not work as well i originally tried to save a few bucks and grabbed a v-mate but it went back after every recording had a squiggly white line on the top of the image and the quality just was not up to snuff upgraded to the neuros and have been very happy,67,0
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated especially with fast action sports like football and basketball the sandisk does have a better interface and is easier to understand and set up quickly but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor fyi I am using a psp as my viewer,74,1
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,nice compact box and recording quality better than i expected one major flaw although no preview when recording 640x480 resolution just a black screen with rec in the top corner dropping back to 320x240 resolution does not help this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display a real shame i love the concept but the lack of preview is a real problem technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it I shall keep my fingers crossed but do not have high expectations,90,2
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,this is nearly the best thing since pre-sliced bagels i bought this after i purchased another unit from yahoo before i came upon this little jewel what this has over the other model is that there is on screen programming and video recording options i purchased this to supplement my psp and new sony-ericsson w850i phone it works like a charm not only was it a snap to integrate with my set top box but the recoring options ie bitrate protocol and more give you the opportunity to record for any phone that you may own or your psp or whatever will play a list of a / v formats what i love about the unit is that you can record off of your tv or dvd player in the exact format that fits your playback device my sony phone works well with 3gpp so that is what i just recorded 8 below in and wow there has no stuttering or pixelation it is great what can i say i found another gem in my quest for entertainment freedom any questions please email me,176,3
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i had been going nuts trying to find a way to utilize the video features on my psp and sandisk sansa without becoming an it engineer or a getting involved in bittorrent and risking a raid or a subpoena for illicit file-sharing this was the perfect solution as it is incredibly easy to use and the results are immediate if you have a similar product it is well worth it as you do not have to mess with trying to figure out which content providers can provide video content that you actually want without paying fees or worrying if the licensing software will allow you transfers i have no interest in file-sharing and more i just wanted content i liked the ability to copy my dvds for my own use on my portable electronics is a big big big plus,137,4
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,pretty good video quality although i must say the setup was a little tricky not for the novice also you have to update the unit with the latest drivers from the sandisk website overall a good buy,38,5
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,is nobody else having the same problem with this device as me this worthless piece of garbage does not respond to the remote half the time it refuses to stop recording and it damages the sd cards,36,6
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,very different from the traditional recorder but you can set the output signal to match certain devices like psp i record tv for my psp all the time you can also set it for phone and the like the sandisk recorder can also use several different memory cards very cool device and works on it is own i highly recommend for psp owners especially,63,7
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,i ordered this to do exactly what it said it would do and it does it you can record from any a / v source even those oldtapes with copy protection straight to an sd card the only drawback is lack of choice for recording file type it would be nice to have mpg2 or avi as choices especially if you want to burn your results to dvd the sheer ease of capture in a single portable device that doubles as a card reader is like having an old school field recorder in your pocket no computer no drivers no expensive video cards no hassle just click to record,109,8
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,sandisk definitely had the rightwith this straight to media memory recorder unfortunately this is either an early model or they missed the boat the remote is hit or miss and selects twice per click most of the time starting the recording works well but you can not stop it so unless you have a small memory card and want to take everything until full which is when it will stop recording automatically then this is not the unit for you i hope sandisk has an upgraded model because this would be great if it could be controlled like a video recorder should be the price was right and it was worth a try but this model is not worth even the cheap price,124,9
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,unit is a great replacement for a vcr plus has better advantages i use with 16 gb sdhc card and yes it works originally purchased to use as an auto dvr for my car but it will not continuous record without having to delete recordings so i set 8 daily scheduled recording to repeat then just delete smaller files every so often nice unit and does what it says it will good quality and so small too nice unit and very inexpensive,80,10
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i use this to record my favorite tv shows onto my psp for less than 30 you can not beat the portability and convenience,23,11
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,i purchased this unit to record our church services from the output of a multi-camera switcher it instantly gives us a file that is ready to post on the internet each week of course there are other ways to do this but being able to hit stop and instantly have a file ready is a tremendous time-saver the quality is everything we need for a web video posting i have a second unit at home for time delaying tv shows from a set-top box the home unit has some issues responding to the remote control but continues to work once i have the recordings i can play them back from this box or from other tvs in my house connected to a media player another use i have found for this box is making recordings for my itouch i would really like to have a unit such as this that encodes a component hd signal with h264 compression,157,12
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,we bought this figuring it would be a great option to a subscription dvr if it worked we did not expect much especially after reading the reviews we were pleasantly surprised it works much better than expected and the picture quality is great recording at highest quality works great on a 19inch tv and while not crystal clear on a large 27 tv it is good enough to watch a recorded show i would not call it hd but it is just as good as my still kodak camera takes video or even my flip video camera the remote is not great in fact it was almost impossible to use at first i than did some research and found a forum suggesting the obvious replace the battery made a huge difference i just ordered a 4 gb sd card and this is going to get a lot of use in my house,150,13
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,best video recording device you could ask for the best quality and ease of use of any tv recorder for the psp,22,14
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,the device arrived promptly and undamaged that is all the good news after reading the product instructions i realized this device would not do what i wanted i have several sony semi-pro mini dv cameras with worn out tape drives i am looking for a way to use them with an inexpensive pvr that records to avc / h264 format which this one does not i connected the device to my video system for the test run it came on but would not respond to any command from the remote it has no input method other than the remote i tested the battery and it was dead i bought a new battery and it sometimes works sometimes does not the remote is really cheaply made without true buttons and sometimes takes multiple tries to get a response in a video shoot struggling to get your recorder on is a nightmare the product pamphlet suggests going to a sandisk address online for firmware updates they do not exist the product is out of production and unsupported amazon authorized return for refund but save the headache and do not buy this one,186,15
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,for the price this is an amazing little device and it does just what it says it will do it is targeted at creating video for mobile devices so if you are expecting to watch the results on hdtv you may be disappointed in the image quality i bought it so that my daughter could add video content to her ipod and it is been great for that I have also created videos for my phone the video even looks pretty good on a pc in it is high quality mode you can record almost 4 hours of video to a 2 gb memory card you can not expect dvd quality the clunky part is the remote all record functions are through the remote so you have to use it unfortunately it is one of the worst remotes I have ever used you have to hold it in exactly the right position to get it to respond still you get what you pay for when you consider what this device allows you to do it is a great value and very cool,176,16
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i do not understand some of the bad reviews for the sandisk v-mate are they expecting hd quality or something i took a chance and recently bought thisand absolutely love it the firmware on it was the old version so before i even tried to use it i downloaded and installed the latest firmware update version vmate 0207wwb8 and it works fantastic [ ] then all is hooked up to my tv i use the av-switch on my tv set up so that i can easily switch from my vcr / dvd player or switch to the sandisk v-mate the sandisk v-mate records really decent video onto my sd and sdhc card after recording i can then play it via the sandisk v-mate and watch it on my tv or i can take out the sd card and play it on my pc or other devices that except sd / sdhc cards [ ] i really love this sandisk v-mate fun and so easy to use obviously it is easy to set up if i can do it and it offers various recording quality and video formats that you can choose from,185,17
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,unfortunately after i hooked up the sandisk sdmv1-r v-mate when i tried to set up the v-mate the response between the remote and the v-mate was very poor i was not able to complete the setup however the company that sold the sandisk v-mate through amazon com adorama camera has excellent customer service and they allowed me to return the opened v-mate because it was not really operable i would not purchase the sandisk v-mate again however i would purchase from adorama camera again with confidence,86,18
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,thiswas a junk remote never work right and it kept eating cards not worth a dollar,18,19
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,we needed a digital video recorder to be used on our racetruck something that could handled hard vibrations and it did the quality is great for youtube easy to use easy to setup here is a small clip recorded with this vmate [ ],43,20
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i ordered the sandisk sdmv1-r v-mate video memory card recorder through the request of my son we placed the order on a friday and received the recorder on the following monday very surprised the recorder came withbyinstruction and my son had it working within a matter of minute it is way cool he is able to save tv shows on his sim card for his cell phone psp and more what amazed me was the low price for anthat does so much i very much recommend this product to anyone that is looking for this type ofsincerely k mathews jackson ga,106,21
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,what could be more simple a vcr equivalent that records to sd cards instead oftape unfortunately this product lives up to what can be expected from most everything made in china installation was easy but set-up was impossible because the remote control behaved erratically controlling the tv set-up screens none of the ir emitter codes worked reliably turning the my satellite receiver on and off after struggling with it for about an hour i put everything back in the blister-pak and shipped it back to the mail-order place i ordered it from a huge disappointment from the largest manufacturer sandisk of memory cards i conclude this product was designed developed and manufactured in china and marketed under sandisks label do not waste your time and money on this device,130,22
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,I have followed the sandisk web instruction but there was nothing like would you like to upgrade your firmware by the way my firmware is 0113en and i could not catch any video from tv what has going on please help,38,23
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,do not expect too much from this device the output is very grainy if recording fromthe picture will be blocky because it will not deinterlace the picture also i had a lot of issues with the remote it is very slow to respond and sometimes it took several key presses to work,53,24
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i received thefrom them on time but only a couple of weeks after getting it it stopped working i had only used it once,26,25
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,would like to return but supplier will not answer and therefore will not supply a return authorization or is delaying to get out of the return allowable time,28,26
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,this product was a huge disappointment i was so excited to finally get a device like this that recorded video directly to flash media i read the reviews and knew the video quality was not that great but i was still expecting better than grainy cellphone-type footage this is even although i had it set to the highest quality video setting i also wish i had read the technical specifications more closely i thought this device was supposed to be able to replace a vcr but it can not connect to an antennae of any type so you still need a separate video source that is a vcr which almost totally defeats the purpose of getting this device at all i knew there were going to be problems when i saw that the only video connections were mini-stereo plug ports on the back no s-video no-coaxial not even rca on top of that the tiny remote is incredibly frustrating to use i only spent 40 on this but even at that low price this device was complete and total garbage sandisk should be ashamed for letting this product come out to market,190,27
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,first off the battery was dead when i received it very confusing to work if you unplug it you have to reset the clock has to playback in quicktime only it sux,32,28
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,cool that is the best definition of this gadget makes it alot easier to capture video to ipod good product with quick shipping,22,29
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i had good expectations for this product but it let me down the fact that it has no buttons forces you to use the remote which has to be pointed directly at the box at about to inches in distance but i do not mind the defects above what really got me mad was that i had to press every single button about 20 times until it finally picked up the signal it was not a battery problem because i changed them and one day i wanted to record a show and it took me ten minutes of pushing the on button to make it work so i got sick and frustrated grabbed a screw driver and ripped the remote in two now i have no remote which means no v-mate what a good way to spend 60,137,30
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,i think having purchased a second one speaks for itself while dressing at 5 am i can record the morning news on a sd micro memory card and watch the news one hour later on the train no conversions are necessary you can record from a camcorder a dvd player movies or cable tv and watch it immediately i watch my recordings on a sandisk sansa view mp3 player however i have also used it on my lg phone it also works fine on any tv using a resolution of 640 x 480 320 x 280 and lower resolutions for internet purposes,102,31
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,I have been using my scandisk v-mate for about two weeks and so far it has performed as i expected which is good I am satisfied with the performance sometimes it is slow to respond to the remote but for this price i did not expect perfection or studio quality video it does pretty much play back the same quality video that was it received to record tv playback is better than on a computer but i do not believe it was really meant for computer playback I am very satisfied with this product I am still trying to think of ways to use my v-mate,101,32
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,greatbut picture resembles watching oldtapes there is also no caption option hope they are working on a better version,23,33
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,i thought i was going to be receiving a cheap easy to use recorder but the sandisk recorder never worked for me the remote is awful and you need to plug in the ir emitter yourself luckily it was only seventy bucks but i would not recommend it because of mine not even working goodbad product,59,34
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,purchasing through amazon was initiated by me my boss ordered this product in the past direct from the manufacturer when purchasing direct from the manufacturer he paid alot more for both the product and for shipping now he has learned amazon is the way to shop,46,35
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,after recording a tv show and inserted the card into my treo 700p there was no program on the treo that would play the show sandisk customer service did not respond when i inquired about what program would play the show i found some freeware core media player and loaded it on the treo this allowed me to see the video but the sound was choppy and could not listen to it i went back to customer support still no response it is going back unless there is a program to view / listen on my treo,93,36
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,purchased to look at short low quality video clips the device seems like it will do that but the image quality on a 20inch tv is horrible on my 24inch screen it is just fine do not even think of buying this if you want to look at the video on a bigger than 12inch screen system will pass through the video for your source so it is very easy to use takes some getting used to the remote there are no button on the device so do not lose the remote,91,37
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,product was easy to use handy device to record video for use on a mobile device i would highly recommend it,21,38
Electronics,B000IN72KK,1.0,negative,the quality of the recording was very bad little squares showed up all the time and in dramatic scene changes the whole screen was transitioning little squares like it could just not keep up with the speed i would defintely not buy it again,44,39
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,the great thing about this is that if you have ever strugged with ear-buds or something similar you will never have to do so again i have basically forgotten that these are in my helmet the setup is seamless the wires fit perfectly under the padding in most helmets and the female connect is then attatched with velcro to the underside lip on the side of your helmet so when not in use you really do not notice it when you need it reach up and connect your music male connector piece of cake the only downside is that it is not very loud at it is loudest setting with my mp3 player not sure if that is a fuction of the speakers or the player it is loud enough to enjoy although,125,0
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,really excited when i found this product and after installing in my helmet i wish i had never seen it volume is pure garbage i have tried multiple input methods phone input bluetooth amplifier input direct amplifier input even at non-interfering road noise the volume of these speakers is not hear-able in a helmet buy a real helmet speaker system even although these are priced right the money is wasted,70,1
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,the headset failed within a few weeks and the only way to make it work now is to get the jacks situated in the right place and even then the smallest bump knocks it out the speakers were also barely loud enough to be heard over wind noise at 45 mph,51,2
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,works for what i needed them for just temporary fix till i can afford a bluetooth setup for my helmet,20,3
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,excelente for control of volumen and the confortable for my ears so only need a microphone it is good product i recommend,21,4
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,work great i highly recommend this product the hounding of giving a review and how many words i gave to type not so much,24,5
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,it barely works i can barely hear sound in my room i can not imagine hearing anything when I am on the road with the wind,24,6
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,it fit my helmet like i wanted but the volume sucks i turned the volume wide open with out being in my helmet and could barely hear it i put them in my helmet starter my bike and could not hear at all with volume as loud as it would go i guess this is what i get for going cheep,61,7
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i can not say anything about the performance of this product because i never installed it in my helmet i did not care for the look of the speakers so i did not bother to install them,34,8
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,these work well and i can hear my music when turned all the way up but i ride a highway scooter it is not very loud i wish i would have gotten the higher priced ones that said they were twice as loud,42,9
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a viable solution for having a comfortable in-helmet speaker that i can use with my radar detector on my motorcycle i experimented with various ear butts that only caused discomfort especially while planting / removing the helmet I am very happy with this system since it has a volume control and disconnect and does not put undue pressure on my ears,63,10
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i thought that i would be able to ride on the highway while listening to some tunes from the ipod that is not happening with these you are better offer using regular ipod headphones or investing in a bluetooth helmet like i did waste of money volume is too low can not hear even when the bike is off,57,11
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,there are way better ones out there that you mold yourself for forty five bucks search for fuze custom headphones use them on my bike and they are awesome with very little background noise,34,12
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,sounds great to me but stay under 70 mph and it is your player not the speakers,16,13
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,they fit nicely in my helmet they are not very loud but you can get a booster / splitter and you and tour passenger can enjoy the music,25,14
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,i tried these with my mp3 player all the way up with a boostaroo headphone amplifier and the volume on the speakers all the way up inside a closed full face hjc helmet still could not hear much of anything i was sitting still on my 500cc aprilia scooter probably the quietest motorcycle out there I am far from deaf and my 10 sony over the ear sporty buds are pristine under the same conditions save your time and money and head to walmart I am mailing them back tomorrow the boostaroo does help with regular earphones / buds to get over the bike and wind noise,102,15
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i agree with many of the other reviewers definitly not loud enough i tried them with my ipod and my garmin neither was loud enough i had to go with in ear phones,34,16
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,1.0,negative,what a waste of money you can not hear the music over the road noise get a speaker with a booster if you want to listen to your music on the road,31,17
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,4.0,positive,have over 12000 motorcycle miles wearing these most recently on a trip through canada and alaska i use mine with my ipod and they work great especially at speeds below about 70 mph if you spend a good deal of time above that speed you may want to upgrade to the hs24 iasus speakersxsound 2 high end motorcycle helmet speakers these are priced ridiculously low they are very easy to install very comfortable and have their own volume control which is very handy especially if your mp3 is in your jacket pocket or motorcycle tank bag,99,18
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i tried these with my creative zen sleek photo mp3 player in a 3/4 jhc helmet and they do not get loud enuff to hear adequately standing in the driveway never mind on the road the rated impedance seems low enough maybe the drivers are inefficient / lack sensitivity i tried plugging them into the headphone output of my yamaha yst 21 computer speakers and with the volume knob cranked up they do get loud and sound pretty good most portable devices probably will not have sufficient output to drive them properly for their intended use,94,19
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,2.0,negative,i like the size and ease of placement in the helmet however i can hardly hear it when riding i do not even have that loud of a motorcycle ducati st4s it is more of a back ground music than anything,39,20
Electronics,B000K5IZUW,5.0,positive,i bought these for my ski helmet i could not find anything else and thought i could make these work i was right they fit in my helmet a giro 540 almost perfectly and sound better than i expected i looked at the various ski helmet manufacturers and the stuff they have only works in certain models and is more expensive these work well and should work in just about any helmet well worth the price i would think they could sell a lot more of them if they broadened the subject beyond motorcycles,94,21
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,warning do not buy these radios i have alot of experience with two way radios i live and work in the mountains of montana and i know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios I have had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers anyway i feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking it is slight but very noticable with regular use i feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can not be certain in addition the sound of the audio is horrible i was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply is not worth it the sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe motorola should recall this product it a serious dissapointment from a company who has name typically means quality these may be the worst radios i have ever owned sorry folks this pair of radios are not worth the box they are shipped in,194,0
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,the product worked but only about 500 yards this may be due to trees and more i suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation,27,1
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,the ordering and shipping on this product was super fast i received it a few days after ordering like the product plan on using it for outdoor activities would recommend this product and it is cheaper than i saw advertised anywhere else,42,2
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios it was frequently very difficult / impossible to understand what the other person was saying confirmed in both directions this was not an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such simply it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded i have an fcc license and have owned numerous motorola radios over the years this set was a real disappointment a radio that can ideally communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can not understand what the other person is saying even from a very short distance away furthermore the housing of these radios lacks durability the rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone just cheap-feeling plastic now,128,3
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,the motorola 9500 was strongly recommended however the set that i received turned out to be a piece of junk very poor voice clarity and quality we depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor to the point of just not using them which put us in a very unsafe position at times i did call motorola and was informed that i was past the warranty time and they would do nothing my recommendation is to buy a set of midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators,108,4
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this is the first pair of two-way radios i have used they work very well voice is clear i tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user we kept talking until the signal began to break up which was about 7 miles your mileage may vary this was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees these units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation,74,5
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,used the motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip great communications with day long battery life and swapping in aa batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions great radios a good buy at a great price,42,6
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,product is extremely easy to use used while on vacation in the islands on a cruise it is an ideal method for communiction when you are with large parties clarity is not bad but not great worked better in open areas,40,7
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,this radio has adequate power and the audio to get out i highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors rather than weak 5 watt frs radios i found them larger than many in this class and a bit under powered at only 2 watts maximum but ok however it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the remanufactured sale list quite often i suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on or it could be something else if lots get returned and resold it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process in any case buy with caution,118,8
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,despacho eficiente y en los tiempos de entrega considerados en cuanto al producto es un buen juguete para los nios tiene sus limitaciones en alcance,25,9
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,pros used with other motorolla and non motorolla radios and the sound quality was good battery holds charge for several days in normal use cons 25 mile range is bizarre because the most that i got was about a mile and a half,43,10
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,it is a great product especially for the price amazon offers it for stores sell the same two way radio for the same price but does not have the 25 mile capability it was a great deal,37,11
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i have not tested these for their full 25 mile range but they seem to work well enough around the office complex and at the park the 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right i might have actually gotten more than two miles but i also live in los angeles where we do not have very many tall buildings overall they work well enough for casual use but i would not consider them for more critical applications,83,12
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i have not had much chance to use it as i purchased it for use as an emergency preparedness block captain in my city we have practiced using it but i will not really know until a disaster of some type happens i am pleased to have it for that purpose,51,13
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,despite the problems some other reviewers have reported i have not seen them myself the radios could be more durable but for the money they seem like a good value some friends of mine recently took them beach camping and said they had no trouble with the signal although the users were never more than a few miles away from each other the kids liked the interchangeable covers,67,14
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,the motorola t9500xlr seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment once out of the packaging the 2 units are charged via a cradle i have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well first off keep in mind these are not professional level radios they are merely entry level units for home and family use they are ideal for road caravans amusement parks shopping malls cruise ships and more as other reviewers have mentioned the voice over the speaker is tinny and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible the range is definitely nowhere near the claimed 25 miles in a typical setting you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country just remember these radios cost around 50 for the pair and you simply can not expect professional quality at this price point the noaa radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle overall i wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature,182,15
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,this is my second pair of two-way radios the first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise wind staticbut this pair worked much better and was clearer we used them for two days my son and i to try them out at the beach at home and at a big park once we found the right channels they worked perfectly all places i did try to test the distances difficult while walking but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine there was a bit a static at the beach but not too much they are not as clear as your cell phone but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child they will work fine,129,16
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,although the radios had some good features the bad sound quality trumped all of them i had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad even at close range i do not know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing there are other radios for under 10000 that work much much better i just returned the t9500xlrs,75,17
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,these radios have worked well for what i use them for and they keep there charge not more buying batteries they work well,23,18
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,got these so that we can tell our 9yo to come home works with other brands too uniden for sure so he can also communicate with his friends who have other brands while they are playing,35,19
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,for all of the features and capability they put into these radios motorola forgot one key element sound quality other reviews that mention can not understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away are not referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers with only a passing knowledge of audio electronics it would seem that motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker as the sound is very clipped sounding and horribly distorted they could also use a modest compressor on the input as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker for a radio that is marketed as a family product they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk after 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it i still could not get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out these are getting returned unfortunately as they seem to have all the features i want we will try again with midland i think,183,20
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i love these walkie talkies the sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand i have not had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees,51,21
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,motorola has done it again these radios work excellent and i would not buy anything else,15,22
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,do not buy the motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection even with the vibrate alarm our employees were often missing talk requests with the clip on speaker and microphone the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier the radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back,80,23
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,the original units would not work right i called morotola and they said those were the deffective ones they sent me new ones that work just fine i sent the old ones back so they could experiment on them motorola provided post paid return envelope a good final experience it pays to go with a name brand that has service department and cares about their customers,64,24
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this is the second pair of radios i buy so that each member of my family has one products works very well and is very useful for our family vacations both at the beach and at the mountains,38,25
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,wow what junk these worked fine for about two weeks then worked intermittently and are now dead now comes the hassle of sending them back to motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones these never should have made it off the drawing board,49,26
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,after owning 2-way frs / gmrs radios by bellsouth cobra and motorola motorola radios were always the highest quality they may not have been the best in every area but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked the last 3 models I have owned have all been motorola i purchased the t9500xlr their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio the other day to replace my t4900s i was appalled at them the sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older cheaper t4900s and worse yet the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually at any range and at any transmit power whether in the next room or half a mile away the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out no settings affected this i ordered a pair of midland gxt710vp3 radios instead they are way better they are what the t9500xlrs should be,147,27
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i purchased these to replace my aging t7200s but there is no comparison the 7200s are far better the 9500xlr have very poor sound quality very tinny like talking in a can the volume does not go high enough and the reception is poor i spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately i am happy to say that amazon accepted my return do not make the same mistake i did look for a different model,84,28
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this has been very useful not just for fun but at remote locations of work related business i would suggest easier menu layout the ability to silence ptt confirmation better clip design recommended overall best buy considering what is out there,41,29
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,do not like thisdo well to get 2 mile range can not understand what other person says 1/2 mile away,20,30
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,we bought these for christmas and they were hours of fun the entire week afterwards the boys especially love to use them for air-soft wars because you can wear earphones with them and turn them on vibrate the only complaint we have is that they do not seem to work long-range we had them on vacation took one for a drive in the car and left another at home we lost contact in about 1/2 mile i will say that we did not play around with that feature too much so maybe there is something we could have done to get a longer signal do not know but they are great fun for around the neighborhood,116,31
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,the audio quality is really poor compared to other manufacturers you can not understand other users even over quite short distances and this not helped when the signal keeps dropping in and out whatever you do do not be beguiled by the motorola name and do not expect any support from motorola regarding this problem they will not do anything about these poor quality products i complained to the uk and united states offices of motorola and both fobbed me off i have some really cheap uniden radios which have a superb sound compared to these you can expect better quality from two tin cans and a length of string than motorolas t9500xlr radios,116,32
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,i got these radios because i own two talkabout t5950s i figured that i would upgrade to a newer better model was i wrong they do transmit farther than my prevous model but you can not understand what is being said i am a loyal motorola fan but they had betterup the qaulity i will be returning these radios and i will go back to the old stand-by for another year,72,33
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,this was a real bad decision when people say it all in the name they do not mean motorola t9500r,19,34
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,great price and loaded with man features hard to imagine not going with motorola,14,35
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,these radios are the worst you can not hear anything it does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet they look nice but that about covers it i have nowhy they are still being sold and have not had a recall on the up side i called motorola and they are aware of the problem they are sending me new ones and a different better model they are also sending me return postage so i can send them these awful things back i will let you know how the new ones are,101,36
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,purchased two twin packs of the t9500r radio and the sound quality is so poor they are absolutely useless for transmitting i can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios do not purchase,40,37
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,i bought these because the mini club i drive with use 2-way radios for communication the came with headsets and either with or without them it was almost impossible to hear what people were saying range was poor too save your money and buy something cheaper these just do not live up to their claims,54,38
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,they work well are a relative bargain and are nice and small the preferred radio for mt biking,18,39
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations until now I have been very happy with many different motorola and midland models the t9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable,40,40
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,we use 6 8 handheld radios at our business to communicate across multiple floors and buildings we have gone through two generations of motorola talkabouts with this line being the third these are the worst of them all the last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad with several ceasing to work within days of purchase and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up of the 6 we purchased 5 did not have adequate sound transmission cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all these are junk do not waste your money my one star is because they are attractive to look at,116,41
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them the voice clarity does not exist no one is able to understand anyone it cuts out sporadically i would say that the distance is terrible also but i can not tell if the radio is cutting out or i just can not understand anyone called moto and they actually confirm that there is a problem with this and another new model they recommended that i get the sx800r model at first they would not even take it back oh the noaa channels are great and clear design is also good,103,42
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,wow have walkie-talkies changed in four years these are packed with some pretty sophisticated features including noaa weather alert and are very user-friendly strongly recommend,25,43
Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,as many people have noted the audio quality of these radios is terrible i also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when i had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again,44,44
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,unfortunately microphone started giving trouble shortly after i began to use intermittent cutting out and muffled sound or no sound at all earphones sounded good although too bad i needed them to use with skype returnedthe return process through amazon was the easiest and fastest i have ever used for internet purchases amazon is favorite place to shop,60,0
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,4.0,positive,they are cheap for a reason my first pair lasted only about 4 months but they do what they are needed to do,21,1
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,supplied with a 10 cord with one 35 mm stereo headphone plug and one 35 mm mono mic plug and a stereo and mono 63 mm plug adapter for each,28,2
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,4.0,positive,not the greatest headset in the world but i doubt you can find one better for this price exactly what i was looking for cheap and good,27,3
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,the mic boom did not work good the headphones sound ok,9,4
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,i expected good quality from koss and these headphones deliver i got them because my daughter thinks she wants to be a dj my new laptop does not have a mic input so i can not say anything about the mic,40,5
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,headsets work good but the mike was really weak i actually had to scream in it in order for it to work at all,25,6
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,headset wiring seems wrong the stereo connector has the microphone also in it i used adapters to hook up the microphone to a 1/4 mike input on a pa system mono plug on nady and to a headphone out 1/4 trs jack stereo plug on nady this is not rocket science but after trying all sorts of adapters i could not properly use headphones and mike at the same time too late to send back for a refund fortunately only 17 lost i do not recommend this is rare for me maybe it is just me doing something wrong it is not the on / off switch for the mike i hope this is the case let me know,113,7
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,yeah I have used a couple of these and what can i say if you compare them to anything else in this price range there has nothing better to choose from i use them as backjust in case something goes wrong mid-gig they have saved me more than once and that makes them well worth the price,55,8
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,arrived with some type of wire shortage cuts in and out just she shall out the couple extra clams for a better product,22,9
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,just send it i ordered over a week ago this is pee poor shipping speed,15,10
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,2.0,negative,this headset seemed pretty good at first then after a week of using it the mic quit working then the sound was bad not worth what i payed for,29,11
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,1.0,negative,i purchased these as a stopuntil we decided just how deep in equipment we wanted to go it was a big mistake the difference between buying these and throwing 20 out the window is someone might find the 20 and use it and you will not have to put up with these super cheap junk headphones do not buy these,62,12
Electronics,B000QGJRL6,5.0,positive,i love these headphones they have an inline volume control and an on / off switch for the microphone the sound quality on both the mic and the headset are great I had been using fairly cheap headsets for a long time and i will never go back to them these are perfect for any type of online audio application,57,13
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,this lens is either not very good or i just havnt figured out how to use it on my canon 20d does not make colorful pictures but hey it is a very economical lens,32,0
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,every thing works but the lens is very hard to use and pretty much impossible to use hand held it is not sharp i got better images from another lens at half the length blown up to the same size,40,1
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this was a good find for me i was looking to expand my equipment for my camera and this was a good one,23,2
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,the mirror lens was a high quality low cost alternative to a very heavy and very expensive conventional telephoto lens where you want an occasional lens this is a fantastic buy it is decidedly smaller and lighter than the conventional lens and it gives an excellent picture with a canon digital slr it should be remembered that the rebel series rd300 rd350 and rd400 have a smaller film size so that the 500 mm lens is nearer 800 mm on a film camers a truely huge lens,86,3
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,on a tripod you can get good pictures i often find myself using manual focus even with my af lenses so getting used to this lens was no problem at f/8 it is dark and at 500 mm it is shaky so get out your tripod and a remote or cable release and get to having some cheep long lens fun,60,4
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this is good but i have one questionhow can i use it on my canon slr camera do i need some tmound part,23,5
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i do not even think this lens deserves 1 star it is junk not sharp very hard focus do not waste your money,21,6
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,very nice lens for the price lens is solid and sturdy easy to use no communications with camera all settings must be manually set focusing is not bad just like any other lens that is manual using it on a canon 7d and very pleased,47,7
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i was excited to try this lens out and the magnification is pretty amazing but the focus just did not cut it even with a timer on a solid tripod and the reflex mirror in the up position canon t3i crisp pictures were not possible for me large objects might considered in reasonable focus but not people or animals even with the most subtle turn of the focus ring i can not find a reason to keep it,76,8
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i ordered a 500 mm mirror lens for my 60d canon cameras i got an adapter for a nikon and now i can not use the lens because it will not go on my camera i just spent little over 100 and i am very angry and i can not get the adapter off,51,9
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,this turned out to be a horrible purchase and a 100 thrown away i am so disappointed in this product i bought it to give it a try and the photos turned out to be grainy and just utter garbage it is hard to focus with this camera and to keep anything in focus i use a good tripod and a shutter release and i still get horrible photos another thing with this lens is that a ring on the outside of this device came undone i have to push it back to be able to focus it seemed it was glued on so if you are looking for a lens please pass this one up you will just waste your money do not go cheap on your lens and they should treat you right i am not sure if i can do anything about this lens but i plan on saving up and purchasing a better lens for my canon rebel t3,162,10
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i tested this lens extensively on a nikon d40x with tripod mount and self-timer set to eliminate vibration the resolution is poor at all settings use this lens if you want to take a series of fuzzy images that could not possibly be displayed in addition there is no option to control the aperture or depth of field,57,11
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,the lens is a small reflecting telescope cassegrain no aperture diaphragm fixed f/8 manual focus you will be able to take some interesting telephoto shots given the right conditions for the price of the opteka i have no complaints check prices on real 500 mm telephotos,45,12
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,very poor quality images images taken with this lens have a very low contrast the bokeh looks really weird never really seems to be in focus but that may be due to the poor contrast on a positive note it is very portable for a 500 mm,46,13
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i got the lens within a few days looks great and i can not wait to use it however i went to put it onto my camera and it will not attach very disappointing now i have to hope an adapter exists i have a canon eos xs which it should fit into,52,14
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,you can read all opinion it is cheap easy to handle and with a regular quality the only issue is you need a lot a lot of light,28,15
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,1.0,negative,i got this lens today and tried to shoot some pictures using tripod outdoors it is very difficult to focus even wioth tripod even after focusing my pictures came out soft this is not the lens for action pictures it is well built and hence is a great paper weight 47th photo which suppleid through amazon is charging 15 restocking fee for returning thisi decided to bite the bullet and return this,76,16
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,i bought this lens to have something beyond my 55 - 250 tele-lens similar to other reviewers i was not quite aware of the fact that I had buy a little telescope that said i am very happy with the solid barrel and the optical properties of the lens you will need to use some sort of support although best a tripod otherwise you will end up with blurred pictures i took some amazingly sharp and big images of the moon but due to the slow speed even a picture of venus will be blurred not to speak about faster moving stars the lens performs quite well in bright daylight but you do need to have a good tripod,115,17
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,5.0,positive,this is a cheap way to get a 500 mm telephoto lens for my canon t1i nice compromise until i can get a nice stabilized zoom lens that goes up to 500 mm,31,18
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,if you want a 500 mm lens you can spend 4 figures on a canon lens or you can buy one of these for less than 1/10 the price obviously you are going to get better results from the canon and if you want to sell your photos this is going to be useless it has not got any bells or whistles no autofocus no image stabilization so you are going to need a tripod too i would characterize the results from this lens as barely acceptable sometimes but still if you wanted to take professional style photos you were not going to get that from a 90 500 mm lens,105,19
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,i bought this lens when i first bought the camera i did not know any better it is a shame that good lens are so expensive but after a year of using the camera i think it is best to wait until you can aford a better lense i am a beginner at photography but without a stablizer built into the lens i can not get a clearly focused photo without a tripod also without auto focus it is only good for still shots jmho,84,20
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,i was a little naive in the purchasing of this lens i went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300 mm they all said the same thing there is no such thing if you go cheap you are wasting your money they were right i was extremely disappointed in this lens if you think you are going to freehand this without a tripod there is no possible way to do it if you set it up against something stationary it is still going to because a snowy white image you have to use your tripod or the shot is wasted the quality of the photos would rate approximate 6/10 they generally appear a little darker with quite a bit of grain it is nice and compact in design but if you care about the quality in photos stay far away from this lens,149,21
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,these are great headsets with mic great fit great sound great price would buy again,15,0
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,the price was right but once i received i discovered the connections were rca and not usb so it does not connect to my laptop any suggestions other than sending back,30,1
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,this headset is totally perfect for my purpose it fits well can be loud enough and has a inline volume controller and microphone on / off switch the sound quality is totally perfect for the price the mic can be adjusted the whole thing fits in a small place only problem i seem to see is that at the very minimum volume one ear shuts off overall i would rate it as a good purchase,73,2
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,these headphones are not usb although they work ok a little uncomfortable with the standard audio jacks it did not state clearly the connection type at the time i ordered,29,3
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,purchased for telephony needs at work where did not need a usb set not very comfortable with two ridges of hard plastic that dig into the top of the ear will have to pad these sections with cloth or tape,40,4
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,i was looking for an inexpensive usb headset for voip and saw this one at amazon the specifications are very vague and nowhere does it mention the type of connector it uses even the picture seems to cut-off any clues to the type of connector used i had to go to the logitech website and dig through their specs to find out it does not use usb to connect to your pc but mini rca connectors i think this should be mentioned prominently to avoid confusion and purchasing the wrongthe price seems fair although,96,5
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,I have bought this headset for myself 2 years ago and I have been using it pretty often ever since it is light comfortable and works great the sound is very clear and the volume settings are high enough my mom needed one now so i bought the same logitech headset for her she loves it as well you are getting a really great product for the money,65,6
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,i purchased this product almost 2 years ago and used it regualrly it worked well and finally after 2 years it started to give me some problems since it worked well for that long i purchased exactly the same product again this time it works well and is very comfortable to use,52,7
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,great sound quality it is comfortable on ears too the only thing i could ask for is a little small frame it is a little too big for me an adjustable one was welcome,34,8
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,i bought this product two days ago and the mic does not work at all i can hear clearly through the headphones but the computer does not pic up a sound from the mic i checked everything went through a ton of tests and options and nothing works never buying something like this again,52,9
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,the microphone broke after less than 2 weeks of use i purchased this headset to talk with my friends online and now i can not because all they hear is godawful screeching as the microphone is somehow broken this is a terrible product spend the extra few dollars and get a better headset it makes me sad because this is the first logitech product that i have ever been really disappointed with,71,10
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,it works pretty well it sits comfortably on your head and the voice quality is very good,17,11
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,1.0,negative,logitech 981 - 000074 880 pc headset please do not trust this product bcos i thought logitech as a brand is worthy product regardless of the price we pay for it i use to voice chat n use voip service i just bought couple of months back suddenly voice output is worst other end can hear only if u scream out of your lungs,63,12
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,4.0,positive,this microphone / headphone combo is really great it is affordable and effective the mic is bendable so it can adjust however the headphones do not adjust to size of your head and they are really big so they slip off my head alot and I have got an average sized head there is a conrol panel on the cord so if you are so lazy that you can not find the button on the computer which you are attached to by the cord you can just press buttons on the cord itself which is convenient and nice overall this product is good for conversing online as a friend but not for much more than that four out of five stars,115,13
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,5.0,positive,logitech 981 - 000074 880 pc headset i purchased this product in may 2006 for my voip account i paid 2500 from staples at he time i frequently buy online at amazoncom and wanted the product the same night to make this long story short this product works great it is reliable and portable can be used to enhance volume as well as sound on laptop and mp3s have new voip account today apr13th 2009 house phone making weird noise i tried these headphones and adjusted the settings on pc tested it on my cel for sound and it worked great i highly recommend this product and highly recommend amazoncom they are awesome and have saved me a ton of money and are reliable well worth the price i paid irma,130,14
Electronics,B000W8W8PA,2.0,negative,these work fine but he previous set i had from logitech were much more comfortable these may be good for kids but they do not sit well on me they always seem to be in the wrong position and fell like they are always there pressing against me i wish i knew the previous model but it is not listed on the headset i travel enough that i do not expect these too last over 6 months they feel cheap next time I shall pay more to get a better headset,89,15
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,i have a dell laptop with bluetooth built in i connect devices to the dell often with no problems however the s-2 just plain does not connect to the dell with any reliability when it does it sounds great but the frustration level in trying to connect just makes it not worth the effort i would blame the dell but it does connect just fine to other devices so i have to conclude that the issue is with the s-2 i tried to get so me help from the manufacture but never got a response to my repeated requests for help again nice sound but just not reliable,108,0
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i was looking for a replacement bluetooth headset for my iphone previously i had a motorola s9 paired with an icombi ap21 i got both at amazon well after 3 months of use the buttons on the s9 got stuck so that i couldt increase the volume I have read that this has been a common concern for many other people as well i looked at the bluetrek st-1 the sony drbt21 g and the cardo s-2 all three were within the same price range a cnet review of the cardo made me buy them in comparing them to my old s9s the sound quality is excellent i was a little apprehensive because I have gotten used to the small buds on the s9 but the earpiece is very light and comfortable overall a great product and i would recommend them to friends,140,1
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,it took me 2 hours to figure out how to configure the headphones with my vista 64 os but finally i did and it works like a charm with decent listening quality update the headphones are too flimsy and broke on me now i have to use tape t hold it together,51,2
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,I have owned the cardo s-2s for about 4 months during that time they received light use i would estimate total listening time to be about 40 hours the s-2s were used mostly for listening to audio while exercising i found the lag while watching video to be a bit annoying the sound quality was good not great but good battery life was excellent they never went dead i would always recharge at about 4 hours i did not abuse these headphones and had they not broken after 4 months of light use i would rate them 4 out of 5 stars,101,3
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,this piece of junk broke almost immediately it is designed so poorly that after only 2 or 3 uses it will break right at the piece that joins the ear piece to the part the wraps around your neck this prevents it from no longer staying securely on your ears i was extra careful with it two after reading several other reviews about it being week but it made no difference the sound is good but the quality of the product design it terrible if the price drops to 5 i would say buy otherwise avoid this product completely this is not worth the price,105,4
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,i like this headset works great and easy to connect not very loud and can become uncomfortable if wearing for a long time overall i think it is a good buy,30,5
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,the headphone plastic cracked and broke a couple of months after i bought the,15,6
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,i bought these to make my life easier at the gym by not having wires hanging off my head when i exercise the sound is pretty good the range is decent it connected to my ux380 easily i like that they fold it is what sold me one them top begin with although i worry about the durability of the plastic we shall see about that i have tried not to expose them to too much sweat so i can not attest to their sweatproofness or lack thereof i am please with my purchase although,94,7
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,this cardo bluetooth headphone works well inside a vehicle or indoor outdoor it pick up many other interference reception becomes poor when i turn my body might loose the signal inside vehicle no problem the elbow where it folds the plastic joint can seperate causing ultimately internal wires become torn will not charge and no longer function,56,8
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i use these extensively with both my blackberry curve 8320 and pearl 8120 for both phone and music listening i also paired with the jabra a120 adapter easily sound quality is great compared to the two other comparable bluetooth stereo headsets that i have tried not as good as my sony dr-bt50s but much easier to travel with no complaints about the mic when using the phone the controls are well placed and easy to use once you are familiar with them the headset is comfortable to wear for extended use my only complaint about them would be that they are a bit on the flimsy side and seem like they would be easy to break,115,9
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,cons you look like mickey mouse wearing these headphones pros best bluetooth phones out there for the money,18,10
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,1.0,negative,i had mine for a few months now it was easy enough to make it work with my notebook lenovo x61 but it just would not work with my blackberry it was not cardos problem but their tech support was not very easy to work with so finally after making the headset to connect properly with both it is battery stopped holding a charge for any reasonable period of time basically a waste of time money and efforts,74,11
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,i paired it with a verizon palm 700wx works perfectly no complaints sound is very good having the controls right on the headset is very conveinent essentially i am controling windows media player with it the microphone is also very good no complaints from people on other end most do not know i am on a headset at all range is great also almost to good make sure bluetooth is disabled or unit is turned off when your charging or not using charge seems to last me two 2 works days of intermittent use which for me means several hours of music listening and stand-by time,105,12
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,4.0,positive,wow better than expected the sound is clear there is no skippin of music and they fit very well quite pleasantly surprised,22,13
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,5.0,positive,this product is in a league of it is own very comfortable and it stays securely on your ears with the unique design of the ear clips easy to use and setup just have to follow the instructions can be paired with as many bluetooth devices you have to use sound is excellent the only set back i have is i can not get it to recognize my voice when using voice activated dialing which is minor because i did not by it for cell phone use but is crystal clear as handsfree device really good sound for stereo use and for those who have to stay up late watching tv,109,14
Electronics,B000WV6VGO,2.0,negative,i am enjoying great sound quality using my cardo s-2 bluetooth headset for the mp3 player part of my phone however when phone calls come in the sound for the people on the other end is poor and i have to switch back to using the phone to talk otherwise this is a beautiful set of earphones,57,15
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1.0,negative,as the other reviewer stated if you mountain bike anywhere there are bumps roots rocksthe mount is just too weak to take the stress i had less than 50 miles on the first one and the interlock snapped off thinking it was just a faulty unit i order a replacement and gave it a second try after 20 miles the second one did the same thing ram needs to abandon the swivel option and design a more secure fixed mount if this is to work with any mountain biking none of this mileage was over any hard hitting drops gps resides in my hydration pack now until i find someone thing more secure,115,0
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1.0,negative,I am a fan of the delorme earthmate but this bike mount is worthless unless you plan on riding exclusively on paved roads or groomed dirt trails unless they have recently improved the mount which i doubt it attaches to the handlebars with zip ties this alone was a red flag you can not get the ties very tight and the thing wobbles around and will not stay put i outright snapped zip ties twice due to vibration from a rocky trail this was moderately annoying but on another ride again on fairly technical rocky terrain the plastic bracket that attaches the unit cradle to the handlebar mount snapped it is also incredibly bulky compared with garmins low profile bike mount seriously guys can not you come up with something better,125,1
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2.0,negative,this mount has a very poor design where it attaches to the handlebar moderate jarring caused the gps to vibrate so much that within 5 rides it broke there is a warranty but it is a hassle and not worth the cost of postage to get the same thing back save your money and keep the gps in a side pocket on a hydration pack,65,2
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1.0,negative,arrived with parts missing and there is no clue on how to contact the seller for replacements buy locally and examine at store to assure that you get all the required parts,32,3
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5.0,positive,gps unit fits in real tight i do not think i have to worry about loosing it bouncing over trails very happy with it,23,4
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2.0,negative,just received it is ok but only marginally so issues only mounts permanently mounts via plastic ties rubber strip missing from package I shall keep it but would definitely not recommend it main picture in listing is the 44 version detail pictures are of this product,44,5
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2.0,negative,does not mount tight to handle bars with the zip ties making the mount move also the 4 prongs that snap into the bike mount will break only lasted about 8 months,31,6
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,2.0,negative,the mechanism by which this mount attaches to your handlebars is two zip ties give me a break,18,7
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5.0,positive,i bought this for my new pn-60 i guess it used to attaching using screws and a clamp but now it uses zip-ties so it should attach to just about any diameter handlebar the gpsr is held tight in the bracket so tight in fact that you will want to remove the lanyard before you put it in the bracket is easily removed with a simple twist but it stayed in place even over rough roads it works great for me when i go out cycle caching the pn-60 will even calculate a road route to the cache update the little plastic pins that secure the gpsr holder the bike mount tend to break off that means it does not last too long if you go on rough roads I have had to buy two more mounts it is still useful but it needs a redesign to make it last longer,150,8
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,4.0,positive,very well built bicycle mount i was disappointed when i saw that the whole thing was mounted to the handle bars by zip ties this part could stand to improved but once mounted it hangs tight and works very well i like the quick disconnct makes it fast and easy to remove and snap back on,56,9
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5.0,positive,i planned to buy one of these handle-bar racks when i bought the pn-30 gps handheld i received the unit and made sure that it would do what i intended and within a day i ordered the handle-bar mounting kit and the carrying bag as well the handle-bar mount is a universal fit device it clamps to your handle-bar by the use of heavy-duty zip-ties and delorme provides a self-stick rubber sheet that you wrap around your handle-bar before attaching the unit while it is a primitive design it works flawlessly and i tested it on some rough road before i considered writing a review of the product it has not slipped at all and the pn-30 is held securely at just the right viewing angle for me i would love to see delorme modify the mounting kit to make it easier to put the gps handheld into the bar mount but it is so secure the way it is designed so i am pretty sure they make it the way they do to prevent the unit from accidently coming loose if you are mountain-biking or riding a rough road like the pan-am highway,194,10
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5.0,positive,i took note of the reviews cautioning about the lack of instructions and the limit on the handlebar diameter supported but i bought it even although i have a thick handlebar i am glad i did right on the front of the packaging it says new ez-on attachment fits multiple handlebar sizes sure enough there were clear instructions and an attachment kit using zip ties and form fitted parts that would allow for any diameter handlebars installation was easy and seems very sturdy do not hesitate to buy if you have a pn series gps and want to cycle with it,101,11
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,4.0,positive,does what it should but bulky there are better mounts out there and when i find it i will buy it,21,12
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5.0,positive,it are not that hard to figure out without directions there has only four bolts two nylok nuts and four plastic molded pieces i do not know what kind of plastic this material is but without too much effort i had no problem prying apart the handlebar clamp but i can see where it might be too tough for some believe me if this clamp got stressed to the point of snapping you would know about it the handlebar bracket was a sloppy fit but wrappng a few turns of black electricians tape around the circumferance of the handlebar between it and the clamp took up the slop no slop after i tightened it solid as a rock now my handlebars are only 22 mm diam close to the brake cable mounts and then it flares up to 25 mm in diam towards the gooseneck so now you know what to expect i agree they should offer a larger diameter handlebar clamp and print a diameter spec to go along with it,168,13
Electronics,B0014TU0OC,1.0,negative,i ordered this for a new road bike and was disappointed at the lack of documentation and that the cheap plastic bracket almost snapped when i put it on my handlebars the handlebars were way too thick for the screw holes to line up even with a longer screw as the previous reviewer noted there are no dimensions listed for maximum handlebar thickness yet there needs to be as newer bikes are larger,73,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,my mother-in-law bought this to make coffee for visitors it worked fine at first but after one or two months of use started to experience water leaks of increasing severity at first there were drips outside of the carafe then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints we put the whole machine on a metal tray to make clean-up easier finally it got so bad that fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock we stopped using it in the end i was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket it is a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug i then inserted a filter coffee and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle while this sounds ridiculous it is a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine my recommendation avoid this machine it is disturbing that black and decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality,194,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,when i first bought this 5-cup coffee maker i was so thrilled i purchased 2 more as gifts it is just 6 months later and all 3 of us are experiencing hot water and some coffee liquid falling outside the carafe I am disappointed in this brand which i trusted looking more closely inside the poor design which houses the filter holder is the issue i will not be buying another b d again,70,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,this is a great little coffee maker and does a better job overall than my old 12 cup braun coffee maker ever did makes good coffee and the warming plate keeps it warm actually hot i had been looking around for a small coffee maker and on a recent trip to walmart i saw this on the display shelf with the other coffee makers it seemed to be a bit sturdier and better-quality than the competing mr coffee 4 - 5 cup of course there seemed to be a zillion of those in stock but i could not find a single one of the b d smartbrew on the shelf i almost gave up until i went 2 aisles over and lo and behold way up on the top shelf there was one smartbrew left after looking around for half hour for a sales person to get it down off the shelf i finally found someone the best part is it cost less than the mr coffee if you are looking for a small coffee maker this is a great choice and no offense to amazon but i paid much less at walmart let us just say it cost me slightly under 1000 for mine o,202,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,while true it does not drip like others when pouring coffee but nothing else about it is up to par first it does not use a gold-tone filter basket or will one fit the standard filters i got were a bit too big okay those are things that are livable but it took very long to make a pot of coffee compared to my other 4 cup makers I have had last the coffee it made was not very good i would say continue looking,82,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this pot does all i expected and more so it fits my condo kitchen well i would well recommond this product esp because it a black and deckerthey always seem to last a long time without failure,39,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,let me say that this is my third black and decker coffee maker i have hadthere is no way possible to pour a cup of coffee without pouring it all over the placei have never seen this much leakagevery unsatisfactorythank you ps otherwise coffee maker is ok,47,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,my elderly father uses this coffee pot and likes it as it is good for just one person the lid is better quality than most other 4 cup coffee makers and the container can hold up to 6 cups which is like 2 mugs the on / off button stuck in the beginning but is working fine now we had previously bought a 4 cup but it was too small my father thinks this one is great as he has parkinsons and is limited on his strength,85,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,prefer my coffee brewed fresh this is the perfect size for one or two mugs having no auto timer is a definite plus since I am not into bells and whistles,30,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this product is very nice considering the fact that I am in iraq it is a slow dripper but it gets the job done,22,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,i needed a quick coffee maker and picked up this model at local hardware store and paid a premium little did i know the pot drips no matter how we angle the pot while pouring a mess occurs we can not make the right amount of coffee if we pour 5 cups of water in tank and fill up to line we get about 3 cups of coffee what has up with that so we never know how much coffee to use what a mess never again,80,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,easy to use easy to clean makes a great cup of coffee in a very reasonable amount of time also the coffee is hot not just oneabove warm which is really nice if you add milk or cream because it does not cool off too much also nice is the feature on the glass carafe that shows not only how many cups are in the carafe but also where to fill to get that many cups they are not the same i definetly would purchase again for myself or as a gift,93,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,i bought this when i was single in a tiny studio apartment and needed to save space and make small batches of coffee I have had it for over 10 years without complaint 10 years yeah it may be slow but it is cheap and small and easy to use 10 years,50,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,this is one of the worst products that i have ever purchased the pot leaks whenever you pour if it were not for the fact that i have thrown away the box i would return it in a newyork minute,40,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,while the price is right it brews a quick cup of joe and it is has a little more capacity than most 4-cup machines that is about where the good news ends my machines heating element just crapped out after 5 months of use it is under warranty but i am just going out to buy a different brand i find this unit is messy the caraffe does not pour as well as the mr coffee i had for 3 years it is ok if you pour very slowly but if you are a little too fast you will get liquid on the counter while brewing the lid is flimsy enough that it pushes up enough to release a lot of steam which over time will ruin the finish on your cabinets i also notice that if the warmer plate is left on more than about an hour my countertop becomes extremely warm i believe the bottom of the unit lacks sufficient height for proper air circulation rather than wreck your kitchen or burn the house down buy another product,173,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,this inexpensive coffeemaker performs very well it is easy to fill and the glass flask pours without spilling my only quarrel is that the off / on switch is not very pretty and glows red rather than green when it is on,39,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,my parents have this coffee maker and every time I am at their house for a few days i have to use this very slow machine to make what amounts to a weak cup of coffee which i then have to proceed to forgive me coffee gods nuke for 10 seconds in order to get it hot enough of course if you like your coffee not much hotter than room temperature this may be the perfect coffee maker for you but keep in mind that the trade-off for this convenience is a very inefficient coffee maker that is warm water extracts far less coffee flavor than very hot water and on account of this you need to use far more beans to make a cup of coffee with this machine overall this is a poor coffee maker that is slow inefficient and makes cold coffee,144,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,4.0,positive,just the right size for 2 people 4 cups not quite enough 5 cups just right with this pot however and my previous one when you pour always some dripping onto the counter because the lip of the pot is not deep enough i guess otherwise b d seems to be the only company making a 5-cup pot which i appreciate,60,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,i bought this product to replace one that had broken that i really liked i had to return this product three times because it does not as it says in the description come with the perfect pour carafe which is what i wanted since the standard carafe drips everywhere on the third time of returning it i asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size i then mentioned to amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description but they have not,98,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,5.0,positive,with the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us we like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing but you must use their carafe with this maker you can use your own mug and if the carafe breaks and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes you can still use the maker with the mug or other container i sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher sure this maker is not fancy but i just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that does not take up lots of counter space i have not had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker,149,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,2.0,negative,the carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good no matter how careful or how i adjust my grip water / coffee leaks from the top and down the side i have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter,44,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B00006IUVE,1.0,negative,after 6 months of use the led switch popped out of the coffeemakers base which turned the wired plug into an on / off device i found that black and decker no longer services these products and the firm that does does not respond to e-mail,43,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,the pineapple cutter does not work at all it is not powerful enough to cut through a regular pineapple without exerting extraordinary force and that makes the fruit mushy i would return the product to the purchaser if not for the hassle and expense of the return itself do not bother with this product it is a complete waste of money,59,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it does what it says it does it is not to tough although it deforms when being pushed through the pineapple causing a oval shape design thereby wasting some of the sweet tender meat,34,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought this because i love fresh pineapples and i thought this might be a goodwrong this thing has a very small cutting circle and waste a good portion of the fruit worse yet it wastes the good tasting part of the pineapple after using it once i reverted back to manual peeling it costed me 10 and a good tasty portion of a pineapple for this experiment,70,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,this tool sounded like a goodbefore i got it however there really needs to be some direction on how specifically to use it i tried to just cut off the top and push this tool down to core the pineapple did not work i then cut off the outer layer of skin and used it but it mangled the fruit i really do not recommend it,69,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,thiswas easy once i got the hang of it it saves time and money be patient and it will work,22,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,this sort of looked flimsy in the product pictures but it is actually very sturdy the blades are very stiff and sharp and the bars that they are mounted to are very heavy-duty squared aluminum it hardly flexes at all so do not be fooled by the pictures it also makes getting the meat of the pineapple much easier i just cut off the top use this tool and then slice off thin pieces of the bottom until i get past thecore it works very well and gives on big chunk of cored pineapple,95,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,good product a little tough on smaller poineapples but great to skin and core and slice to desired thickness,19,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the first thing to note is that this does not slice a continuous spiral as some pineapple slicers do it cores and removes the husk resulting in one solid piece which is then perfect for slicing into rings or cutting into chunks i find the solid piece much easier to work with than the continuous spiral this corer will squeeze out some juice so you want the pineapple to be just ripe not over-ripe although it squeezes out much less juice than the plastic spiral kind the corer is made of sturdy metal which is dishwasher safe to use slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple stand upright position the corer in the center and turn clockwise while pushing down the serrated teeth are quite effective at slicing down into the pineapple but it is still easier with two people one to hold the husk with two hands and one to turn the gadget if you are looking to cut the result into rings or chunks this is the one i would recommend,174,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,core your pineapple with this handy device far better than the plastic models,13,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,cuts perfect and clean with ease saving on precut pineapples,10,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,i had one of these already and i wanted another one for a different location so that i did not have to transport that one back and forth works great,30,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it works but you kinda have to be strong to push it all the way through the pineapple,18,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works really nice runs rings around the plastic cutter / corer offerings out there the wife can now handle the pineapple coring chore much easier i would like to help but she says it is her kitchen and for me to keep out of there yes mam will do,47,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it would not cut through a ripe pineapple darn near broke my hand trying to get it through a waste of money,20,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the diameter is a little small and does not work in large pineapples needs a little more in diameter to make it perfect or they should sell 2 sizes,29,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,in theory this thing is great but in practice it is worthless squeezes out all the juices and you are left with pineapple that does not taste good,26,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,i m sure alton brown would not like this since it is a unitasker but it does the job it is better for medium sized pineapples as it is rather small so it loses some meat on big ones,34,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works great used as recommended without any problems saves time makes it quick and easy easy to clean does not rust,21,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,it works great once you know how to use it cut off the top of the pineapple position the saw on top turn the saw counter-clockwise i first tried turning it clockwise and that did not work take my advice this is a great product it will last for many many years to come,53,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it does not work well at all i have put it in the cupboard because i can not get it to cut the pineapple,22,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought thisfor my store to quickly core pineapples for customers who ask for it and it bent pretty badly on the very first use it is not made from a very strong medal and i certainly would not recommend purchasing this,42,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,this product just does not work very well by the time it gets to the bottom of the pineapple it is no longer round i was oddly shaped and blow out the side of the pineapple a little the instructions say to twist it as you press down but that does not really work it has two metal supports that make it hard to twist it just did not work very well at all,74,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,i used the pineapple prince pineapple cutter and corer once and wil not use it again it is sturdy but it is a very poor design first the instructions tell you to turn the cutter in a clockwise direction however the serrations on the cutting blades point to the right meaning the tool needs to be turned in a counter-clockwise direction to cut properly second the vertical aluminum parts that form the handle are about 1/8 thick and they are attached to the outside of the cutting blades which means they rip through the pineapple this results in a pineapple that is very difficult to slice this could have been easily avoided if the handle was attached to the inside of the cutting blades,124,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,i tried the equity by la crosse skyscan 31269 lcd atomic alarm clock and it was fine except the clock ran from battery only even although they give you an ac adapter the ac adapter is for the ceiling display only when you change the battery on the la crosse the clock and all settings are lost so i returned it and bought the smartset dual alarm am / fm clock radio the ceiling time can not shown right side up with the clock facing you this is like most other ceiling clocks so watch out the la crosse has the most advanced ceiling display as it can be twisted all 4 directions but can not be twisted enough to use the clock with the ceiling display right side up,127,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,how many times have you been awake at night and wanted to know what time it is the lacrosse skyscan lcd does a fine job of projecting the time on the cieling or wall it is not obtrusive and is not too bright although minor i would have liked a little more swivel capability with the unit,57,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,the clock worked as advertised and as the comments of others stated came quickly and set up easily directions are not great but can be used,26,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,for the money this is a great product the atomic part of this clock is excellent as you do not have to set it and the time is always correct,30,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,does not preform as advertised does not keep proper time and the alarm that we have never set will not stop going off i would not recommend purchasing michael piliaris,32,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,the clock will not set to eastern standard time i manually set it and it keeps reseting itself to central time the customer service on this product is horrible a person called during the day and left me no good info,41,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,i have several skyscans where i live we lose power all-too-frequently it works fine has no problem getting the sky signal we can not even use cell phones here and i especially like the ceiling time it projects the time onto the ceiling the only thing i had to get used to is the alarm setting mechanism the in-between setting does not set the alarm you have to slide it all the way and the alarm has an increasingly louder signal so you can not be slow at turning it off unless loud noises do not bother you in the am mine looks just like the picture it always has the right time and i do not have to mess with it what could be better,121,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,received as expected 2nd one we have purchased bought 1st for myself this one is a gift will buy again,20,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,great price for this clock but have read the instructions and set the clock and it always when wave happens sets itself for one hour behind the original time have taken out batteries and unplugged the clock and re-set many times to no avail,43,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,this is probably the best atomic projection clock if all you want is a time display function i have several of of this model it has a bright-enough projection display can do 24-hour format unlike oregon scientific models relatively easy to setup for an atomic clock and the most affordable as is with most digital clocks setting up the alarm is a hassle and i do not use it negative 1 the power-supply is only for the projection and all setting is lost when battery is changed the trick is to replace one battery at a time and quickly to retain the settings negative 2 when placed behind you say on a bed headboard the display can not be rotated enough for proper orientation while sleeping there is a plastic tab inside the projector that can be forced broken to override it,141,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,works exactly as described it actually got the signal from colorado very quickly once i realized i needed to turn on the wave buttons are easily hit accidentally which can because the clock to change to 24time or turn off the signal receiver,46,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,this clock will not keep the right time it keeps kicking back an hour i would not buy this product again I have had other la crosse items that I have really liked this one is no good,36,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,2.0,negative,where to start no warranty no instructions would not set time automatically focus knob simply rotated did not focus without instructions is difficult to set up worth maybe 10 for the projection no more overall cheap cheap cheap poor example for lacrosse will avoid them from now on very disappointed,50,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,1.0,negative,records will show I have boutht 3 of these clocks in last 6mo i gave them away as presents then my 88yr old moms says you can not see the time during the day unless you punch a button then time will stay on only for 5 seconds this was not refered to in details of clock when i bought them it may work during the night but why would anyone build a clock that you have to go to and punch a button to see time during day to say the least i can not tell you enough how not happy i and everyone on my gift list is with this piece of work geo,114,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with the clock it arrived quickly and was easy to set up we really like the time projection on the ceiling it helps at night,29,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i bought one of these to offset the cost of using baseboard electric heaters this one heater works very well at keeping our 300 sqfeet room at a good ambient temperature at 475 watts i leave it running 24 hours a day during the winter it is a great design you barely notice it,53,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,when i bought this product i was skeptic if this will infact work i installed 1 panel in a 120 sq feet room it works very well heats the room to a comfortable temprature in about 30 minutes after checking this months electricity bill i will buy more of this product,51,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,this has to be the best heater i have ever used i bought some to put in my kids bedrooms and they work like a dream it not only heats the rooms to a comfortable temperature but it keeps the moister in the air so my kids allergies do not act up when i tern them on also i do not need to worry about leaving the econo heaters on with my kids in their rooms alone because the heaters will not get hot enough to burn them it is a wonderful product and i am buying more to put throughout my whole house to replace my central heating so we will save on ourbill fred new york new york,119,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i have bought over 10 of these heaters for both my house and rental properties they do heat nicely the only problem with them is most of them have cracked sometimes they crack right away sometimes they will crack after you turn them off in the spring i have sent many of them back and they do send you a replacement without a problem i have even been told to use joint filler to fix the cracks they are like square pieces of clay with wires running through them i think the contraction and expansion of them being turned on to heat and then cooling down when off cracks them I have thrown a couple of them out wish they would come up with a model that does not crack other then that they are great they do heat,138,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,i bought seven of these heaters two years ago and everyone has developed severe cracks throughout the whole core i have contacted friends who have also bought this product and they all have the same problem i contacted the company by phone and was told the warranty had expired and to use silicone caulking to fill in the cracks these heaters are poorly made if you research other reviews not on the company website you will see similar complaints,79,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,this product provided a nice even heat at first and i found it is quiet heat more soothing than a noisy fan-powered unit one day i carelessly tossed my winter coat on the floor next to the wall-mounted unit and apparently the sleeve landed against the corner of the unit where a plastic circle covers the wiring i returned to the room immediately smelling burning plastic i pulled away the coat to reveal a burn hole through the plastic circle completely through to the other side the unit has not come back on since be very careful about what you put near this device,102,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,the good thing about this heater is that it will heat a 10 by 10 room eventually this heater really needs to be on 4 - 6 hours before you can feel a difference in the room if left on it will maintain the temperature to about 65 degrees the web site says the average cost to your electric bill should be about 3 cents an hour and for me it was more about 30 cents an hour i used the heater maybe 10 times the first month i got it i left it on for about 10 hours each time and my next electric bill was 35 more than the previous month nothing else had change but this heater,117,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i bought a house that used these panels as the main heating source throughout the house unless your attic walls and floors are insulated this product is worthless my electric bill was astronomical and the house did not get warmer than like 63 degrees because the very small amount of heat that they produced was quickly sucked out of the house i froze for two winters my water pipes froze too because the house could not stay warm enough but i just installed centralheatmay be just as expensive but at least I shall be warm,96,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,we bought this heater hoping to heat our bedroom and save money on utility costs it does heat up a small room quite nicely if left on for a while the only problem i have had is that the unit cracked from normal use and i am not sure if it is safe to use or not the cracking seems to be a common problem with these heaters if you read other reviews on the web,76,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i had purchased my panels over two years ago online it turned out that i got a bad batch of the early models that were prone to cracking like some of the other reviewers here had experienced i contacted their customer service department and after a few e-mails and me sending them pictures of the cracked panels and copies of my receipts they replace my panels within a couple of weeks my warranty had expired but i received what they call customer service replacements my wife and i heat our entire condo with these panels and have had no complaints until the cracks started appearing we look forward to using our newer models great heating product excellent customer service,119,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,i have 5 panels 3 cracked and 2 burned out you must leave them on 24/7 to keep up in the northern illinois winter not much of a savings if they need to run constantly customer support is a joke a real joke i was told to fill the crack with drywall mud and sand it smooth i have taken mine down and because the company will not honor them threw them away do not purchase this product,76,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,we installed a panel in our new mudroom worked very well unless it was really cold outside new hampshire after 15 years although it developed several cracks the manufacturer said not to use it anymore but also would not replace it i had planned on installing more panels but not now too bad,53,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,rather high price but then again anything that is going to save money in the long run is so far so good puts out quite a bit of heat but you can not expect to heat a large area with just one i do plan on buying a couple more of them,51,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,this panel heat is really what a lot of us are looking for saving money and being confortablei thought i would just supplement my heat my home presently has a floor heater 1000sq foot house i am in missouri and it does get down in the teens i first bought two panels and placed them in my living room and kitchen they do such a nice job i do not think i will be turning on the floor heater instead i ordered more to handle the bedrooms i could pay money for an old furnace in the maintance and up keep or i can save and use a beautiful efficient panel heater easy to install and not bad on the eyes i recommend this to everyone-try it you will probably fall in love,132,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i bought this heater for my sons room it does a good job of keeping the room warm but the door must be shut or it does not work it is a little hot to the touch will not burn but too hot for an infant to touch it works as described and i would recommend it to anyone especially for a childs room,64,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,i think this heater is great for kids rooms we have had this unit over a year now and use it in the winter months for our sons room which is the coldest room in the house we turn it on at night and by morning his room is much warmer than the rest of the house it does get slightly hot not too hot to where you would immediately get burned if you were to touch it in my opinion this is far safer than any other heater it does not run our power bill up and there is no saound while it is on i researched many heater before purchasing this one and i must say this turned out to be better than i expected i was very skeptical at first to whether this would provide enough heat but now this is the only heater i will use in my childrens bedrooms,154,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,great heaters I have used them for years with no problem one thing although when first turned on they outgas for the first 24 hours they give off an odor as the material cures the same way many appliances do if you do not want to smell it give it a day in the garage then move it inside other than that they are the apogee of heating technology they come as close to the comfort of woodstove heat as electricity can and are basically invisible,84,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,for anyone that has a marriage where you can never agree on what is a comfortable temperature this heater will be your winter salvation i have a hard time retaining heat and my wife has a hard time expelling it the problem with most space heaters is that they heat the room well beyond the temperature you set the thing too this heater will always comfortably heat a room very evenly it gives off a comfortable radiant heat this is wall mountable which means it will not take up any space in the room summer storage is just wrapping the cord around it my advice is to mount on the wall near the person that likes it warm it helps to create a slightly warmer pocket that will not affect the rest of the room i have sinusitis and this heater really helps my sinuses drain,144,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,we bought this installed it according to directions it worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks we did have it on constantly during that time then one night we woke up to a horrible burning stench it was coming from the heater the spot where the wire goes from the unit to the plug was beginning to burn the other side of the heating unit was begining to turn black and smolder we unplugged and removed the heater immediately it took about 2 weeks before the burning chemical stench left our room i just thank god that we woke up before it was too late i still have not contacted amazon or the manufacturer to get my money back still just too horrified please do not buy this product,130,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,this appliance is exactly as promised in the ad very cost effective source of quiet soft heat use of this heater on our sun porch allows us to use the room year round,33,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,I have ordered 2 of these panel heaters now we think they are absolutly great they are very easy to install and take up no space they do not even look like heaters attached to the wall we bought 2 because we were so impressed with the first one and decided that we needed one for a different room it is true that they only heat an area of about 100 square feet but they do that very well what has really neat is they get comfortably warm to the touch but do not burn so they are safe to put in small areas and great toback against for a toasty back while at the time of installing these heaters in our apartment we did not pay for our own electric it only makes sense that they cost less than most other electric heaters an old heater we had ran at 2100 watts and these take only 450 my 2 computers run at 750 watts each it must be cheaper than a less-efficient source of heat all in all i think the heaters are well worth it we would buy another and have been recommending them to all of our friends and families,202,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i was disappointed that one of the panels does not work at all and one was cracked the others do work fine did effect my electric bill as expected,29,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,the panel was shipped promptly my wife and i installed it in our sons room during the fall it seemed to keep his room warm during cool weather but before winter came and it could really be put to the test the unit stopped working unfortunately i misplaced the receipt and could not return the unit i rated the unit with a single star because it did not last more than 60 days,73,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i have one of these have had it for about 2 years recently it has cracked in the center from top to bottom i have contacted the company and they stated that since it is past the 18 month warranty period they could not help however did recommend i replace it and then mentioned of a sale on theright now i am going to contact the consumer reports group and email the photo so they may review thisoverall it was alright it takes the chill off of a room it did not raise temperature significantly i do not think in my case of 2 year life it was worth the money spent also it seemed to produce less heat as time went on,126,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,i purchased these for use in my bedroom which was an addition that did not have central air or heat in it because of the size of the room i purchased 2 of these i have only used a couple of days so I am not sure what effect they will have on my electric bill but hopefully the same or less as the space heaters we were using i am conserned because the walls in this room are wood shingles and they seem to heat up we are looking at other options on mounting i have purchased the electric temp sensor so that it will turn them off and on as needed they do get a little hot to the touch but for most adults i do not think it will be an issue,133,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,if you are looking to heat a large room this is not the heater for you they work as indicated by the company to heat 100 sq feet you must place them on a solid wall such as drywall at first we tried placing it in our older home on some paneling that had nothing behind it but the studs the paneling is thin and the wall got a little too hot for my comfort however i found that if you place it on drywall or other solid surface the wall does not get hot there is no noticeable difference in the electric bill once it gets cold and stays cold we leave it on 24/7 we use ours in the laundry room which is roughly 100 sq feet and it works wonderfully and we are glad to have it for that purpose but we would not purchase any for the rest of the house as they are not aesthetically pleasing nor would they be efficient for the rest of the house,169,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,i bought the electric panel radiator for the express purpose of saving energy but i just wound up cold quite hot in the center but the outer edges were cool to touch I am wondering if that is a fault found in my heaters since the product seems to have such rave reviews it did not have the heating power i expected i found the small soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w which was the same amount the panel heater used i live in atlantawhich has quite mild winters so i was disappointed with the performance but since the panels are permanently attached to my walls i may give them another try this winter,118,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,this product worked okay for us there are few heating options that use so little wattage which was a necessity for our old home however we decided to paint one of these to match the wall after we painted it it is effectiveness decreased by about 50 the website even touts this being able to paint it to match the wall as an advantage of the product but does not warn that the heater will not work as well afterwards we contacted the company several times to complain but they would never get back to us like i said these things are okay but the company does not give you all the facts and they will not get back to you if you have problems i will not be buying any more,129,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,beware if you are buying this product to lower your bill it will not work my electric bill has actually been higher from last year since using the econo heat last year i used baseboard electric heat the econo heat used 200 to 300 more kilowat hours than the baseboard electric heaters i gave it a two star rating instead of a no star rating because it does heat up the living room nicely but at what cost,77,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,1.0,negative,from the great reviews i really expected this heater to be wonderful but it fell short for me it might be good for a room the size of a small closet but it did nothing for my bedroom we could not even tell we had added any heat at all it was really a waste of money for us,58,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,do not know about others but live in wi and i set my therm at 55 and let the econoheat take care of the rest 2 br duplex and i am fine when it gets below zero i have to move it up to sixty not going to blow smoke but it works if you have compact area very easy to install,61,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,we installed 4 eco-heaters as supplmentary heaters they were easy to install 15 minutes they take up little or no space make no noise 2 stars we live in boston and had all 4 working non-stop since december 1 2005 the econo-heater give off about 10 of the heat we expected the temperature in a test room was only 2 degrees higher the detail documentation that came with the heater says that you can expect 10 of the heat coming from the face of the heater that is all the heat you get the truth of this heater is in the 90 warranty by the time you figure out it does not work the warranty has expired this econo-heater is a greatbut get an oil filled heater for heat the electrity that both burn is the same but you only get 10 of the heat with the econo-heater,149,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,we purchased three econo-heat panels in an effort to maintain a more even house temperature to take theoff our monitor 441 oil-fired heater also a great product with one each in our master bedroom northeast corner study and adjoining sunroom the results have been outstanding although deep winter has yet to arrive here in maine our monitor runs only a third of it is normal curve the econo-heaters maintaining a soft even heat in those outer rooms for our application i feel it is best to avoid large swings in temperature and we choose to let them run most of the time however one could use timers or thermostats with the units if desired we have yet to figure any specific heating cost reductions but anticipate considerable savings especially as we face increasingly high fuel costs i usually dismiss any type of electric heating units but these are clearly a wonderful addition for most well-insulated applications safe clean aesthetically pleasing simple to use and install all for a very reasonable price and our cats have found new residence in the far reaches of the house we rate em two paws way up,191,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,well i purchased three of the heaters they are easy to instal about 10 minutes each being it is only october and the nights have not been that cold i do have them on and it is been a constant 72 - 71 degrees in the area where they are i installed one in my sons room and with his door closed in a room about 120 square feet it is been nice in there the true test will be in january,77,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,when i got my econo-heater last year i was so amazed to experience it is quiet velvety warmth i also really liked the fact that it did not create dust in addition i was impressed with the fact that it was unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing it cut down on my heating bill even although it was installed in a room with windows on every wall and a sliding glass door i am looking forward to using it in my new place where i can actually use it in the way that the manufacturer suggests,92,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,wow that is outstanding customer service i recently e-mailed you about a problem i was having with my heater i could not believe it when theguy dropped off a brand new one i really liked the heater but i really am amazed at the way you guys stand behind your product it is unusual to find a company that is so responsive and does not try to find fault with the customer I have told a lot of people about the heater and they were impressed wait till they hear about the service thanks a million and i am sure the folks that stay in the guest cottage that is where the heater is mounted will really be appreciative,115,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,well after reading all the tesimonials from users i decided to replace all my old ugly baseboard heaters with econo-heat panels what a difference nice steady heat no tick-tick-tick of the heater warming up but they are warm and so am i i even went out and looked at the power meter when all the panels were active 4 big and 2 small panels and the meter was barely spinning if i did that with the old baseboard heaters the meter would be twirling like mad great product already have a co-worker looking into them for his place and a friend is looking at them too you now have a sales rep in the seattle area I shall expect a commission check in the mail soon,127,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,well we live in a trailer and do not have central heat and air we use space heaters in the winter but can only have one on at a time so can only heat one room at a time or our circuit breaker would pop also we could not leave them on while we were gone because of the fire hazard with a baby on the way we needed to find a safe affordable way to heat our home we tried to the econo-heat panels and they are great three of them use less electricity then one of the little space heaters we were using they are easy to install and i feel safe leaving them on while i am away i know our little one will be warm and safe next winter,132,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i bought them to fit a 1956 sunbeam and it said that they would fit but they did not so i had to return them and went and bought a new kitchen-aide wish it would have fit but the shaft was not long enough,42,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my grandmother gave me her mixed and I have not used it very much because it was more sentimental then anything I have started using it more and i got a spoon caught in the beaters and the original were ruined i was afraid it would be a search for replacements that would last forever these beaters fit perfect and they arrived quickly and the price was a lot less than what i was expecting these are great grandma will never know,81,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the original old beaters had completed worn out i neverthought i would get them working correctly glad these are available the mixer works as if it were new,28,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,in spite of the amount of research i did i could not determine if these beaters would fit even a call to the hamilton beach customer line was unhelpful so i ordered them and they did not fit the middle shaft was too long i returned them,46,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,it is just like the photo but i thought they were bound together for shipping not the correct part for my hamilton beach mixer how to i return it,29,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my mixer was handed down to me from my mom 30 plus years old beaters broke i had such a hard time trying to find replacement ones so happy when i finally did just do not make mixers like that anymore these were perfect fit,44,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my mom got her hamilton beach mixer for her wedding in 1953 it is still a great appliance that she uses regularly she was having a tough time finding a new set of beaters i bought these for her and i am impressed very good quality heres to another 59 years of moms delicious baking,55,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,factory services ha-hbg replacement beaters it was new and fit the electric mixer had not found it locally so searched internet,21,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the quality was a bit low considering the quality of items purchased in the past there must be an american factory that could do a bit better allen clark,29,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,great quality great price fast delivery and nicely packaged bravo this will bring that old mixer back to life thank you,21,9

Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,thisdid not fit at all if i can not find the proper piece i will likely have to purchase a new mixer,23,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,these are fine for replacements of the original beaters only bad thing is they are very lightweight metal and bend easily unlike the original beaters which were durable at least they work and i am able to use my old mixer so I am satisfied,44,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,work great fit perfect into old sunbeam mixer these beaters are hard to find so if you need these get some,21,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,i have had a hamilton beach mixer for 50 years the only thing i have had to replace are the beaters i am always thrilled to find them,28,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i told the company what year my machine was old but motor works beautifully these were for the newer version and did not fit,24,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,bought this to replace the beaters on a hamilton beach model g mixer i inherited from my parents that had been resting in a box for over a decade my wife is not fond of cooking and what few items we need a mixer for a small hand mixer usually suffices i wanted to mix up a batch of very dry-battered cookies and wanted the nostalgia of mons old 50s-era mixer these perfectly replaced the bent-up beaters on the hb model g also fits many other hamilton beach stand mixer models worked great at whipping up a batch of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies price almost 1/2 of what you would pay elsewhere if you have an old otherwise serviceable hamilton beach mixer and need a replacement set of beaters this is the way to go,135,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,this is a great machine it heats up fast and brews fast i read the reviews about the coffee tasting like plastic and i had the same problem at first but i cleaned it with the vinegar solution and after a couple uses the plastic taste went away and now we just have a great machine,56,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,coffee maker is working perfectly this is my second proctor-silex coffee pot and the only reason i got a new one is that i broke the carafe on my 10 year old machine which is still working just fine,39,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,works great with auto timmer and more-failed after almost 2 years plate does not heat up and water stays in reservoir,19,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i was lucky to find this same model of coffee maker that i had i purchased my last coffeemaker at least 15 years ago and it finally slowed down too much even with cleaning all i wanted was a reliable coffeemaker without bells and whistles i do use the timer on occasion when i have to leave early for work i hope that if and when this new maker wears out i can purchase this again maybe i should buy a spare,82,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,good simple coffeemaker very easy to thoroughly clean consistently brews a good pot,13,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,lasted only 14 months the heating element failed after 14 months of light use half pot daily my previous coffee maker same make and model lasted a decade before the heating element conked out on the plus side easy to pour without dribbling,43,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,i could of saved my money and wished i would of water all over counter when pouring out of pot clock button can easily be bumped and change the time also the dial is very hard to see it is hard to open the top to get the coffee bin in or out the power cord is very very short save your money,63,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i doubt it is the worlds greatest coffee maker and the numbers on the pot have already mostly worn off after a few months but it makes good enough coffee for us at 7 am we do not have the palettes to justify fancy coffee or machines and it is the one we were used to so it was quite convenient to order the exact same model when i shattered the old one and being able to program it the night before is nice,80,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,we have purchased proctor silex coffee makers for over twenty years the coffee is brewed quickly and tastes great,19,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,our go to coffeemaker the last 3 times i say 3 times because the carafe will break way before the machine quits and the replacement carafes are almost as expensive as the entire coffeemaker down the hatch,38,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i used a mr coffee for years this coffee maker makes much better coffee and lasts longer than any mr coffee pot I have had,24,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,shipper placed one sheaf of folded paper between product box and shipped carton not good coffee maker was dead on arrival this was not a complicated product while it does have programmable clock brew start it has an on switch that when pressed should heat the water and start to brew on switch lit up red as per instructions but nothing happened did not heat the water amazon really aggravating to have to waste an hour or more of my valuable time dealing with a product that is so simple it should be plug inwith water filter and coffee and press brew have to dry out re-pack go online arrange return and waste more of my time writing a review,121,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this product to replace an older model of the same coffeemaker the coffee basket is an improvement but the time display is hard to read unless you bend down to view it straight on it does make tasty coffee,41,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,cheap unit with some nice features while not listed in product description research reveals product has only 180 day warranty from mfgr i can not recommend this unit buyers should be aware that i experienced a total electrical and functional failure after 10 months which nearly caused an electrical and plastic fire while we were sleeping during a programmed brew cycle just before we awoke an internal temperature control module short-circuited overheated and melted a hole in the plastic housing before a slow-acting safety shut-off electrical power to the unit such an pre-mature and catastrophic failure of this simple household appliance indicates an improper and unsafe design,106,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,had this for a couple months now and it really is a great coffeemaker with i think could have had a few improvements 1 led is not lighted 2 too easy to accidentally hit the minute and hour set buttons those are the reasons it received a 4 star instead of a 5 other wise for the price it is a bargain it makes a good coffee in a short amount of time and keeps the coffee hot,77,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,if you do not care about bells and whistles on a brewer this is perfect after 2 weeks of use it developed some spots on the warmer which in time i think might start peeling off which is why i originally bought this as a replacement for my old one,49,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this coffeemake after reading extensive reviews on amazon and other web-sites for coffemakers at this price range my mother-n-law came to visit me and her son for a week since she is a regular coffee drinker which i am not needed to find one that was reasonably price and functioned well this one did my mother-n-law enjoyed her morning cup i bought the more pricier filter cups so I am sure that plays a part in good coffee the coffee maker does notwater on the countertop like other lower-priced coffee maker i purchased the one in white which I am glad i did instead of the white the clock is not lit but that was ok for me all in all for this price range this is a good one,131,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,the best thing about this deep fryer is that all parts could be taken apart and cleaned it works well and is safe but it fills my house with greasy smell it was a lot more than just deep frying on the stove top also it was a little too big for a family of four considering the amount of unusable oil i had to throw down the drain i will still use it for recipes which call for a deep fryer with good ventilation,85,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,i liked everything about this cooker but the heat settings i found myself in need of temperatures of 400 degrees and this unit stops at 375 other than that it was beyond easy to clean and left nothing that i could think of it could use other than for folks like me a higher temperature setting good design style and thinking when into producing it,65,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,I have only used mine twice and had good experiences both times the food turned out the way it was supposed to clean up is easy it takes little effort to disassemble the fryer but although many parts are dishwasher safe they take up quite a bit of space in my average sized dishwasher so i just wash everything by hand i wish the fry basket were larger although i guess the rest of the appliance would have to be bigger so i guess i wish the whole thing were just a bit bigger but it is still a good size for the price i wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital the timer is antimer type dial and the thermostat is a slider amking for somewhat impercise settings although this is relatively minor it is still a very good deep fryer,143,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i like the fact that it is dishwasher safe all parts except for the heating element storing oil in the fryer is an option but if you prefer you can empty the oil pan into a bottle and wash the pan in the dishwasher too no more stinky rancid crumbs in the bottom to deal with i also like the thermostat and timer,63,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,i should have taken heed this rival czf630 deep fryer did not have great reviews but i did like the fact that it had a filter and a break away cord hence 1 star rate the filter zero stars we used it 8 times it no longer works and it is out of the return window so we have this plastic covered can the housing for the oil resivour is even garbage impossible to remove oil from the finish of it so at 60 and an 8 time usage it would have been cheaper to go get junk food out save your money on this,107,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,this deep fryer is great it heats the oil quickly and i absolutely love the fact that there is no spatter while cooking,22,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,purchased this product 3 months ago looks great and easy to clean i tought i would be statisfied big mistake i have used around 3 to 5 times only now thermostat seems to not respond anymore it does not heat at all because thermostat shows that oil is at right temp all the time i am really annoyed about this situation this is a brand newelectric part is totally defective beware,76,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,the second time i used this fryer it stopped working in the middle of cooking i cooked one batch of fries and as i removed them i noticed the power light had gone off i did all the trouble-shooting stuff and still no power i allowed it to cool down and still no power i followed the instruction booklet carefully the two times that i used this fryer and it died in the midst of it is second use since there does not seem to be a reasonable explanation it is being returned,89,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this rival is my first fryer and i love it it keeps you away from the oils splash and you can remove all the parts and wash them in the dishwasher easy to use and to clean I shall recommend this df to anyone,44,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,we purchased this deep fryer two and half weeks ago without warning it stopped working piece of caca this is i would avoid it there are better deep fryers out there because i can not just leave the stars out of this I am giving it one star although i would prefer to give it less than zero,56,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this deep fryer heats up fast and holds it is heat well so far all i fry came out nice and crisp i have not tried chicken yet that will be the big test my last rival i got for christmas lasted a month hope this one last longer by the way this is a up dated fryer from my other one to be all far,65,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk within a month the timer knob broke off within two months the basket handle broke so there is now no way to raise or lower the basket today the temperature control slide knob broke in two there is no way to fix these defects either it is obvious that the plastic used is of poor quality for it is the plastic that failed pieces simply snapped in two or connections failed i do not use this for anything other than average home cooking either and then maybe once a week so there was not a heavyon this cooker it is just junk,106,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i accidentally over filled the first one of these i bought but i liked it so much i got another one it cooks food well and is very easy to clean the ability to close the lid before putting your food in the oil is a real nice feature this is definitely the best product in this price range,59,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i purchased the rival 5 liter cool touch deep fryer and it works great we owned so many different brands over the years and i am very happy with this one the best one yet,33,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i spent hours reading deep fryer reviews and i could not make up my mind which was the best one then one day in the wal-mart i saw this fryer and thought that is it I am just buying it well boy I am glad i did this fryer is easy to use cooks perfect and looks great i am so happy with my purchase I have made taquitos apple fritters little apple pies soft crabs fish fillets donuts wings and more the food does not stick to the basket i have no problems with the magnetic safety cord and the outside gets warm but not enough to burn which is important with my 3 kids running around the basket is not too small for this family of 5 i highly recommend this fryer,128,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,first model was dis functional returned and got unit that worked beware cool touch still requires heat resistant gloves to touch while the unit is turned on I have been able to successfully fry anything from fries fish calamari and much more excellent working quality for the price,47,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,2.0,negative,i bought thisabout 6 months ago it had all the features i wanted was easy to break down and clean but it looked cheaply constructed now after 6 months the lid does not seal well and the handle on the fryer basket has broken which is a big safety hazard next time i will spend a little more money and buy a cuisinart,64,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,2nd time i used this fryer the timer know twisted off unfortunately the knob is made of plastic and is connected to a metal rod when i twisted the timer the metal rod stripped out the plastic do not buy this fryer,42,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i must say this is actually my first deep fryer and it is an excellent pick the deep fryer is huge and easy to use i feel safe and comfortable having it on the counter it is cool to touch a great buy,43,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we have owned this vacuum for 2 years and counting the only negative i can think of is that one must replace the hepa filter every 6 months however this is the standard rule for hepa filters and for 10 bucks on amazon it is considerably cheaper and more convenient than using a bag-type unit contrary to other reviews i have never had a problem with this vacuum in fact it consistently fills up the bag-less container every time we vacuum we were amazed with the amount of dirt this thing picks up we did not expect much when we purchased this vacuum due to the price but considering we use it about 15 - 2 times per week I had say this has been one heck of a bargain,126,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,this vacuum blows literally the exhaust fan blows in front of the vacuum at floor level so it blows everything you want to sweep ahead of you and into the air and you will never catch it until what is to heavy to become air borne is stopped by a wall this is not obvious on a rug because the rug camouflages it and holds the dust better but just try it and see on a bare floor granted you can overcome this design flaw by sweeping backward or only using the tools granted it also has good suction but that just means a stronger airflow coming out of the exhaust i bought this on the recommendation of consumer reports and i already wrote them a letter and told them to test it again hopefully with someone who knows how to vacuum i did not believe the previous amazon reviews that point out this problem because there has always some one who is not happy my mistake check out the other reviews and do not buy,169,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i got tired of having to drag out my big vacuum and having to switch heads everytime we have got mainly wood floors and a few area rugs and this little vac goes from one to the other with ease,39,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i have a bad back and two dogs that she had profusely when i read consumer reviews recent report that recommended this vacuum as being both powerful and light weight i thought this might pick up all the dog hair and not hurt my back i ran right out and got one i found it to be cheaply made which was sort of expected with it is 50 price tag it did a semi-ok job on hardwood floors but when i moved to carpet the suction was so strong that i could barely push or pull it and even although the suction was strong it only picked stuff up on the side that had the air in-take when i went to empty the dirt holder which had a lot of dog hair in it i tipped it upside down over the trash and nothing came out i had to shake it with all my might to get the thing to empty and then the filter fell out in the trash so i had to get that now-dirty thing replaced before i could finish up my back really hurt after vacuuming one floor with it needless to say this thing is being returned as soon as possible,201,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,no problems so far cleans very well just sounds awefully loud what do you want for 50,17,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,we bought this vacuum three months ago and my experience has been similar to the other 1-star reviews it is not worth the money it indeed blows dust on hardwood floors and is basically ineffectual on those surfaces we sweep first then vacuum the pile with one of the attachments and this really defeats the point of having a vacuum then the brush roller broke after 3 months just like the other writer noted it does not turn true it sounds like it is bearings are shot we got it out before it broke the belt or destroyed other internal parts no abuse to it otherwise it is just a faulty part that is not covered by warranty and is now out of stock for another month this is a very bad product and horrible corporate support as a customer you should be skeptical of buying any product from a company that does not stand behind their units this is yet another example of the evils of big-corporation america,164,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,vacuum supposed to have automatic height adjustment but nothing adjusts or changes for different carpet types contacted dirt devil twice and received different things to try but still does not adjust for different heights if you have different kinds of carpet this vacuum is not the one,47,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,this product works just fine in our home upstairs and downstairs i used to use it only on a couple rugs and hardwood floors but we have since moved to a place full of carpet carpet is bad enough but dirty carpet is worse this vacuum keeps it looking nice we have a toddler and it gets messy i have not had any issues with blowing dirt and yes the brush roll as with any I have owned will get stuck if there is too much hair string dental floss and more stuck on it in this case you take a scissors and cut it off then the belt will not burn and you can continue on with the vacuum,118,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend with carpeted floors i have hardwood and to me this is the most counterproductive cleaning device imaginable it literally blows dust away from you before you can get the suction part over the area there is a very powerful air output on the lower front of the cleaner right now i have dust bunnies and dog hair floating through my living room and am sneezing my head off as i write this if you want this effect you might as well sweep with a leafblower awful,96,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we like our dirt devil vacuum very much we were a little skeptical due to the price being low that it would not do the job we needed it to do we we were amazed and happy with it it does well on carpet as will as hard floors it is worth every penny i would recommend it to anyone wanting something smaller that does a good job it does a good job of picking up cat hair,78,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,bought this after reading reviews was not sure if i really wanted this type of vacuum as i am used to pulling around an old electrolux canister still getting used to the upright vacuum but boy does this thing suck up some dirt every time i empty the canister I am amazed and how much dirt I have picked up it is a very loud vacuum but I am over the noise factor when i see how much stuff it picks up,78,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,i can not say enough about this little vacuum it is absolutely amazing i have 2 dogs one of which sheds beyond belief and since i purchased this vacuum i have noticed less dust and hair building up around my house i use it at least every other day and i can not believe how well it performs i have hardwood floors throughout my home and before i purchased this vacuum i would have dog hair all around the floor and baseboards that seemed to build up when the ceiling fans were running since i began using this vacuum i rarely notice it anymore i just can not praise this vacuum enough,109,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,my husband and i have had this vacuum for about six years now it is been great we have not had any problems with it whatsoever it picks up unbelievable amounts of dirt and dust every time we vacuum you do have to change the filter every six months but other than that it is a good vacuum and has lasted us many many years and still going strong,66,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i know that many people do not like this machine but i think it is great maybe it is because my old vacuum is a canister and almost 30 years old it was top of the line when i got it and still works perfectly the dirt devil was so cheap that i thought I had buy it and have an extra vacuum on another floor I am glad i did i have three cats and this thing picks up the fur like nothing I have ever used i did not find that emptying the container and cleaning the filter was all that messy if you do it in a deep trash container it is no big deal it is a lot worse to change the bag on my canister my only complaint is that it is very noisy my cats agree,132,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,we can not keep vacuums in the industrial environment we work in this vacuum has worked good and is priced reasonably it is loud but what vacuum do you know that is quiet,32,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,i have received this dirt devil about two weeks ago so far i have not been disappointed in what it has done i can pick this one up without a problem and can use it on the stairs without a problem the only thing wrong with it was that i did not get instruction on how to put it together and there was no screws and i had to find them,71,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,I have only had this a couple of months so I shall have to see considering the complaints from people whose units broke but so far I am pretty thrilled we have to vacuum the carpets quite often because of the puppy dragging in dirty roots and all manner of things from the back yard we have very hairy shedding dogs and it is been great to just pull out this little thing and make it all go away within a few minutes our old canister was so expensive and bulky and did not pick up as well also the rug in my bedroom is kind of strangely made and the canister did not pick up the dog hair from there at all this one does i do understand the complaint about blowing but ours has nonetheless done fine on hardwood love the bagless element if it only lasts one year it will have been well worth the price yes noisy i really could not care less update three years later the vacuum has finally had it the carpet brush no longer works although it is still semi-operational we will get the same model again such a great price,190,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,4.0,positive,we bought this vacuum because consumer reports said it was excellent particularly on pet hair since we do have a pet and since i have long hair that is always getting caught in the carpet we bought it and think it works great all of the attachments work well it is a sporty red and really the only drawback is that it is quite loud but then again most vacuums are we love that it is bagless which seems a little more environmentally friendly and you can see through the canister so you know when it is full to empty it easy to use pretty lightweight and a good price highly recommended,108,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,roller and belt broke after a couple of months because hair got wrapped in it you also need earplugs because this vacuum cleaner screams,24,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i only used this once every few weeks and it broke after 4 months i called customer support and they were no help at all save your money,28,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,if i could attach a picture to show you what it picked up from our area rug i would and this is a rug i thought was clean already great performance for the price loud yes but I have heard louder before so I am not concerned with sound if it cleans this well i intend to use on rugs and carpets only so the blowing on hardwood floors does not concern me since i sweep and mop them anyway if you are a budget and want a good performer this is the way to go,92,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,i have this vacuum and it is now broken the bearing that holds in the brush is made of plastic it started vibrating causing a horrible noise eventually the vibration caused the plastic brush to come out of place and literally melt from the friction of rotation no worries although you can buy a replacement brush for about 20 5 s h which comes to 25 on a 50 vacuum cleaner yeah right the f1 filters are very difficult to find in stores although i found one at target selling for 40 80 of the cost of the whole vacuum cleaner you can get them online most places want to charge at least 20 but amazon has them for around 8 the vacuum does not do hardwood / tile floors it is carpet only it is quite noisy too but that is probably expected for such a low price not worth it since it breaks so easily and replacement parts are too expensive relative to the original low cost,166,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,this is not [ counter to consumer reports ] good for hard surfaces it blows all light material away from the vacuum with dog hair it is impossible other negatives very loud on / off is not for people with large shoes not overly ergonomic very disappointed,43,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,5.0,positive,great price for a great vacuum it is very powerful and flexible and gets the job done fast,17,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,not that great of a set because it is overpriced for one and there has almost no down in the comforter you are better off going to walmart or some place like that and buying one very disappointed,35,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter set in hopes it would fit in my washer it is the first king size comforter i have found that i can launder at home i wash it on delicate and dry on low heat it has held up very well to weekly washings so far all stains from baby formula to ink have washed out i am pleased thus far and considering buying sets for the kids,72,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,great quality comforter set only purchase for light summer use not ment for heavy winter use,16,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,it was soft and great right out of the bag however the 1st time we washed it feathers were everywhere by the time we washed it the 2nd time it was not more than just a piece of material and had to throw it away the tag said machine wash this one must have had a flaw in the material or was just cheaper made i bought one just like it 6 years ago and it looks as good as the day i bought it after multiple machine washings i was very disappointed in this product,95,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,what a remarkable value for the low price i was not sure what to expect but it is a lovely set at twice the price all pieces are well-fitting comforter is warm yet lightweight and an added bonus it is even reversible now i regret not getting a couple of other colors as well because they are all out of stock in cal king now,61,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,so i read the reviews but recongize that some people have unreasonable expectations you get what you pay for but this set is amazing and for the money fantastic i saw that people compained that the feathers came out i have never seen a one it is very warm yet is not too warm when your heat is up i have slept with the windows open and that soft cozy feeling is amazing i bought the khakiis very soft and feels like a super high quality set it comes with pillow shams and skirt you will just love it and do not be scared of the other posts,107,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,love theand how it keep you warm but a problom with the feathers comeing out the faethers is over every thing,24,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,this comforter set is okay if you do not mine wearing feathers all day long or seeing them all over your bed and room I have on had the comforter for about 3 weeks and feathers are everywhere even getting all over our clothes my husband is sick of it and just said yesterday that he has planning to take it to the salvation army and just buy a comforter from walmart the style and look is nice but the feathers coming through the fabric is insane,84,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i was excited to receive this set because i love there d and really wanted to try a down comforter i slept great the first night and i loved the microsuede fabric i did not like however how each time i touched it the feathers would come flying out each time i fluff it to make my bed there are feathers everywhere i hate that it is perfect as long as i do not sleep on it,76,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this purchase the quality far surpasses what i expected it is warm comfortable and only a few feathers seep out when i make the bed,29,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,what a dissapointing purchase the material is very thin the feathers are coming out everywhere and it does not provide any warmth i have a down comforter that is over 10 years old and it is much better than this new one now i just use both of them on the bed i should have returned it but did not,58,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i have this on my bed right now it is warm soft and light enough we do not roast to death but heavy enough to keep us warm it is really easy to clean we have taken it to the laundro-mat and washed it in the huge washer using the huge dryer adn tennis balls to make sure the stuffign was dry i would buy another for our daughters room but she has not decided on her colors yet,75,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this comforter to anyone from the time i took it out of the bag it came in feather have been everywhere it only gets worse as time goes on it is comfortable and warm and it would look good if not for the white feather all over the place,53,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,this comforter set arrived to me in a huge box i was like oh yeah until i opened it there was more paper in the box than comforter the comforter bag was so small like it was a sheet set i can not believe that there is no down in the dame thing i wonder why they only want 3500 for it because your getting a sheet set with 1 feather in it and called it adown comforter i read other reviews and they said that feathers are everywhere but i do not see how that is possible if it did not come with any feathers unless they some how lost the feathers during shipment laughing out loud or mywas bald go figure,123,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,it had very little to no down it looks like there is some filler it the photo but when i received it the comforter had no fill somehow it got passed quality control with no down in it,38,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,i purchased thisand sent it back after opening it the seams were coming apart and it was really thin i did not expect anything great but this was a lot less than i expected,35,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i love theand texture of this comforter however as mentioned in previous reviews it does not take long before the feathers start to come out i thought for the price i would try it and hope for the best unfortunately my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out this is not just an occasional feather either it started out that way but after a week or two it is all the time i especially notice it in the stitching areas disappointed,98,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i love my new comforter it is deliciously soft and comfortable be warned it is much too heavy for year-round use but perfect for a freezing winter night theis oh-so-slightly less vivid than in the picture but it is still a beautiful addition to my bedroom i would definitely order this product again,55,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,the microsuede is incredibly soft the pillow covers are great but i have feathers everywhere they come out very easily and make a mess of the entire place,28,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,this comforter was definitely worth the money i could not believe the quaility for the price i lost a few feathers but it is great,24,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,it is well worth the 35 bucks it is not too thick which means you can actually sleep with it and not sweat to death,23,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,for the 3500 i paid for this set it was well worth the money it is so warm so cozy so soft yet it looks very high-class it is not as poofy as the pictures make it look even after giving it a big fluff-up but it really does add a touch-of-class to our room and i wish i would have gotten the red set too for our other room the only problem that I have had is that the feathers / down come out a lot not really at the seams so much just at random places all over the comforter it is a little annoying always vacuuming them up but other than that it is been great,113,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,the comforter is soft and pretty however it is not very full and fluffy the worst of it is that the down feathers fall out of the comforters thin material and make a mess in the bed we are not able to use this comforter at all,46,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,no problem with the shams or bed skirt and i loved thebut the feathers in the comforter started coming out very quickly it really looks like i plucked a chicken on my bed i was less than pleased with the set but for the price i guess i got what i paid for,55,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,great deal for the price the stitching is very weak and has only one stitch accross each pattern if it breaks and there were breaks then it breaks loose it is not 100 down it says 75 on mine yet the ad says 100 eachhas a different feel to it and it is noticeable having said all of that i gave it a 4 because for the price you are getting something worth what you pay for it is warm and maintains the warmth not like the true 100 down comforters although,93,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,light soft warm good quality overall and i got it with extremely affordable price everyone loves it in the family,20,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,poor quality feathers everywhere i normally do not write reviews but i strongly suggest you do not get this,18,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,pros comforter is warm and you get a good night sleep cons you may get a good nite sleep but when you wake up you will find feathers allover the bed the feathers keep coming out from comforter cover i used this for a week and have thrown this i do not want the hassle of removing feathers from my bed every day can i get a refund on this,72,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,comforter slides off the bed not a bad thing since the feathers stab you in your sleep did i mention 100s of feathers come through the comforter and get everywhere got a deal but never expected this amazingly bad quality,40,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i have been pleased with my purchase of this comforter set it was not as puffy as i was expecting but it definately keeps us warm my only complaint is that it does she had feathers which show up against the darkthat we ordered,44,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,love the comforter it is so soft and very very warm better than the one i paid lots more money for so glad i jumped on it and got it when i did they went fast,35,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,the comforter is very nice and warm my only negative comment is that the feathers come out from time to time i am quite satisfied with it especially for the price,31,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,this was wonderful much less expensive than in the stores and good quality very happy with it,19,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i was extremely pleased with this comforter set it is very very warm even although it is not a thick comforter lightweight and warm that is a plus i have a cat that loves to lay on it and it has been the easiest to clean the hair off of that i have owned with a lint brush which makes the entire comforter look very nice love it,66,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,ordered this set in navy loved the look until i opened it white feathers inside the comforter would poke through the exterior top of blanket with debris it looked amess and very unattractive bought a lint brush to attempt to wipe off the feathers but that did not do anything i removed the comforter set from the bed within two weeks of having it i do not recommend thisat all maybe the lighter colors would work better but i am not willing to find out,86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,several years ago i purchased a comforter and shams as a gift it was three times the price of the one i just bought from amazon yet identical in every way with the exception that the amazon purchase also came with a bedskirt it is lightweight but warm has a good loft while still being flexible the filling is actually down and not the pin feathers that tend to crackle and end up poking through the fabric other reviews I have read on this product reflect disappointment that the shams are thin well they are shams you know it is the pillow within that gives a sham life honestly i did not expect this kind of quality for the price i paid very well made excellent price perfect purchase thank you so much,126,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,the comforter is very very soft and holds heat very well the only complaint i have is that the down feathers seem to be coming out but I am sure this would be solved with a duvet cover as i do not have one,42,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a great product for the price i have it on my bed now and looks wonderful,18,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i was not very satisfied with this product it is very thin and do not feel like a down comforter i guess there is little down fill in there i did not want to deal with the return procedure and pay the shipping to send it back so i end up kept it to use on the sofa,56,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i am from arizona and wanted a light weight down comforter did not realize it came with shams and skirt best buy anyone could fine nice quality and fit,28,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a good comforter for the price amazon is selling it for i wish the microsuede was on both sides because you can only feel the softness if you are sleeping on it it is also kind of short for a queen bed,43,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,we got a great deal and worth the money it does have a luxurious feeling it does it is job well keeps you warm,20,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,the price was really good however it was very thin and not very warm i would have to however that the worst part about the blanket is that it sheds feathers all over the place basically rendering it useless do not buy unless you like feathers all over your pajamas and floor,52,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,this is just cheap all over but i guess for the price what do you expect i now use it as a pillowtop for my mattress and it is fulfulling that duty pretty well,33,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,if i had known that down fill means feathers i would not have brought thisfeathers were everywhere i would not recommend thisto no one only if they like feathers very dissatisfied,35,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i like this quilt because i do not have to worry about the cover twisting around but i have had it for a year and it is not going to survive much longer it is losing feathers at an alarming rate,38,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a nice warm mild weather comforter it is soft and comfie but suffers from a common failing it leaks a few feathers now and again,26,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i got one of these and after a few days feathers are coming out everywhere looks ok and feels nice but not worth the mess it makes pulling feathers out,31,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,when first opened was thinner than expected was able to fluff up by washing it very warm and comfy,19,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,we just recently bought this comforter set off amazon for a great deal we were pleasantly surprised when it arrived and found it to be of great quality and extremely soft it is replacing our old down comforter that we loved so much and i can honestly say that this one is just as good as our first one that we paid lots of money for so if there are any available definitely buy as this is a great comforter set for the money and would make great christmas gifts my husband loves it too,94,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i really love this comforter set i read a couple of reviews before i purchased it so i knew what to expect it is not too big and fluffy which is fine for me because I had rather wash it myself than send it to the dry cleaners it is very soft and comfortable and i complimented it with some nice throw pillows so it looks awesome,64,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i ordered this down comforter set in brown for my 13yo son i just love it and more importantly so does he he has never had a down comforter before and could not believe how warm and cozy it is the brown microsuede is an impressive and durable fabric just before writing this review i asked him what his review would be his reply was it was sent straight from heaven yeah a little dramatic but he really loves it the reverse side of the comforter is a cotton or a cotton blend that is slightly lighter inthan the microsuede i will be using the bedskirt to construct some box pleat valances for his room just because with everything on his bed it was just too much brown i am also going to be ordering this set for my youngest sister who was jealous that a 12 year old had this nice of a comforter set she thought it was a 200 set,164,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,my boyfriend and i just bought a new house and now that we are unpacked we finally have a chance to start decorating the house is very modern so we are using a lot of black and chrome for our accent colors i was a bit impulsive when purchasing this set however the fact that the duvet is down and that it came with a matching dust ruffle really sold me the dust ruffle brings the entire set together it provides a much sleeker look i was hoping the down duvet would have been a little thicker but overall i am very impressed with what i was able to get for the money in addition i thought the pillow shams were perfect usually shams are too thick and bulky so i do not put them on the pillows i sleep with however these shams were thinner yet elegant and very soft / comfortable enough to place on a pillow you will be sleeping with not just for decoration great buy excellent value,168,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,at first i was not that thrilled i thought it would be fluffier / fuller and the shams looked really cheap however i went and checked out some other down comfronters and realized that they were the same fill as mine and they were 6x the price after a nights sleep i was in love it was soft soothing and warm the next day i matched it with a bright pink 300tc sateen sheet set from amazon and it really made it pop the next day when i came in from work i felt like i was in a new room it even looked as if i spent much more than i did it is a great buy the shams are still cheap looking but you can dress them up with extra pillows from the money you save,134,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,3999 for a great little comforter set got the chocolate brown one to put on bed in our lake cabin and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality very warm soft and nice looking comes with comforter 2 shams and bed skirt we got free shipping so even better deal,50,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,there are more hooks than needed so you can fit the highest ammount of unusual sized mugs i bought two and fit 6 regular mugs on one and only 4 giant mugs on the other my narrow width shelves are set in so the rack slips on and does not get in the way of the doors the mugs hang freely which means theyforward so i can not slam my cupboard doors or I shall smash my cups but who does that anyways the doors close easily the metal holder does stick up on the upper part however it is symmetrical so large flat plates fit nicely or bowls centered but i would not put more cups above it without laying a flat cutting board or something similar overall the best looking mug racks durable well balanced and above all else functional,143,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this mug holder looks nicer than many but the way it is built it is virtually useless unless you have very skinny shelves it is all one piece that is supposed to slide onto a shelf but if it is not a small shelf it will not fit unless you bend it far apart then once you get it on the shelf you can not put anything directly above it due to the thickness of the piece that holds it in place it causes anything up there to fall over because it can not sit straight i am going to be purchasing a different unit because this is pretty much worthless,107,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this holder is pretty cool but i have 2 problems with it first it has pegs to hold 8 cups but i can not get 8 of my cups on it and my cups are not overly large second because of the way it fits over the shelf the door of the cabinet hits the arms and prevents the door from closing all the way i can deal with both of these problems and consider them minor so i still give the holder 4 stars,83,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like this mug rack as it keeps my coffee cups out of the cabinet and within easy reach there is a smallin the cabinet door where i have put this but it is not noticeable,37,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i bought two racks for all of my coffe cups i love them extremely good price,16,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not work for me so i gave away,8,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if you have the 3/4 width shelf this will be a snug good fit it holds six normal coffee mugs probably would hold eight matched tea cups happy with the purchase,31,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,smaller spaces than expected my mugs do not fit in it,10,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,a couple things while i really like theand design visuals the racks are too small to hold most of todays sized cups i can squish three together the weight of the coffee mugs is bending the pronged portion of the rack down and away from the cabinet i do think these are good quality but only if you are using them for small 6 - 8 oz cups nothing larger,69,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i do not realize it did not bolt to shelf but it actually works better than i would of expected had it bolted no problem at all with hanging my cups,29,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,if you have normal size coffee cups or mugs do not expect to be able to fit one on each hook i was able to fit at most 3 on each side and they still clanked together however my teacups fit quite nicely be aware although if your shelving is in anyway robust enjoy the struggle of attempting to slide this puppy on there,63,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,hooks need to be farther apart can not fit a reasonable amount of cups to actually save space,17,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i collect pretty big mugs so i can only use 3 hooks on each side but it is really easy to install keeps my mugs safe and saves a bunch of shelf room,32,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the hooks are so close to the shelf it is difficult to put the cup over the hook to get it on or off it will not hold 5 cups on each side only 3 to the most,37,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not hold as many cups as advertised because you have to use every other rung,16,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,while the hooks were too close together to hang my mugs i will use it to hang belts and scarves in my closet it is very well made and fits over the closet shelf without the screws good product can you make a version that allows for larger mugs,49,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very sturdy and i like that it is for 10 cups not 8 like others because of the design the cups nest in each other and i love that because it looks more organized,34,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not fit all the cups to small unless you have small tea cups,14,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,actually holds 6 - 8 big mugs so i am satisfied,9,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,love this it definitely does not hold 10 cups unless they were tiny but i easily got 6 on exactly what i wanted,22,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,love this very sturdy and heavy duty was worried that the weight of the mugs would not hold but this is super reliable and it has gel grips to keep it from sliding around my mugs are bigger so it only only 6 but i already knew that from reading previous reviews overall a great purchase and a space saver in our apartment kitchen,63,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i have pretty small cups and i can not put the all in on one side,15,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,fit next to my coffee maker perfectly i wish the hooks were spaced a bit bigger but not bad,19,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,seems fairly sturdy however hooks are too narrowly close together i was looking for more of a hanging mug display for a cosmetic,23,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,do not like it at all would like to return,9,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,how does anyone actually fit more than 2 or three mugs on each side i thought this would be a space saver for my cupboard but it really does not do much i can not fit neatly the amount of mugs on it as advertised,43,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,these would have been great if it fit over he shelf it has to be a thin shelf,18,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is a great rack for small cups in order to use all of the hooks if your cups are bigger you can only put 2 cups on each side but it worked for me i bought 2 of these i have small cups for one rack and the other holds my 4 larger cups make sure that you think about the height of your cabinets your cups will hang down and you may have to raise your shelf up a little i did,85,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i wish i would have listened to the other reviews this looks like a great product but it will not fit all the way in the cabinet if you bend the top piece to make it fit then the top arm sticks up and you can not use that part of the shelf,51,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i could only fit three coffee cups on each side and it is not the space saver i expected,18,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very attractive and sturdy storage for my mugs without losing more of my very limited cabinet space,17,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i do not know why people leave such low stars for these they are great you can not fit 10 normal sized coffee cups on one but you can fit 6 works for us,32,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,wow i love it it does not look cheap it fits nicely on myshelving unit,16,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,had a very hard time trying to get it on my cabinet after i did i wanted to move it but did not want to go through all the trouble again so i just took it down and gave it away,40,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,just got these in and i agree with other reviewers that they are not good for sliding onto standard shelves at all measuring toward the joint there is only a half inch between the arch of the holders and the bracket i got it about 4 arches in before having to give up with the outside portion no longer lying flat in doing so i also broke one trying to open up the bracket enough to slide the last arch on it looks like some of the mounting posts for the screws are bent too far inward my shelves are 3/4 thick gave up ended up screwing them into the bottom of the shelves which i had purposefully bought this particular product to avoid it is nice looking and works in half it is capacity but do not purchase if you are hoping to slide this onto a shelf more than 1/2 thick too big of a gamble that you will get one that will not slide on edit 2 to 1 star they hold about 2 3 coffee mugs on each side so a total of 4 for me depending on the depth of your shelves,194,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,was too narrow to fit on our standard size shelf and broke when i tried to expand it,18,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,trying thisbecause the books are too close together and they do not hold coffee cups because of that shipping was on time but the product definitely did not do what was described,33,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,space saving way to store mugs as well as display your favourite ones we have ours over the sink can only hold 3 mugs per side although or they do not hang properly maybe if you had tea cups but who does that,42,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this is a greatbut it was way bigger than i thought and hung down a lot lower if i use it i can not have any mugs below it so it does not really save space also you can not fit a mug on every hanging piece maybe every other one even for smaller mugs it is a greatthough hopefully they can update it with a few changes to make it work better,77,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,bought this for inside my cabinet but it just does not fit quite right and the weight of the mugs seems like it might be an issue over time so I am going to try mounting it under my cabinets hopefully then I shall be able to safe store more than 2 mugs on it if not i will be returning it,59,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not fit over the lip of my cupboard,8,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,my mom had one of these and i ordered one because the quality is very nice,16,41

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this are made for smaller cups if you want them for mugs you can only fit four,17,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i could not attach it underneath the cabinet very disappointed,10,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,love it it will only hold 6 med size coffee cups if you had small coffee cups it might hold 10,21,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected holds 6 normal size coffee mugs,10,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works good but is definitely meant for smaller cups i have to leave an empty hook in between my larger mugs,21,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,our china cups look great hanging where people can see them,10,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,cup hooks stink which is why i prefer this little under the shelf unit fills the same purpose as cup hooks but without drilling into the shelves,27,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,fits great on the shelf of my kitchen cabinet holds about 6 - 8 regular size mugs comfortably besti ever purchased saves me room and the mugs do not fall all over the place anymore no more stacking the mugs life changer laughing out loud woohoo,44,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,description says mug rack but mugs do not fit on it it is made for smaller coffee cups,16,52

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,came quickly installs easily and i love that it saves me counter space,13,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,way to small to hold coffee mugs maybe some tiny tea cups not spaced far enough apart,17,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these do not sag and I am not using the screws because I am a renter at least they do not sag enough for me to see it with the naked eye and I have got these loaded up completely full with china teacups and glass / stainless steel espresso cups if i were hanging big ceramic mugs on them yeah they would probably sag but as it is right now they are doing a beautiful job rescuing my awkwardly sized kitchen,74,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works but hanging design could have been better,8,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,bought for son to use he likes a lot promptly shipped and good price value,15,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i had to return the mug holder it does not hold 10 mugs it holds maybe 4 you have to skip a hook between mugs to get them to fit and I am not talking about huge mugs i tried with regular coffee cups,43,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,unfortunately my shelves were to wide and it did not fit very well made,13,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,a little hard to install once you get to the very end of the unit tight fit once installed worked great wish i would have put it in a different location so that i can have my entire cabinet but oh well gave me room to put 4 mugs on the rack could not hold 10 if i tried on it and my other 4 mugs below the unit,67,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,fits the shelf and looks cool but did not really realize until i tried it that it will not fit ten full size mugs they knock into each other as the hangers are so close together still fits six nicely and could fit ten smaller cups,45,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,even although it has 10 prongs you will only be able to fit 6 normal sized cups on it,18,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this rack looks nice but I am pretty sure it is made for a expresso cups or super tiny coffee cups i could only fit 4 average sized mugs on it i ended up putting my measuring cups onto shower curtain rings and hanging them from it so it would not be a complete waste of money,55,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,disappointed that it does not hold as many mugs as there are hooks only holds six total,16,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,received the product as described in product posting and received it fast worked great under our kitchen cabinet,18,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,after reading all the reviews i still went out and brought this product figured i can make it work wrong this is a waste of money can not even get 4 mugs on there let alone 10 the hooks are way too close to each other preventing other mugs to hang on decided to just get mug hooks at home depot and screw them in under the cabinets,66,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the ad shows a picture of it being clipped to the shelf above it this can not be done even the detail shows a sizeable opening in the clip but it is less than l/2 and much too small to clip to the standard kitchen shelf if installed with screws it will hang so low as to make the shelf below unusable so no space saving at all in fact you could stack the cups in less space than this would take up,83,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,unfortunately i could only get 4 mugs on it so it is back in the box would cost me too much to return it so it will sit here until i can perhaps find someone who can use it,38,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,did not fit on shelf or under cabinet possible design flaw or it might be our cabinets as they are older either way we could not use it,26,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,will buy again perfect size for shallow cabinets and shelves,10,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this only fits very small mugs normal sized mugs must be placed on every other rung and get crowded you also can not place anything on the top shelf because that is where it slides in takes up more room than it creates,41,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,can hold 6 regular morning coffee type mugs and allows me to put a few more cups and mugs between the arms in the cabinet this is a cute addition to my coffee area of the kitchen,37,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,cool concept to save space but did not fit the shelves nor the varying mugs placed into it,17,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,does not fit my cabinets so will try to use in china cabinet if it does not work I shall return,18,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this did not fit under my shelf properly the bar at the top that is supposed to slide onto the shelf did not slide on properly i returned it,29,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is a beautiful well made product that is exactly what i was looking for I am enjoying it in my kitchen it would also work great in a closet for scarves beautiful design and very sturdy,36,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,liked the first one so much i bought another,9,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,not a bad product but small spacing would only work with tea cups,13,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,it does not let you close door cabinet it sticks out not attractive and very small tea cups fit will return,20,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,look closely at the write up i did not but the product will work anyway,14,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,the hooks are a bit close together meaning i have to space my mugs two hooks apart but i just bought two of these to make up for it problem solved,32,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,the hooks are too close together for standard size mugs i use them for my tea cups so it is perfect to keep from stacking the delicate china,27,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted keeps my coffee mugs near my espresso machine and with my other coffee supplies i did not install it under the cabinets so have not used the included screws,32,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,does not really hold many mugs 4 to 6 since the arms are poorly spaced i did not install it because it was pretty worthless,24,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is exactly what i was looking for,8,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,do not waste your money by playing around you might get six small mugs on this but it does not even fit well on the shelf unless your cups nest perfectly they just hang down all wibbly wobbly big disappointment,38,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,perfect for my tea cup collector daughter might have to order another one,13,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,disappointing it looks nice but when installed i can not get the door on one of my brand new kitchen cabinets fully closed now why did not they test this product in real kitchen cabinets before they started selling them earlier i had purchased one of the under the shelf 10-hook space saver espresso cup storage drying rack cupboard mug holder mygift now that one fits perfectly unfortunately i bought the last one available from amazon and the message is that they do not know when it will become available again that is really a shame because it is a far superior product to the one from spectrum after all what use is an under-the-shelf cup holder that sticks out so you can not shut the cabinet door,125,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it will not hold 10 mugs and if you moun it to slide onto shelf the closet doors do not close and if you screw oount it under the shelf you lose too much room in the cabinet and again it will not hold all the mugs it is supposed to hold,52,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,made for use inside the cabinet to narrow to fit underneath,10,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very sturdy and well-made fit my 3/4 inch shelf perfectly without wobbling around the only drawback is that my mugs face a different direction than i prefer i just put some s-hooks on them so the mugs are shown better with the side design facing forward also saving space with hanging longer mugs,53,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the hooks are too close together you can only put 2 mugs on each side and you end up with not enough room below for other cups i can fit things much better in my shelf by just shoving them in I had return it if i had not thrown the packaging out darn,52,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works although the spacing between is too small to really store 10 coffee cups,14,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,way too small did not fit more than 2 mugs on each side,13,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,if you can find a shelf that works with this holder it is a really great little organizer i was not able to use it in my kitchen cabinets but it works great on my pantry shelves it is sturdy and is holding 10 tea cups easily it would not hold 10 mugs because the mugs were too big to all fit on the hooks,63,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,great product make sure you do not have any word thick trim inside your cabinets or this product will not fit,20,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,product quality is ok can be mounted under cabinet with the screws provided not sure how much weight can be placed on this rack,24,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,these are too narrow to fit on a shelf with trim so unless it is a bare shelf the rack will not fit i would advise against these,27,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,okay for tiny cups not regular sized cups,8,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,did not slide fully into the cabinet about an inch stuck out i had to return it,16,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,good product had a little trouble fitting under shelve but i made it work,14,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,hangers were too close together for my mugs granted i like huge coffee mugs and expected to have to use every other hook but i could not even put two to one side useless to me,35,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is going to work for me and I am getting more for my smaller coffee and tea cups easy to put on heavy,23,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it works for me but it definetly does not fit big mugs uniformly if your cabinet shelf is not set back from the door you can not use the the two hooks on the end but it frees up space so you can fit them underneath all in all i like it and am glad i purchased it,57,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,the product literally fell apart 2 days after sliding it onto my shelf thankfully there was no damage to my cups,21,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,awesome product fits about 6 cups depending on size,9,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,seems sturdy and like thebut no way can fit 5 standard mugs on each side much more appropriate for small tea cups espresso cups or cups that all fit within each other I am fitting maximum of 3 on each side still helps clear out space on shelves,49,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,can not hang mugs as holders too close together worthless as mug holder,12,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,a bit tight can not hand mugs only smaller tea cups,10,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i definitely would not buy this again i have standard run of the mill cabinets in a house built in 2006 nothing unusual i had to pound the poop out of this thing with a hammer to get it to fit it is definitely made for super skinny cabinet shelves can store up to ten mugs or tea cups I am not sure where they are getting their mugs but it might fit 10 espresso cups I am giving it 2 stars because at least it is sturdy,84,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i hesitated to buy this for a few months after reading some of the reviews however after finally purchasing it I am happy to give this product 5 stars it fits on my shelf perfectly it holds 10 cups perfectly does exactly what it says and looks nice too,48,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,did not fit right as my shelf was to thick also you can get a coffee mug on every hook as there is not enough space,25,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this is for small cups i can only get 4 mugs on it you can not really tell that until you try it,22,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,very poor design does not even hold teacups correctly,9,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this is the second one i bought the first one worked out so well that after receiving new disney mugs for christmas i bought another just like the first one,30,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,perfect for my cafe cups frees up shelf space for other cups,12,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,construction andare fine just very poor design shelf must be very thin maybe 1/4 inch for it to slide onto shelf i had to break off first hook just to get it to work even poorly disappointed to find one on same search page that does not have this flaw not worth the effort to return so it is lost bucks figure out what I am talking about before you buy,70,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works great if mugs are too heavy although it will droop solved by securing it with thread,17,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,easy to install does not hold 10 normal size cups had to skip holders to get 6 to fit but you can put 2 cups per holder for a total of 12,31,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,you can only fit a few coffee cups on it,10,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like this product a lot it keeps my coffee cups handy just if you want to hang mugs will use only 3 hangers from each side,27,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,this is a ridiculous design the hooks are only an inch and a half apart you can not hang mugs or tea cups it only has one function to hang cups and it does not do it i am send ing mine back it is neither use nor ornament,49,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,good quality and design but i had to return it because it would not slide on to the cabinet shelf as one of the pictures theis too narrow for my new cabinet which has thicker shelves however it also comes with 4 screws for mounting if you are fine with drilling on your cabinet i did not want to drill any extra holes on my new cabinets,68,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works great all of our coffee cups and stemmed glassware are hanging by these under our cabinets it pretties up our kitchen and it frees cabinet room these holders are also really sturdy,33,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,good quality but did not fit in my cabinet properly,9,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this would have work if my mugs were tiny the hooks are too close and i could not fit more than four mugs,22,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these look super wonderful in my cupboards they do fit 4 large mugs comfortably on each rack as is what i was expecting from other reviews great space saver and very secure,32,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works great for mugs that are all the same type if you have large worlds best dad type mugs this will probably only hold six,25,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this thing works ok but the spacing for normal mugs seems a little too close together we can fit 6 mugs rather than 10 if you have tiny mugs or mugs that nest inside each other really well then this would be great also keep in mind the measurements of this and the depth of your cabinet some of these are different depths different listings similar product,67,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i could only put two mugs on each side I am not sure what they consider a mug but mine are bigger than a cup i could not even get eight of my china coffee cups on this hanger without them stacking totally disappointed in the description of this,49,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,the spaces are to short between the hooks so you can not hang out 6 cups of regular size,18,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i brought this to try and reduce the amount of mugs in my cupboard only problem it only holds really small mugs and they have to be the same size i am only able to keep 4 small mugs on it i did not even bother to put up the second one i ordered,53,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,you need a very specific situation in order to be able to use thisadditionally i paid 1050 which i consider too high and thishas gone up in price what crazy your shelf to install it on has to be thin otherwise it will not slide on you have to have high distance from the stuff below otherwise you can not put anything on the shelf below it and you can not put anything on the shelf above it either junk unless you have a very specific use additionally do not bother trying to install it under the shelf unless you do not mind going to a hardware store to purchase the correct hardware the screw heads are too tiny to hold the dern thing up properly so you need either different screws or the correct sized washers should be able to install something like this in 10 minutes as it is it will take a lot more effort than i am willing to put forth in order to be able to hang 6 coffee mugs oh yea it will take 10 tiny ones little cutesy tea cups but not normal coffee cups for a red blooded american who drinks coffee,199,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it is sturdily made it attached to the underside of the cabinet with 4 screws and when fully loaded does not sag under the weight of 8 teacups consider your type of cups because anything more than cups that nest when stacked upright will not hang well or many mugs 4,49,135
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i have to return this because the hooks are too large i wanted to use it under cabinet for hanging my utensils it appears to be sturdy enough to hold heavy mugs very well,34,136
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i love it look good on lower shelf and fits perfect on 1/2 inch shelf cabinet door close perfect too,20,137
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,easy to mount under cabinet but barely holds 4 to 6 regular size mugs i would not have purchased this particular rack had i realized,24,138
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i like it although it does not hold as many mugs as i expected it all depends on the size of the mugs to hold the described ten mugs it looks good and suits my needs i am pleased with the purchase,41,139
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,there are a lot of questions on thispertaining to how thick a shelf it can hang on and more i found that the slip over function fits a shelf made from a standard one by board so 3/4ths of an inch thick apporximately 25 cm i used it inside my kitchen cabinet freeing up valuable shelf space and the door closes just fine with it in place as the description indicates there are 4 spaces for screws if you prefer to mount it to the underside of a set of cabinets a lot of reviews noted that the hooks are spaced for small tea cups which is accurate meaning that using the standard american style coffee mug you will only be able to hang 4 maybe 6 mugs on this rack if you are clever it seems sturdy and well made the finish did not have any noticeable flaws that i could detect,153,140
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,i can only use 3 of the 5 hooks on each side because they are too close together it barely holds 4 coffee cups on each side either way i have hooks on both sides that are empty,38,141
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,very nice and sturdy price is pretty competitive with in-store retailers the rack fits snugly and securely onto the shelf almost too snugly the part that fits on the shelf is coated with a thin clear layer of plastic to ensure better adhesion my shelves are not quite 1/2 thick but i had to open up the rack to get it to fit on so that there was no excess poking out in the front try putting it on the shelf first to decide if you need to open it up a bit more although,95,142
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product really made my limited shelf space for my many mugs i am a semi-collector much less cluttered and much more neat it slides onto the shelf fine and is very sturdy the only thing i would like to say in a somewhat negative light is that like others have pointed out you are not going to be able to put a mug on each of the rings they are much too close together i have a variety of sizes of mugs but using my small normal sized mugs i can only fit 6 3 on each side however i ended up purchasing two of these and they work absolutely great for what i needed,116,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this did not work on my shelves the opening for sliding over the shelf is really narrow and would not slide over my shelves in the cupboard plus the hooks are so close together that you can only get two regular size coffee mugs on each side there is no way you could put 5 coffee mugs on each side,58,144
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it is called a mug holder but it does not really fit mugs mine are small as mugs go under 4 and i can only fit on every other hook also can not use hooks closet to door as interferes with door closing with a mug on it kept it as i have not found a better over the shelf holder i do not want to make holes in my new cupboards maybe should be called a cup holder,75,145
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,true it holds 6 of my mugs perfectly but that is all i needed it for so it works great for my needs i love it,25,146
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if you have traditional coffee cups the ones that look slightly larger than a tea cup then you can get away with just one if you have american sized coffee cups or larger 12 oz get more a 10 oz cup is about the limit if you expect to get one on each rung i managed to fit my 16 oz cups on each rung but it looked awful very cluttered however once i set it up for every other rung it looked fantastic the quality is good i have 1inch thick open shelves and this gripped them nice and tight if you have something thicker or need to close a door over it i would suggest a mounted system or hooks instead there are two screws included if you feel your shelf may need extra reinforcement i felt they were unnecessary in my case overall a really great product,148,147
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,holds only four standard sized mugs that is it i supposed if you really really small mugs this would be of use but who has and uses tiny mugs,27,148
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,great little gadget and it needed a high score think this is the coolest thing to have in my kitchen everyone who has coffee cups or needs things to hang stuff,31,149
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,the quality of the material is very goog for the price and it looks very nice too the only bad thing it only holds 4 big mugs,27,150
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,only small tea cups will fit on this rack any kind of mug is to large to use all the hooks i had to return it,26,151
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it did what i she wanted it could be less obtrusive that is a muted gray the hooks could be movable for spacing,22,152
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,do not believe for one second that this product will hold 10 mugs as advertised it holds 6 mugs and they are all knocking into each other beware they list this product as an under the shelf mug holder yet the box says under the shelf cup holder which explains why it can not hold the advertised 10 mugs i give it 2 stars to be nice because it does screw under the shelf and hold some mugs so it does what i needed in a sense but they are complete liars when they say holds 10 mugs,97,153
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,just what we needed real space saver easy to install and looks good glad i got two happy to shop at home,22,154
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,works just as described would buy this product again without a doubt made the cluttered cabinet no sightly and good looking organized yeah does not fit one cup per rung i attached with small bolts through the cabinet shelf and worked for me used for eight cups,46,155
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,our shelf was a little too thick to just slide it on but it mounted nicely under the shelf screws were provided but i added flat washers to provide more holding area i looks like it could hold 10 cups but i think they would have to be very small i used every other hook and got three smallish mugs hanging on each side overall it is a really nice space-saver since plates or saucers can be stacked underneath,78,156
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,works for mugs but if the mugs are larger you can only place a cup on every other hanger may hold six at best i placed it under our cabinet and above the coffee maker for convenience but use it more for decoration rather than for the cups i actually use,51,157
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this thing is perfect for making use of extra space in a small condo kitchen some reviewers have complained that they can not fit cups on all of the racks these are coffee drinkers that apparently have never heard of espresso cups anyway this thing will hold 6 coffee cups or 10 espresso cups,54,158
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,only gave it 4 stars as it does not hold as many cups as it is suppose to but it does work would i buy it again no if you have tea cups it will work fine,35,159
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this is listed as a mug holder however mugs do not fit it is a cup holder it was good quality but did not meet my needs,26,160
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this rack is way too small for mugs small cups like the older corelle would be fine but anything being described as a mug can be stored on this rack,30,161
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i was looking forward to having an elegant looking holder / rack in my cupboard unfortunately this one did not fittoo narrow so i ended up returning it,27,162
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,bought it to hand mugs and coffee cups and i can only fit small tea cups on it correctly because where it mounts,23,163
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i bought this under shelf mug holder to display my coffee cups in the china cabinet it works great with regular size coffee cups have nohow it would do for mugs it was a perfect fit for what i needed,42,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,if hanging coffee mugs was an art form then this thing would be displayed in the louvre or whatever it is nice it is holds coffee mugs since it does it is job there no need to boil into a literary rave on the thing,41,165
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it was so hard to put on my shelf i finally gave it up and donated ti to my local thrift store hopefully some one will get some use out of it,32,166
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,this works well for smaller mugs you could only get probably 4 large mugs on this that said it is sturdy well made and attractive,23,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,it looks fine but the cup hooks are not far enough apart so you have to space out your cups please note i said cups not mugs if you wish to hang mugs it is even worse i have smaller than normal cups and i can not hang one on every hook because they get in each others way poor design should have spaced the hooks out further,66,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i like this rack it is easy to use i put it under my cabinet for easy reaching the cups,20,169
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,this unit is made fairly sturdy and looks pretty good but it is touted as being able to hold 10 cups however i have regular-sized cups and i can get only 3 per side there is no way at all that one could get 5 per side unless those cups were doll-house cups haha i bought this to utilize under the shelf space but I am only able to use 60 of the advertized capacity I am going to keep it because it is not a bad unit however it is actually not what i was wanting or expected,95,170
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,installs pretty easily there has enough tension in the lip that i did not need screws to mount it the last cup moustache was taller than the other two so i had to hammer it flatter to make the whole thing fit on my cabinet shelf a bit more flush also i think it could have been designed a bit better the front hanger moustache is too close to the door so you hit a cup with a horrible sound every time you close the door looks like it fits 10 cups but it is more like 4 comfortably or 6 if you jam them in there wish i got a sideways one,110,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product is made with good quality it does exactly what it is suppose to do it fits perfectly in the cabinet and holds your coffee cups the downside you can only put smaller mugs on the rack because larger ones takes up too much space,44,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,it would be great for thin shelfs it is great for tea cups made a lot of room in my cabinet however my kitchen shelf is thick and my husband put it on the shelf because it was to tight for me to due,44,173
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this product is exactly as described in the advertisement it was everything i expected it to be and i am pleased with the quality of the,27,174
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i wish the hooks were further apart so that it could handle mugs better i hate leaving hooks un-used quality is ok,22,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,to small will not work with even small mugs makes shelf above not usable gave it to someone else and they do not like it,24,176
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,these are really difficult to put up by yourself but it is possible and they are really cool when you have finished,21,177
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,as expected easy to install sturdy i can only fit 6 standard cups instead of the 8 suggested it works,20,178
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i intended to screw this to the underside of my cabinet which worked wonderfully so the size of the arm versus the size of my shelving was not an issue for me i like the way it looks in the kitchen and was able to get several mugs on it however the prongs are not spaced quite as far apart as i had anticipated and the mugs hang very close together which means some of the larger ones do not fit at all when placed directly next to each other i chose to hang my smaller mugs and teacups which incidentally were also what i planned to hang in the first place a few larger mugs could fit if they were staggered although it would be pointless for someone to purchase thisif only half of the space were available for use i am happy enough with it that i am purchasing a second one,156,179
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,not made to hang normal coffee cups only for the tea cup type can you fit more than 4 cups,20,180
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i ordered this product because it is similar to an undershelf wine glass holder which i really like although it has 8 hooks it does not hold 8 coffee mugs i even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks which would eventuallyto chipping it barely fit over the cabinet shelf although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem buy this product only if your coffee / tea cups are very small,78,181
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,the product arrived in time and was as pictured however i could not put it on the bottom of my cupboards as i originally planned due to the size of my cupboard which is a bummer but not the products fault,40,182
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,this is a very eye pleasing rack so i am glad to use it on my wire shelves that i use as a pantry in my kitchen i just used the plastic zip thingies and attached it to the closest wires on the rack and snipped off the excess looks fine but when i went to hang my coffee cups i was very disappointed with the spacing of the hooks and could only manage to hang 4 cups i have 12 and 4 other hooks i guess i should get rid of a few but they are all really nice mugs sanga mikasa and more i guess i could use a set out in the garden other than that i really like it and may order a few more and hang other items off of them,135,183
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,main problem i can not place normal sized mugs on all the arms because there is too little space between each one it is a pretty major design flaw i think it would work as designed if you were only hanging expresso size cups i can not comment on the under-shelf feature as i mounted mine under the cabinet last issue is that because it is mounted the weight of the mugs causes the side that would otherwise be supported by the cabinet to sag i would look for a different product if you are interested in hanging more than 4 normal or oversized mugs from the holder,104,184
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,i do like this product it fits nicely in my cabinet and holds 8 mugs notice there are 5 hooks but in my cabinet only 4 mugs can fit on each side because of the space i suppose with more room or if i put under my cabinet not inside then all 5 would fit on each side overall i really like the product and i will probably order another one,71,185
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,i really love this thing it comes with four screws that you can use to hold it in place but i find that it works just fine without them i do have little tea cups so i can not comment on how well the oversized mugs work hanging on it but for my cabinets it is a great space saver i also like that it looks interesting unlike all the other styles i found it measures 105 inches deep 9 inches wide and hangs down almost 2 inches under the shelf,90,186
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,these are designed for tea cups that fit into each other not for coffee mugs as they are to big and do not fit into each other,26,187
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,i bought this to create more space and it did nothing but take it up it does not hold all the cups it says it will it is not worth the money i spent on it i would not recommend this to anyone buyer beware,43,188

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,i would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that i saw before i purchased one i thought it was going to be real light but when i received it it was definitely a heavy weight lid for 10 it was a real bargain they must have made it heavier since the one in the article do not buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch it is excellent,85,0

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,this lid is flimsy but better than nothing it also does not sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot,23,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,great for those lidless pots it fits any pots up to 10 only drawback is that it does not fit my largest frying pan which is 12,26,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,i use this lid every day it replaced one that was years old the size is perfect it fits every pot I have set it on,25,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,when i received the package it was already bent up probably because it is not made very well the metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it will definitely bend i suppose it is good for your most basic needs but other than that do not be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid,59,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,I am not sure what lid the other reviewers received who said that theirs was flimsy because the one i received is very strong it would be hard to bend or dent this it is small but it is perfect for small pans i like it,44,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,it does what i need it to do it is very light weight and would be easy to bend out of shape but it is the answer to a need i have other pots and pan lids are just to big,39,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,the description says that this lid fits all but it does not and the material is so cheap i needed it for a casserole that i have bought from goodwill but it did not even come close and it is a 16 casserole,41,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,this is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids i agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy which is why i gave it four stars instead of five mine had a teeny tiny dent in it but really no biggie not as good quality as the old one i have but useful nonetheless as i need one for home and one for the camper,86,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,there has nothing wrong with this lid other than i did not think it through in terms of size before ordering this is not big enough for a large fry pan I shall keep it anyway since it is a decent lid or other pots but if you need it for a large fry pan you need at least 12 1/2 lid and this one is only 10,65,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,I have bought the cheaper set of barstools with a single metallic looking column they are one of the first hits that show up if you search amazon for bar stools pack of two was about 80 and they were very modern looking unfortunately build quality on both was poor both broke under gentle use and i am 155 lbs well below the weight rating very pleased with my first purchase of this stool cushion is quite good after one month of use cushion is deep enough for you to feel a slight sinking sensation i have no problem practicing guitar on the stool four legs are very good for stability i have mine under an island sitting on mid level apartment carpeting i do not detect any damage to the floor or any slipping of the stool when getting on or off i agree with the other reviewer that buying furniture especially something like a chair which holds your body weight can be bit of a gamble even so i like this particular stool enough to buy another one looks modern and subdued it matches pretty well with dark brown furniture from target if you like shopping for modern looking furniture without designer mark,204,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,i bought one of these in 2009 for small prep shelf really comfortable and looks great we just replaced our dining room outfit with a counter height same style so i bought 2 more of these stools for additional seating very sturdy,42,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,it was difficult to find a single stool most stools are packaged in pairs i always find the best deals and great sellers on amazon this stool took 5 minutes to put together and is very well made,38,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,these stools are nice looking easy to assemble and reasonably comfortable the cushions are a little softer than i would like so if you sit for a long time your rear gets a little sore but they look great and have a nice finish they are a lot lighter than i expected so whatever wood is used is not very dense one of the stools had a small hairline fracture in the finish but nothing major they assemble with good quality screws that are nice and long so i expect these to hold up nicely over time edit as someone liked my review here is a two-year update these stools are still fine i assembled them with a small amount of wood glue on each screw which probably helped the little screw hole caps popped out after a few weeks but putting wood glue on them solved that problem these stools are used only occasionally but are still doing great and look brand new the cushions are as good as new we are still very happy with these,178,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,i got 3 of these for our counter we have had it for about 2 months now for the price it is not bad we have used it enough that we know it is not really meant for heavier people over 225 lbs it is easy to assemble but one of the stools had one leg piece that just would not flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have athat is slightly noticeable they are very lightweight and the seat is very cushy not firm you tend to sink into it a little it is made of pleather or whatever it is so it can stick to your skin otherwise not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be it does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen i do still wish i had spent the extra to get a more solid product oh well i hope these last at least 3 years and I shall be happy with that,176,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,we picked four of these up on a gamble we could not find anything local that was comfortable and sturdy it was always a choice of either comfortable or sturdy these are great looking and really match the bar i put in our basement this may be a stretch but they even make the football games more exciting and the beer smoother and colder what a deal i highly recommend these chairs,71,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,i purchased 2 of these stools but they quickly loosened up i tried to tighten them back up but they do not stay tight they are actually dangerous to sit on at this point i am very disappointed in these stools,40,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,comes unassembled it took two of us an hour to assemble two stools i used two days before one of the stools started swaying back and forth when i sat down i tightened it again and it still does it I am an average size woman and the cushion goes down after you sit on it and eventually returns to it is normal size I am donating these two stools and ordering new ones from another company you get what you pay for,80,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,2.0,negative,not bad construction but the padding was non existent it looks great but the padding is so soft it sinks flat I am 175lbs and my wife is way smaller and it does it to her also the screw hole plugs did not work at all some fell into the holes some flopped out a couple fit just right they look nice from a distance but that is about it i would have spent more knowing what i do now,77,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,these bar stools were easy to assemble great quality and do not look cheap at all I have owned these for about 4 months now and have not had any issues,28,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,nope started falling apart within a month would not buy again bought holland stools and they are great,17,10
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,i was very hesitant to order furniture online but i could not find any stools this size at the price i wanted to pay in stores they look great and have held up well i had trouble fitting i some of the woden tabs during assembly so i just left those off and they are still very stable i would order again,61,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,perfect for my breakfast bar very comfy,8,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,2.0,negative,not as sturdy as they look rather cheap and would not recommended to a friend when attaching the seating part to the legs the holes did not line up as a result the screws ripped out where the wood is attached to the seat will use my own to fix loosened the screws on stool 2 wholes line up but seat board the srews are drilled is so thin they are likely rip out eventually,76,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,i would not recommend these stool to anyone i hate them i have had to tighten the legs multiple times and they still become loose they are not sturdy at all even my young children under 80 pounds can not sit on them without making them wobble very disappointed with these,50,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,it got to my house in a box that was water logged the bottom of the seat the wood was so wet it warped making it very hard to mount the legs and square up the chair took some time but most would have just refused the box at the time of delivery over time as it dried it formed to the legs and is now in use,68,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,these stools looked great but the legs are all uneven so they do not sit straight had to send them all back sorry they did not work out but they were poorly made,31,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,this stool is very cheap i bought one at world market that was 9900 and returned it to buy this one as they looked the same the buttons go all the way into the holes so they do no good the top cushion is not supportive and i only weigh 112lbs so it is not like my fat butt sinks into it i have spent a lot of money on amazon and been very happy until this but it is more to ship it back than the stupid thing is worth do not buy you will be disappointed,93,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,these have lasted pretty good i do not do much entertaining but i cringe when a heavier person sits on these not sure if there is a weight limit overall they look good and have stood up over a couple of parties i have had the fabric is in tact and there seems to be no problems,56,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,these leads do not fit the gdt-190a even although it was stated on the description for the product the socket probes are too short,24,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,not as pictured and instead of two i got two different ones however the oddball one was long enough that i cut off 1/2 the plastic sleeve covering the meter end of the plug and it works just fine will be returning the other one,45,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,wow should have read reviews mine do not fit either much too short for gdt-190a,15,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,agreed i bought these leads and they do not fit the gdt-190a they are too short see attached images,19,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,the actual claws grip very well but the metal where the probe pushes in is quite flimsy a slight lateral force while the clip is attached causes the metal to bend and the probe no longer inserts securely then it needs to be pinched tight with a pliers again,49,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,4.0,positive,are exactly what they appear to be inexpensive shielded alligator clips that mount push onto the end of multimeter leads you can tell what they are like including the insulation by looking at the picture work exactly as expected should work with any brand leads multimeter quite useful when working with pcbs small components glad i bought them no more to say,66,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,these leads do not fit the gdt 3200 the inserts are too short,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,2.0,negative,i suppose these would work great for the meter that goes with them i have a gb model 190a that requires and extended banana plug so these leads can not go in far enough to connect cutting off the shield does not help gb and other sources state that the rtl-103 is the proper replacement for the 190 but they certainly do not work with my meter,66,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,4.0,positive,works well leads a little shorter than original,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,5.0,positive,fits on my craftsman leads perfectly worked as intended,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,5.0,positive,what can one say they convert your test pins to clips allowing you to use your hands for other important tasks,21,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00002NAOH,1.0,negative,they do not stay tight on test leads you have to re-crimp every use very cheapi would not recommend to anyone,22,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this is a really great set of hooks and clips for your pegboard i was very disappointed that the set i received had blue bins and blue jar tops and blue tipped pegs unlike the yellow theme in the picture that really grinds my gears when companies do that the yellow would have gone perfectly with my exhisting collection in my hobby room theyellow was the deciding factor in the decision to purchase if you do not mind receiving a mysterythis is an ok set for organizing a hobby room or garage,95,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,if you are expecting construction quality pieces for this price you are fooling yourself i do not use all of my tools daily but i would like them to be organized i am very happy with the quality / price ratio of this set yes the injection molded pieces will probably not stand up to high volume use but they stay where they are supposed to and they seem to be fine with a little love i am happy enough with the quality that i am ordering a second set mainly for the hooks which are of acceptable quality,94,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,this set is great it has everything and more that you need for your pegboard a really good selection of items,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,do not pay much for this low quality set yeah i know it is constructed from the thinner diameter wire i needed a few pcs from it for a project so ordered it knowing what to expect again do not pay much or you will be dissapointed,43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,i bought this set of pegboard tools to augment my already large collection of pegboard hooks and hangars and more i was disappointed in the quality especially of the plastic bins and bottles weak injection molded plastic is not going to stand up to the hazards of my garage the steel hooks were not much better weak and flimsy another lesson learned do not buy hooks that claim to be 1/8 and 1/4 compatible to use with your 1/4 pegboard holes they are going to wobble and fall out period,88,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,great for the price my only complaint is that the small j or u hooks only have 1 place to go into the pegboard where other brands have 2 because of this a lot of items i hang hang fine but as i take theoff the hook falls on the floor and i have to reset it,59,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the plastic parts break easy i have other sets that were much sturdier,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,most hangers have obvious uses but some plastic parts i have not a clue nice if it had a minimum of instructions if nothing they can brag love the plastic bottles that just screw on to mounted lid like the old days of nailing a jar lid to a table and filling the jar with loss junk then screw the jar on to the lid,64,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,pretty usefully but two of the plastic pieces one bin and one jar were damaged upon opening,17,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,no no no quality poor save your money,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the plastic hooks on the mini bins break easily once you have it where you want it is probably best to not ever move it again i was only holding safety pins in it for my craft room the bin did not hold up,43,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,so the plastic attachments the two square trays and two closing cups are cheaply made but they still work and hey it was like 10 bucks this was a great purchase for the amount of items and at that price,40,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,sending them back the plastic hooks for the cups broke off in the pegboard while putting them in metal hooks look fine although,23,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,as other comments say these are made on the cheap side but if you are just looking for something simple to organize your things they are good enough,28,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,practical and well made product do great job mounting and organizing wide variety of tools on pegboard,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,i can not recommend this product for anything other than the lightest of duty the plastic elements are thin and extraordinarily fragile i broke several components just by putting them in the pegboard and the metal hooks are poorly welded and at an angle that makes them practically unusable stay away,52,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,this was a fantastic product for my peg board at home i love the jars for the screws and assorted hook so far i have not used all the space or hooks but hey i am sure i will find a use for all of them eventually,47,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,i just can not bring myself to giving 5 stars for a bunch of wires laughing out loud but this finished my garage project with these and my pegboard,26,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,low quality some of the plastic parts broke while installing,10,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,all of the hardware is ok the issue that i have is that the black plastic clips do not clip in and stay at all i have had to build up the diameter of each hook with tape so that the retainer clips will actually hold in place manufacturer either needs to increase the od of the metal pieces or getting a better designed plastic retainer,65,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,these work great and home all of my tools on a plastic pegboard that i bought from home depot these were a great price i would certainly recommend,28,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,the hooks / hangers in this set are fairly comparable to other hooks maybe a little cheaper but the best part is the little plastic clips that come with this set these clips reduce so much frustration when grabbing tools especially high ones the hooks stay in the board and do not fall out so nice to not have to search for my hooks every time i try to return a tool,69,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,i was going to give it one star but honestly there are a couple nice pieces here to offset the truly abysmal ones the containers and boxes are nice as well as any of the long arm pieces with 2 peg holes everything else is pure crap they provide these little black clips to hold down the pegs but they fall out just as easily really really super crap,69,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i got it from another brand called crawford but this is actually for wood pegboard not for metal as is very similar kit in lowes this is much better yes it is cheap but i do not feel this it fits perfect to the pegboard i got from lowes wood one that is brown will buy one more when get more tools this is the best choice you can find on amazon for about 11 i checked it,80,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,first packaged shipped with the storage boxes broken amazon shipped another one out immediately free of charge these are cheaply made but you get what you pay for these days would be 5 stars if not for the broken storage boxes,41,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this will make ur pegboard look great lots of pieces to organize ur tools,14,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,great product works great in my garage i love it,10,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,very cheap plastic pieces breaks quite easily local hardware store should have better options,14,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,good value and worth the money has a wide variety of hooks to choose from would buy again,18,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,flimsy materials did not work on my new pegboard which is a wall control board,14,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,threw them out completely useless hooks fall out when you lift the tool of the hook the little plastic ties that supposedly hold the hooks fall out break and simply do not hold the hooks tightly buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself they are a little harder to attach to the pegboard but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble i found that by stretching the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some,106,30
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,good price and very handy with a good variety of hooks thought i might purchase a second one but one kit has basically all i need only down side is some of the plastic containers are pretty flimsy and can break easily just be careful with them and they will work fine but i did break a piece putting it in the metal hooks that make up the majority of the package are all well made although,77,31
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the containers were all broken inside they kinda screwed me out of my money the hooks were ok but that is it,21,32
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i was weary at first at the construction of these but they have turned out to be really solid and they work / look great above my work bench definitely buying more in the future,32,33
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the jars are only made for a 1/8 inch peg board not both 1/8 - 1/4 as described also one of two bins came with broken tab so in-usable,27,34
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,cheap worst peg hook i have ever seen buy in person so you can see what you will get,19,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,no zero stars option i guess hey crawford i ordered this organizer kit instead of a second one from stanley because its got a couple plastic trays bins in your parlance and a couple jars or part organizers also not brilliant to use the zero-descriptive word organizer for a component of a product called organizer anyway crawford newsflash crappy plastic hooks break when you insert them into a peg board i just told amazon that they are embarrassing themselves by stocking and selling something so obviously shoddy well made pegboard trays and jars would have hooks made from something sturdy a metal band around the jar and a metal hook might work I am pretty sure I have heard some good things about metal hooks but I am not an expert,127,36
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,bad plastics in this product the hooks that hold to the peg board are broken off,16,37
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,really useful box set of all needed hanging pegs,9,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,have not used it yet but it looks great and is just what i need for the pegboard on my new workbench going to love organizing all my tools and bits and bobs with it,34,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,used these on my harbor freight steel workbench pegboard,9,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,I am using these on a pegboard with 1/4 holes and they stay in just fine the plastic clips for keeping them tight work really well and the bins and jars clip in nicely the variety of pieces is a good mixture and gave me everything i needed and then some mine are dark blue not orange like the picture which i actually prefer i would buy this kit again,69,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,arrived on time and was in good condition easily installed and stay in place,14,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,holds all my tools and helps me keep organized shipping box was a little banged up other than that it is all good,23,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,poor construction and quality control but what do you expect for the price gets the job done and now my shop is just a little better organized,27,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,2 prices were broken other than that i guss it was ok box on the wall the leg was broken an the long screw driver holder 1of the holder was broke off both of those items were both needed i try write a review sooner but would not let me or return them,52,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i gave this to my husband as a christmas gift and he loved it it cleared up a lot of clutter and is sturdy,24,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,first off the this came in a differentthan the picture shows i did want thethat was on the amazon picture they did not say it could be anothersecond the plastic tabs that hold the bins to the pegboard was broke off making it impossible to hang if on the pegboard anything plastic if very cheap and tabs break off very easy the metal ones appear to be ok but not overly good quality i would not buy this set again,86,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,nice package good product thank you for perfect and timely delivery,11,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,do far the metal pieces seem ok due to lacking of packaging all of the bins are now useless the tabs on both of the bins broke off in shipping,30,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,too small and falls off everytime you touch it,9,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,not much to say about thisexactly as described easy to install works great and is pretty much what i wanted,22,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,this is a very useful product for anyone starting to use a pegboard in a work space the quality is excellent apart from the plastic items which are a bit light,31,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,they do not fit in the pegboard holes properly the plastic bin broke the first time it was put in garbage,20,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,not 1/4 and the locks do not work i was able to use less than 1/3 of the hooks in the set,21,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,i like the mix of components hooks holders for screwdrivers hammers pliers and more it is hard to screw that up right what takes away 2 stars is that the plastic jars are cheap however they are better than the bulldog kit i bought at the same time the plastic jars are hard to screw into their mounted lids because the threads are so poor the jars from bulldog barely work at all although,72,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the bins are almost acceptable but the jars are absolute junk the plastic legs are too soft and bend horribly while trying to insert it into the peg board as a result i can only use one of them the other simply refuses to mount on the peg board the metal hooks at least are worth the price i paid they are consistent and fairly sturdy,65,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,poor quality light-weight materials numerous defective pieces i would return it but i do not want to waste the time or money a piece of poor merchandise,26,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,alot of pieces makes orginization of my shop better looks clean not all junked up great price still finding places to hang stuff,23,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,they do not pad their numbers with the little plastic clips either which is good solid parts tools are neatly organized now,21,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,if you are in need of pegboard accessories for a 1/4 pegboard do not bother with this product the product description states it will work for both 1/8 and 1/4 pegboards and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4 pegboard they are ridiculously loose to be expected and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place do not work at all in pegboards with 1/4 holes all in all the products price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars while flimsy are usable if my pegboard was drilled with 1/8 holes I am sure I had be completely satisfied with this product,120,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,the pegs themselves are decent quality but they do not fit 1/4 boards when you put them into a 1/4 board they do not sit flat against the board and so you can not put those plastic clips on to secure them they also do not come with the 2nd peg not sure what you call them that keeps it stable as stated by a few others too the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy i was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break on the other hand the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent the entire set is still far less than just the few parts i liked bought individually so i gave it 2 stars but do not buy this expecting to use the l or u shaped hangers,135,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,we are very happy with the quality of this set we bought two sets because we can not buy these in western australia we could not be happier with the variety that is in the set everything you need for most hand held tools plus it has two small bottles to hold tiny screws or washers and a couple of small bins as well we particularily liked the small clips that hold the hooks and holder to the board so they do not move we have never seen those here we can buy a few hooks sold separately now and then we recommend this set to anyone that is starting out because the quality and variety is all in one box,118,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,i was quite thrilled when my package arrived fairly quickly i received a lot of stuff for the price i definitely would recommend buying the 43-piece set if you are just starting with peg board organizer as i did my peg board covers one wall in my craft room this was a great value,54,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,i bought a set of hooks only from this company last year it is really really bad I shall never get anything from crawford again i do not care that the hooks are made of thin wire and do not hold much weight that is plenty fine for most tools it is that the hooks refuse to stay on the board the little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place do not they are difficult to get in place use up holes that could have been for other hooks fall out of the holes after a few uses and get stiff and break in half with age overall the whole package is a waste of money every time i try to remove a tool from the board the hook comes with it and falls on the floor i was putting them back up now i just throw them in the trash give it a pass and get pegboard hooks that have a second metal stud on the back to hold them in place,171,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,if you already have peg board this is a great buy lots of useful items to store tools,18,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the box came holes in the sides of it with nothing in it,13,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,5.0,positive,great set for a good price add all the hooks i needed to the garage,15,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,you are better off picking individual hooks or getting a bulk pack of the regular double hooks over half of this pack is useless and will fall off every time you hang something on it,34,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,the metal parts of this product are fine but the plastic parts are total junk all of the plastic cups and jars wall hook holder things you stick in the peg board broke all of them if you are using this for a peg board for sewing supplies and you have the hands of surgeon you will probably be okay i broke the first one thinking it was durable the rest i broke trying to be as delicate as i could be very disappointed would not buy this ever again,89,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,4.0,positive,the pegs are great the jars are useless and I am not using the cups because i do not expect them to last long the cups and jars are 100 plastic since the hooks on them are so small i do not believe they can handle continuous use just the pressure of putting your fingers in them to get stuff out is likely to break them off the jars are also designed to sit upside down so you have to remove them completely to use them,83,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,i just ordered five more and am waiting for delivery that should tell you that they are quite good at holding small parts,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,these storage containers are awesome but the little plastic pegs are quite brittle so unpack it carefully install it carefully and hope you do not forget when you move it but once installed it is great and ideal addition to the pegboard fanatics habit,42,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,i received some with the tabs broken off the back and they do not install easily,15,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,had to break off a pin to get it to attach to my board but it works well after that handy to have a few of these around,28,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,does not fit the pegboard i ordered yet everything else does fit i am sad this does not work,19,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,this product is made of cheap plastic it broke when i installed it on my pegboard,16,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,says it can fit any pegboard but did not fit mine and 2 of the 3 i received had broken hooks,20,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,very fragile peg board clips most are broken when shiped,10,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,all of the lehigh crawford pegboard stuff is weak it will break before it is even hung in the pegboard save your money,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,there seems to be a lot of user error and confusion regarding this bin so let me hopefully help some people out these bins are made to work with two sizes of pegboards so that means you need to break off the lower pegs that correspond to your size pegboard if you have the smaller 1/8 pegboard you have to break off the middle peg if you have 1/4 pegboard you have to break off the two outside pegs this bin will not work if you leave all three lower pegs in place this is a must have for simple organization on your pegboard they mount up solid with no play so you do not have to worry about them falling off the wall as you are using them the bin can be taken out and moved around if you need to but this leads to my only grip the bins are quite loose which is necessary in order to be able to take the bins out but to me it feels like they are a little too loose it would be nice if they could be a little snugger in there,191,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,thought it was bigger it is like 5 wide,8,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,these bins have 3 upper hooks and 3 lower notched pegs that should align with corresponding peg board holes when you hang them none of the lower pegs align after you hook in the uppers i ordered 8 of these and none align and because they do n't it holds the bottoms away from the peg board which creates an upward angle when they are secured in addition 1 had all of it is upper hooks broken off my guess is that someone received it in a previous order and tried to force alignment and broke them off i believe i am going to take some side cutters and snip the lower pegs off to get a flush mount without the lower pegs securing the bins they pull away at their bottoms when you pull items out of the bins but i will put up with that i am contacting the seller to see if they will ship me another bin to replace the broken one i would n't buy again,168,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,this is a quality product i am a single woman who loves tools and i have to rely on honest descriptions when i purchase products i just bought a peg board and wanted some good containers this is a good one,41,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,wish it was larger i like to be able to have some supplies covered or enclosed i have eraser in one and automatic pencillin another wish they were easier to get out work on a larger size,39,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,just what i was looking for i read the reviews about them braking but they where packed very well i did take care installing but the went in very easily and work great,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,fits perfectly on the pegboard in my van for easy access to screws and parts makes for a well organized work truck,22,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,one of the boxes was broken when i received it and another broke when i hung it up on the peg board the 3 upper plastic pegs break off easy and so does the peg on the inside that holds the clear bin from falling out,46,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,fits standard peg board easy to use and keep small parts organized on my work bench plan on purchasing several more in the near future,25,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i love these little bins and I have used them on the pegboard of my shop for years adding more and more be warned if you order these in large numbers they bulk ship them in one big box where they rattle around and break off the plastic pegs expect amazon claims,51,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i was looking for ani could zip tie to the cage in my truck and this fit the bill perfectly,22,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,i like these little things i have several at my work bench great for keeping solder rolls screws or any other smallthat just does not work to hang on the peg board some complain the that little plastic comes out but i actually like that it is nice to be able to pull it off the bench an take the little drawer with you when needed,66,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,5.0,positive,this is well constructed molded plastic durable and although has minor sharp area watch out with the kids although it is like a miniature pegboard for screws nails and or bolts gee waddia no very satisfied,35,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,this works well at helping me keep my tools organized the quality of manufacturing is not quite as great as i would have hoped but it works quite well as long as you are not too rough with it,38,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,one of the tabs broke of on day one greatbut build quality is not up to par,18,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,the tabs were too fragile and easily broke off during shipping and made attachment to the peg board impossible poor quality,21,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,storage bin is held in by two plastic tabs and one was missing completely opened clear storage bin and the entire bin pulled out it did not break off it was never attached and could not find tab anywhere to try and superflue it back together do not waste your money on this brand,54,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,1.0,negative,it arrived with 1 i repeat one intact peg cheap and worthless,12,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,when i found myself with a flat tire on my way from bikini waxing to the shoe sale at bloomies i knew I had be ok because my bestie bought me this safety girl roadside kit for my birthday this year i knew there was something good about turning 30 it had these nifty instructions for how to change a tire so i can totally sound like i know what I am talking about if i meet a guy who likes strong women unfortunately i do not really know where my spare is tee hee and i let my aaa membership expire whoops as i gazed into the swarovski cover on my iphone i thought i have just the thing i applied my lip balm rolled up my shirt and proceeded to look seductively helpless alone on the side of the highway lo and behold before long men were honking and slowing down and eventually one stopped long story short it would have been great if the safety kit had some condoms too but i managed to flirt my way into having a big strong man change my tire for me thank goodness,190,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,i think this is a cute noveltyand gift to give to friends and female family members for their cars i do not think it is completely practical but it does have some nice essentials for non car related emergencies and a couple of good actual emergency items i have one for myself and will be giving a couple as gifts but i think an actual road side assistance kit is needed to go with this,76,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,as a woman who has an emergency kit and has had to use it I am grossly offended by this package an emergency kit should have flares jumper cables a first aid kit things you can actually use to get yourself out of an emergent situation not chocolate a nail file and breath freshener all the things young women might need to prepare themselves for when someone else strolls by to rescue them i own pink apollo tool kit i have no problem girlifying things but if you are going to call it an emergency roadside kit it should actually be able to help you in an emergency not point out how your ovaries and lack of self-esteem should render you useless,125,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,the safety girl roadside kit was a novelty gift that i thought was cute to give a first time driver i think it could have been improved by changing the matches to a mini flashlight taking the chocolate out and maybe adding some reflective tape the container was the size of a lunch box and the grafics on the outside were nice,62,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,this is packaged in a cool box and has a lot of things a girl might need in case of a flat tire or being stuck somewhere and more i gave this as a gift to a 20 something and she really liked it it makes women less dependent in a stressful situation,52,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,great gift for my 16 year old niece,8,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,was not at all what i expected very cheaply put together,11,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the contents of this kit i bought this 1st week of december 2014 for christmas gift for a teenage girl who is just starting to drive but i was embarrased to give it the energy bar expired october 3 2014 the chewing gum expired june 23 2014 and the 6 safety lightstick expired 04 - 2014 i do not know why the seller even included perishable items and did not check the expiry dates before shipping the stuff,79,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,awesome thank you so much for the quick shipping,9,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,i purchased this on recommendation from our local news station it has everything someone should need only thing was that my bar was outdated but i kept everything else a friend of mine saw it one day as i was going in my trunk and she ordered one laughing out loud,49,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,as expected great product great gift for college bound student,12,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,i thought this would have car safety things like booster cables not kleenex and lip gloss or dime store items,20,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,this kit proves it buy a real kit and learn to use it learn to do simple repairs yourself otherwise you would better forget about driving a car,27,12

Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,i was so excited to find this kit for a sweet 16 birthday gift however when it arrived more than half of the items that were supposed to be included are missing my kit is missing the accident record card bottled water deodorant emergency blanket gum hand wipes ibuprofen light stick lip balm energy bar nail file how to instruction card pencil stain remover and hair brush it did however include a few items not listed like hand sanitizer tooth brush key chain and antibiotic cream still not as advertised and very disappointed since i have only 2 days now until the party below you can see what actually came in my kit not much,115,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,1.0,negative,contents received are not contents advertised kit was missing the following no hand wipes no hairbrush no bottled water no nail file no peanut butter energy bar no chocolate bar and no gum everything else listed was received and they included 2 rolls of mints a facial cleansing cloth and a small lint brush not worth the money i bought two,62,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,very cheaply made and the items inside are things you could pick up at the dollar store it might be cute as a silly gift but not for a 16 year old,32,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,4.0,positive,great gift for anyone getting or who has just gotten a drivers license,13,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,2.0,negative,false advertising it is a lot of money to pay when you do not receive all the items listed i just received a kit for a gift and it is missing at least 6 items i guess i will have to supplement from target so it does not look cheap,48,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000ESKF1M,5.0,positive,i bought about 10 for all my girlfriends they all love it totally sexy,14,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,when thisarrived it was in pieces the packaging was torn and crushed it is useless it is a piece of junk thanks for the scrap metal,28,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,lots of fun to play dr with simple to use and stays in place well,15,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,bends very easily made with a very cheap thin metal,10,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,a little more flimsy than i thought it would and does not stay in place as well as i thought it would but overall i would say this is a good product,32,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,i forgot about a tampon in the heat of the moment of sex with my fiance and the tampon got shoved up high and i could not reach it well then what happens infection bacteria which produces a funky smell and i was so embarrassed but did not understand what was wrong until i went into a actual hospital and the doctor found the tampon stuck up sideways oh my god i felt so bad i wish i would have had a speculum to check for myself and now i will every woman needs to be responsible for her own body and having a speculum is a good aid to seeing what has going on inside of us it is not gross it is our bodies and we need to be in charge if we need help beyond that by all means get a doctor i will purchase this because i never want to be so embarrassed again by that odor from a tampon that gets stuck and you can not tell or reach it that is life take care of yourself and do not be ashamed,179,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,we likes this tem it did as it was suppose to do we get into kinky play from time to time showed it to friends and they want one,28,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,good for fetish play and fantasy play made with real actual stainless steel not cheap coated materials works as it is intended to for it is purpose,26,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,this was a gift for a friend as a joke but it was well received and enjoyed watching him open it,21,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,this is cool it opens up the vagina and hold it in place it is smooth and easy to enter inside do be careful since it is metal and make sure you clean it thoroughly,35,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,5.0,positive,great device does just what it is supposed to do and that is open things up for a peaky peaky inside will tell anyone looking for one about this,30,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,problem one is it is made very poorly the ends are fairly sharp which makes insertion an extremly delicate process the metal is very very thin and bends incredibly easy it is not easy to adjust once inserted and i was told the edges are very uncomfortable once in looks like they poke into the area around the point of insertion nothing nicer then a jagged bit of metal in a sensative body area overall identification say look at other products the collins speculum for example is far superior in construction and ease of use,93,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,4.0,positive,this speculum functions but feels flimsy but for the price it serves it is purpose,14,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,does not look like the advertisment to flimsey made of steel not stainlesswill rust up fast,14,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,1.0,negative,horrible sharp edges stay away from this thing is junk,10,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000TEZPN4,2.0,negative,smooth but poor quality difficult to adjust due to misalignment of the two pieces,14,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,i just wanted a simple inexpensive vernier caliper that works and this is it the markings are engraved not printed there are cheaper calipers where the marks are printed on the edges are a bit sharp but not exceptionally so and the finish quality is adequate no instructions are included about how to get the measurements down to 01 mm or 1/128 inch but google how to use a vernier caliper and it is pretty simple to figure out no markings about where this thing is made it works perfectly fine,89,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for i m not sure about the accuracy of the instrument but the finish was very bad looked like a one that had been used for 3 years buy a goof n then given,39,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,while not having the refined finish we have come to associate with british new england and japanese tools this is a serviceable and accurate instrument,25,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i bought this because it looked sturdy and did not have digital readings because i worried that the battery would be dead with infrequent usage this would probably work fine for carpentry or mechanical usage it moves easily and measurements can be taken with one hand for measurement of human anatomy however it has sharp edges that could cut skin,59,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,i received the caliper shortly after ordering and the caliper itself seems to be pretty solid i have no reference gauges with which to test it is accuracy but it does appear to be possible to calibrate the caliper however the specific caliper that i received appears to have small specks of rust on the jaws and some scratches in addition the caliper actually shipped outside it is plastic and foam case the shipment was well packaged so there was no damage to the caliper but it seemed like it would have been safer to put the caliper inside the case perhaps i received a returnedrather than a newgiving 4 stars because i think the caliper will serve it is purpose well despite these minor issues,127,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,i had received the gauge a little while ago and in my initial review mentioned the case arrived broken without contacting anyone from jacks tool she had someone contacted me and immediately sent me a new case thank you for the excellent service and i look forward to dealing with jacks in the future,53,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,it is not the ultra-high quality product all the edges are too sharp but it is solid construction and I am pretty happy with it i recommend it,26,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,junk does not measure properly due to shifting marker plate,9,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,they are pretty crappy quality but they will work for what i need if you need any type of accuracy buy something different,23,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i buy a lot of products on amazon and never really had a problem therefore i did not open the box until now which is several months after buying it the product itself is not that bad but as far as i know i have ordered a new caliper this is not a new caliper it clearly has been used the caliper i received is covered in greasy fingerprints scratches and dents it also does not feel and sound to smooth i guess it is not bad for the price but when i order something new i do not like to receive something heavily used,101,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,it does the trick but is very poorly made i doubt it will last long the fine adjustment wheel is fake and just for looks,25,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,best for setting to acceptable maximum or minimum diameter measurement and checking batches of parts i use a digital caliper for other measurements older eyes struggle with reading vernier quickly,30,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,have not used for actual measurement yet but out of the box this instrument is of very poor quality unit was scratched badly on back and slide does not move smoothly the slide also had a large grinding scar on the face where the measurements read this may be fine for limited use but do not make the mistake that this is a quality unit although the price should have made that point obvious,73,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,not bad instructions would have been nice but i will live,11,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i wish i could return it butis non-returnable,10,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i use it for 3d printing and stuff good product,10,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,not worth the 10 you spend dirty scratched and measurements are practically invisible to the eye do not buy,19,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,it is not good but not bad with this price,10,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,all divisions are the same length not easy to read,10,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,well made product i am sure i will get much use out of it,14,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,this tool was not zeroed properly and the slide was not smooth may be a hit or miss with quality but the one that came to my door was poor quality useless if not zeroed correctly because the tool is supposed to measure to very small tolerances,47,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,good for the price i needed a simple metal caliper,10,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,wanted to return it to buy a better digital model and it is not eligible for return,17,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,do not buy thisit is garbage from the plastic case that broke apart the first time it was opened to the three screws missing where the holes were misaligned so they just left the screws out to the set screw that stripped out after very limited use to the very hard-to-read scale if i could give this a zero rating i would buy a plastic toy and you will get much better value,74,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,hey it is better than a tape good for the tool box not a precision instrument but does the job needs oil and tlc to work,25,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,we ordered these as a christmas present for my father they were very cheap quality our dogs destroyed the christmas wrapping while we were out but the silver lining is that once we saw these calipers we were thankful the dogs misbehaved i would have been embarrassed to gift these to my dad,52,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,this is a very badly made product the machining is awful and measures 005 mm in the completely closed position,19,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,great product fast delivery and service followup thanks,8,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,very cheap chinese manufacturing the screw on the side does not work it just feels well cheap,17,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,it is a very good product considering the price in adverse lighting conditions it is almost impossible to see the magnitudes because the grooves are very superficial,28,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,love it very accurate till 005 mm it says nobelium coated but as far as i know it is only theas nobelium is radioactive and it would not be good for measuring tools,34,30
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,received the product 3 days late due fully to usps incompetence product appears as depicted on line however my big oversight was this caliper measures in 1/128ths of an inch increments totally useless what do you do with a measurement of 2 and 71/128th inches also manufacture details are poor inch increments are not possible to distinguish all lines are identical baffling i can not even give this thing away use this review as a guide shop wisely i did not,81,31
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,very nice quality for my home work shop came in nice protective plastic case,14,32
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,the wheel shown is not a wheel just looks like one,11,33
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,great i would order more things from this vender,9,34
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,perfect for my jewelry business sizing gems beads findings and more,10,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,not recommended for extreme precision work for it is price it is a fairly accurate and a very good product for general use,22,36
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,very poor quality unable to read the scales returned the unit immediately,12,37
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,junk screws falling out terribly graduated i got exactly what i paid for,13,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,cheap chinese poor quality just by having it in your hand you can tell it are not worth it,18,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i use the tool in wood working for accurate measurements and it works great this is not a highly precision tool not for measuring in the thousands of an inch but works very well for my purpose,37,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,I have had one of these before and really did not like it when i lost it or displaced it this has been sufficiently accurate for my purposes and it is a great price the case on the last one seemed a bit flimsy but that is acceptable,44,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,good for the price i only use it top measure slack on my motorcycle chain,15,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,works well for the price got some friction here and there although wonderful if you need calipers here and there for small things not very good for very accurate work,30,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,excellent transaction product as advertised on time hassle free,8,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,this caliper works fine for measuring outer diameters inner diameters are a little off the teeth sit a mm apart when the caliper is fully closed such that if you measured a 5 mm identification tube the device would read 6 mm roughly,41,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,used it like it good enough for what i do at home,12,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,these may be great calipers but i will not be using them they do not measure in thousandths but in fractions of inches,22,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,was of extremely poor quality the teeth for measuring inside dimensions does not zero out and gives measurements that more than 3 mm off also very poor finish edges still have burrs which because resistance when using the device i would definitely appreciate if they could send me a product of better quality assuming that this one is a dud,60,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,do not buy i got one and it seems that everyone here is getting a different items mine had metric markings the measurements oscillate when tested against a trustworthy caliper the markings for measurements are very bad they have an indication for 1/16th inch shorter and 1/8th longer but if that is it making it very hard to read accurately any measurements at a glance without counting marks or grabbing a sharpie and annotating the scale the moving part has a wee bit of wiggle which means any 1/64 in precision measures are going to be way off worse of all the measurement is off i know a man with 2 watches can not tell the time but i was measuring some pipe fittings and tried this caliper directly against another one i have i trust and readings would oscillate over and under what the other one says,152,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,good tool considering the price it is just perfect no problems with mine it works great for me,17,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,my students are grateful to be able to actually use a caliper and a nice one at that,18,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,a present for my son who studies for engineering he told me it was very helpful for his projects,19,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,great tool for the money i use it as a hobby tool and it works however the made in china logo does not make it very dear to me,28,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,the measuring instrument is very well made i wish there were more specific instructions on care and handling of the product,21,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,recived on time it is what it was promised,10,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,total junk but you get what you pay for,9,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i got my vernier too late today i am sad because vernier does not have inch graduation also the threads of fixing screw on top side are broken so you do not buy it,34,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,not very precise adjustment in the moving parts very poor finish would not recommend it,15,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,they only have a metric scale i picked them for a based on the description and picture i read a review before i purchased them that said no metric scale which would have been fine by me,37,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,nice steel construction and consummate finish it is been interesting at having to convert from 128ths but i like the quirk,20,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,good quality considering it is so cheap but is not the same quality as a really nice expensive pair acceptable for what i need it for,26,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i am a student of goldsmiths and was looking for this tool and it really is good i recommend it the seller is excellent,24,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,fairly decent especially for the price they were not too expensive and do the job on simple projects nothing too fancy,21,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i do not have the money for the more expensive calipers and these are built to similar quality as the more expensive ones i have used the materials they used are great for the price and i compared my measurements from this one to my schools more expensive dial calipers and they are just as accurate also it has measurements for millimeters / centimeters as well as inches,65,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,it works perfectly and I have used it many times and still good this good quality for the price i paid,20,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,this replaces one that i lost at work i liked the way the adjustment worked on the one i lost but this one works just fine i am not interested in the digital calipers at all i like things simple this needs no batteries,44,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,the title of this product is incorrect the product looked like it had been previously used when it came out of the package i will be returning the product soon,30,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,this is not a high quality version but if you do not need it to do more than basic measurements than you will probably get the desired results i did not need anything as nice as some of the otherwise more expensive cousins this caliper is perfect for my needs thank you grace marketing hi,55,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i was expecting something a bit more substantial but for the money i guess i should have not expected a great tool,22,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i would not have given any stars but the seller tried to make it better the first one was not steel but aluminum and very poor quality at that the seller promptly sent me another you can keep the original one they said i kept it in the trash the replacement was nice but with no inch 16th 32nds markings how does that happen caveat emptor,65,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,the mark is not on zero when i do not place anything in it when i do not place anything in it the mark is about on 03 mm so if i put something in it and the reader is 15 mm that means it actually is 12 mm 15 03 12,52,71
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,it is difficult to figure out what the actual measurement is no pointer or other marking indicates the measurement reminds me of a toy slide rule the best i could do was to measure in mm and convert them into inches and fractions of inches with a calculator very disappointing,49,72
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,great deal i wanted a vernier caliper because the cheap digital / dial calipers seem to be unreliable it might be a bit too much effort to read the fine markings if you are using this all the time but if you need one around the house / shop for the occasional measurement that requires high accuracy or the benefit of the caliper jaws to get a valid measure this is a great option,70,73
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,received caliper on time that is goodlooks nice the problem is that it is not stainless steel as advertised it is aluminum the acurracy will be good for very short time most people who buy this should know the difference,42,74
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,excellent tool that can not miss in any toolbox and at home inexpensive and quite accurate for a price in line with expectations note for very demanding and professional do not use this tool see comments from people who talk about imperfection in the measurements and it is obvious it is not a tool of more than 100,59,75
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i love that it has a screw thing to keep it in place i have used ones that do not and you have to keep checking them to make sure that it has not moved,33,76
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,i ordered this from micro-tools via amazon at that time it was 3 or 4 cents more than the cheapest vendor but they had better reviews ymmv i was specifically looking for a non-battery caliper while a digital readout is certainly simpler the thought of a dead battery really bugs me especially since this is not something I shall use every day and so keep spare batteries around a dial caliper is simpler but more money than i wanted to spend if you have never used a vernier caliper I am sure there has a tutorial video on youtube box arrived with a little oil stain on the corner no big deal i did need to wipe the oil off the calipers after opening the box they do not have the smoothest sliding action but it perfectly acceptable for my needs general measuring and woodshop use unless you are looking for nist precision i think you will find these perfectly fine and quite a bargain,160,77
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,this is not comfortable to hold or easy to operate with one hand it is too cheap to bother returning so i ground the tips round and will use it as a gauge for lathe turning spend a few more dollars for a nicer caliper this one is kind of junky,49,78
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i recieved thethe quality is not so good but considering the price it is barely acceptable for the job,20,79
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i needed this to take measurements of the casters on some office chairs and i am sure i will find some other uses for it it is made very well and will be handy when needed,36,80
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,this caliper i passed up buying these many times from harbor freight store the ad says sae and metric should not be advertised as any thing standard american equivalent standard scale should come first then metric scale as the ad states should not be unit-ed-stated,47,81
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,i loved the product this is very useful for me i liked the product i recommend to all because the product and quality,23,82
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,comes in a plastic case with foam in a plastic bag oil coated all edges are precision cut there has a locking screw and the slide moves easily some of the small screws on the back needed tightening and this seems like it would not hold up to very heavy daily use however light or occasional use this is your tool and the price is right for that,66,83
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i was in dialogue with the companys president i thought i was purchasing a 12 mm product but on my calipers purchased through you it only measured 10 mm come to find out i was wrong because my calipers completely closed would measure minus 2 mm 2 mm instead of all the zeros in alignment when completely closed and the company president was using digital calipers that cost probably 600 my only disappointment with amazon ever glen,73,84
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,eliminates guess work on which drill bit to use well made very easy to use a person who is new tovernier calipers may want more directions,26,85
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,1 when you close it you can see daylight at one end and not other meaning less than precise at measuring2 it does not open all the way not machined properly 3the handle on the moving part not glued on correctly4looks like as another rev iewer put it cut with a bandsaw worst caliper ever wasted my money and time would not advise to buy,64,86
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,the case was broken by the time it got to me but whatever i did not buy it for the case otherwise it is a great caliper i have not put it up to the test against something i know is accurate so i do not know how accurate this one is but I am sure it is pretty close great cheap caliper,57,87
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,i bouhgt 4 of these for my father and he is satisfied he tested them and they are are all good,20,88
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,the finish on this appears as if it were done on a grinding stone the etching for the numbers and line increments are so faint they are barely readable i wanted a caliper without a digital re-out but this is so poorly crafted i really do not trust it is accuracy,48,89
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,i bought this caliper in a bundle along with the recommended digital caliper and micrometer i thought i could check myself with the digital caliper to see if i was reading it right i got relatively the same measurements with the digital caliper and micrometer but for some reason this vernier caliper was coming up twenty thousandths short on the same measured object anyone else encounter the same problem I had like to know,73,90
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,I am a bit of a nerd and do a lot of work on my bikes so i wanted a more reliable measuring tool for dropout spacings and more i also have a background in chemistry so I am familiar with calipers these despite being cheap are indeed stainless steel and seem like they will last me forever as long as i do not abuse them they look a teensy bit cheap and feel a teensy bit cheap but only because I have seen very expensive sets of calipers these are good and from what i can tell accurate to the nearest millimeter at least I had certainly hope so based on my measuring of things I have measured with other calipers they were able to measure my 125 mm dropouts easily and have helped me in deciding on how to rebuild the drivetrain on my fixed gear I had recommend them based on their perfectly adequate functionality inexpensive price and solid-looking construction again mine are kinda cheap feeling but not to the point of it being a significant flaw they just do not look like you paid 50 for them more like 20,183,91
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,4.0,positive,every now and then i need outside measurements of things i definitely did not need dial or digital readers and not even that much of an accuracy because i always double check with my ruler hopefully this is real stainless and not the chinese version of stainless,47,92
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,this is more a a review of the vendor hobbytoolsupply than the actual product the caliper received had no metric markings it was a different model from the one pictured the description states features both sae and metric markings,39,93
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i ordered thisa few weeks ago and received a digital one instead a regular one like the picture shows,21,94
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i bought this caliper some time ago and just recently had the occasion to use it the accuracy is just plane bad if i measure something with it i have to then measure the jaws of the caliper with another measuring instrument it is passed the return date so i can not return or get a refund it was cheap but who needs to pay for scrap metal i had to give it one star just because they do not have a no good indicator,83,95
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,2.0,negative,the quality is poor enough for my use but not very precise,12,96
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,i was looking for a replacement caliper that read in inches all the marks on the inch scale are the same size they are 1/16 apart even the 1 marks are the same size you have to count each mark making it impossible to read,45,97
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,the price is right but the markings are impossible to read the markings are so faint and similar also it is obviously intended for primarily metric use,27,98
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,this says a 6 inch measuring range but it is metric,11,99
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,1.0,negative,very poor quality tool the cinch bolt does not work the whole unit is poorly constructed,14,100
Industrial_and_Scientific,B000WR034O,5.0,positive,I have been looking for a caliper without a digital or analog meter i like this basic version and it is a good quality one,23,101
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,this is bigger than most trunk jack stands i bought this for my mazda 6 2008 does the job good price soild metal,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,the crappy little jack that came with my prius fell over when lifting the prius on the flat street in front of my house when it fell it bent i went to replace it and discovered it was 179 or something like that this looks have not used it yet twice as strong,52,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,thiswas just as described in the ad and arrived on time it is nice to get a great deal,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,the jack i ordered was not able to lift my car and was slightly different from the product advertised the company responded with several different options to meet my needs and included detailed information about the replacement options along with pictures i still do not know of the replacement items will do the job they have not arrived yet but the company gets a gold star for working hard to help me,69,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,i used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer i had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my rv they are sturdy and work well for my purpose if you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire i believe they will suffice the maximum height extension is limited about 18 20 so keep that in mind,71,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,it is a car jack after all and a good one it does it is job well and it is easy to use no complains about this product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a car jack,41,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,i bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well it did fit but it would not lift a 1000 lbalthough rated for 4000 lbs the screw was well lubricated with grease but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank it was cheap but still not worth the little money i paid,63,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,cheap fell apart after 2nd use i was lifting my golf cart and it got stuck about half way through the lift i kinda worked with where it was when i was done i went to lower it and noticed it bent with such a littlei bought two of them the bent one went into the recycling bin and other is a garage paper weight,67,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,this is a substitute for my 2500 and horse trailer jack works well too,14,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,very poorly constructed rated for 2 tons but would not lift 1 tire of my 3000 pound car also it arrived damaged the put the jack in a box too small and simply punched holes in the end of the box for the two ends of the jack so of course both ends of the jack were damaged by the time it arrived,62,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,i am not putting this in my wifes car that is what i bought it for but after opening it and extending it out i could see that the metal arms were loosely put together and rickety the screw mechanism is good and smooth but i do not trust this thing to hold up 4000 lbs without creaking one way or the other returning for sure I had rather hassle with sending it back and buying another one than worry every time i crawl under the car i recommend avoiding this jack,90,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,the threaded rod or screw was galled up right out of the box was unable to even open it up all the way until i put the jack in a benchto hold it in place why i used a crow bar to work it back and forth 50 times to get it to free up at least they should test this piece of crap before they ship it after working on it for two hours i finally have a jack i can use,85,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,jacks situation here in the us is a mess have to use a combination of jacks to change a flat scissors jack is just one that i use,28,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,like someone else said it is a car jack what do you expect it was not built to lift the world,19,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,the jack i received was somewhat different and had a different crank than the one pictured it was not possible to lift my car using the crank so i am sending it back,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,my son used it 3 times to change a flat and 2 rear tires on my 97 ford probe and it worked great a little awkward turning but did the job perfectly otherwise the only kind that fit and was sturdy enough,42,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,i like theit work really well i have no complains i paid 19 dollars for this so to me it is a good value,26,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,just received this jack went outside and tested it out worked great lifted my 1998 chevy blazer with no problem the jack was able to lift my truck high enough that i could get a jack stand in and change a tire no problem i will be keeping this on board since i do not have the spare tire jack,59,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,what a piece of junk do not purchase,8,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,looks good hope i do not have to use it,10,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,in my opinion these screws are not very good the philips head strips too easily while inserting into wood tried 2 different size bits,23,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,good screws they can split the wood more then some others,11,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,way to long foredge guard and fillips screw to shallow,12,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,tested them out by using a magnet on them not like the home large supplies sell you can pick their up with a magnet not these,26,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,package came with opened package missing some screws for the price you pay for these items you should get all you pay for thanks,24,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,cheap screws heads stripped very easily had to drill all holes before putting in screws to prevent head stripping out could not remove without pliers softest stainless screws ever go get screws somewhere else high priced junk,39,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,these would have worked better on myif i was willing to pre-drill the first and only i tried to screw into my docks pressure-treated boards stripped the heads almost immediately i had to use a wrench to reverse them out i went to the local hardware store and bought screws that worked much better i ended up putting around 200 screws into myhaving to pre-drill would have been crazy,73,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,used these screws in the installation of ourbumpers and am very pleased with their performance,17,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,worked great with pilot holes stainless steel is usually softer so some issues associated with it are expected,18,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,if you apply pressure and use 2 philips bit you will not strip the head for hard surface drill a pilot hole great price did the job fine,27,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,as others have observed the heads strip very easily the phillips socket is too shallow and the metal is quite soft so even when exercising great care they are prone to strip driving them into southern yellow pine not particularly demanding fairly soft wood several that did not strip instead twisted off right below the head again the metal used just is not up to the task save yourself much frustration and find another option,74,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,screw heads easily striped with a power drill need a stronger steel or better yet a tork head,18,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,phillips head seemed to strip out too often even changing bits out,12,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,they are ok but the heads do strip fairly easy as other reviews suggest if you are carful they will do fine,21,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,these screws worked great to install bumpers on mythe package includes 80 screws so there are plenty,19,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,screws were of high quality and worked as expected,9,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,these screws were awful the heads continually broke off going thru aluminum for everyone that worked i broke two going into wood they worked fine,25,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2.0,negative,very soft heads which means these strip very easily,9,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,too bad handi man has a good name even in soft pine these very soft screws strip immediately count on losing half your box trying to use pliers to twist them out and start over too long for your regularbumper you need maybe half the size i was working all day trying to drill pilot holes should not have to then stripping almost every other head used multiple bits drills and drivers not my fault go look for stainless steel screws half the size and with good solid reports see anything that says these strip then stay away sorry but our time is worth more than a faulty made product,112,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,junk very soft strip out as soon as they meet resistance in the wood do not use without drilling holes,20,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1.0,negative,phillips head screws just strip out way to easy,9,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,good screw did drill holes as we were putting these into pressure treated lumber but not a single one stripped or twisted off still have half a bag of them to use on other projects and will not hesitate to use them on our boat trailer good product,48,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5.0,positive,used these to screw onpiling caps pre-drilled for them husband wishes they were star-head but with the pre-drilling they worked fine and were a good price,28,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,inexpensive screw worked fine if you pre-drill yourcone and piling,12,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,4.0,positive,these work fine even with pilot holes sometimes they strip phillips head against square or star bit i would choose square or star,21,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,2.0,negative,i drive a mobility scooter and wanted these to improve the safety of me scooting around on our streets granted the strips are highly reflective but when hit by the sun they fall off and when i picked them up i got sticky goo on my hands which was very difficult to remove,53,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1.0,negative,the strips would be great but the packaging was bad they folded the taped in half to fit into a package and the tape has a permanent crease in it you can not get this crease out matter what you do so it ruins the product unless you cut it out which means you have smaller strips so not satisfied with this,62,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5.0,positive,i used these on my helmets they are matte black and they make it pop and at night they stick out,21,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4.0,positive,a very good product i will be using this when i drive my motorcycle have not used it yet but will soon,21,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4.0,positive,great for what i needed if for used it on a loadingfor trucks at night to see where to park trailers against doors,25,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4.0,positive,you can trim the strips to put them on tricky spots i did this for my grandsons stroller the bad news is that they do tend to turn up slightly around the edges especially if the surface is slightly curved i recommend that you use this reflective tape only on flat surfaces that are not porous flat metal yes cloth no,61,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4.0,positive,i bought it to tape onto my motocycle luggage very reflective but adhesive is next to useless started to peel the next day i superglued them down it has been two months so far so good,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1.0,negative,it is very sticky but it pulls away fro plastics and metal after a few days after this i pulled the rest off plus i received some that was from a old lot you can tell it was made a long time ago i think there trying to liquidate there supply,50,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5.0,positive,i bought this to keep my trash can from becoming an unwilling accessory in a hit in run on the night before trash day it works,26,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,2.0,negative,sticking on surface will not work real good on corner,11,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1.0,negative,i used this on my dogs harness but within a day it came off and made a glue mess on the fabric,22,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1.0,negative,do not expect this to adhere to fabric for even ten minutes i bought it for my backpack and ended up having to sew it on it was a mess with all the glue which is sticky and messy but not adherent also it comes folded in thirds which creases it horribly and causes the glue in the bend to stick to itself and come off the tape if you are doing a backpack or jacket I had suggest non-adhesive tape and a needle and thread,83,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,4.0,positive,very reflective but not terribly sticky it is still on my shoes but i have to push it down periodically,19,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5.0,positive,order was on time and all was great,8,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,1.0,negative,did not stick to my coat folded plastic tried to hold it shape,13,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5.0,positive,they really are super reflective great for bicycle night time riding safety,12,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0052FU8P0,5.0,positive,the product is just that reflective strips and i chose thisthe adhesive is very sticky and i cut a piece of it and placed a little square on the back of my shoes my shoes is made where it can hold this type of product i walk a lot and sometimes when the sun goes down you want people to see you walking with little light two strips came just like what the package stated,77,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,the quality of these pins appears good and the pitch is right to fit the standard 01 perf boards however due to the length of the pins and the roundness these do not make contact with the headers on a netduino apparently longer square pins are needed for these and presumably related for example arduino boards,54,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,2.0,negative,pins are too thin to work properly with most female header receivers and breadboards they do connect but they fall out easily plus the pin has a thick base which shortens the pin on one side from what i can tell these would work great if you are soldering them to a pcb and planning on using them to solder that component to something else also like someone else said the plastic holding them together often breaks in the wrong spot leaving the end pin exposed or it falls out,89,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,pros quality is superb pins are attached thinly to eachother makes for easy separating into segments lots of pins for the price cons none,24,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,as far as pin headers go it is hard to have a bad set at least in my experience the only complaint is if you are soldering something to them the plastic starts to melt faster than other pin headers i have used in the past nothing terrible but just be cautious of this when soldering,56,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,these do not work with the common female jumper ports purchased for arduino work these are very narrow pins which do not fit into anything useful for hobbyists,28,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,if you need pin headers these are excellent they work great for soldering serial ports on embedded devices or for whatever electronic project you might be working on,28,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,must be a type o yes 010 on center great for making custom connections on costume circuit boards i find them indispensable,22,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,these are nice pins and fit the listed pitch perfectly my only complaint is that the plastic strip which you must cut to size for whatever header you are attaching to tends to break along the side of the pin not between the pins where you would want it to this is rarely an issue but if you are working in a particularly cramped space on a board or project be careful not to short the side of the pin with anything,83,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,well built product easy to solder it on the pcb effective while using in protoboard i would definitely recommend this product,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,5.0,positive,they are header pins it seems like something difficult to fail at manufacturing with a decent level of quality and maybe it is either way these header pins are good and snap easily,32,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,ad stated pins were round received header with square pins,10,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,they advertised male rond pin and i received female one they are exactly the size they advertised and i was expected but on the picture you clearly see that they are male and not female ones i think it just an error,42,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,1.0,negative,first and foremost what i received is not what was advertised i received some kind of male-female connector which are so small it is completely useless the pins are extremely short they are barely the thickness of a pcb board hole in the female side only will take an extremely small wire attempting to separate into segments results in destruction of the two pins saddling the break i do not recommend this product nor for anyone to purchase from this vendor,81,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,breaking a piece off for a header the plastic was a little brittle so it cracked around an extra [ wasted ] pin have not done a lot of this but expect this is not unusual and i just need to learn the knack soldered it up to my board and works perfectly,50,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,2.0,negative,i did not read the reviews before buying it and yes they do not fit useless for arduino breadboard in the other hand they seem sturdier and nice but i have not see a female that fits,34,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,coupler works just fine just a bit lower quality than i expected for the cost the threaded top that holds the spring and o-ring in place required reseating and a bit of tightening before it formed an air tight seal otherwise a decent product at a reasonable price after said adjustments,51,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,ball lock pin did not work with either the stainless steel carbonation cap nor the plastic one i replaced it with a different brand that works fine,26,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,it came in the mail a little slowly it was shipped to my house and was exactly what i was looking for,22,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,the reason everybody is saying this leaks is because the 1/4 mfl male fitting does not fit standard 1/4th mfl female fittings this thing is not manufactured correctly no way prevent leaks with this construction,35,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,actual product was not the same brand as advertised leaks co2,11,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,4.0,positive,it works pretty well but it does require quite a bit of force to mount onto the carbonator,18,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,we use this in combination with the carbonator cap it works but it only last 6mos before it develops leaks and must be replaced we are looking for another brand that will hopefully last longer,34,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,used in my custom built home carbonation system i did not want to pony up the cash to keep refilling sodastream tanks so i built a system myself and this little gem along with the carbonator adapter also available on amazon made it all come together,45,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,i made my own beverage carbonator like the soda stream search around you can find tutorials this was a key component,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,maybe it is the hose clamp hose combo i have but something i think this leaks i am using thein connector for home carbonating and fluid is able to pass through the connection easily and backs up in the tube build quality is good maybe i am doing something wrong,51,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,i use it to carbonate my own water i carbonate at least a half gallon a day no issues yet and i have been using it for 3 months 3 to 4 times a day,35,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,worked well for about three months then the valve stopped working but still sealed ok then it produced orange dust replaced it after another month,25,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,plugged this into my home made carbonation system and it works like a champ just make sure that the hose you have is the right size as this lock,29,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,this product worked for me just a few times before the spring assembly broke on me and all the ball bearings shot out everywhere i managed to get the bearings back in but could not get the spring fixed every time i did use it there were leaks i would not recommend this product,52,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,this piece is very hit or miss about 50 of the time it works as expected otherwise it does not seal when not connected which leads to escaping,28,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,i bought this product to use on my bissell proheat 2x professional i purchased at a big box store this was exactly what i wanted because i can use my bissell to clean the entire house and not just my carpet this really can make your investment in a floor cleaner even more useful i have a 550 square foot apartment and this tool has made cleaning the kitchen and bathroom a dream i used vinegar instead of cleaning solution and this mopped the floors better than any traditional mop and bucket also the floors were dry after i was done cleaning so my dogs would not track water paw prints through my apartment,114,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,it did what it was supposed to do,8,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,for the newer models it just clips on no screwdrivers needed the problem is that it lifts up off tile and brushes make no contact so basically you end up with a squeegee with a really weak vacuum attached,39,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,product came as described and my wife was quickly able to affix this our bissell work fairly good but our floors need some work,24,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,while this will work for many it is not what i wanted it raises the machine up so the brushes do not touch the floor acts more like a squeege with a vacuum attached,32,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,this is the second time i have order the floor tool they do wear out the foam but by using this tool attached to my bissell steam machine my ceramic tile floors are clean so much better than getting on your hands and knees,44,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,well the title of this review pretty much sums up how i feel thisworks as described which is a real blessing considering how many hard floors we have in our house for the quality the price is good which is another big plus the major downside is that this came with no real packaging and absolutely no instructions at all thewas just sealed in plastic with literally nothing else instructions packing slip and more if you do get thiswhich i would say is a good move assuming you have hard floors and a bissell floor cleanr be prepared to search for directions on the internet granted that is simple to do but I am docking a star because of poor packaging and complete lack of materials,129,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,old fashioned mop will do a better job this is not exactly a bad product for some reason i thought that it would be as good as mopping,27,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,did not buy the product through amazon went through bissell direct since i was not sure of the part number this attachment does not work well the squeegee portion is much too flimsy to effectively remove the cleaning solution even after multiple passes and the design does not provide adequate suction btw wish i would have bought it through amazon as i would be returning it now bissell wants return shipping so the cost outweighs the refund,76,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,lifts the brushes completely off the floor so there is no scrubbing just a rinse and squeegee action,18,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,did not fit the machine i have although the description said it would fit,14,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,these things make cleaning our brick floor much easier but the seams in the brick destroy the foam in the tool head so we need a few every time the floor gets a major cleaning about once a year i have noticed the same effect cleaning tile floors from the grout lines overall i still like these very much and will continue using as long as i can get them,70,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,this bare floor tool works very well the proheat cleaner puts the water / cleaner on the floor and the squegee tool does an excellent job of getting the water back up i am sure it is working well since the water is dirty i used this on a tile / grout surface without any problems you can still adjust the amount of water and cleaner just like the carpet settings my only issue is with high traffic areas still not perfectly clean this is probably more to do with the bissel cleaner than the attachment i would recommend this attachment to clean hard surfaces,101,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,awesome if you have hardwood floors it lowers to vacuumto where it needs to be for floors from the carpet height,23,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2.0,negative,shrunk considerably with just one washing before wearing way too small now very disappointed,14,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2.0,negative,just received these so i can not comment on quality yet but as i ordered two pairs at 30x30 and both are labeled as such on pair is a good six inches longer than the other so as far as quality control they are a big fail,45,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2.0,negative,beware thissays natural white what i got is labeled natural and it is definately not white i need to see if i can return this for something that is actually white these are beige and i am very disappointed,46,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4.0,positive,just received the pants a couple days ago and took him to work they feel really good they are comfortable when i receive them there was a couple of stains but i do not care because they are going to get dirty the stains were caused by the metal in it the zipper and button there just a green tarnish but like i said they are going to get dirty so i do not really care,71,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5.0,positive,fit great comfortable better than i expected double knees fit knee pads even although that is not labeled here will buy again,21,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4.0,positive,great pair of pants they are wel made and comfortable that is all i can say about these pants nice purchase,20,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4.0,positive,good product for the price excellent customer service,8,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1.0,negative,horriblewas not blue or white bad fabric felt like it would tear the moment i moved stiff and fit horrible i would have returned but should have known better than to order something cheep and expect something more,40,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5.0,positive,these are great work pants at the right price i would buy them again for my spouse,17,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,2.0,negative,we ordered 2 pair of the rugged blue pants without the reinforced knees and they worked great so we decided to order 6 pair this time this time we ordered with the reinforced knees and although my husband loves the deep tool pockets and the ability to put knee pads in for comfort every pair ripped in the seam below the zipper i was able to sew them again but next time i will go back to the other style,80,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5.0,positive,nice pants but i seriously had to learn to defend myself against all of the women who now attack me when i wear them I have never had that problem before even in speedos pros they are tight and white women love them cons it is tough to get anything done when having to beat women off of you all day,59,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1.0,negative,awful product design the front pockets are very narrow barely accommodating my cell phone the inseam is not big enough and this caused them to rip after only wearing them 3 times also there are very deep pockets in front of the knees which serve no obvious purpose,48,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5.0,positive,they wear well and are made very well only thing is the front pockets are on the small side not a lot of room for keys and more,27,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1.0,negative,thin material double knee opens to top and the crotch is a mile long very high waist line,18,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,5.0,positive,ordered these pants for my brother said they were just what he needed extra padded knees were great good sizing also,21,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1.0,negative,do not order the size you normally wear they will not fit when you try and return them you must pay a restocking fee I am not getting any bigger,27,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,1.0,negative,made of thin material i ripped both pairs that i purchased after wearing them 2 times never ripped my dickies,20,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00BCKC780,4.0,positive,they look fine and fit well true to size the fabric is very light which is nice for hot weather but probably not super long lasting great bang for the buck,31,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,not the usual welders cap has light cardboard in the bill that is malleable should still be okay under a hardhat i have a fat head for being an average albeit fat male 58 188lbs this is really tight fitting and fabric stitching audibly stretched no visible signs of wear when examined very well made and strong thick material should loosen with wear and not show it,67,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,works like it is supposed to and it is a good price,10,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,super deep like beanie deep with a really stiff bill,10,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,very uncomfortable i was not a fan and the material is really stiff,13,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,been buying this brand for over 20 years been welding longer they are nice when the brim gets soft probably have owned 6 of these hats they are true to size i wear 7 1/4 like when they cover tips of ears i wash every other week unless welding over head then more often let air dry do not put in dryer will shrink and slowly deteriorate in a shorter period of time i usually get a few years out of each hat and I am pretty hard on them,88,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,this welding cap has really held up to a ton of washings and has kept it is size without stretching so I am confident that this cap will last i gave it 4/5 stars because the cap has frayed a bit,39,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,i do not know who would even wear this it is gigantic it has a hard bill and it is taller than any head I have ever seen definitely sending it back does not even resemble the picture do not buy,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,love the way it conforms to my head,8,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,offers good protection and is comfortable to wear once you break it in it is a non reflective black which hides stains be aware that the brim is stiff like a ball cap,33,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,had is awkwardly oversized really baggy ontop of the head the brim is also basically a brim off of a fitted hat it looks like a fitted hat with a soft cap,32,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,do not believe that this will fit your big head it is a med at best medium in european standards,18,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,good quality hat runs a bit small although,8,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,i did not expect the versatility of this hat i bought it strictly for protection during my welding classes when not using my helmet this thing wears just like a hat spin it around and it covers the back of my neck very well what i could not see was how fully it covers my head and acts as a buffer between my head and helmet band and actually keeps the helmet from slipping on my head as it tends to do without the hat my head is not huge 22 3/16 around which is a med in practically every motorcycle helmet manufacturers size chart,103,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,had to return these the sizing was not as expected the brim was stiff uncomfortable for welding,16,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,hat is worn under hard hat and welding helmet does a great job of absorbing sweat and fits well with one issue hat must be worn tight to top of head due to hard hat and welding helmet hat is so deep it covers top 1/4 3/8 of ears i do not like that i have not gone back to read the description so could be my fault good quality overall,70,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,4.0,positive,just a touch of elastic makes it fit well,9,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,tooo big zize for me but i sold it to a friend,12,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,5.0,positive,fit well and it happened to be the something my husband needed but did not know he needed it until he had it,22,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,more like a baseball hat and runs small,8,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,1.0,negative,i have a small-medium head this is for an xl or xxl head,13,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,bought one of these awhile back because my new tv did not have rca out the new standard seems to be toslink digital product did what it should for anyone thinking of buying go with one that supports 192khz sample rates and fyi if you plug this in and get nothing but a clipping noise repeatedly it is because you have to go into the tv / devices settings and change the sound mode to pcm / linear pcm i stead of dolby digital/51 / dolby pro logic this is because the tv senses the toslink digital audio wire and assumes your using a source with surround sound it can not auto sense that your plugging the wire into a converter to rca which only supports 2channel audio,117,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,it worked one time for about 10 minutes then would not power back on,14,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,shipped quickly great product for the price easy to install and works perfectly,12,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,this works extremely well if your tv has a digital optical audio out only as my lg does converts the optical to standard analog which then can be transmitted by bluetooth to my hearing aids takes a long time to get although as it came airmail from china,48,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,doa the converter never powered on not worth the trouble to ship back,14,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,could use off / on switch but great product otherwise,8,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,2.0,negative,it works well with dvd player but with the satellite the volume does not play loudreally disappointed,16,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,i did not expect how good the quality of the product i was totally impress the sound quality for the price,21,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,5.0,positive,this actually works really good i have an lg 50 inch going to a kenwood surround sound older unit sounds beautiful,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,under 40 bucks with free shipping they are great using to connect a cable box to a legacy stereo system comes with a nice quality toslink cable,26,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,1.0,negative,cheap connectors did not work did not make a good connection,9,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00HGAD9VE,4.0,positive,with my tv setup i am now able to use this device to listen on headphones while tv volume is not muted before when i turned on my surround sound the only choice i had was speakers or headphones,39,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,what a disappointment firstly the soft cloth that is supposed to be included with this product is nonexistent okay so I shall use my own soft cloth no big deal right the instructions say to clean the electrode with distilled water no problem i always have several gallons of those all the time then it says to sucks it with filter paper coffee filter paper that can not be I shall use a cotton swab instead i turn it on wow the back lit display is green pretty i had one exactly like it in yellow the ridges the placement of sensors dimensions it is the same stuff with a different name now heres the big difference my old stuff worked for 3 months before it began to flash random numbers this one right from the plastic container it came in just flashed random numbers am i disappointed what do you think,149,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,small compact and did not cost too much it preformed just like the write up said it should,18,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,not user friendly directions in english but written by someone who did not understand english,14,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,easy and fast but always good to double check the accuracy occasionally,12,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,does not work even after calibrating which was a chore it still would not hold a ph reading it would swing 20 whole readings at a time bad product guess you get what you pay for,34,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,easy to use be sure to calibrate with distilled water and follow the directions good instructions if you follow closely without trying it on your own,26,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,tester appeared to work fine when delivered 1 month later the readings jump all over in test media and tap water used supplied test buffer solution first reading should be 4 get 47 clean and try again in 1 min now reads over 6 and not steady not reliable enough to trust would not recommend,55,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,great ph meter for my sons science fair project,9,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,seems to work real well for checking the mash ph,10,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,i received thisat no charge in exchange for an honest review i have a more expensive ph meter which has a few more features but for basic checking where accuracy although this is still accurate is not as huge of a deal this is a no brainer the biggest difference here is that when you calibrate it you are responsible for turning a screw screwdriver is included to reset the ph level others automatically calibrate this the cap also does not have an easy way to store sterilized water in it which can help keep it calibrated the good news is that it has a decent plastic case which holds the meter and the screwdriver it is an incredibly low price in my opinion and having to manually calibrate is not a huge deal this is a no brainer,138,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,works well under open air conditions when used in enclosed bucket with the lid only open enough to fit device gave wildly inaccurate readings 15 to 11 in actual 6 ph water removing lid completely always worked although a good product for precise usually and fast ph readings,48,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,this ph meter is easy to read and comes with a nice case for storage it comes with a screwdriver to use for calibration and a sheet with instructions i tried it with distilled water and tap water and found that it does not give a precise reading it sort of fluctuates a bit around the correct ph of the fluid thus it can give an approximate reading but is not precise enough for scientific work this is fine for home users and a usefulfor this price range i was provided a free sample of thisfor my honest review,104,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,for any accurate consistent readings thisis next to worthless if you are measuring something where the reading does not need to be completely accurate this will do just fine however if you are getting this for hydroponic or water testing use i would recommend investing more money in to something more accurate i am using this for water testing and need to re calibrate every single time i use it which ends up costing me calibration-liquid cost so in the end i am no better buying this cheap tool for me it is barely tolerable,95,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,this device turned out to be perfect for my purpose i distill my own water i like to raise the ph to give the water some character with this meter i was able through trial and error to come up with the exact amount of solution to add to my water to bring ph to the desired level i can not imagine how many ph drop bottles i might have gone through had i gone that route it is a little slow to get to the final level but you can speed that up considerably just swishing it around a little one bonus shocker was i did not know how high my city water ph was until i tested it oh and the calibration was easy with the two packets supplied,129,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,good value for the money however at least two pack each of the testing solution should have been part of the shipment the instruction for calibrating the pen needs to be written better,33,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,inexpensive easy to use seems to give stable results although i have not checked it against any lab-quality instrumentation good enough for telling if my water and fertilized water is in range or seriously out of whack,36,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,did not last more than 3 months became impossible to calibrate,10,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,do not last just failed after two years without using it,12,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,for the cost you can not do better it even has a backlight which is super useful in darker areas please remember that when using a ph meter keep the unit in your test solution long enough for he numbers to stabilize or your reading will not be reliable,48,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,junk does not even hold calibration for 10 secs when you turn it off buy gallons of calibration solution if you buy this meter you will need it,26,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,this thing is so moody it never settles on a number i use it to adjust the ph in my hot tub this thing is not accurate and has caused me to over acid the hot tub too many times it will read 84 for 4 rounds of adding acid and then jump down to 24 crazy thing that after calibrating it before each use I am going to toss it in the garbage and go buy my old version it worked great until i accidentally tossed it in the washing machine with my robe,94,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,1.0,negative,horrible and worthless the readout is so sensitive the numbers jump around way to much as soon as u pick it up to calibrate it it starts reading 1 or 18 and then jumps around everywhere look elsewhere for a ph pen,42,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i can confirm that the advertisement is accurate the focal distance is a few centimeters out to infinite the image quality is good 640x480 using an adapter i was able to plug this into my samsung galaxy s4 active with a webcam app i downloaded the camera head is under 6 mm i measured it with a dial caliper the wire is flexible and will not hold shape very happy with my purchase update i bought this for work at my shop and recently used it to inspect a combustion chamber in an engine i was impressed with image quality the convenience of using my smart phone with it was great i was able to capture the image of the piston damage and quickly email it I am going to buy another,129,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,actually does have infinite focal length i tried other borescopes that you could not really see anything farther than 6 away i plugged this in to my android with a micro usb adapter and had an instantly portable borescope setup awesome,40,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,not 55 mm the diameter of the scope is 85 mm 35 inches which means it will not fit into the bore of most rifles worthless for bore inspection,28,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,pretty decent picture for a reasonable priced endoscope you need to look at several aps to find the one that works the best with these and one that works great with this one does not work well with the short one i have,42,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,did not fit in 22 cal as advertised,8,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,the sensor worked well when connected to my portable mini lap top pc however when i inserted the probe into the pvc drain lines i could not see anything so i never did find the reason the line was plugged i was disappointed,42,5

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,amazing device for the price it works better than expected however the tiny accessories that you can fit at the end are somewhat hokey,24,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,works fine for the price software that came with it is a bit sketchy set off my antivirus software however connected fine with windows 10 and did not need the software that came with it,35,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,maximum resolution of device 640x480 did not match advertised resolution of 1024x768,12,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,nice camera with many uses not as clear a picture as i would like but for the price not a bad deal,22,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,pretty much useless i bought this to locate something that fell down into a oil pan on a car understood this is not a big dollar hd camera but it was totally useless it does have adjustable led lighting which helps but the images are so bad you still will not know what your looking at i purchased the phone adapter and that was even worse do not bother there was a glimmer of hope using a laptop but no i do not mean to leave a bad review but it is not the tool for automotive use i suppose it might help looking behind drywall but most likely not it was shipped fast and arrived in great condition but all it will see is the trash can after trying to use it,130,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,came in on time and use this alot for my installs will be ordering again thanks,16,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,these guys all lie about the resolution tiny picture,9,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,performs exactly as advertised used with a laptop so have not tried any of the phone / tablet software just an awesome tool to have available,24,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i did not think this would do the job for 15 you should not be able to get an endoscope a few years ago this would have been seriously expensive we use this to run down rifle barrels it does a very impressive job,42,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,worthless i tried looking into a cylinder on my diesel could not see a thing looked into a sewage pipe and again could not see anything,24,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,received exactly as advertised smooth transaction thank you,9,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,i tested this product with a desktop computer an android tablet and an android phone sometimes the device was recognized sometimes it was not a whole two if the times that it was actually recognized as a camera device i was able to get video from it for about 20 seconds,50,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,works awesome very clear picture with my samsung s6 used it to check a piston on my diesel engine,19,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,if you want a picture perfect nikon quality photo look elsewhere this product seems to be well made and is handy to have around if you get into a jam you can not go wrong for the price,37,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,worst instructions ever only a few sentences by somebody who is not too familiar with english software is windows only,19,23

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,worked on windows 10 image quality is just ok i use it to verify that a piece of plastic filler spout had gone down a catepillar oil filler spout if it had not been bright yellow i probably would have missed it,41,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,i was shipped a look alike product software was in chinese absolutely useless,13,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for and in this case that is very very little trying to get anything in focus is virtually impossible and as a bore scope it is worthless,32,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,the pix are clear only if you have additional lighting in dark places the light provided by the built in leds is woefully inadequate the software to run the camera is dangerous you can not select where it installs and it self installed on my recovery drive which would have ruined it but finally was removed with much effort and sweat as it turns out i did not need their software anyway my computers built in camera software ran it just fine it recognized the usb camera and allowed me to select it and do much more with the images,98,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,definately worth the purchase windows application provided with the camera is easy to use and comprehendsive in terms of functionality applications for this 5 meter long canmrra with sufficently bright leds to illuminate the picture,35,30

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,it looks like it had been previously used by someone else box was obviously opened as well as the plastic bag instructions were old and dirty,26,35
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,could use a higher resolution camera would work better if focusing were closer for the money i feel ti to be a great buy,24,36
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,works well impressed with quality for the low price,9,37
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,bad manufacturing quality usb connector wobbling in it is casing stopped working after using it a couple of times,18,38
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,picture is not crystal clear but works very well anyways used for vehicle mechanical work to see into small areas you can not normally see and brings the image onto our laptop,31,39
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,excellent product my husband is a mechanic he says that this really helps him he does not have to completely disassemble something to see what is going on inside a great time saver works great with a laptop or a smart phone with adapter the one down side is that it is incompatible with the kindle for the money you can not go wrong,62,40
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,camera quality too low to be useful does not work with a mac,12,41
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,the usb endoscope arrived promptly and was easy to use the camera requires no special or proprietary software and gives a clear image inwith a usb adapter for a tablet it can be used easily it is tricky to control the camera position the farther the came a is pushed away unless being used down a pipe or other object to stabilize the shaft image is clear and in,73,42
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i bought this for checking the barrels of rifles that i work on great picture and it hooked up to my lap top and was working in a couple of minutes,31,43
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,can not find an app to use with phones several apps tried none successful please advise,15,44
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,went out and got an adapter to use with phone / tablet at work thing will not work at all the usb casing broke and had to be glued back together too poor quality pictures just all around junk,37,45
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for not high quality video not a bad product,14,46
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,camera works well instructions were written as if by a martian cd did not work at all had to download driver from internet,23,47
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,camera does not work without software but software disk is so loaded with viruses and malware that I am not about to try running any programs on it norton blocked 4 viruses before i even tried to install the drivers do not buy this product,43,48
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,needs ability to select focus point instead of fixed focal point at 3 - 6 inches,14,49
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,needs more lighting but the small head makes it great to get into the small areas i attach another small flashlight to the head nice clear video,27,50
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works fine my only complaint that it needs a cd to be installed could not use it with my smart phone or a tablet tried several apps but none of them worked,31,51
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,no way to get a driver no site no brand name forget it,13,52
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,took a long time to find an app that works with it but i did finally get it to work occasionally on my phone the picture is very coarse and unfocused i do find it somewhat useful in very small spaces but if you could fit a larger camera i would look for a 7 mm or 8 mm one instead this will fit the barrel of a 22 rifle,68,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,not impressed at all i would have to rate the quality of the image worse than the camera from the first camera phone,23,54
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,this works well as a bore scope to check the condition of rifle and shotgun barrels,16,55
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,not the resolution it claims to be false advertising,9,56
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,i am happy to say that this endoscope / borescope works with my note ll it does get hot when in operation so my remedy is to use it only for short periods at a time for the price i am content with the low resolution and actually it is not that bad,51,57
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,needed this forwork inspection but the focal length of the camera is 5 to 6 feet away like a cell phone or usb computer camera so anything within 12 - 24 inches of the camera are out of focus it is really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long usb cord attached to it adjustable leds work fine except you can not completely turn them off even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like ai assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded but that totally negates it is use as a scope in a reflective environment maybe i just got one that did not have it is focal point adjusted correctly or something but as it is it will not work as advertised one plus is that it would work on my cell phone with a 3rd party app and a micro usb converter but i had to send this one back in favor for another from ebay,187,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,it is great for what it is i used this in combination with an usb to usb otg adapter and webcam software to turn my smart phone into an inspection camera does everything i want it to do and best of all cost less than 25,45,59
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,plugged it into my mac laptop worked great via photo booth for about 20 seconds then the usb connector hardware literally fell to pieces another piece of chinese junk my friends buyer beware,31,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works great the image is zoom in a little to close for my needs,14,61
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,works pretty well and is a lot of fun the end gets warm to the touch as my teenage son realized trying to stick it up his nose priceless,28,62
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i work as a plumber and this is a wonderful tool to use to actully see the clog on my tablet it is awesone works well nice andclearthe cable is long enough to see the problem and also as an auto mechanic it is great to as with these new cars today it is hard to see anything by the naked eye this tool well let you see everything you normally can by eye excellent tool i recommend it to everyone to see things you thought possible great beef in get yours yours today very happy customer john h noone,98,63
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,do not work no detection by the pc soft installed j tried with other soft it is a hardware problem,19,64
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,excellent for the price i used this endoscope to help fish wires out of the wall for a surround sound speaker setup i did a video write up on it here [ ] fast forward to 830 for the actual video footage if your interested cons i did notice reduction in frames per second and clarity in low light conditions even with built-in light the light only works well in confined spaces where there is very nearby objects for the light to bounce off of inserting the endoscope inside an acoustic guitar sound port for example yields poor visibility,97,65
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,did not work with samsung galaxy s3 tried camerafi and mscopes apps with no luck,15,66
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,it is too flimsy to be able to direct the camera through pipes beyond 3 feet can not easily control it is direction of travel and orientation light gets hot quickly,28,67
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,wow so useless light did not work very well could not see down into a cylinder head on the car which was why we bought it,26,68
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,only got about 15 minutes use out of it it got wet but was not underwater at all in the middle of looking behind firewall in vehicle for rain water it just went away ms windows no longer recognized it tried it on different pcs running windows10 and vista while it was working and when i tested it things were great image was clear and adjusting the led lites worked fantastic i am not sure if moisture got in the camera head or the usb plug and lite control went bad the plug end was extremely sloppy and loose if i get another one i will seal around cable / camera connection and beef up the usb plug no problem getting refund so that was nice too,124,69
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,timely shipping excellent product and most importantly very easy to set up and use,14,70
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,this product worked easily i have windows 8 and simply installed the software on my laptop camera worked well the only reason i did not give it five stars is because the image it provides is a little soft resolution wise but other reviews mention that plus the light is not strong enough to site down a five foot cavity to the end would i buy it again yes,68,71
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,plug and play with photo booth on a mac great resolution,11,72
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,exactly as described not the highest quality picture nor the brightest leds on the end but for the price it works fine i was able to peer into the cylinders through the injector hole of my 30l mercedes diesel to see the valve stick in the piston now if only this thing could pull the engine for me,59,73
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,works great if you do not have a integrated camera on your computer if you do it gets all screwed up and only brings up the computer camera,27,74
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,small form factor and real easy to use however the camera has very poor resolution i would recommend spending a little bit more money on a camera with higher resolution rating,31,75
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,broke less than a year picture is not very clear I am not sure how it is 720p the leds are not bright enough to illuminate a dark space because the camera has a long focus length,35,76
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,I am using this camera on my macbook os x 1011 using photo booth as the viewer the picture quality is not great as expected with a cheap device but it works perfectly you can use it to tease your cat or look in your own eye or many other things,50,77
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,the camera and lights is not centered inside the case,10,78
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected works well and good clear photos and videos until camerafi quit working on my android i hope they will fix camerafi soon,25,79
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,could not get the camera to deliver an image to the computer could not take a picture or video waste of money,20,80
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,gave it 4 stars for great value for the price quality seems pretty good resolution decent if you understand the limitations of what you are doing software is ok at best can easily view on laptop screen picture capture still eludes me beats the heck out of tearing a wall open to see in was able to easily observe outboard cylinder condition although spark plug hole which is why is chose this one over one with a larger camera but again it is not a miracle and you need to be slow and patient i have not yet tried to attach to smartphone,102,81
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,kind of hard to use make out images as a mechanic get a better one,15,82
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,after reading reviews i was not sure if this would work or not but i gave it a try after plugging it into my usb port the leds came to life i did not want to risk installing their software so i looked for an existing program to display the video i found that i could use the play capture device setting in vlc to stream the video on my windows computer with no issues overall I am very happy with the camera i used it to track a cable through a wall the small size helped the camera is tiny as i could easily fit it through the existing access point the led brightness control worked as expected and allowed me to get a good image i was very happy with the focus range it was definitely a lot more than a few inches which seems to be an issue on some of the other similar cameras i used a coat hanger and later a fish tape to direct the camera where i wanted it to go this was not the easiest task but it was rather fun like playing a video game,190,83
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,i had no luck with this product my laptop running windows 10 would not recognize the compact cd i tried everything i could think of to get it to checked the auto-run it was on tried to access it through the file explorer nothing worked i really wanted one to go with the laptop i returned it,57,84
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,did not know i needed until i bought it windows 8 and above works right out of the box no software necessary software and drivers for windows 7 and earlier included whether you want to see what has in that smellyor that mole on you back this adjustable lighted endoscopic camera fits the bill,54,85
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,piece of junk i could not get it to work with my dell laptop windows 2009 macbook pro or 2015 macbook air,21,86
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,the image went solarized after a few minutes of use i tried it on several different phones and tablets so it was definitely an issue with the endoscope,28,87
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,after very little use several times the lens fell off and then the housing came off and then the connections broke very useless it is a nicethe lights need a little bit of work brighter but it is a fantastic size,43,88
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,it worked once than died i gave up and threw it away,12,89
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works great could be a little bit brighter light otherwise no troubles good video pics,15,90
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,for what it costs and for checking out things like the condition of a gun barrel or trumpet leadpipe it is what the doctor ordered it will even enter a 22 barrel most of the time some 22s have a tighter muzzle for some reason the image quality is somewhat uncertain much of the time but there are some adjustments in the program that comes with it that helps that problem,70,91
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,i purchased this to allow me to inspect the inside of my chimney it worked ok but not with the clarity i was hoping for i think the problem was a lack of light because before and after the camera worked fine also the diameter of the pipe may have also been a factor i will find other uses for this around the house so i think it is worth the money,71,92
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works as advertised low resolution can not see very far from end of camera no control over where it is pointed but expected that,22,93
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works well although i hardly use it just a one time purchase to help see the inside of a wall,19,94
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,this is a great way to see where you can not go investigate small openings in parts and more a friend of mine used it to investigate a boat cooling heat exchanger and it works zip tie it to the boat hook and inspect the prop or the hull,47,95
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,the 55 mm diameter gets this into lots of places and the longer length goes even more illuminated so it works excellent for any inspected,24,96
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,the video / picture quality is very poor it is really grainy there was malware embedded in the software do not but this product,20,97
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i love that i can buy a fiber optic camera like this for 20 it came as described and works exactly as i expect when a product like this can be delivered right to my house for this price I am amazed yeah we do not have hover boards or flying cars yet but we definitely are living in the future,59,98

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,the led lights up the computer see it but no picture,11,102
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,the included software amcap would not install on win 7 using the setupexe on the disk it would just crash the installation software but you can just copy all the files to a new directory on your hard drive and run it from there apparently it does not make changes to the registry file just make a shortcut to amcap executable file and put the shortcut on your desk top it works sort of it will not go to resolution of better than 640x480 i do not know if that is the fault of the camera or the software i might try some webcam free ware see if it will get better resolution i also intend to run it on a tablet i am waiting for amazon to deliver a usb to microusb converter i hope the resolution will be better than 640x480 on the tablet that is a little too primitive and not what was promised,155,103
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,stop do not purchase this product it is very poorly documented and one can not reach the manufacturer to discuss means for getting it to function,25,104
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,really a nice product for the price does get warm / hot after a bit on the end due to the light,20,105
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,view can be blurry have to get it in just the right place that is understandable for the small diameter size which we expected served purpose used it to view inside car valve cylinders and to check metal roof for leaks,41,106

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,not the greatest picture quality but it helped me run a new water line for my fridge so I am happy with it,22,108
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,i expected more cuality maybe is good for plumbers o people who search in a small holes something and have a portable computer with cd s reader on it to me is unpractical but i have it now and maybe i will use some day for something that i do not kow yet,51,109
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,works fine where there is light in a tight dark space of my boat the view was pretty useless might be good for a rifle bore or something close up,30,110
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,excited when it came installed software worked great until i bent the flex wire and shorted out the camera light comes on but camera now does not work overseas no recourse no warranty,32,111

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,piece of garbage it broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box definitely want money back,20,116
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,i does not do any good what seller says video is very poor even in enough light conditions cd driver is damaged so you need to figure it out how to use it without it and overheating is another problem you need to handle,43,117
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,worked great image quality is not anything to brag about awesome price for what it is,15,118
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,edit 8/30/15 i tried just about everything to get this to work with a tab 2 including different apps and rooting the tablet and changing the os i finally gave up and bought a galaxy tab s and it does work with that so i can now give it 4 stars works with laptop but disappointed it did not work with a samsung galaxy tab 2 tried connecting with an otg cable and camerfi app but can not get it to work,81,119
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,good value only getting 640x480 resolution from motion software have outside watching a robin nest and it is working well you may want to mark the top with a piece of tape or dot of paint i found this to be helpful for how i use it,47,120
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,performed bettert than i expected for this price worked well with both mac and pc field of view was great and the integrated leds were super worked as well at 3000 bore scopes i have used in the past,39,121
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,two of the leds were dead and when it went down into the cylinders i could not see anything i have a 3 minute video of nothing but darkness when it was supposed to be checking piston carbon build up,40,122
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,extremely poor viewing quality no focus to identification much of anything not a good purchase i m not happy at all can not recommend it to anyone sure would be happy with a refund,33,123
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,get what you pay for i tried to use it to inspect a clogged pipe all mediocre reviews are correct the picture quality is poor not even close to what would be expected from an hd camera focal distance is very short and led lights are barely sufficient to illuminate subject within focal length the view angle is also narrow so narrow that it will not cover inside of 1 1/2 pipe with in the focal distance of the lens the usb connector is so flimsy it rattles and i used electrical tape to hold is together so that it would not fall apart when plugging it in or worst unplugging i was able to use it for my need but barely and with great disappointment i can see it performing better in other situations but fo pipe inspection it was just barely adequate if you do not expect much in first place would not recommend it,156,124
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,worked with an app that came with the pc not your high def camera but the picture is ok for viewing into inaccessible areas overall it works well for me,30,125
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,the lens was scratched out of the box the leds glare on the lens slightly washing out the picture on all brightness levels even on the highest brightness setting the leds do not put out enough light to illuminate an object from more than an inch or so away if it is bright enough to see it is too close to get good focus and detail on top of all that it is not 720p it is 640x480,74,126
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works with my macbook using photo booth but the image is mirrored for some reason easy enough to mirror it back when editing but a little disorienting during use my mbs fairly old so i do not know if newer models have the same issue dimmable leds are a nice touch,50,127
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,hd l-o-l not funny it is not hd however focus is the main issue with this unless there has distance from the object so it is in focus if there has something in front it will be blurry like fk you have no ideak what the fuck you are looking at,47,128
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,this would be 3 stars but the price is just so great i was in need of a scope to check a cylinder on an engine most of these run upwards of 200 however i thought for the price i would give it a try the video clarity is not the best i am sure there are similar products that have a higher quality however at this price point it really is hard to beat if you are looking to read fine print inside of a dark hole this may not be the best but to get an eye on the inside and to do it quickly and at a low price point it can not be beat since using it on the engine i have used it around the house several times by hooking it up to my laptop i am able to get a very good look in small openings gun barrels drain pipes even inside the wall running wires,160,129
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,be very careful with it easy to break the usb end,11,130
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,640x480 resolution but for the price it is amazing built in illumination 15 feet long can be hooked up to a samsung galaxy s4 for use on the go sam fisher would be envious,33,131
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,good for the purpose i use to see down gun barrels for cleaning inspections is not as good lens quality as others but good enough,24,132
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works well just the usb plug is loose,8,133
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,better then expects this camera has great resolution especially close,10,134
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,poor resolution and no focus not usable as otoscope,9,135
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,the quality of the image from the camera and craftsmanship of the product is not 5-star but for the price i considered rating it a five instead of a four i used this to check for an obstruction in one of my pvc vent pipes found the birds nest and got it taken care of money well spent i connected the camera to my fish tape and it was rugged enough to be fed into the pipe i also used it to check one of my sinks the led lights at the end are not super bright but bright enough to illuminate a 1 to 4 or so pipe there is a little luminance adjustment on the usb end of the light to control the brightness i can confirm that this works with windows 7 and fedora 21 64-bit,139,136
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,one led was not working so i returned thethanks again to amazon for the simple return also the image was not as clear as my first phone camera ten years ago i was very disappointed in the resolution of the image and do not recommend this product,48,137
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,work for two days then the lights stop working not happy,11,138
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i downloaded a driver that allowed me to use my andriod phone as a screen helped find ain my hot tube also used this to insoect and repair a tub drian in my home,36,139
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,software is not compatible with windows xp and 7 no instructions on finding drivers or how to install software,19,140
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,not quite what i was hoping for i was not expecting great image quality from a 20 borscope but the real issue with thisis the focus distance the minimum focal distance for this unit is about 3 cm anything closer that that is blurry this works ok for some applications but in tight spots it is no good this also is a problem with the lights on this camera they are not bright enough to light up dark areas more than about 5 or 6 cm away but when you get close enough for the lights to work you are too close for the camera to focus the software that comes with the camera works fine but i was not able to get it to work with some other applications that i have used in the past,138,141
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,to me it is amazing the picture quality is grate the lights work do not know how waterproof it is yet the cable is more than i need i got it for work unable to use it yet can not get the software toon my amazon fire,46,142
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i am a professional technician and this borescope worked very well for me i use it with my phone,20,143
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,it works hope it was a little more stiff,9,144
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,junk did not even work1 1/2 led out usb end started to come apart would not advise to buy,17,145
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,great endoscope for the price it has a usb interface you can use the camera to view record or capture images the light intensity is adjustable on the usb connector,30,146
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,did not work for me because my computer not working and can not use it on anything less it has usb i gabe it away,25,147
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,i purchased the usb endoscope because my wedding ring fell behind the backsplash on my kitchen counter i tried looking with a mirror a camera and flashlight could not see anything the small endoscope camera with leds was perfect once i figured out which program to use on the computer i put it behind the counter and it did not take 30 seconds to see my ring the image is reversed so it took some concentration to snag my ring with a hooked piece of wire but once i did it came out fairly easy well worth 20 as opposed to a hasty kitchen remodeling project if you do engine work or musical instrument repair this would be good for that too i looked inside a guitar i recently bought the camera has a good picture and the adjustable leds are bright,140,148
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,as stated in previous you get what pay for a 20 dollar camera great for minor look in the hole jobs i love it for what i need it for which is to check the bore on my rifles now if your looking for small detail in firearms this not for you however if you just want to check for debris and pitting or light rust in barrel this is good enough to check all bores down to 22lr and 556 yes it just fits with a little wiggling but be careful also play with settings in the software for a better picture,103,149
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,main purpose is to look down shower / sink drains i hooked it up to my android smartphone via micro usb to usb adapter image quality is like most others say good to acceptable not great but for the inexpensive price that is exactly what i was expecting the led is also poor to acceptable in illuminating the shower drain my next use for this is to drill a hole in the wall to check if the shower is really leaking or if it is just my imagination although due to it is lack of holding shape I am going to have to plan this out first,101,150
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i like it it does what i need and more tks ozzy,13,151
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,brought a micro usb adapter and use it with my phone very handy tool to have around good picture quality too,21,152
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,video quality is very very low res looks like an oldprobably not even that good i have ear tubes i had one blow out while i do not expect to self diagnose myself i just wanted to be able to see if they are in place the last time i went in to thehe showed me my eardrum and it was plain to see there was a big prob so i got this camera with this camera you just can not see much detail when looking inside something it is just very low quality video in general at the same time what can you expect for a 20 endoscope i rolled theand it is not so hot my bad i will not return it it is 20 worth of endoscope I had suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube videos showing the video quality this one is just not worth even the 20 because you just can not see anything clearly so it is kind of useless yes i cleaned the lens i have many cameras gopros and many other electronics all my life I am the guy everyone calls to help or fix their stuff trust me save your money,204,153
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,worked perfect for my needs i was able to get it into an attic that has no access to allow viewing i will be using this on our boat,29,154
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,simple software and great equipment although lacking in strength i just used sturdy hanger wire to snake it through not back at all,23,155
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,after testing this unit i am very pleased with this device works as designed great picture quality i use it for inspections,23,156
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,camera is low megapixels led is not as bright as i hoped with 6 leds,15,157
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,i buy several different models of inspection cameras and resell them at snowmobile shows and swaps they sell themselves i sell them to repair shops and to people who work on their own motors they can look inside the engine for damage without disassembling it first i have used one to locate a problem inside the third door on my sons 2003 chevy s-10 it would not open i located the problem and fixed it what a wonderful tool all you need is a laptop computer,85,158
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,for the money this is a phenomenal product it took me a little while too make it work with my s4 smart phone but once i found the app it was easy and versatile usb camera is what the app is called great buy would recommend highly,47,159
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,2 of the 6 leds are very dim but it still works well the real test will be how long it last scott,23,160
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,works pretty good software that came with did not work got other software and everything works good the picture is a little blurry sometimes but these usually are,28,161
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,it is nice small and compact has a preset focal length if you want to view something up close sol software supplied is generic common found on other scopes,28,162
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,very impressed with this camera bought it to inspect some ductwork under my house the camera worked great and focused to infinity as promised just used an adapter to plug it into my android tablet and with a webcam app it worked perfect never could get the pc to read the little cd but did not need it this thing must have 20 feet of cable con the adjustable lights worked as advertised but are so small they are not much good trying to see more than about 4 - 6 inches since i needed to see further in the dark i taped a bright key chain type light onto the camera that worked pretty well but then it was hard to orient the camera so i knew which way was up ended up taping the whole thing on the end of a flat stick i could push along knowing how it was oriented i think it is a great buy,158,163
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,it worked for a while under windows 8 no need to use the cd that came with it as it self installs and the win 8 camera app does the basics for you the picture was pretty grainy and washed out but probably acceptable for most applications after dipping it in my pool water to inspect a pipe it died within 60 seconds assuming that it is a typical chinese quality control issue I am going to return and order another one hopefully i will get lucky and the next one will actually be waterproof as the description claims,98,164
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,in a bright lite room it gives a good picture but in a wall cavity the 6 leds are useless and you can see nothing a total waste of money,30,165
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,for about 20 this was very worth it mine came without a software disc but i did not plan on using that anyways still the description says it comes with one so that brings the product down to 4 stars usbwebcamera on the google play store worked just fine for my purpose along with this i purchased a 4 usb otg adapter so i managed to connect this to a galaxy s5 essentially i now have a 720p camera with a 0217 55 mm diameter at the end of a 16 cable connected to a pocket size hd display for 25 my wife uses it to check for ear infections / inflammation so the small diameter really helps we also have one that has a 0276 7 mm camera that will become my work one now because it is just a little too big to shove in an ear the leds are pretty bright and do not make the end too hot the adjust-ability is also better than our other scope even although it has a noticeable jump from medium to high intensity the focus does seem to be infinite but it seems at any distance things are a little fuzzy still for what it is I am happy,202,166
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,only issue with this is that it is not android friendly,11,167
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,the camera is very small 5 mm and has a narrow field of view this is adequate for it is function looking into small spaces that are difficult to get to i am planning on using it to view my hvacwork using a fish tape to get the camera into thework the included cable is too flexible to force the camera anywhere a good thing as it increases where it can go the image is inand detail is good you will need video software to use it my laptop could not read the included cd and i could not find a manufacturer site to download it i was able to use movie maker win7 to view the camera i have the 15 m version and purchased a 15 m usb extension to attach to the cable should i need it i do have a concern for the lens on the camera it is exposed,159,168
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,this seems to be a bargain for the price i expect you could find a scope with better overall performance but the price would reflect it so far so good still trying to figure out how to save images,39,169
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,it would get 4 stars but the disk did not work with windows 8 i did use it on my galaxy s5 active with a adapter and a free app that was pretty awesome,34,170
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,i needed to use the included software computer did not automatically turn on pre-loaded webcam software installed the camera no problem magnet wire thing included are helpful for pushing it along i would like a bit more stiffness in the cable to be able to push into ducts farther away without curling up on itself,56,171
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4.0,positive,connected to my laptop running windows 81 and used the camera app that came loaded on the computer picture quality is as good as to be expected from such a small camera it got the job done,37,172
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,you can never be 100 sure where viruses come from but i am almost positive this camera installed a trojan horse when i used it,25,173
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,this thing is total crap no where near 720p and the lights make everything you view either washed out or gray with no contrast the dial to adjust the led is not linear there is a large amount of adjustment that occurs on the first 1/5th of the dial the rest of the dial is basically useless i am returning this because it is useless for my purpose buyer beware,70,174
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,focus and clarity is not what i expected maybe at this price you should not expect more but i would not recommend,21,175
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,junk in my opinion the image was terrible,8,176
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,the borescope works as intended and i do like it the only drawback to my order was that a set of 3 borescope mirrors showed up as being compatible with this scope but they were not would not fit and not for this particular scope the mirrors that showed up are yunanwa supereyes borescope side view mirror set 30 45 60 degrees for borescope endoscope n005 n013j n015 series so if you order this scope and see these mirrors listed as being a good add-on to your order do not get them as they do not fit this unit,99,177
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,1.0,negative,you have to spend money to get a good camera do not waste your money you are not going to be seeing jack,21,178
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,works great until you smash it between a piston and cylinder head,12,179
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,this was a gift my son liked it no details,11,180
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5.0,positive,it works on my mac with no problem,8,181
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,really functional just be sure your drill is large enough to accommodate it,13,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,the bits do not secure well in the holder and the holder did not secure well on my drill wasted money,19,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,real handy does cover up switches on top of drill I shall work around it,14,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,just buy what ever the brand sells for your drill to hold bits do not buy this it is rubber with no way of securing it i tryed using tie wire nuisanve,29,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,i have one on my drill and one on my screw impact driver you may want to cut out a hole for the drill speed switch on top if the holder is too loose use a zip tie to tighten the loops around the drill,45,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,nicebut i wanted it to fit an electric screwdriver and it is a little big for that i just need to shorten the straps,25,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,works perfectly on my 18v bosch impact driver,8,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,5.0,positive,does what it should it holds bits and stays in place on my ridgid drill,15,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,drive holders are starting to lose their grip,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,difficult to use bits are larger than each holding space,10,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,4.0,positive,this is such a great invention i wish they were more available and/or that they lasted longer i have them on all my drills at work and home but have to replace them often as rhey stretch over time and then the bits fall out,45,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,it interfers with other fuctions of my 2spd drill,9,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,2.0,negative,this was apparently designed for older models of drills compact modern drills do not have the real estate to accommodate this large holder but maybe you can put it somewhere else wherever that place is it is probably a lot less convenient than right on the drill it is made of good quality materials and functions well but it is too big,59,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,straps either cover built in drill light or interfere with chuck clutch when trying to change direction on dewalt 18v,20,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00SJOOABY,1.0,negative,this is junk did not hold bit they just fall out do not waist your money like i did,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,so the only key design i needed did not line up i got it to work but it keeps slipping i only needed it for that one key so i can not comment on the rest of them I shall probably never use it again,42,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,appears to be good quality easy used and heads swapped however wrong key for my need,16,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,wish it had a 3/8 end as well,8,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,a good tool but does not have either of the heads we use for twc,14,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,i was shocked with it it is awesome no more carring five tools for one job,16,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,I am going to have to send it back the inserts are larger than the opening it seems like the most primitive quality control check would be to test fit the inserts before packaging perhaps even packaging it with the tips inserted to ensure they fit would be the way to go very disappointed i gave it two stars because it seems the quality of the materials are decent,68,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,can wrench is smaller than star keys none of star key is able to insert into can wrench,18,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,bought this for the multiple star attachments as i work in multiple markets and did not want to buy multiple 25 50star tools worked fine for a month or 2 but then the star tool tip separated from the interchangeable piece and is no longer usable I have tried using the tips with pliers but they are too smooth to be able to apply enough pressure to turn the locks,67,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,does not work with any of the patel or lockbox florida area,11,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,works good do not have any issues recommend the store,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,great too for comcast infinity metal boxes i live in fresno this has four different sizes,17,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,2.0,negative,rusted in 2 months and the heads are stuck low quality,11,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,none of the tips fit the mdus in my area very disappointing being that there was four tips one of the tips was the exact opposite,26,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,4.0,positive,great ped key but the additional star keys do not really work on any peds in central florida,17,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,5.0,positive,worked perfectly to open a comcast pedestal with the irregular 5 point slam ped tamper proof lock,17,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,head was slightly mis-shapened and would not catch the lock correctly,11,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,the hex sockets do not fit together and the depth on the star key made them slip out of the lock really disappointed and I have found better on another website just a waste of money,34,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00UFIH956,1.0,negative,the inserts do not fit the wrench also some of the star patterns are deformed i actually read the bad reviews saying the same and thought they would have resolved the issue by now sadly they have not this is a scamit is literally useless in every way what a waste of my time and manufacturing resources,57,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,actually pretty decent not or quality but will work in a pinch,12,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excelent product i would buy more in the future good grip and excellent suture cut far better than the olders i used before,23,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,absolutely the best if you do a lot of suturing and i do these are head and shoulders above stainless steel shears and worth every penny the tungsten carbide blades fly through gutand silk threads the needle drivers also grip fantastic these days i actually get in a bad mood when suturing without this little work of art some people are not big fans of the olsen design but if you pay attention while working you can avoid accidentally cutting your thread prematurely this has cut my suture time down a lot I am one very happy customer,99,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these were awful you can not grab anything without having to lock them which is incredibly annoying i guess you get what you pay for,24,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,I am a medical student who purchased this needle driver for tying practice and it was such a disappointment the drivers do not open and close smoothly and it does not put a good grip on the suture at all if you were looking for something close to or quality needle drivers do not go with this brand i found that the ones provided in my medical kit i ordered through school worked a lot better,74,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,not a good needle holder ok as hemostat clamp,9,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,very poor quality product the instrument is not comfortable in ones hands and the it does not move smoothly at all when adjusting the grip would not recommend,28,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,they work pretty good but the scissor part is hard to get to you still need to have separate scissors,20,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excellent quality will be using a long timel,8,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,this is a good product and is very useful,9,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,perfect for practicing my sutures in veterinary school,8,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,bought these for my son here is his comment I am a fourth year veterinary student and can honestly say these are fantastic I have had problems with my basic first year needle drivers having the lock pop all the time typically at the worst time or the inserts dull down the lock is very strong on these and the inserts have not dulled or pitted these are probably better for people who wear a size 75 surgical glove or higher as they are a tad long some people may not like the suture scissors incorporated right behind the inserts but i think they are fantastic ok i can not add because i have not the vaguest notion of what he is saying but he did tell me after he had used them for a week that one of his professors asked to borrow them because she thought they looked awesome,144,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good heavy duty needle holder I have been building my emergency surgery kit great product at a great price thank you,20,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,these are 185 cm long not the 16 cm as described quality and function are good carbide insert surfaces meet uniformly and lock / unlock tabs function perfectly with 185 cm length they are a little larger than i desired but i can make them work while made with german stainless they are manufactured in pakistan according to the stamped imprint on the device,61,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these are cheap garbage they are absolutely not even close to or grade the needle drivers in disposable suture kits are better,22,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was fine works pretty well although they were different from the picture,13,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,have not had occasion to use yet went in my shtf kit but appears to be a good quality piece of emergency gear,23,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was shipped quickly they look legit although they are a little stiff maybe they will loosen up with use,20,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,good product there is a slight amount of catch when opening the jaws and a very smallis visible that is light streams through but functionally not an issue unlike another reviewer i received exactly what the description says an olsen-hegar driver with scissor function needle holder,47,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,it seems to be great quality and durable I am no professional but it seems to do the job ordered on dec 28 and it said would arrive on jan 10 actually arrived on dec 30 if i could change anything maybe dome paper in it with some info would be nice or specifications be aware that the neck is short and i have small hands but it might be uncomfortable for one with longer hands,75,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,although this products works flawlessly I am taking a star off for mislabeling of this product these needle holders are actually called mayo-hagar needle holders olsen-hagar needle holders have an incorporates scissor portion near the tip fyi in case you are wondering these needle holders can be autoclaved without rusting just shows that even although these are generic they are excellent,60,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,this product is poor quality easily rusts and turns grayish rust after putting via autoclave,15,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,worst pair of needle holders ever can not open with one hand piece of junk,14,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good s steel no rust from class b scican bravo autoclave,11,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,i am picky about surgical instruments regardless of what i use them for given several years of training in general surgery i think I have earned that right I have found that buying german-made instruments has been a reliable guide to quality not these there is no stamp on them to indicate where they were made but they are absolutely unusable another unhappy reviewer said pakistan so i guess now they are not stamping them at all they are very uncomfortable to hold and use I have never had my fingers hurt from a needle driver before the alignment of the jaws is off and closure is for want of a better term lame i now get to delay my project while i look for something i can actually use photos show the pointy ridge inside the handle rings ouch thebetween the jaws at one click of closure are you freaking kidding me and the malalignment of the jaws seriously this has to be a joke,169,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,using this device allow me to nicely have multiple spools of plastic for a quick switch product is exactly as advertised the only thing to be aware is that it will not work for spools with smaller holes many of the spool i get from other suppliers work well but only on the outside the much smaller ones like taulman 1 lb spools will not fit at all so just be aware of that,71,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,i was really excited to try this out because I am sick and tired of swapping between different colors putting this together you can definitely tell that it is a bit cheap but i have no doubt that it is plenty strong for holding filament my biggest complaint is that you can not easily swap between filament rolls i would not use this if you are running through pounds of filament every week which i am but it is useful for the colors that you only use occasionally the big advantage that this has over the plastic spool holders that come with printers is that the metal has a lower coefficient of friction with the plastic spools so the resistance is lower as it comes off the roll theoretically this would reduce your likelihood of failed prints but I am not entirely sure to what extent i can say that I have been using it for a week and it appears to be working better than my standard plastic holder summary for those machines that are not able to hold standard filament rolls for example davinci and flashforge dreamer this would be fantastic but for makerbots and other printers that you can easily swap spools i would not suggest it,199,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,you can not really beat it for the price putting it together it felt a little flimsy but once it was together and loaded with spools it is solid so far i have not had any issues with it feeding filament to my makerbot replicator dual,45,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,2.0,negative,same problem as others have stated this product is not made well it is a solidand i wanted to keep it but the manufacturing needs work the female threads are held in place with just a pinch of metal and any weight on them causes the thing to fall apart also you can not even tighten this thing without the threads coming out either if they spent the time to spot weld the threads in place it would be a good product and very solid disappointment from hatchbox as they make great filament,94,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,easy to set up my 4 year old put it together and works great will likely end up getting a few more to organize more colors when i get them,30,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,the sections come apart under the weight of filament spools where they screw together,14,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,great looks good fit but easily falls apart from weight of hatchbox filament,13,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,i have the spool holder mounted upright on the pegboard on my workbench i use it to feed my printrbot simple metal the spool holder works great i wish it was a little more stout but all in all it is a great filament holder,44,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,this spool holder fits perfectly on top of my machine loading the holder is straight forward and easy to do seems very rigid and seems like it will last forever so long with the single spool holder this makes life so much easier,43,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,welding / gluing / whatever is terrible pieces have fallen apart since day one,10,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,would normally get five stars but the two of these i own both managed to break in the same way the metal spacers between where the rolls go tend to have the piece with the screw hole fall off i have these on a shelf above my printer and sometimes they break and roll off onto my printer i have a bar in front of them now but be careful if you plan to buy,75,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,nice filament stand but stick to the one with the 2 or 3 sections the 4 sections model tends to sag with 4 x 1 kg spools,26,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,great christmas present for my husband works great,8,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,2.0,negative,the construction of this is pretty lousy my side frames came bowed at the middle and were not straight but were aligned again with a bit of force the entire assembly basically needs to come apart if you need to replace a spool a giant headache if switching a spool in the middle when under full4 rolls the entire thing bows and sinks as the weight is actually on the threaded ends and not on the bar itself you are better off buying some closet shelf brackets and a dowel from a hardware store instead,95,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,this spool holder broke immediately after it arrived poor chineese design thin walls metal hollow hand wrenches inserts are fixed with cheap stamping instead of proper welding inclined inserts which prevent proper aligning i do not recommend to buy it if you are not a professional welder to fix it all the time,51,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,5.0,positive,mounted on wall and it feeds 3 3d printers without a jam,12,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,1.0,negative,spools do not spin not even the hatchbox ones and causes the extruder to run dry it warps with 2 or more spools on it,24,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,poor product clogged printer extruder i was forced to clean and disassemble the printer extruder,15,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,makes very nice prints however with a small note this plastic is not flexable at all this makes support structures tend to damage parts when removed so best for models with no support needed or be extremely careful,38,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,my printer jammed 1 hour in after setting the heat at 228c between the 225 and 230 they decla still fixing the mess from the print nozzle,27,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i could not print more than 1 - 2 layers before filament became jammed measured with a caliper and found it to be 179 mm in some places and 189 mm in others i was disappointed because i received this for a birthday gift and was saving it for special occasions only to find it unusable it was jammed so badly in my extruder i had to pull it out with pliers hopefully there is no permanent damage,75,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,printed fine at 185c even although the spool said to print at a higher temp i was happy with the slightly metallic sheen to the final finish i was printing a joke trophy / award and it came out better than expected,41,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,the filament was visibly tangled and kinked on the spool when i received it my review is based solely upon that at this point I am attempting to print with it now but i have very little hope as I am sure the tangles will because the filament to break or pull out of the extruder during the print i will never buy this again and identification advise not to take the chance on it,73,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed using this filament it has a nice finish and sheen after it is been printed on average it requires higher temperatures than standard pla filament i was using a nozzle temperature of approximately 230 degrees celsius and a bed temperature of 65 to 75 degrees celsius it was not difficult to calibrate my slicer software i would like to try other filaments by this company as i was impressed by this filament,74,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,it printed well at the suggested temperature on my printrbot metal but it is definitely more brittle than other pla i have used objects tended to break a little easier,30,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this bronze filament prints particularly well and it really does have a metallic shiny look to it i was impressed with the results of my first print with this filament no problems with printing at all my only regret is the limited amount of filament on the spool but hey it is a specialtyif you are looking for that true bronze look without the cost of buying a tumbler then i would recommend this product just keep in mind that it does produce a shiny metallic look i have already purchased a second spool,96,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,if you are looking for a bronze fill this is not the stuff you are looking for i was dooped do not do the same and think that it is,28,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i purchased this pla the extruding temperature was higher than most of the pla i had been using so i set everything up however when printing the pla does not produce even results also this is the only filament that has gummed up my printer i had to take apart my extruder and clean it out afterwards after that experience all my other filaments work like a champ,68,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,this is a repurchase and they must have changed the formula because theis different it is more of a dull brown / green than bronze and does not have a look metallic at all also unlike colorfabb and esun bronze filaments this brand has no actual metal content the last time i purchased this it had a very accurate bronzenot this time the photo still shows how it looked as the bronze metallic material this is a bait and switch i will not be purchasing it again after this experience i can recommend their metallic silver however,97,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,printed fine but it was brown not bronze,8,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,prints fairly well but it is rather expensive considering it is only a 05 kg roll and theis not bronze not even close,23,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,more of a brownbut if you shine it up with high grit sandpaper it really shines on an odd note it smells almost like maple syrup,28,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,prints great at 225c theless metallic than others and has an even opaquethe diameter is consistent and the filament is smooth off the roll with hardly any bends,32,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,not reflective at all comes out as a dull brown,11,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,very pleased with this filament on my mod-t printer from new matter I have made several successful prints with it the spool has a thoughtful slot in the side to hold the end which is a nice touch for storage,39,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,i keep hoping to find a bronze filament that is bronze and this one is not it at best it is a yellow ochreno metallic properties and certainly no actual bronze disappointing may be good for a poop emoji although and after the poop emoji it made a nice loofah sponge out of what should have been a sculpture with 20 fill unfortunately iy decided that clogging the nozzle was more fun so is getting returned to amazon innediately crap filament,81,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,it is a bad filament when i tried to print something the plastic can not melt it good it is like has air inside,22,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this is the s i love this stuff more than any other filament i have it adheres like a champ and spools nicely although i do reccomend feeding out the first 10 or 20 feet and then re-reeling as in the begining of the roll it can get a touch tricky the pieces I have made with it come out beautifully it strings a bit at high speed and requires around 235 for heat and i like to use 70 on my bed but this is all to be expected it is brittle when it is done so it makes it easy to remove supports or stringing can not say enough good stuff about this material,112,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,one of the best pla filaments that i ever used very sad that is not availabe anymore,17,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,5.0,positive,this filament prints very very well i print at 210 degrees on an unheated bed i was nervous to use it for support material but it broke off easily it has a bit of a sheen and looks great,39,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,it is most definitely not bronze looking like the sample they advertise with which is disappointing considering that is what i chose to buy it,24,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,do not be fooled by the preview pictures this is not a metallic filament it is brown plain and simple that being said it prints extremely well this would easily be a five start review for quality alone but they are vastly misrepresenting theand type of pla i would return it but I shall find some other use for it sadly this was purchased for a clients print which i do not have time to order a proper metallic pla for,81,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,printed fine at 225 per the manufacturers recommendation but it has zero metallic look just a dull brown not a bad earthy dull brown mind you but the word metallic is in the product name and it is just not true I have used many other filaments with much more metallic effect so i have a point of reference,57,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,very good material it absorbs moisture more quickly than other brands I have tried so definitely store with desicant I have gotten into the habit of using airtight containers to store all my filaments as i live in a very moist environment,40,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,printed well not as shiny as i expected it to be but prints turned out nice and strong,18,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,this filaments very frangible and breaks easy the coil length i purchased either was not a single continuous length or was so fragile it broke into several pieces of various lengths in shipping the filament breaks so easily it is not practical to print with since it can not bend well enough to make it to the extruder from the take up spool and has a tendency to break during printing was never able to get anything to successfully print because of this but the failed aborted printed pieces were also very fragile and broke into pieces trying to remove from the print bed i would not waste any money on this filament despite the fact that it looks great on the spool just like a copper penny unfortunately more fragile than dried mud,131,28
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,stuff looks brilliant and prints wonderfully for me unfortunately the last batch i purchased the filament was missing the metallic additive so it was just poop brown returned for a refund i ended up switching to gizmo dorks 175 mm metal bronze filament 1 kg for 3d printers,49,29
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i plugged this into my computer and pressed record i was in a 12x17 room and no one as more than 9 feet away from me when i played back the audio i could barely hear anyone i have to attach my speakers to my computer and turn every volume way up i have been continually dissapointed with omni-directional microphones,60,0
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,while some people complain about this mic to me if it is connected with mic preamp with enough phantom power it really shines much better than using the battery that comes with it i purchased two of it for stereo recording connected directly via tcc tc-720 stereo microphone / riaa phono pre-amp preamp preamplifier and interconnect the preamp output to the line-in in the pc sound card not to mic-in which provide a very good quality capture from all directions but you will have to record in a quiet room to avoid recording unwanted sounds anyway with these combo you will not be disappointed highly recommended,105,1
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i tried this microphone out and it really was not worth the money it recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones and while that is the point of a uni-directional microphone to dampen out background noise this seemed to be creating some interferance of it is own I am sending mine back,49,2
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i purchasd two of these microphones to record conversations during data gathering meetings using a computer i was using tools such as camtasia and audacity the mics did not pick up enough of the conversation to be useful i tried four different computers with the same result they did not meet our requirements i purchased a more expensive sony ecm-f01 and it works as described great so i am stuck with two mics that do not perform,77,3
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,this mic is surprisingly poor quality for a brand name like audio-technica the sound is distant and thin and basically makes the mic unusable for a speakerphone,27,4
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i managed to get sound into my pc only when the recording settings are set close to maximum even then the mic had to be fairly close to my face to record my voice audibly definitely not what you would expect from an omnidirectional condenser boundary microphone a waste of money,50,5
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i bought this mic with the intention to use it in an interview while it does function pretty well when it is about one inch from your mouth audio quality rapidly degrades any further than that the audio it picked up at 3 feet had to be amplified beyond reason everything maximized to get almost normal speech volume and when i did the audio quality was worse than what you would from a cell phone call admittedly I am using a mac to test this on and they have unpowered mic jacks as opposed to pcs typical powered and unpowered varieties since the mic uses a battery i do not think the lack of a powered jack was the issue but since i do not have a pc to test it on i can not say any more than for mac users to stay away from this product the microphone built into your mac is likely far superior I am returning this product,157,6
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,works as well as expected for 3000 picking up non-directional sounds was delivered in or less than the time specified all is well,23,7
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i have been happy with the atr97 for years it captures voice very well it is compact and unobtrusive the one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it and run the battery down and then there has no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result but overall it is a stylish boundary microphone i also like it because it resembles aor more accurately our domestic military industrial complexs arv alien reproduction vehicle enjoy,104,8
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,it is now sometime I have had this product it works fine as i got it i was able to use it even from the room next to the mike as battery goes down the radius of action decrease accordingly battery life depends on how long you use it and other conditions I have already changed battery ones but i do use this mike quite a bit i would not call it a major drawback it works ok and that is what counts,81,9
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i can not beleive the sound that this captures i use it running to a small digital recorder as a backup for main sound at depostitions i could use this for the main sound it is that good last week i placed it on the floor in the middle of a room about 10x14 it picked up every voice perfectly my main sound had a terrible buzz in it from some electrical source and this was perfectly clear plug it into a zoom h2/4 and you have a really nice sound unit conference rooms podiums at conventions you can depend on it,101,10
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i purchased this product refurbished from beach camera and within 90 days it stopped working on any computer or amplifier that i used it with no sound came in besides a click when i turned the switch on or off and brief electronic noise when i plugged it in or took it out of the computer i would suggest that if you are thinking about buying this product pay at least 25 for a high quality new one,78,11
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,i bought this microphone so i could record conversations in a meeting room it is a great improvement over the built-in mic on my digital voice recorder it does not pick up every voice at the far end of the table but it has been sufficient for my needs i wish it had a light on the top as a power-on indicator I have forgotten to turn it on but that is my only complaint overall i think it is a good value,78,12
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i was doing my videos for national board certification and to my horror found that my students could not be heard audio-technica to the rescue with the included adapter it fit perfectly into the ancient video camera at my school and my problem was solved,45,13
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,just want to tell everyone that previous to this purchase we had problems in recording and broadcasting the conversation of our clubhouse board meetings which composed of 6 to ten people seated around a long a 20 ft conference table the voices recorded were not very clear and picks up hiss and lot of background noices when learning of this product we bought 2 sets and placed them apart on our conference table to our delight the recording became very loud and clear and devoid of hiss and annoying background noices i give it a 5 star to this wonderful mic,100,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampers really allow for several effects from tight to none i really needed more although i wound up with screw dampers mounted to the she shall these were nice and would work for most needs,35,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,i wanted something to subtly dampen my toms and these seem good over-damping is something i was concerned with so i liked that these could be adjusted or removed entirely via velcro I am not sure i notice much difference between the different placements as far as adjusting the damping but removing it only leaves the one tiny sticky dot which pretty much does not damp at all i used a small one on my 12 and snare a large one on my 13 and two large ones on my floor tom,90,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,this evans minemads are good but u have to put a little bit of tape so they dnt dismount from ur tomes or specialy ur snare drum but anyways they are a good product,34,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,they did not make any difference where i used them in a church the drums are still too loud these may be just for recording or a setting where the drums are miced although,33,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,honestly i should have just stuck with moongels on the plus side they can be adjusted some what i use them on the resonant heads,25,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,for the tom-toms it is perfect on snare drums i had to use 2 dampers to get the proper reduction of unwanted harmonics,22,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,excellent product to damper the toms armonics easy to install mount and unmount also the package comes with 6 dampers great for a big drumkit,25,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,moongel wears out mine melted in the van these are subtle and adjustable and durable if you are expecting a dead thud from your drums then these are not for you but if want to adjust the resonance of your heads they work beautifully highly recommended for drummers who tune properly and like controlled resonance,54,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,it is a waste of money it barely changes the tone of the drum i recommend getting some damper pads instead,21,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,i ordered it and found out that the product does not improve the sound dampening at all for heavey heads like remo power-stroke 3 i would not recommend but if you have a thinner head that has alot resonance then may it will work other than that i would not waste my money on the product keo,56,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,works well for the first couple of days then it begins to fall off pros eliminates ringing amd some overtones cons adhesive does not stay on for long,27,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,sticks to side of drums with adhesive poorly designed product with little actual muffle effect it is the first time i have been disappointed by an evans product,27,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,did the job it was designed to do damped my snare and tom toms perfectly,15,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,sorry but the moongel gave me best results,8,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,i noticed a sharper and more precise sound from my snare which I am really liking i have not noticed much of a tone change from larger toms but they probably require more than 1 minemad to sound noticeably different the ends are sticky and hook on to the side of the drum and you can place the other end anywhere on the drumhead the damping will vary by how far or close you set the minemad i believe they are removable but i have not actually tried because I am satisfied with my placements they are definitely worth the low price,99,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,these were straight up bad they did not stick to the drum heads or the rims and all of them had come off after a week of regular playing do not buy,32,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,so far these work real well on cutting down on the ring,12,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,i think these sound better than those gel type dampeners you can get and they are definitely better than those mylar rings people use as well basically they are small efficient and fairly unobtrusive they can tame a troublesome drum with ease,40,17
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,do not waste your time or money these things do not stick to the heads especially if you ever put your drums in cases they come right off they look pretty stupid too i usually do like evans products use their heads but this was a huge miss for them stick with the control rings moon gel or good oletape,59,18
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,got itas described fast shipping worked fine for what i wanted it thanks,18,19
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,as efficient as moon gel and less messy,8,20
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,these are horrible they do not work well at all,9,21
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampers are an original concept so i thought to give them a try i find them far more useful for resonant heads than for batters but one on the batter side of my mcx master snare with evans g2 coated head actually did the job quite well for removing that irritating ping from the snare moongel did nothing unless you want to use three of them on one drum head the adhesive on the velcro dots is not very robust so i find myself having to reattach them too often not sure if it is the choice of heads or what all in all they are as good or better than other damping choices out there but a little strip oftape still does the job best for me,131,22
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,for seven bucks I had say you are better off getting a roll of masking tape with cash left over for a six pack to keep you on the level while tuning your drums the only advantage i see with these is the appearance they certainly look cooler than masking tape or if you like the adjustable nature of this product you can buy a dozen feet of sticky-sided velcro tape and make your own the bottom flat ends of these doohickeys have a small 3 - 4 mm area of sticky stuff that does not adhere very long to the side of your drums so most of mine are currently on the floor under my kit unlike the picture they come in a variety pack and the smaller ones are so small that they barely reach my drum heads once the sticky end is adhered to the side of the drum i have a gretsch energy kit maybe your rings are shorter than mine but overall I had suggest another method,169,23
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,these dampers came in 2 days when 6 were expected and they did not disappoint exactly what i needed to make my drums sound much better for a very low price,31,24
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,i thought i should have returned these as soon as i saw them sort of a sillymight yet,20,25
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,from the humble opinion of a drum dept manager the evans dampners are the ones i recommend the most from the 4 choices we offer yes tape and gels may work and may be less money but tend to be and look messy especially tape which give you no real option once they are in place and really leave a mess or damage heads when you need to remove it each dampner give you 3 options just enough extra dry or none at all depending on your sound the dots do stick and stay they certainly do a great job getting rid of over ring and more and yes they do look great find exactly where you want them then 1and very important make sure to use the alcohol pad included or get more to insure clean surfaces read the instructions or watch a video or two on ytube do it right and you will not have the problems the folks with 3 stars or below have then if you still want a roll of musicians tapeyou can usually find a roll in the pro-audio dept or the dollar store,190,26
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,velcro loose every time i go back to the drums miss the point,13,27
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,4.0,positive,these dampeners are very good quality and very easy to install and take on and off they were great for the price and exactly what i wanted however they did not effect the sound as much as i hoped they removed a lot of the overtones however there were still a few ringing sounds left but when i added a second dampener on the drum it improved the sounds to more of what i wanted,75,28
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,2.0,negative,the stickers do not hold up after a few weeks of playing going to be switching to a different product worked fine when they did stick to the surface of the drums,33,29
Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,1.0,negative,they deaden way too much and can not control too finicky to use i found that strips of black gorilla tape work excellent and easy to control amount of ring you want,31,30
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,i teach a couple of theory and ear training classes at a university and this tool was exactly what i needed it works great is easy to use and saves a lot of time that i was wasting while trying and failing miserably to draw straight staff lines on the board freehand the price was extremely reasonable I am really glad i bought it,63,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 1st grade daughter for her bedroom chalk board and she loves it it is great,20,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in this the chalkholders are loose and they often twist the chalk falls out i will toss this and pick one up at the nearest walk-in store that sells them,33,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,works as expected wires can twist slightly I am not a music pro but imagine they make some that do not do that so that is why 4 instead of 5 stars i feel i got what i paid for,37,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,using it to make straight lines on the chalk board works well,12,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,it works just fine with the chalk here in japan the tines twist a bit but it works just fine,20,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,very cheaply made the kids bent two chalk holders after one pass i tried it and same thing spend more and get one you can use,27,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i guess i got so excited over ordering this for the kids chalkboard that i did not read the reviews what a piece of junk not even worth the 299 it is flimsy does not even hold the chalk steadily do not waste your 299,41,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,a little flimsy but for the price it does the job very helpful tool for my students who struggle with fine motor control i use it on the board to give them lines to write on,36,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,i like being able to draw straight staff lines on the chalkboard for students to write their notes this does the job nicely,22,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,my 6 year old is addicted to teacher supplies and i bought her one of these for her christmas stocking the wires are super bendy and do not hold the chalk very well i think she just has it there for show at this point would not buy again,49,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,1.0,negative,i deliberately ordered this one with the dark heavier looking prongs because i did not want a junk staff liner it came today it is junk it has the copper looking very thin prongs the handle is also very thin not quite 1/4 and a cheap plain piece of wood as soon as i loaded the chalk in the prongs some held tight and a couple did not i notice the prongs twisting i can not imagine they will last very long with such thin wire since i could not give it a negative number of stars I shall just say 5 so i guess i paid to buy an example that the hubs can use to make one very disappointed indeed,116,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,great concept but the metal pieces do not stay in place and continue to twist which ruins the staff lines,19,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,i intended to used this tool for swiping acrylic paint the metal pieces are not facing the same way good for chalk but not for my needs i will see if i can adjust them,34,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,4.0,positive,there has not a lot to it but as a music teacher i use it class everyday it works,18,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,2.0,negative,i bought this to lay down guide lines for chalk signs you will probably want to reinforce the handle withtape or something as soon as you get it it split beneath two of the tines as i was just trying to get chalk into it the tines also tend to twist around on themselves so i wrapped the chalk and tines with tape as well to kind of hold them in an un-twisted position sadly i could only find one other listing for this on amazon and it looks like the same product so whatever,96,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002E2750,5.0,positive,perfect for what we needed in our arabic language class,10,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,while it did not clean deeply it still did clean the cymbal gime it makes my cymbals all shiney and awesome haha,21,0
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,the cleaner performed well considering it is not as toxic as some of the other spray cleaners out there a good choice to use to keep the dust and fingerprints down after your gig,34,1
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,better off with the blitz cymbal cleaner for way less works way better and easier than sabian or vater cymbal cleaner,22,2
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,my cymbals were definitely brighter after using this and finger smudges were taken off for a day i had to use more than one application and rub hard for any serious cleaning it is not good for trying to reverse any aging of cymbals or serious deep cleaning you really should think of it only as a surface cleaner or as a brightener possibly with a brush of some sort it might work better in the grooves but generous application of the product and rubbing with a soft rag did not seem to achieve penetration of the cleaning process into those grooves that is probably reasonable and to be expected anything that cleaned very aggressively may be on the border of being a threat to the cymbal surface the stuff has a noxious smell i cleaned my cymbals outdoors and even then the wind shifted and i feared for the effect on my eyes i have three cymbals ride crash and top high hat and when used generously one bottle was good for two separate cleanings of the full set,178,3
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,this is an ok product you just want to make sure you dry nicely after spray or else you it will be yellow,22,4
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,worked just like the bottle says takes more than one application on duller finishes for 20 bucks sabian will re finish a sabian cymbal and relabel assuming there is no damage however the shipping time will mean no cymbal for a few weeks,43,5
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,this is an awesome cymbal cleaner it does not get the stick marks off at all but it does an amazing job at the grime oil and dirt just rub off the stick marks then use this you spray enough of this on the cymbal to cover it wait 15 - 30 seconds do not let it dry on the cymbal and then wipe it off with a soft cloth great product highly recommend,70,6
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,do not buy this whatever you do plastic spray bottles were shipped in a loose small thin bubblewrap envelope both spray heads were busted off with a large quantity of the contents pooled in the plastic envelope i currently have three unopened bottles bought previously direct from sabian the cleaner should have a raspy acidic smell that borders on toxic smelling I am not sure what the liquid is that they shipped but it is not sabian cymbal cleaner more like watered down dishwashing liquid nice try and an obvious scam buyer beware,90,7
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,works on sabian brilliant cymbals but is does not work at all on other brands,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,purchased to keep my new sabian aax brilliant finish cymbals basically keep looking brilliant the product is easy to useabd very effective in cutting through fingerprint oxidation and restoring the originaland luster it is an acid based product so be careful when applying to the logos if you want to preserve them i cover them with blue painters tape and then remove after i have cleaned the entire cymbal the fumes are very strong and being an acid will make you cough if inhaled i found that diluting the product 31 part water was very effective and a little less noxious I have used this to clean both brilliant and traditional finishes on various cymbal brands and it does a great job each time,124,9
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,good stuff while it will not remove multiple layers of tarnish from an old cymbal this will refresh a well maintained cymbals that has some buildup of fingerprints and marks,29,10
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,did not work very good could not see any difference,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,this stuff worked great but tape up your logos and be careful of you can wipe it off pretty quick even if you follow the 15 - 30 second instructions,28,12
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,save your money thisis near worthless it removed practically none of the tarnish from my cymbals just use lime juice and baking soda this will work wonders simple inexpensive and all natural,34,13
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,my son has a drums and required clean his cymbals i use it but did not think properly because they were 100 clean and shiny now i will try again but using the product with a polishing machine but i think the product is good,45,14
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,i ended up using brasso on all my cymbals because these cymbal cleaners are a joke I have tried most of them when you use brasso make sure you do not wipe off the logos although,34,15
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,stick marks show up in a yellowishafter using it and you have to clean your cymbals often get music nomad cymbal cleaner they stay clean for a long time and it contains no acid that destroys your cymbals over time i am just a fellow drummer and i am not endorsed by music nomad i just love it,60,16
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,i used it once to clean my 16 aax xplosion crash altho it does remove oil finger prints and grease it eats away the gold shiny finish look also removes black lettering if not careful,37,17
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,i did a lot of research and reading of many different reviews before i purchased this cleaner just as advertised it cleaned up all of the dinge and oxidation and did not remove the cymbal logos i highly recommend this product i cleaned five cymbals front and back and still have quite a bit of the cleaner left your cymbals will not look brand spankin new but they will have a good clean look,72,18
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,let it sit on the cymbal for about 30 seconds then wipe it off wal-la clean cymbal great product thanks,20,19
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,i thought i was getting an spray like advertised but got a wipe on cream instead i should have read some of the other reports that people left same thing happened to some of them,35,20
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,what i wanted was cymbal cleaner spray like the picture but what i got was a tube of polish paste,19,21
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,this stuff is like a creme that drys like a paste wax and then needs buffed off problem is it did not do anything no pay off for my labor sabian b8x and one b8 pro,35,22
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,this cleaner is junk it is more of a cymbal polish than a cleaner it does shine a lot better but without removing the grime smudges I have been drumming for 15 years and cleaned a lot of cymbals I am going back to the zildjian cymbal polish you want to clean and polish your cymbals not one or the other,58,23
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,2.0,negative,what i received was not thepictured i received a cream cleaner not spray on and wipe off it does clean brilliant finish cymbals fairly puts a good shine on them but does not clean them very deep,38,24
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,good product for the in-between quick cleans problem is that if you order from amazon and etailz is involved you may not get what you really wanted recently i purchased this product only to receive the safe and sound sabian cymbal cleaner instead since no explanation was given for the switch i can only assume they were out of the pump spray light cleaner / polish and substituted this anyone in the business should know there is a huge difference between these two products and it is not a suitable substitution will purchase this elsewhere in the future,96,25
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,1.0,negative,1 star because i did not receive what i ordered i ordered 2 bottles of the sabian liquid spray cymbal cleaner as was pictured on amazon etailz shipped 2 bottles of the sabian safe and sound cymbal cleaner a paste that will remove the logo from your cymbal i will be returning these etailz also failed to include an invoice in the package something that is certainly second-rate i would give the sabian spray cleaner a 4-star review based on my usage but that is not what i got,88,26
Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,5.0,positive,i own a backline business and keeping shiny cymbals is a bane of my existence mostly everyone puts fingerprints on everything without a care and sabian brilliant cymbals turn orange with a humid breeze notice this is cleaner and not polish if i pulled out the brasso every time i needed a set of cymbals to be stage worthy i would spend my entire life polishing cymbals i hit them with this stuff for 30 sec a side and wipe they look great gets rid of most of the gunk and discoloration and the logos are all still intact i do this about 6 times between real polishing and as a result i can spend time with my kids this will not get those fingerprints you left corroding for a few months but if you are on top of maintaining your brass this is a huge time saver I have used a couple bottles and will continue to do so,158,27
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,i thought when i saw this together i would receive two but i received one and we love it great price and excellent quality,24,0
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,2.0,negative,this tambourine tore through the fabric the first time we used it i do not think we put this much pressure on it so if you are planning on using the fabric part invest in a more quality product this might be good for little kids,46,1
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,you will never again say there is nothing to do as long as this is within reach you will always have a dependable friend sturdy and light and inexpensive wonderful way to introduce someone to music after time you will start to notice sound differently especially great for children who are very active if you have the passion and energy go for it i learned to play and i knew nothing about how have a good day,78,2
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,i thought there would be a pair medium and small instead it was only one,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,really nice rhythm instruments but do not have quite the sound of my moms kindergarten ones from the 1950s,18,4
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,these work well for a kids dance but you can not pound them a lot because they tend to break overall I am satisfied for what i paid,26,5
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,either i did not read all the information and also do a measurement before orderingis too small and is now taking up space,24,6
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,since i was planning on using these infrequently in plays and skits and never leaving them permanently in the hands of children i was less concerned with durability than with cost these are not likely to survive three days in the unsupervised hands of kids but as functioning tambourines they are great props for use in a 15 to an hour play if you are new to tambourines i suggest you buy a wooden mallet to use with this kind if as i was planning you were thinking of getting the drum effect by striking the head with the hand and not getting much sound from the jingles you will be disappointed striking the head with the finger will always give you jingle as well i bought soft mallets to use with them and that did not work because they had the feel of a finger only when i bought hard wooden strikers did i get a relatively pure sound from the head with little jingle the other side of the coin is that with your hard mallet you can get two distinctly different sounds from the one device,188,7
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this was an impulse buy and i do wish i had done some more research the zils the metal pieces that clang block out the thump of hitting the drum head so i wish i had bought a tambourine with just a single row I am not sure what the tambourine head is made out of but it is pulled tight and seems durable it does say it is an economy tambourine which is accurate it is a good size for adult and youth hands for the price it is a fun instrument,92,8
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,this product did not meet my expectations and i will not order this again and will not recommend to others to purchase,22,9
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,love my tambourine i may get my grandson a baby size for christmas I am sure my daughter would love that,20,10
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,i aam still play the instrument during my private and public worship of my lord and savior jesus christ the giver of life,23,11
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,nice tambourine i was able to draw on it as well and the size works for me because i have small hands,22,12
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this is a good buy for the money it has a leather skin head and seems to be of sturdy construction,21,13
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,thiswas used in a dance processional i added some ribbon around the 6 openings to give it a miriam affect i plan to use thisagain it is of very good quality and just the right size for an adult hand 2 thumbs up,47,14
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,when i opened the package a few days after i ordered it i was excited until i saw the broken area near the disks that my husband had to repair i would have sent it back but i needed it for a dance at my church so i am not happy with thisbut because we have done a repair to it and had to alter the original in order to make it work i was unable to send it back and had to pay full price for theso not happy at all,93,15
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,this is a great instrument for the price we bought it for our family instrument collection and for our young children to use much better quality than any of the toy instrument companies and comparable pricing definitely recommend,38,16
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,2.0,negative,the drum skin ripped the first time we used it laughing out loud,11,17
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,5.0,positive,just what i thought they would be it sounds good,10,18
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,1.0,negative,did no play it but once and the center broke,10,19
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,these powered monitors are a great solution for providing accurate sound reproduction for performers in many difficult situations they are small enough to be mounted where you need them up close or at a reasonable distance consider their size they can be daisy chained for like feeds they have built in eq they have speaker outputs that are powerful enough to power larger speakers if you need more bass they have headphone outputs if you can not get them close enough they are mic and line level compatible stand mountable with the adapter they are not designed to shake the house so if you do not abuse them and they will work great for a long time,114,0
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,compact and easy to take to gigs i used it as a drummer and it was great this has all you would want in a powered monitor,26,1
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,puts vocals right there for better clarity the only issue i have is that it is not as loud as i thought it would be it is loud enough although it would be nice if it came with the stand adaptor even so i knew that going in the main difference between this and the beringer model is this has a headphone jack otherwise they are similar,66,2
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,i liked mine until the bass blew out i never even turned it up over 1/4 volume lasted about 7 months at that volume,24,3
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,have only use it 5 or 6 times but does a fine job so fall,15,4
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,i received it today the first thing i did was plug 3 different vocal mics into it and check the sound of the monitor just having the volume 35 of the way up and speaking into the mic the low frequencies of the vocal make the speaker buzz or vibrate in the casing of the monitor all 3 mics did that and the eqs were all straight up at the 12 o clock setting which is probably 0 db this monitor basically does what most hot spot style monitors do they can not handle any kind of volume and sound like am radio i even tried turning down the low eq to almost 10 and it did the same thing just not as bad i might try using this with a friends band who is performing this weekend in a small club but honestly as a pro level touring sound engineer and as a musician myself i can tell you that i do not want to put a buzzy speaker that can not be turned up loud in front of any musician i will probably be returning thisin a few days,189,5
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,so far so good i really did not expect it to be as good as it actually is i bought it for a few purposes one of which was to be a personal monitor for our drummer i sat it on a mic stand beside him and turned the volume knob halfway up and he liked what he heard mission accomplished this saved us a lot in the way of needed equipment because we did not have a powered monitor for him and had to use an fairly heavy monitor amp and passive speaker plus a stand for the speaker it lightened oursome and any working band knows what a plus that is as long as you do not expect it to sound like a 15 speaker with 200 watts pushing it because that would just be silly laughing out loud you will like it our drummer can hear the mix just fine with this and we played a little on the loud side that night one gig down with this baby and hopefully many many more to come,175,6
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,not he best monitor we have but for the price itl do for now,14,7
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,1.0,negative,horrible the thing explode literally in the inside at 30 minutes of usage without clipping fireflames and smoke came up from the front panel never buying nadys products again is so cheap,32,8
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,not a full range hi fidelity speaker however it is very well suited for it is purpose on-stage personal monitor we use this daisy chained to a pm-100 for our drummer and keyboard player both of whom sing in a classic rock band it has a pronounced mid-range but that tends to deliver more volume for vocals without feedback no problems bottom line not high-end gear but effective and good bang for the buck,73,9
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,enjoying it allot great for the price use it all the time and have bought 2 more only bad thing adjustment are on back,24,10
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,great monitor with a lot of flexibility can be used as stand alone or to drive passive wedges only downside is the input jacks are connected directly to input board and can be fragile still a great product for the price just handle with care,45,11
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,so much better than the one i replaced with it better sound more flexibility very impressive,16,12

Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,2.0,negative,poorly made this should not be sold as a party accessory because a child will have great difficulty making any noise with it i had to completely rebuild the clapper to be able to use it at all i would have thrown it in the trash and found another but i was pinched on time sorry for the poor rating but it is just not of selliable quality,66,2
Musical_Instruments,B0019I1GDC,1.0,negative,theof the cowbell is darker than the one on the website it is a deep purple cowbell not a purple pink one after holding it for an hour my hand was tired the handle cutes into your hand the cowbell was not very loud either we will have to buy a different one,54,3

Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1.0,negative,this is a very small and unstable stand that could probably work for a very small keyboard no way it would hold an electric piano note the questionable link from amazon reviews for the yamaha p85 i am now waiting to see if emd would get it back without their crazy shipping fees the amazon people who ordered thisalso ordered this is misleading there should be no link between e-piano and this stand,75,1
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4.0,positive,i am very pleased with the stand it is easy to put together if you follow the pictures on the amazon display for thisit comes with extra screws so do not worry that you left some off my only complaint it adjust up and down bt you can not adjust the with,54,2
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1.0,negative,from the picture posted here this stand looks sturdy and pink not only was it not pink when we opened it up but it smells of gasoline we have tried putting it together and wiping it down but the smell stayed we were willing to overlook thenot being right but the stand is not sturdy at all and adjusting it comes with hurt fingers not theor quality we thought we were getting best part is when we emailed the seller we were told that the picture was black and we got the right one a two sentence email we would love to return it and get our money back but we are getting a hard time,117,3

Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4.0,positive,this stand is great if your piano or device is lightweight this stand will not support any equipment over 50 pounds it works great for the piano / synthesizer that i use it additionally comes with screw based attachments that will secure your keyboard to the stand to reduce movement good price good deal,52,5
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5.0,positive,fits my roland sh201 49 key perfectly sturdy no wobbling z-tytpe stands in general are pretty cheap and break / bend which i knew before i bought this works for me very pleased,31,6

Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,1.0,negative,complete garbage super lightweight not stable inadequate for a kids toy keyboard no instructions for assembly poorly threaded screws not worth shipping to send back garbage,26,10
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,2.0,negative,there was no instructions oto put it together,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,4.0,positive,it is ok i guess it came in an unmarked box other than the shipping label and some of the cross-beams were bent either on arrival or during manufacturing oh and no instructions honestly i was surprised that everything was there i bought it for my novation impulse 61-key midi keyboard but my keyboard does not come with predrilled holes underneath so i have 2 extra bolts from the stand i do not use just be aware that it is flimsy and it does wobble a bit i think i would have given it a 5-star rating if it was more sturdy,98,12
Musical_Instruments,B001MX7TA8,5.0,positive,as the description states this is a lightweight stand i would not recommend it for anything above 30lbs however it is stable with my m-audio 88 keystation,27,13
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,i hate this stand the cymbal is always tilting to the side or some thing the boom has two grips at the bottom so you can not do alot with it she came in fast but will not last spend 10 more bucks on the others,44,0
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,i bought two of these stands they look really new but their construction is very basic such as on the boom arm connector there is no spring inside the joint just a wing nut and a screw i have not played seriously with them yet but so far they seem pretty strudy and stable,53,1
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,i purchased 6 of these stands I am going to get another 6 my drums are played at home so i do not know how much these stand would hold up to real world use but for the money they are really good,40,2

Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,i got what i paid for a cheap piece of junk that will break as soon as i put the least bit of pressure on it i just hope that it will hold a small cymbal at all,38,6
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,this is an excellent product shipping was as always extremely fast assembly was non-existent very heavy duty for the price i thought it would be junk and was pleasantly surprised it could handle a zildjian 22 ride easily due to the dounterweight,42,7
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,this cymbal stand was an ok replacement it might be alright temporarily for a beginner drummer otherwise i would not really recommend this stand to anyone,26,8
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,it is absolutely incredible i bought it about a year ago and have never had a problem with the thing it started shaking one time when i first put my new 20 ride but i widened the base of it and now it does not move at all no matter how hard i hit it cheaply made yes sturdy yes buy it now yes,62,9
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,this is basically the worse cybal stand I have ever used i bought it because of the price and figured what the he shall its cheap turns out this an understatement the wing nut to hold the cymbal on is plastic the stand does not hold the boom arm no matter how hard to you tighten it I have converted it into a straight stand until i can buy a better one save your money for something well built,75,10
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,I have purchased 3 of these stands I have been very pleased with the stands i use my stands for a home kit that i have i never break them down so i do not know how durable they would be for someone who is playing gigs and constantly breaking them down for a home kit or back up stand for the road they are a great value,65,11
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,mine snapped within 5 minutes of playing literally broke into pieces i do not play metal it is a piece of crap returned mine for refund the boom part cracked in 2 places it is in the trash the weight at the end is the only part that survived i do not know why it is even on there i have a rack by them I am contemplating returning it or just use gibraltar parts on their rack boom is literally garbage unless mine is faulty i doubt it get what you pay for,88,12
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,good for cheap cymbals would not put anything expensive on them the metal rod keyholes the cymbals fairly quickly,18,13

Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,this product does it is job picks up quite a lot of acoustic sound i bought it for my classical acoustic guitar and tested it with my amp worked like a charm if you are on a budget and are looking for something to get you by meanwhile or just if you do not want to go all out to make your acoustic into an acoustic-electric this is for you love it,69,0
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,i am amazed this works very well for turning my acoustic dulcimer electric it will also pick up drumming reverbs through wood the djembe over-powers the amp but a board or the desk does not,35,1
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,i use this with a korg tuner to clamp to headstocks of my musical instruments it does a great job and is a whole lot cheaper than a replacement for my korg,33,2

Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,very good the cord could have been a little longer,10,9
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,very simple pickup nothing fancy i noticed if you mess with the settings on the amp you can get a nice sound i was safisfied except for the length of the chord I had recomend buying a male to female extension,40,10
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,works suprisingly well even clipped to head of guitar it is very easy to attach and remove it is small size makes it easy to carry in your gig bag or pocket,31,11

Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,this is amazing i do not have to buy an electric acoustic just to play with my amp thanks rock on,20,13
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,a page of suggestions for mounting on various styles of guitar would have been helpful otherwise it is an excellent addition to my guitar accessories should the need arrises,29,14
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,2.0,negative,does not work as expected mainly pick-up low frequencies end of the guitar with very week output the microphone wiring also interferes with the guitar strings,26,15
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1.0,negative,it just does not work i plugged it into both my amps than i tried to use an adapter to use it for rocksmith did not pick up a sound from the instrument at least if anything touches the wire that makes a loud noise do not buy,47,16
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,it works the pickup picks up a nice tone it is kind of hard to clip into the guitar but once you get it it is perfect,25,17
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,4.0,positive,i just go it and it seem to be working on my first test i will have to test it with regular musical instrument to see the real result,29,18
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,the wire was too short so i had to go buy a extension cord other than that it was perfect for what i needed,24,19
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1.0,negative,it literally picks up worse than if you plugged in a pair of earbuds and used them as a mic no kidding try it the cord picks up more sound than the actual microphone it is kind of a feat of engineering to make something this horrible completely worthless,48,20
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1.0,negative,this does not clip well into my guitar it hits the strings or I shall hit it when strumming i do not recommend it,21,21
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk fortunately it did not cost much my mistake,13,22
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,1.0,negative,mic has a low frequency hum louder than the sound from the guitar almost impossible to get into the sound hole in the guitar and then is way too close to the strings try the cherub wcp-60 g acoustic guitar pickup instead much longer cord no noise fits in the hole much better,52,23
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,works better than expected fun for special-effects such as clipping it to a wooden tabletop or desk drawer and then thumping the wooden surface with your hand as if it were a drum seems well-constructed the wires have not fallen out yet or anything no problems with it,47,24
Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5.0,positive,excellent to use with a tuner so the tuner only listens to one pitch while tuning a string instrument fair price good quality,23,25
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,love it amazon is the best shockmount looks so cool with my blue mic yeti if you want pictures just ask and i will put them up i have the samson stand i bought that from best buy a primacoustic voxguard reflection fliter from guitar center the blue mic yeti professional usb mic a sterling audio pop filter temporarily and of course thee blue microphones blue radius shockmount i love my set up now I am ready for my music to come out have fun words can not describe how happy i am so just read the other guys review laughing out loud,99,0
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the microphone mounting screw is the wrong size how they screwed up something this basic is beyond me this mount had one job fit the blue yeti microphone it does not fit the blue yeti microphone,35,1
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,if you know nothing about sound quality when you are just starting out your podcasting radio shows youtube channel or any form of media where you are using a professional microphone remember you only need to know one thing shock mount this product is for the blue microphones line of products and will instantly improve the quality of your production and sound if you are searching for microphones right now and see this product linked with blue yeti microphones do not even second guess it purchase thisi use this product along with my blue yeti for my podcasting live streaming and youtube business i know this product will never fail me nor will this review and recommendation fail you,120,2
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,agreeing with all the other reviews here very poor design and it can not even support the weight of the mic it is made for,24,3
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,I have had and used this shock mount for months so am finally leaving a review pros it is designed for the blue yeti and does hold the blue yeti and does what a shock mount is meant to do the holes around theof the mount are convenient to permanently attach a pop filter through with a nut and bolt cons as many complain about the knob to tighten the shock mount is absolutely worthless when i first set it up it would not hold the yeti straight once tightened it just flops down i then tried to tighten it and the hand knob snapped off completely most people would have just returned the product at this point but i really wanted to get it setup with the yeti so i drilled out the broken piece and took the mount to the hardware store after getting the right size bolt and some washers and o-rings the mount is 1000 better at staying up thanks ace hardware for the shock mount viagra,173,4
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the screw broke almost immediately i got a screw of the same size but recently it failed also stripping the hole it seams as although the blue microphones yeti usb microphone silver is too heavy for the radius which it was designed for,45,5
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,loved this shock mount loved being the key worked perfectly with my rode psa1 swivel mount studio microphone boom and blue microphones yeti pro usb condenser microphone but after using for less than a year the thumb screw where you tighten to support the microphone snapped it is now unusable i do voice over work and use this combo daily as of right now i would not recommend this product as it will not hold up over time,78,6
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,ever notice a hum when listing to someone on a video or audio it is the vibration of their mic get one of these and leave the humming to the birds,30,7
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,just got it today and i originally ordered the radius shock mount and they gave me the improved radius ii shock mount i was worried that thiswould not suit me well because of all the bad reviews here i am very pleased with my purchase and happy it came early i used prime shipping for this and to just let everyone know that everything is made of metal and not plastic as previously described by others,78,8
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,fyi they are selling radius ii units from this listing now or at least that is what happened to me the radius ii listing was out of stock so i bought this instead but the radius ii is still what showed up overall i am pleased the only major con is the price i do not know that it is really worth 65 not sure what all the one star reviews are about the threading and such has all worked well for me has worked flawlessly with my yeti and rode psa1 boom arm the combination totally isolates the mic in cardioid pattern while recording with my kef x300a loudspeakers on either side of it typing away on my mechanical keyboard there is no background noise unless the speakers are blasting music and then the amount is negligible,136,9
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the only gripe i have is that the hinge does not hold the mic up very well over time i found that people took the plastic washers spacers from the mics original stand and that made a difference it definitely helps but every so often it will still droop other than that it is a nice little piece the seller was quick to ship as well,65,10
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the screw does not hold the product very well i was always afraid that it would all-of-a-sudden give out and flop down right into my laptop screen,26,11
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this product has been a great disdain of mine for a while at this price point you expect premium quality but what you receive is poor design and build quality look elsewhere,32,12
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,does it is job albeit at a terribly overpriced cost,9,13
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,great product bought for my son and he loves it,10,14
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,kind of expensive but you do get a solid product out of it seems like 40 50 would have been a more reasonable price but it is not too over priced i suppose,31,15
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,looks great but mic is to heavy has to be at a upward angle i do not like that,18,16
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the thumb screw and joint are not designed to hold the weight of the mic,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,after buying this stand i had a look at the reviews i was a little worried since a lot mentioned a problem with the screw not holding due to the weight i inspected it and they replaced the old plastic washer saw on youtube review with a metal washer with teeth it holds very well easy to tighten and i am very pleased with the purchase,66,18
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the mount seems to be too big i have mine set up with a rode psa1 swivel mount studio microphone boom arm within days of owning this product the thumb screw snapped off so now i have it jerry rigged with various items from my husbands toolbox if it gets bumped in the slightest it falls it is very concerning and i worry for the safety of my blue yeti i also have the blue pop filter that does not seem to have a set home in combination with this set up which boggles my mind it is all blue equipment minus the boom arm which i have no problems with so why does not it fit together next time i will go with another company for all my audio recording needs,128,19
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,great microphone but known issue apparently with windows 81 reading on their site and had to follow instructions to use an old o / s version driver not happy about that and is keeping me from giving a 5 shame that latest is not supported properly in latest o / s otherwise great microphone sound quality and construction,53,20
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,thisbroke shortly after purchasing the metal knob which is used to tighten the mount is not strong enough to support the weight of the yeti blue microphone all and all a very expensive waste of money,38,21
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,good shock mount does the job perfectly easy to install on mic and on the boom,16,22
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it lasted for 2 months or so before it started to get loose i tightened it up and it stayed for a few days before i had to tighten it up again eventually the thumb-screw or whatever it is broke off and now it is a big pile of junk overpriced piece of crap time to look for another solution and burn more money on something that shall hopefully last long enough for me not to get pissed off when it eventually does give in,83,23
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i saw alot of bad reviews of this mount being faulty or the wing-nut breaking off well be careful with it and be patient during setup / re-adjusting it holds firm looks pretty professional and definitely does the job no complaints as of now,42,24
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,my son loves this as part of his microphone setup,10,25
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it does not support the weight of the blue yeti or the blue yeti pro,14,26
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,very bulky and heavy thumb screw broke so now it is unusable waste of money,15,27
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i like this shockmount a lot however i wish they could be a little more innovative and shrink down that size this is a gigantic shock mount,26,28
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,super heavy and the bolt holding the swivel mount on broke and my blue mic fell right on the ground was not even home when it happened bolt just snapped over time from being tight you can tell everything is quality except this little bolt it is cast molded and junk pretty bummed had to rig it up to fix,59,29
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,works on the yeti but it adds so much weight that the whole thing starts to sag unless you use a wrench with some rubber protective pads to tighten everything up i had this on a swing arm and it was constantly drooping with the yeti pro i would not recommend this for the yeti series at all nothing wrong with the product itself by the way it works as advertised and i use it with other mics on occasion,80,30
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,horrible do not buy this it does no good it easily breaks and does not support the mic at all,20,31
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,love the radius shock mount i do recommend this product,10,32
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works good the hinges need a lot of tightening and i twisted of a bolt and do not know how to replace it,22,33
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,yes like many other reviewers have said this is pretty much not worth it for the yeti keep the yeti on it is base it is just too heavy to be mounted on a stand you will frustrate yourself with clamps trying to keep it mounted in the air,46,34
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,not strong enough to hold up the blue yeti just ordered a blue microphones yeti and yeti pro custom spider shock mount instead to solve this problem,27,35
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,blue mic customer service is great but no amount of customer service can fix this mount I have been sent two replacements and like all other reviewers the mount can not hold the mic up and is constantly drooping down,38,36
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this stand looks beautiful but it has flaws it constantly need re adjustment and recently the thumbscrew broke off,19,37
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the radius is one of two available shock mounts of the blue yeti that is the reality is it overpriced yes does it do the job also yes however the thumbscrew that comes with the shock mount is extremely prone to breaking due to the extreme weight of the yeti and whatever pop filter you use the radius will inevitably sag some users suggest exchanging the plastic washers included with the radius for the rubber o-rings from the original yeti stand that is a mistake the o-rings merely provide a different form of friction less surface area of the o-rings will make contact and the o-rings will eventually wear out they will work temporarily however the solution get an m5 hex cap screw from the hardware store and use that in place of the thumbscrew yes you will have to use a special wrench to tighten it however your shock mount will be rock solid I am docking a star because the thing is hilariously overpriced the fixture is large which might make it more expensive but for a product that comes with flawed hardware i expect more for the price,189,38
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,I have gone through 2 of these first one broke because of a faulty screw in the hinge but second one is working out just right does what it is suppose to i can imagine there are other shockmounts out there that do a good job as well but aesthetics of this are unmatched,53,39
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,low quality materials i followed a youtube tutorial on exactly how to mount this along with a rode psa1 swivel mount unfortunately the hardware that it comes with is not strong enough and after about 48 hours of being setup gravity took over and broke the clip so that it is now just dangling helplessly from the mount and it is not fixable unless i usetape or a soldering iron,71,40
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this does not fit a blue yeti microphone the threads do not line up what a terrible terrible product i hope the microphone is better,25,41
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,here are a few reasons why you should not even consider purchasing this mount 1 it is massive put two pop cans on top of each other that is the approximate diameter 2 it does not support the weight of a blue yeti mic not only does it not support the weight constantly swings down because the little screw can not stay tight enough to keep it up but the mount itself weighs a ton this makes it a nightmare for any spring-based arm 3 it brakes after a couple months of use that little screw i mentioned that holds it up yes it snapped off due to I am guessing constantly having to re-tighten it for the mount to stay up 4 just read the other plethora of reviews saying the same thing as me i was lucky enough that amazon allowed me to return the product but I am still out 10 for restocking,150,42
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,I have gone through two of these things with my blue yeti for both the little bolt that holds the mount in place snapped off only by using hand-torque on the bolt I am no hulk of a strongman by any stretch of the imagination seems the weight of the yeti pulled on the bolt joint enough to snap it makes me sad because the yeti is such a quality product and you are basically stuck with this piece of junk shockmount,81,43
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,I am very serious this shock mount gets 2 stars because of one little screw allow me to explain i got this mount for the same reason anyone does it is the mount made for the blue yeti that said it is huge and a bit unwieldy on top of that my mic was drooping every day and so every day I had untighten the screw move the mic back up and tighten it again this process got old fast so finally i tightened it as hard as i could and lo and behold the screw snaps i was startled because I am not a strong person at all i looked at the screw and it is made of plastic please be warned this screw is cheap plastic and will not hold the mic up at all until they fix this part do not buy this is not even shoddy workmanship this is pure bad design and laziness cheapness even there is zero reason for this part to be made of plastic it is a screw something like this should never happen,174,44
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,it looks great but it was very heavy and made the yeti huge it was so heavy that it brought the stand down no matter what adjustments i made ended up using the yeti without it and I am fine with it for podcasting,43,45
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,there was a problem with the screw in which to hold your mic in place the screw just snapped completely now i can not adjust my mic to be upright it just dangles now it was a pain to constantly adjust it and now i can not adjust it at all i have a friend who has the same yeti set up as i do with the shock mount set up and he had the same exact problem terribly disappointing but hopefully a warranty is out there for this,87,46
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the screw that holds the microphone to the shock mount can not support the weight of the microphone for the month that i used it it consistently slid out of position then today when i attempted to record some audio it completely snapped in two when i went to adjust it,50,47
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i have tried to use this product and it always came loose i was careful with it but it still broke it dos not support the weight of the microphone,30,48
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works for what i need works fine with the yeti mic allows the mic to swivel around so you can position which part of the mic is facing you,29,49
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,just like everyone warned about the point where the shock mount attaches to an arm i have mine on a rode psa1 is terribly designed and can not hold the weight of the blue yeti which is the only mic that this mount is intended for it is very disappointing because i can not afford a different mic at this point and the only shock mount available for the blue yeti is this one i was very careful with tightening the thumbscrew but gradually over time it would not hold the mic in place and it would pivot down i tried to tighten it tonight and the screw sheered off when i turned the thumb screw I have only had the mount since 2/28/2014 very disappointed,122,50
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,perfect fit and mount all i can say is watch out simple minded rappers cuz s s about to blow up,20,51
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works as advertised helpful with such a large microphone easy to install and to adjust i would recommend this product to others,22,52
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,does this do it is job in the audio department sure the problem is that the attachment to a tripod is so flimsy and loose the microphone will fall down immediately so tighten it right well tightening it by hand is not nearly enough as it will fall back down again so the next obviousis to tighten with a pair of pliers unfortunately the damn thing snaps at less than a quarter turn literally no way of holding up the yeti on it is own without buying extra little bits and parts for it it had one job and it can not even do it hold up a blue yeti but it can not which is sad for such an expensive piece of hardware,122,53
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,listen to the other 1 - 3 star reviews the turn / handle that twists and allows you to tighten the mic into place completely snapped off today I have only had the mount for about two months look elsewhere or wait until a redesign happens,41,54
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it does what it says reduces a lot of nearby vibrations and excess noise feedback from mounted objects i am satisfied with the rig i have going and this shockmount,30,55
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it is the shock mount you want if you bought a blue yeti microphone do be aware that this does wiegh around 3 - 6 pounds just by itself so if you get a mic stand make sure it can take all the weight you need it too,45,56
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought thisjust over a year ago along with my blue yeti i love the blue yeti and i wanted to make sure i recorded the best possible sound i could so i bought this and after over a year of use i can say it is completely useless the stand the yeti comes with is just as much a shock mount as this i also have a few other cheap desk mounts which i tried out the shock mount does not help secondly even is this thing did work as advertised that would not make up for the terrible quality it broke a month after buying when i was adjusting it and cmon that price 60 dollars for a shock mount that is 2/3s the price of the freakin mic it is made for i do not know what i was thinking do not make the same mistake,145,57
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,based on some of the reviews posted on here i was unsure about this shock mount when i first ordered it however i must say it works great it works rather easily with the blue microphones the pop universal pop filter the only reason i find to rate this 4 stars and not five is simply because of the price tag it really could be cheaper,68,58
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,not only did i receive back to back defective pieces but when i finally received a good one it worked just as others are describing the threads on this clamp are far too weak to hold the blue yeti mic it is almost as if they built this without any testing whatsoever do not buy this unless you are interested in frustrating yourself to no end if you must use the blue yeti use a mic stand not a swing arm if you prefer the swing arm go with a different mic / shock-mount combo trust the others and myself this mount is garbage and the only guarantee it offers is frustration,109,59
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,legit looks exactly like it does in the picture have not set it up yet but i do not think I shall have problems,21,60
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,well-made product that fulfills it is purpose it looks pretty and costs far less than a night out with marilyn what is this presumptuous minimum-word requirement that amazon imposes regarding product ratings this is my last one ausgezeichnet,37,61
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it looks cool as heck and i get no bumps or vibration while recording this is worth the cost i got the blue yeti pro the pop filter and this shockmount my set up looks very professional and sounds very professional,41,62
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the thumb screw broke and can not use it tell i find a new one or get a replacement so of be carefull when u buy this product,27,63
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i broke the screw part because it would not tighten enough to support the weight of the yeti do not do that it will not be perfect but do not try and force it to be any tighter but as for the shock absorbing part for which you by it it does not do a great job right off the bat but you can unwind the band from a few points to loosen it up a bit which will significantly help reduce any noise from accidentally bumping the table it is on and the like sadly i figured that out after i broke it do not follow in my footsteps,103,64
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it was a xmas gift for my grandson he says it is great works really well it met with all his expections,21,65
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,bought one of these for a blue yeti mounted it on my boom stand the weight of the yeti was too much for the joint and the shock mount kept bending down so i tightened it but it was still bending down and then tightened it too far broke off the tab so I have got the boom pointing straight up and the loose shock mount naturally bends at 90 degree angle it works in this configuration but I have got to rearrange my desk and it is not the setup i was hoping for,92,66
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i have seen lots of reviews saying that the yeti does not fit my blue yeti not the pro mounted perfectly to it it took a few tries but it screwed in perfectly i put it on my arm stand and it works fine one concern is that the swivel mount seems fragile it can barely hold the mic without falling and i had to use a wrench to tighten it perfectly i am worried i will strip it and break the mount other than that it seems fine i have so far had this for a day and i will see if it keeps mounted for a long time without breaking,111,67
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i do not know why there are so many negative reviews about mounting the yeti on this product i had this installed in about 2 minutes without any issues with regards to threading are people trying to mount it on the thumbscrew i find this mount to be incredibly sturdy with just the right amount of tension,56,68
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,works extremely well took quite a bit of effort to adequately tighten the thumbscrew that holds the mic itself in place also annoying that blue made a mic so big it absolutely requires it is own special shock mount especially when many comparably priced mics have some kind of internal shockmount a la the shure sm55,55,69
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i want to say that i love it but this shock mount is very short by that i mean that the shock chords are short taking very little shock away from the microphones receptivity in other words sounds do get transmitted to the mic the best bet is to place your mic on a thick bath towel folded over several times that will absorb much of the shock created from a desk mount stand but the shock mount is supposed to work on a boom i do have one set up in my studio but as i said it is about 80 effective i will say this it is ok for the price if you visit a microphone store where you can see all the professional shock mounts they can run into hundreds of dollars a really good mic with a really good boom requires a really good shock mount the professional set up i am talking about can cost from 2000 to as much as 10000 if you are an interneet podcaster like me then you do not want to go there the blue microphone shock mount works very well with the yeti i highliy recommend it for the price,197,70
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this mount because it was recommended to use with the blue yeti microphone the microphone is too heavy for this mount it does not stay locked in place and does not get very tight so it still moves and I am scared it will fall off i will be returning it soon,51,71
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i briefly skimmed the bad reviews and paid the price sure enough the thumbscrew used to attach the mount to the mic will not turn more than a couple of revolutions furthermore on my unit the 3/8 to 5/8 adapter that came with my rode arm will not thread into the female end on the mount the unit i received had various other defects about half of the screws used to assemble the unit were loose be warned,76,72
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,the blue microphones radius microphone shock mount shock mount did not fit my stand had to modify it but other than that it works perfect,24,73
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this shock mount is pretty massive which adds to just how heavy the yeti mic is as if it was not heavy enough to begin with so if getting this shock mount make sure you get a mic arm that is very supportive or it will droop and not hold it up,50,74
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this is a red letter product you can only buy this for your yeti and it is what it is works for what it is but when i bought it for 80 bucks it felt like a rip off,39,75
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,very happy with this there is not much that fits this little beast but this works great i use it with a desktop mic stand,25,76
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,this f ing thing now before you say stuff like this amazing shock mount held my blue yeti just fine i want to tell you that i bought it used that should not matter but it will not tighten enough to support the weight of the mic grrr would send it back but i think it is too late now,56,77
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the threads do not 100 match the threads on the blue yeti pro when fully hand tighten the rig is super wobbly when i unscrewed you can see the threads on the microphone have been damaged i just hope it does not break off completely do not buy biggest waste of money i wish i could replace my blue yeti pro now,61,78
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this because i have a blue yeti mic and this is made my blue what could go wrong right everything worthless it does not fit the snugly into the threads on my yeti waste of time and money do not buy,41,79
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,great solid mount for the heavy blue yeti microphone easy to install well constructed looks professional let us me mount the microphone upside down to keep it spit free,28,80
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,pretty cool and probably the only one that fits the blue yeti microphone the only drawback is that it does not hold place very well when taking it on an angle you constantly have to be adjusting and tightening and readjusting it other than that it is great,47,81
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,let me start by saying that i like this mount it has a lovely retro style and i would have absolutely loved to use it with my mic sadly in spite of being made by the same company and specifically marketed for use with my mic it is utterly incompatible due to their threads not matching according to another negative review the radius uses a metric thread while the yeti uses an imperial thread i can not attest to this myself but i can absolutely confirm that the two do not work together all those looking for a shock mount for their yeti look elsewhere,104,82
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,it works great with my yeti and allows me to bump the table a bit without distortion a bit heavy although,21,83
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,this product is fantastic and hard to find through amazons search engine do you have a blue yeti microphone if yes do you want to use it in a microphone stand if yes this is the product to buy too bad that when you look for blue yeti shock mount or blue yeti tand adaptor this does not show up but one from samson mics i had to return one of those this product is the solution amazon change the keywords,81,84
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i needed a mount for my blue yeti mic and thought I had try this with the hope that I had receive a version that has the correct threads the one i received from amazon does not have the correct threading and does not work with the blue yeti mic i will not be buying any more yeti products,54,85
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,after trying to rig something up i decided to just go with this mount for my yeti it did not disappoint the fit was perfect install was easy use your logic and the microphone looks sexy as he shall on it,40,86
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i really like the blue radius it is very useful for when i do my gameplay recordings for youtube it gets a lil loose form time to time but is still a great product i love it,36,87
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the blue microphone radius shock mount is excellent it got rid of all vibration sounds through the microphone especially the fans in my computer i did not realize how much they were actually in the background now even if i hit the pop filter with my lips or chin it can not be heard although the microphone great product and very well built a must have,64,88
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,it did not perform looks cool but that is it very large and inconvenient would not recommend this because i would not recommend the blue yeti,25,89
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,until the company clearly marks the packaging to distinguish standard / english 5/8 27 tpi thread version used in the us from the metric m16 x 10 thread i received customers here will be very unhappy I am lucky that i did not strip the mic threads but be careful others have complained of just that will return this and hope to get the correct standard threaded one without delay this was not purchased from a reseller ships from and sold by amazoncom update I am not sure which part had the standard thread and which was metric but i sent both mount and the yeti microphone to blue and am happy with their customer service they are correcting the problem by sending me a set that fits i only paid for shipping it to them I am bumping from one to three stars for that and will update again based on my experience with the returned set,149,90
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,as another reviewer mentioned it looks great although it is probably bigger than it needs to be however this is not well designed from a functional point of view only on aesthetics this holder does not take out much vibration which it is supposed to do i have 3 other shock-mount mic holders and they all do what they are supposed to unfortunately i do not know of any alternatives for my yeti pro if you know please enlighten me,77,91
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i purchased this shock mount for my blue microphone as advertised unfortunately the weight of the mic is too much for the mount and when it is on a mic stand it will not stay fixed without serious torque in the screw after one or two times of me tightening it to the required torque the screw threads gave way and now it will not stay in position at all disappointing for the price and otherwise it would be a nice shock mount it certainly looks nice,87,92
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,fits on the mic perfect and looks very professoinal i am very happy also with the construction looks to be very sturdy and fits like a glove go for it,30,93
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i had a little issue with matching the threading of my microphone and the radius it works but not quiet as deep into the threading as i would prefer i am using it to hang over my head when shooting videos,41,94
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,hard to complain in spite of the price tag it works great and looks nice when paired with the yeti microphone,21,95
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought the blue radius shock mount for my blue yeti microphone to reduce secondary noise when i move near it i was glad when it arrived but devastated when i attempted to screw the radius into my yeti the screw does not fit the microphone the screw is metric but is the reason it does not work i chipped my microphone on the bottom trying to screw it in i do not know who to contact to have them replace my microphone due to blues error i had to return the shock mount to amazon and I am afraid to order another one in hopes of getting another screw that is metric i would give it zero stars if that was an option stay away from this shock mount,127,96
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i literally bought this shock mount friday may 24 and received it saturday may 25 great transaction quick delivery obviously works perfectly this company deserves an award for amazing service bc this is honestly the fastest i have ever ordered and received a product keep up the great jobs guys,50,97
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,despite other users having issues i ordered this shock mount to use with my yeti and was glad to find out that it does fit the threaded insert in the bottom of the yeti pros worked with the yeti reduced noise significantly looks nice feels sturdy cons it is gigantic elastic is too tight overall it works well but would work even better with slightly more shock reduction the elastic bands are too sturdy and are still passing along some amount of shock it is not enough to make the shock mount a bad value but it is enough to cost it a 5th star on my review,111,98
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,goes great with my yeti pro i was surprised with the size and i am so glad i bought it,20,99
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it was exactly what i needed and came just in time there is no other product quite like it thanks,20,100
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i bought this mount and paired it with a blue yeti and rode psa swivel mount all three work perfectly together and the shock mount allows the microphone / arm combo to move smoothly the only issue i had//have is that when connecting the yeti to this mount is that when if feels like the mic has tightened all the way there is abetween the base of the mount and the mic itself this problem is that this allows the move and clang and bang i used some shims to keep it tight but i would expect the mount / mic to be flush I shall upload a picture to show what i mean other than that minor hiccup awesome shock mount for the blue yeti,123,101
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,the threading on this mount does not fit the yeti completely loose ridiculous for the amount i paid for each so pissed off,23,102
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the shock mount does a nice job with my yeti in terms of sound mitigation coming from my computer desk i purchased this in combination with the rode psa-1 and the on stage asfss6 gb dual-screen pop filter good combination,40,103
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,thiswas a huge disappointment it looks nice but it does not function in anyway like it should the thumbscrew to lock the head at the appropriate angle is made of pot metal i never once got it tight enough to hold the microphone at the right angle without it slipping this could have been easily solved by putting teeth on the joint so that it would lock after 3 weeks of trying to tighten it enough to hold the microphone horizontal the thumbscrew simply sheared off in my hand it did not once hold it correctly and now it is just a pile of junk that i will have to bore out and put my own hardware into to top it off this joint attaches to the main frame with about 1/8 of slop so that even if this joint was made tight the entire frame can rock up and down basically this is some stylized pot metal that i regret buying i purchased a rode microphone arm with this and a blue yeti pro microphone both are fantastic but i hope no one else has to deal with this thing,192,104
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,it seems to be constructed well however the screw that joins the shock mount to the base of the blue yeti binds it does not want to screw in all the way by hand and i would not attempt to use tools to tighten for fear of stripping the threads,50,105
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,i bought this along with a blue yeti when i got them i put them on a nice floor stand put the shockmount on the stand and then tried to mount the yeti i could not get the microphone to thread up properly i kept thinking it was me because mic threads are pretty universal before i knew it i stripped all of the threads out of the yeti i currently have a service request into blue to replace both items now that i look at the reviews i am most certainly not the only person with this issue with the radius however it looks like we are isolated meaning there are some mounts that are fine and some that are not so when you recieve thisand you can not get the microphone to thread do not keep trying over and over either return theto amazon for another or contact blue i might update the rating on this when i get the new shockmount and microphone but for now i have no choice but to say i hate this,181,106
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works really well especially with the rode psa 1 swivel mount i purchased i can no longer hear my finger touch the desk anymore or any other vibration for that matter,31,107
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works as intended however beware of the weight of the mount with the yeti mic is pretty heavy so if you do not have a beefy heavy duty stand you will not be able to extend the arm very far if that is the case,45,108
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works with yeti good product for good price,20,109
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,ordered this together with the blue yeti in the same order the thread on the radius does not match the blue yeti so i can not mount the radius securely probably a manufacturing defect of some sort what a waste of time for products that are supposed to be designed to work together,52,110
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,i have the blue yeti and a rode psa 1 swivel mount i was afraid the weight would not hold but all together it is perfect yes when you have the mic hanging upside down the swivel mount does not do the best job of holding the mic in place you have to constantly tighten the cinch bolt i might wind up doing some sort of modification to fix this other than that one issue this shock mount does exactly what it is supposed to do,84,111
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,much bigger than i expected i wish it did not cost so much money or there were a generic option to fit the yeti but oh well,26,112
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,seems well made but the clamps that hold it up to make the mic stand upright do not tighten properly therefore making it useless do not buy,26,113
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,the mount is great other than the screw that goes into the bottom of the mic would not go all the way in had to use pliers to get it on even after a drop of oil it goes on far enough to hold the mic to where it will not fall off but not enough to keep it from wobbling i placed a nylon washer in the open space to fix the issue only bad thing is my grip of the screw is a little messed up from the pliers so it is not easy to take off fortunately it stays on the stand at all times,105,114
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,gave thisas a christmas gift he said he would use this at work and for his own personal use,21,115
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,this shock mount takes out a hum i was getting in recordings it truly reduces shock also if you turn the gain down on the yeti and talk louder next to your mic you can get some great recorderings with this duo shock mount and blue yeti it was 65 shockmount but it is worth it,55,116
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,this thing is huge as is the blue yeti my only complaint about this mount is i constantly have to tighten it to support the unbelievably heavy yeti that it must support if you need a shock mount for a yeti this is the only one i could find and it does work pretty well,55,117
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,bought two of these thing and they do not fit properly it seems the thread on these shock mount are not threaded correctly i do not recommend this,28,118
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,it does not what it is supposed to and I have even noticed i that the way i keep my mic i can slide my blue pop filter through it without it touching or being a bother it looks great and absorbs shock i wish it was cheaper but besides that it was a great purchase i use it on a 20 mic stand that i also gone from amazon,67,119
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,the shock mount for the blue yeti and yeti pro has worked out just fine for me i can use it either on a desk mount stand boom floor mount stand or the desktop extension arm mic holder in all broadcast studios i have worked in we always used the extension arm holders i run two stream full time on the net so this shock mount works out great with my having to switch from one pc to another to make announcements on the different streams,86,120
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,bought this for a client doing e-learning videos excellent sound quality i was very impressed the drivers on the website did not work i had to contact tech support it was smooth and the women sent me a dropbox link for an updated driver those worked like a charm,48,121
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,since my home studio is pretty small vocals are not my specialty and i really only got this to dress up my little blue snowball microphone so in that respect it does give my blue a much more professional overall look and it was easy to attach was it an absolute necessity i do not know that i hear much of a difference than before so the verdict is still out on that but it does what shock mounts do i suppose so yes i like it,82,122
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,definitely prefer this over the desktop mount that came with the microphone bought an arm to mount it on and it works great,23,123
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,looks cool but this thing is a gigantic 8 in diameter i got it because it seems to be the only way to hang a yeti vertically on the end of a mic stand boom arm there must be a better solution I am going to send it back and try the on stage posi-lok,54,124
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,if you are the owner of a yeti micophone and you need to isolate the mic with a shock mount then this is the mount to get well constructed not too heavy but keeps the vibrations at bay combine with a good boom stand and you have a nice piece of kit,52,125
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,for the brand and price i expected better quality i think they went more for style and looks when designing this i used it with a desktop mic boom and every key pressed on my keyboard when right up through it and into the mic this resulted in a slight muffled background sound that was annoying to solve the problem i bought a floor mic stand with boom this solution works great with the shock mount and blue yeti i think the problem is that the ties between parts are too small and tight i looked at the shock mounts for blues higher end mics and they are designed with longer ties i also used the samson shock mount that was wonderful with the samson mic it has longer ties that are more flexible so i believe this shock mount which looks cool is just flawed in design for the money asked i would have expected them just to do what they know works on a side note the blue yeti that goes with the shock mount is wonderful,178,126
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,hello before purchasing this shock mount i emailed blue support i previously had the ringer universal shockmount for my snowball mic looking at the pictures it looked like the same shock mount to me so the emailed i sent was asking if the two were the same and if i could just order the attachment piece that looked different to hold the yeti never heard back from them emailed a couple of times asking the same question finally just bought the radius shock mount the two are the same except the piece the holds the mic to the shock mount,100,127
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,i bought the yeti and then the yeti pro microphone by blue wonderful mics but the lack at the time of a workable shock mount left me feeling less than satisfied the recently released radius shock mount is perfect it fits great attaches and un-attaches easily and the look is stellar both vintage and rather spacey I am definitely going to buy a second one for the other mic note when you remove the mic from it is original stand screw the attaching bolts back into the mic otherwise you are left with two holes in the side of the mic,101,128
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,works great I have had this for a few years now and it is still holding strong i have a yeti mic in it,22,129
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,can not be tightened enough to really stay in the desired position without fear of snapping the mechanism too many horror stories it has to be left a bit loose and hang at an angle as a result they really need to come up with a more effective design,48,130
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,very disappointed for the price we pay we should not have to drill use pliers a hammer extra screwsto make these products work / function as they should,28,131
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,bought it for my son he loves it,8,132
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,i have a blu usb attached and the pivot bolt broke after about 1 year they used cheap alloy for the main connector that receives all the tork most of the position adjustment knobs and screws come loose and just do not old in place so i have to continually re-adjust and tighten i managed to hobble together a main connector bolt from parts from the local hardware store and i still use the thing however it is becoming a frankenstein fixture,82,133
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,i was happy that this came pre strung my only complaint is that tuning it was a pain in the posterior i popped the bridge numerous times and when i came close to getting the e string in tune snap i bought a new e string but i could not figure out how to install it with out taking off the fine tuner the rosin is severely dried out and only after a piece of it broke off and i could use the inner part of it that was not dried out was i able to fully rosin my bow now that it is rosined enough i can finally get the right sounds from it and am able to fully enjoy it,120,0
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,my bridge is missing and i did not get my rosin so as thrilled as i am to get my first electric violin I am very upset and not happy,28,1
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,the only thing i was unclear of was the headphones are for use with an amp only can not plug headphones directly into instrument this was my mistake but not the end of the world because we have an amp,39,2
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,my son is 8 he is fascinated with all things technical and musical he has started learning the violin in school and i wanted to get him something that would be all his his favoriteis blue i love the variety of colors available on this model and he has a little rough on his things not intentionally he just uses them for the money spent on this i could have probably tracked down a used more professional violin however this is new it is his and for about 100 it was a great investment he has practicing daily and we can see the confidence booster this has provided him the violin was very easy to setup i had some musical training so i knew what to do if you had none you can pretty much google anything you need to know in addition to what comes with the package great value and what I am happiest with is if in a few years he has no longer interested i did not invest a grand into an instrument that will loose it is value immediately,179,3
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,i do not know how the violin plays yet because i bought this for my girlfriend it did not come with a hard case but a soft case the bow is extremely cheaply made also like others i got the rosin as hard as a rock the headphones are junk they hardly work at all due to a short in the plug the smallest string snapped as when i tried to put the bridge on even although it had not yet been tensioned but was still very loose now as for the quality of the violin itself i can not say yet due to the fact i do not play the violin i can say that the violin itself is not made very well just pay the extra money and get a good one,131,4
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves her violin and wanted a new one this company was fast and very efficient,24,5
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,the violin did not work at all the chip was sticking into the battarie compartment and when i tryed to take the battarie out the whole back of the violin almost came off the collor of the violin is varry diffrent from the picture too i did get a full refund back although so I am varry happy about that,58,6
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,low rating because when plugging it in the electric part does not work i have tried everything i can to fix it but still does not work the way it is described rosin dried out and popped the e barely tuning it,42,7
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,4.0,positive,sounded like a violin my first upgrade would probably be a bow although does not have a very good tone or sound but it is to be expected from the cheapest electric violin on here you get what you pay for,39,8
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,my daughter loves it she was surprised by the quality for the price especially the case she figured out would be flimsy but it surprisingly better built,27,9
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,i just got my violin today when i opened it i thought it was in great shape but when i went to get it all set up and in tune the string broke none of the other strings even stay in tune at all none of the electrical works except to the power light but that do not help the bow feels cheap like the rest of the violin please if anything can be done to fix my situation i would appreciate it,82,10
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,1.0,negative,i bought this and when i tried to tune it the first time a string broke and the knobs are to stiff the resin was in broken pieces,28,11
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,2.0,negative,maybe it is just me because i consider myself a beginner although i played the violin while in high school over 40 years ago i have settled for playing clasical guitar since then and own many guitars i have been wanting to play the violin again and thought this could be a cheap entry level instrument to learn the result was as follows the battery was dead one of the strings popped while i was trying to tune it i could not get the chin rest to stay in place the strings do not stay in tune and i find it impossible to play the a string without touching either the d or the e string the bridge may need sanding but where and how much since i do not know how to set it up properly and the price of the instrument does not warrant new strings new pegs three more fine tuning screws new rosin and a new bow i am having serious thoughts to returning it before the 30 days expire any help,175,12
Musical_Instruments,B006687MCY,5.0,positive,arrived on time as expected the bridge wanted to keep popping off during the initial tuning but we got it the sound is good for the price works in our amps if you want a cheap electric violin for practice sure go for it,44,13
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,guitar came with all promised materials although it had some cosmetic damage to the neck of the guitar the seller did stipulate that due to the manufacture process this might occur i do not think it harms the sound quality good guitar for someone just starting out and not worried about the instrument looking perfect,54,0
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i recommend buying this for beginners the guitar design is ok but the sound is awesome i did not recieve a ebook which is ok instead i got this thing which sounds like a kazoo very low price for an awesome guitar,42,1
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i like the guitar it is is nice cosidering how inexpensive it is but it did not come with an ebook like it claimed instead it came with a pitch pipe,29,2
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,for 20 more i got an acoustic guitar from musicians friend rogue that is much better,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,strings broke the first time i tried to play it,10,4
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,this is proof you get what you pay for the wood it is made of is basically paper thin i feel like if i strum too hard it will shatter I had say only a true beginner who can not spend more than 100 would be ok with this,46,5
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,for a cheap beginner guitar i understand the poor quality but i do not see how anyone can learn to play on this thing the strings do not even make a proper tone and had to be replaced i recommend spending 30 more dollars and getting something a bit better,48,6
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,surprisingly had a vary pretty sound but felt awkward in hands while playing and the neck snapped do to humidity and heat you get what you pay for tho good starter guitar,32,7
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,if you are thinking about buying this guitar do not its not worth it it has no trust bar which means the more you play it the more out of tune it will get i like how it looks looks okay on my wall i guess but if you want to buy a guitar even just to learn on i suggest you spend the 150 and get a really decent guitar you seriously will not regret it and you definitely will not waste your money on a board with strings,85,8
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar has started to break apart and it is not even two years old very very poor quality not good,20,9
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i do not play so maybe I shall learn low low price and great for photo props some people complained about odor i had very little odor odor gone over night again great price and fast delivery,35,10
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,ok the guitar is obviously good for the price but the thing is i clearly ordered the cutaway style and i got the regular style and that 's not cool,29,11
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i bought this at the request of my daughter for her birthday she wanted a starter acoustic guitar because she hoped to learn how to play it this product taught me the value of reading amazon reviews before purchasing anything the guitar itself was scratched and banged up pretty bad when we got it the decorative label on the front is a very cheaply put on sticker with bubbles on it the case is thinvinyl like material that had tears in it and the zipper broke on the second use more importantly this guitar can not be tuned we have had it restrung and i have taken it to three different music shops and they all say the same thing worst guitar they have ever seen you get what you pay for that is for sure,135,12
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,when i opened it i had a trusted friend tune it and the neck immediately started bowing and within the next day the frame cracked not only that but you could see where they would spray painted it black in the heart of it not worth the money even as a beginner spring for a nicer guitar this one would not hold a tune for more than 3 seconds anyway and the case was nothing more than a cheap bag not impressed,80,13
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this guitar was broke right from the box the kneck was broke loose from the body would not recommend this guitar,21,14
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product it did not come with the pitch pipe to tune it it did not come with the strap it did not come with the case it did not come with any extra strings or pics it was supposed to come with all of that i did not complain because amazon is the middle man from what i understand and i had other more important issues to deal with at the time and a big chunk of wood fell out of the guitar as soon as i lifted it out of the box I am not sure if it was a piece to this guitar or from another,107,15
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,chips everywhere the only good thing is came on time would return it but by time i do it will cost me more in the end,26,16
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is the first guitar i have bought I am a beginner and amy friend is teaching me he had 20 years of experience and he says the guitar has a good sound the strings are not that hard to tell apart the guitar does smell like chemicals when you first open it just let it vent out over all i have no problems with it i think i got a lot more than what i paid for,77,17
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this product is very small if you wanted to play it or get lessons this would not be theto order spend the extra money on a real guitar,29,18

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,as the previous posters mentioned it has an odor when you first open the box it is a christmas gift so i let it air out in my work office for a week or so no smell now it was just the paint / lacquer overall I am quite pleased several coworkers that are musicians noticed it in my office and looked it over they said the quality was actually quite good especially for the price,73,23
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,good starter guitar for a bigger my teenage son needed a beginner acoustic guitar for guitar class at his high school my husband and i did not want to spend a lot of money and he ending up not liking it we thought this was a good start to see how well he takes care of the guitar before considering an expensive guitar the bag it came with was a huge joke very cheap and very thin within a week of school the zipper on the bag broke my husband fixed it but it happened again as far as i know nothing wrong with the guitars sound,107,24
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,my son is two and loves music this is a sturdy childs guitar that seems like it was built to take a beating which in our house is pretty much guaranteed laughing out loud the only thing i had a slight issue with was the guitar arrived with some chips in the finish but that may have occurred during shipment but it is merely cosmetic damage and like i said it will probably get more within it is lifetime,74,25
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,horrible costumer service my guitar had a problem and they wanted me to pay shipping to send it back it was more then the cost of the guitar bad quality never go back again the guitar is in the trash it was cheaper to throw it out bad experience,51,26
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i expected this to be a cheap guitar i expected it to smell like chemicals as other posters warned i should have read further warnings as i would have saved myself time effort and money this should not even be sold as a guitar maybe as decor i bought this for a little girl who is trying to find her niche and was interested in picking up guitar she could not even get anof whether or not she would enjoy playing since no one could play this thing with every strum it went out of tune every single strum you would play a chord three times and every strum it would be a different note as the crap pegs failed to do their job a kazoo is more of an instrument than this thing what a waste,138,27
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift for my husband and for the price was any awesome deal it came fast and looked even better than in the picture,27,28
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,okay so the first thing is i received a completely different guitar i received a guitar that buzzes at the frets will not stay in tune and when we tried to tune it the last string broke 3 times the one i was supposed to get was a barcelona according to the images but i got a crescent which is a very cheaply made guitar i smelled chemicals coming off of it you can tell where paint was sprayed on and paint drippings I am sorry but i do not like this guitar i do not think it was worth it i was good at first although,104,29
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is a classical guitar with steel strings on it does not stay tuned sounds like crap even for the low cost it is not worth it at all,27,30
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is a good beginner guitar dislikes the guitar is a little smaller than expected there are minor damages and scratches the delivery was late strap is a little small likes holds a pitch well many replacement strings beautifuland tone very affordable overall a great guitar for the price and would recommend this guitar to start up beginners,59,31
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it is a nice guitar to start out i got this one for my son and he likes it he has still a bit too small for it but it will work for the time being,34,32
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the strings are to old the 5 fern it came broken so it can not be tune the seller dint contac me so now my son do not have a guitar to practice and i can buy another oneit was a waiste of money,42,33

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i bought this thinking that it would help me get used to high tension strings being a ukulele player i was excited to get one of these guitars sadly after putting on nylon strings then acoustic steel strings the neck of the guitar could not take the tension long story short the guitar broke in half this is a waste of money for people seriously about playing guitar however i did make good use of the spare parts tuners picks strap gig bag strap peg and more,84,36
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,a cutaway is used to gain access to the upper frets any child learning on this guitar will be bale to play bar chords further up the neck that a traditional guitar i thought the finish was good the guitar solid it is an excellent beginners guitar and the cutaway for upper fret access is simply a bonus,58,37
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,poor quality only lasted my kids a couple months wood on guitar is warping an the strings broke requesting refund it is junk,20,38
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the product is good it is the same guitar that i have only mine is a sky but it appears they are made by the same folks,27,39
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,the body is too lightweight it feels like i could break it with my hands strings are cheap and the tuning screws are cheap and do not hold a tune which is replaceable except i think i might actually bend the neck with real strings and replacing t he tuning screws is too much work to be done on a finished product at least in my opinion bag is not padded at all so it is basically an oversized ziploc,79,40
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,but my daughter will start taking a class in september so then we will find out if is any good,20,41
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,shoddy manufacturing smeared glue and paint and still no response about a refund weeks after i complained about it do not waste your money,24,42

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i ordered two guitars off amazon for my daughters who have been taking lessons a few weeks with passed-down gear we just wanted to get something cheap but serviceable until we were sure they would stick with it this was the second one to arrive it was not even the guitar we ordered came in differentmy oldest daughter decided she liked it better than the one that came for my younger daughter however has a much more discerning ear and found both to have a lousy sound very tinny this model seems to hold it is tune a little better than i would have expected although one of the reasons we bought this is that it was listed for around 20 but was originally 120 so i thought it could not be that bad i was wrong i think the seller exaggerated the original price to make the product look better and then offered it at a discount do not be ripped off do not buy it,164,44
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar is absolutely wonderful i have had it for 6 months and i play it all the time it has excellent sound quality and it is great for beginner guitar players,31,45

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,yeah it is not the same shapeor brand as the picture it also will not stay tuned i put new strings on it and that helps the sound but it can not stay tuned,33,52
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the first time i played the guitar the string broke and when i brought it to sam ash to have it fixed they told me i could not do it because it was actually warped probably from being stored in an improper temperature setting i definitely would not recommend this,48,53
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the guitar needed lots of tuning the first couple days but after that it was good the sound is good and it makes good guitar for my daughter make some noise,31,54
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i hate itit is was a waste of money and i had to go to another store to buy a 10000 one because even my college professor told me that i could not learn guitar with this poorly made one,38,55
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i wanted a cheap guitar to be able to carry around to beaches and overseas without fear of being damaged or stolen this was a bargain so i did not think too much it looks way better than it costsnatural and it sounds very decent i am tuning it using a simple free program it was not available when i was a kid and it sounds great the strings look fine much better and softer than i hoped for plus it comes with two spare strings e and b which is nice it lacks fret markings and the goldenon the frets is already dissipating but who cares the neck is super straight and the wood seems of better quality than i bargained for the bag is made of very thin and weak material that does not look it will survive much travel but then i am not a traveling musician the pitch pipe is useless the stripe looks strong and fine i do not know why would other customers complain about it the shipping and delivery was prompt i am very satisfied definitely more than worth the money,191,56
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i bought this guitar for my girlfriend for christmas because she wanted to learn guitar the guitar is beautifully designed pros -beautiful guitar awesome price perfect beginner guitar cons -the strings were not on correctly did not come with a gig bag other than those 2 cons everything else about this was good so if you can change the strings and do not mind getting the bag i would suggest this,68,57
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the sound is amazing the wood is very hard and i like it so much theis very natural,20,58
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i look for a guitar in internet and saw it it is true that it is very cheap but i expected at least functioning i should first find out that was chinese the strings are far from the neck so it is almost impossible to play the sound is bad specially one rope i do not recommend it at all,60,59
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,worth the money good for kid and teens or whom ever want to learn or play the guitar only thing you need is sheet music book just go to youtude and learn how to play,35,60

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this guitar is excellent for beginners the only thing is that when you put it inside the case you have to re-tune it when you take it back out but that is to be expected from a guitar this cheap but i highly recommend it for up and coming guitar players who want to test the waters of this instrument without paying 100 dollars for a good one and then not liking it also another kinda off thing is that the pitch pipe is a little off key how ironic right but you can look on youtube and and follow a tutorial on how to tune your guitar there so it is not a a really big deal also i noticed alot of people complaining about a chemical smell i did not experience that i guess it has to do with theof your guitar or something and also this seller says that they will give you a learning the guitar book but it is not a hard copy it is an email so if it does not show up in the mail with the guitar case just know that it is not a mistake check your email all in all i think it is an excellent guitar for the price,203,68

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i understand that you get what you pay for but the frets could still be in the right place it can be tuned openly but many chords sound out of tune because the frets are either too wide or too narrow,41,79

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the product picture and description is misleading my 12 year old wanted a acoustic guitar so we made the purchase solely on the picture and description provided by the seller which must be mentioned that it did come in a timely fashion with excitement pride and joy my little one took the 38 black acoustic guitar to the schools music teacher with a request to add dots that resemble the fret board that appeared on his guitar then it was brought to our attention the guitar purchased was a classical guitar based on this product picture and description we really thought we had an 38 black acoustic guitar my 12 year old went from excited to disappointed after the discovery,120,94

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,agreed that for this price we should not expect for a good quality but at least the guitar should be playable for beginners to learn i noticed the following problems which i had to fix it myself when i got my shipment the height of the saddle was to short which resulted in strings touching the neck and frets producing irritating sounds no position markers the vendor provides a belt but there were no hooks on the body to attach with the only thing i liked was it is very light in weight,92,119
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is improperly built the tuning pegs need to turn too far the neck is barely attached to the body the instrument will not stay in tune long enough to play a chord do not buy this,37,120

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i wanted an inexpensive beginner guitar for my kids to learn on i did not want to waste money and then find out they have lost interest in guitar unfortunately once this guitar is tuned after strumming it once it goes right out of tune this would be good to purchase as a prop but not to play,57,123
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the first day that my son took his guitar to school the music teacher said it could not be tuned and he needed a new one on a positive note i informed amazon of the problem and my money was refunded within 72 hours,43,124
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,everyone bitchin about how this guitar sucks laughing out loud as soon as i opened the box i expected to smell the bad odor as everyone was complaining about no odor oh and an e-book stands for electronic book you can download it from your email i also tuned this guitar just fine,51,125
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar is only for learning it is very cheaply made but works as a teaching tool i only still have the guitar because the bag was cheap and ripped,29,126
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,so i just got this guitar like a month ago and i can honestly say that i love it it came like 2 days after i ordered it which is excellent the only problems i had with thiswas trying to tune it and trying to figure out how to attach the strap i only had one peg for the strap the smell of the guitar which people say it smelt chemical was actually the smell of the wood when it has some kind of preservative so it will not rot overall i am very pleased with this guitar i really want to play it but one of strings popped so i have to wait to get new ones the end k bye,140,127
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,do not buy this guitar i hate this guitar i bought it and the sound is horrible it also has this bad plastic smell witch will not go away the strings are high off the fret do not waste your money it is so not worth it,44,128
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the guitar is good for it is price i received what i paid for the guitar sound great as well I am happy with my purchase,24,129
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,this guitar came in pretty quickly and with all the advertised accessories but the guitar itself is a piece of crap it was manufactured in a way that no matter how much you try and tune it it always sounds off save yourself some grief and invest in a more expensive instrument,52,130
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i was not pleased with this product because it did not come with a cord guide or dot on the instrument for finger placement,24,131
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,we bought this product so my daughter could learn to play not a goodthe guitar is so poorly made that it never got tuned she took it to a guitar place and they told her that it would get untuned as soon as she started playing and so it did the worse 17 i ever spent and i paid 12 in shipping,62,132
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is awful-it can not be tuned thebetween the guitar and the strings is too big not possible to play barre-spend few extra dollars and buy better guitar you will be able to play,35,133

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,the guitar came with all the accessories mentioned in the description and was in new condition however this guitar was made so badly that the frets were in the wrong positions some of them were a few millimeters off meaning that it was impossible to play this guitar without it sounding completely utterly horrible i was not able to play without having earplugs in my ears i did not expect much for such a cheap guitar but you should at least be able to play it this however was painful for my ears invest a couple bucks more,97,135
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i bought this guitar because it was cheap i did review the reviews about it because i knew a cheap guitar was not going to sound like a great guitar but i thought it would be good enough for what i needed it for my biggest problems with it is that it will not stay in tune also you can not tune it against itself using the fifth fret you have to use a tuner even when you use an electronic tuner it still sounds off now if you have a kid who thinks they want to learn to play the guitar and you do not want to spend the money i say it is worth it if they love it you can always spend more of the big bucks later i bought it because i have some people i work with who might very well put a giant hole in it with no warning for that I am ok with it,156,136
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is ok no easy tuner and no e-book as the description how you guys tall about this,22,137
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,a great product for the price i enjoy using it on a daily basis i would recommend this product it is nice for someone who is learning,27,138
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the guitar came with a strap a pick a set of strings a harmonica a pitch pipe and a gig bag however i got the ebook the guitar itself is a great quality sound-wise the strap is very cheap looking and short which does not surprise me considering the price of the whole set,53,139
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,great guitar for learners and the price is unbelievable also was shipped next day well worth money spent might buy another one for grandson,24,140
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,wanted to order a cheap guitar for my little brother in law to start playing on because he got burned at the pawn shop on an electric guitar he spent his hard earned money on knew this one would be smaller but was not prepared for what i got it looks horrible nothing like the picture almost spray painted looking we already covered it in stickers it does play tho good for a toddler to trash not even worth the money for a beginner any older,85,141
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i enjoyed the guitar the paint job is for quality there are noticeable paint marks on the guitar and the strap on guitar does it work you only have one clip at the bottom of the guitar for this crap and the other end of other does not have one,49,142
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,was glad to see that it came just two days after ordering when it said it would take a week nothing was broke or missing except for the ebook which i kind of expected from the other reviews the strap is kind of small but i do not plan on using it anyway all in all it is a very good guitar for the price thanks,64,143
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it is really worth for this price i love the package so i could just start when i received it and the quality is fine,24,144
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar came with everything as advertised and an extra set of strings the guitar is small-ish but that is perfect for my small hands i got it on sale so with he total being 30 including shipping this guitar i worth well over the asking price and i am very satisfied,51,145
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,received the guitar before the estimated delivery date smelt like spray paint but not too strongly a string was broken already so i went to use the replacement strings and the one needed was far too short contacted the seller and they said they would send me new strings at least the ebook was just some pdf file from a completely free website anyone can download the ebook at any point regardless of guitar purchase [ ] the pdf explains that you now own a guitar and it has strings if you touch the strings it will make noises probably the most informative thing ever guitar is not tuned of course best to have someone else tune it for you as the pitch pipe takes practice to actually use not exactly beginner friendly sounds just fine and feels durable,137,146
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i just absolutely loved this guitar but if you are wanting lessons look here one of the best resources for courses is available at [ ] check out this awesome site for guitar players of any levels to get a href [ ] learn guitar tutorials have fun playing,49,147
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the guitar was as pictured and described a beginners guitar the ebook took a bit to reach me but i did get it,23,148
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,first the strings was not tuned if u r a beginer how would you know how to tune them the strings r really thin which means they will pop when you do get it tuned i had so manyand downs with this gutair I am a beginner and i could not do nothing with this gutair all my freinds who have these big nice gutairs said this is a crappy gutair ohh it is falls out of tune in maybe a day or two srry but the only reason i got this gutair is because i did not know if i was going to stick with it now that I am advanced this gutair is for 3 year olds,114,149
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i placed order for a christmas delivery for my son he has been very happy with it and is picking up the guitar better than i expected it has been a very good guitar for learning it was delivered before the promise date which was unexpected due to the fact that it was the week before christmas i would definately buy from them again,64,150
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,to get my order i had to mail them so many times finally i got it but no comment because it is just looks like guitar while i was trying to fit it is string no more commentssssssssssssssss sender may know why i never will never buy any thing from amazoncom again,54,151
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,it was great until i actually put the strings on maybe mine was the weakling of the bunch but the neck and bridge broke when i tuned the guitar well when i professional tuned it with the lightest strings on possible,42,152
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the guitar is great for what it is but i never received the instructional ebook so my granddaughter has not had a full experience with the instrument it came quickly and was packed well,33,153
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,thewas not good like what i thought something wrong with the strings i could not use the,20,154
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,got this for my 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loved it has not had a lot of time to play it yet but my husband who is a guitar player tuned it for him and he started strumming immediately we also got him some cool rock guitar song books so I am sure he will be playing in no time it is nice that it comes with the bag and extra strings because one of the strings broke when my husband was tuning it my husband says it is common for strings to break and it happens all the time when he is playing so this is not a defect or knock on the quality my husband also said that it will sound a little twangy for a little while until the strings are broken in we almost bought a 30 guitar but i am glad we went with the bigger guitar because i think the 30 would have been too small for him and he is not a big child he will be able to play this for much longer than if we had purchased the smaller guitar very good purchase for the price,195,155
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i am realtively new to online shopping and was very pleased with this experience the ease of the transaction the speed of the delivery i shop early and the satisfaction of the product purchased were all outstanding my son was thrilled with his new guitar and happy with everything that came with it hopefully with a proper carrying case we can avoid what happened to his first guitar purchased at an antique shop,73,156
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,decent guitar for a beginner i would suggest changing the strings if you buy this guitar the ones provided are not of good quality with better strings you can get a good sound from it but i experienced some fret buzzing around the 10th and 11th fret on the 6th and 5th but other than that it is something good to buy for a beginner,63,157
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is a toy guitar no real guitar here awful smell no good termination no ebook either sounds terrible my fingers bleed when playing do not stay tuned carefull when buying this awful product yuk,34,158
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,when the product arrived at first glance looked good all items were not in the shippment and come to find out this is not a real guitar it is a toy guitar do not be fooled on thinken you are getting a good deal it is a waste of your money,47,159
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i got my guitar and within the first 20 minutes i had broke the e and b strings while tuning it i just thought it was my inexperience so i took it to an experienced guitar player and the g string would not tune and broke while he tried we used the replacement strings to restring the whole guitar and tuned it but the d string still sounds dead and the g string still will not tune and he said he believes it is because the strings are cheap strings and it needs new better quality strings when we were trying to tune it we were using digital tuners not the pitch pipe that came with the guitar like i said the deal is a great one but not perfect the guitar is a good guitar but be prepared to have to buy better strings soon but do not expect top quality all the way around when only paying 20,159,160
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it arrived just on time and in good condition except that the guitar strings were not tight but it was good because i tightened it myself there was no ebook in it and the guitar had a little marks of dust or paint on it but it was not visible apart from that it was goodthanks,53,161
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is not a full size guitar but a good starter one i bought this for my partner and she loves it,22,162
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,theis pretty decent for the price can not complain the case is pretty cheap feeling but overall not bad,20,163
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,I have got this guitar because it is really cheap and i have always been wanting one but i was really disappointed despite the cost of it it seriously look like a toy-guitar rather than a guitar I am just a beginner but the sound of it is really bad you are going to regret not spending a little more money and buying a real guitar,63,164
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is without a doubt the biggest waste of hard earned that i have ever seen or heard i can not play anything on it have not decided if it is just cheap set of strings or it is just a worthless piece of junk i got it for someone else and imagine my embarrassment when she took it played it and out of it came the most horrible sound quality i have ever heard in my life the smaller jr guitars at walmart for 1200 have a better sound and tone quality again junk just sayin,94,165
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,thisseems to be pretty good for the price my daughter 13 will be using it to take beginning guitar next semester at school her sister has a similarfrom the same company and it is working well so far the only issue i have is the fact that the case had mildew / mold upon arrival i tried to contact the company but they never responded fortunately after washing it by hand and then in the machine i was able to remove the offending substance,85,166
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i expected standard tuning knobs and fret inlays but the guitar i received had folk tuners and no inlays worse than that the guitar is not built properly the open strings can be tuned fine but the frets are not placed correctly and chords are completely out of tune,49,167
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i got this for my friend for christmas and she absolutely loved it,14,168
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,my son loves his guitar it is very durable,9,169
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,does not stay in tune for more than a day,9,170
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,crap do not even buy this it was bowed and it could not even be played i bought it as a starter guitar for my younger brother because i did not want to spend a lot of money if he did not pick it up it was garbage so he never played it bought him a more expensive one do not waste your money here,60,171
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,excellent pedal i buy it to use as expression pedal for line6m5 and works perfectly for wah whammy volume and other crazy effects you can set the minimum level of each parameter and tension it is very comfortable of rugged construction and pedalboard friendly and i could get it for 80 dollars for me is the perfect expression pedal,60,0
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,I have had this on my gigging board for over a year and I am really pleased with it this replaced my eb vice president jr which broke a string during a gig and in general i much prefer the dvp3 sound-wise i do not notice any difference in the swell rate but what i really like is the ability to adjust feel of the pedal and the added durability of not having a string the rubber tread started slipping off the treadle so i pulled it off and replaced it with grip tape maybe it does not look as cool but it is better than having a piece of rubber flapping around the only other thing I have noticed is that it started to squeak so i put a few drops of tri-flow around the center support of the hinge and it has been silent since after 10 years with various eb volume pedals I am not going back,152,1
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i bought this from another source at the same time i bought the boss fv-500h from amazon the boss pedal is huge by comparison the dvp3 is a much better size for me it takes up less floor space and is very stable even although they are both essentially the same pedal component wise to me the dvp3 sounded better with less tone suck of the two this one is my favorite for either volume control or expression I am back to buy another,83,2
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,2.0,negative,the volume change from off to full volume is not very uniform at all for me it functions mostly like an on / off switch you can modify the taper for the expression output but not the volume output also it does not stay heel down by itself so using it to turn the volume completely off is difficult too shame because the pedal build and appearance is good and it looks like it is very sturdy i contacted dunlop about this and no response at all pedal is going in the garbage no more dunlop products for me,96,3
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i tried a morley wah / volume pedal before this one and did not like it this pedal offers a very smooth action and a lot of travel which the morley pedal did not have it is a passive pedal but i have not noticed any tone loss also the tension / resistance of the pedal can be adjusted the pedal seems to be very solid and well-built and seems like it could take a beating it is on the heavy side which i think is a good thing so it will not be sliding around overall I am very satisfied with this pedal and will buy again,101,4
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,this pedal was great but with very little use failed i used it maybe 40 minutes and gently and it was done i would return it but by the time i used it is was past the return period 105 piece of junk,43,5
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,lasted 10 minutes and broke amazingly cheap build quality,9,6
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,be carefull buying this eventually the pot loose the grip so there s no way to keep the pedal in a stopped position the external adjustable screw does not fix that i opened and dissasembled it and let me tell you no replacements nor fixable parts inside so this pedal takes permanent damage the only replacemet aviable is buying another unit,61,7
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,came basically broken the rocker was not strong enough to hold itself up and it had an ear-piercing squeakiness will not buy this again,24,8
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,immediately lost tension on the internal hinge / pivot shaft and lost cc range foot pad just fllopped around and this is not associated with the external adjustable tension screw this is the 2 smaller allen lock bolts inside the pedal that pinch the main hinge shaft have opened twice to tighten those small allen lock bolts and it keeps happening even after reducing the external tension adjust to a minimum poor design have not even gotten to the frail mag strip this things a dog sad because it has a very comfortable throw and very useful features lighter weight and smaller footprint on the board as well against boss fv too bad,110,9
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,i really like the adjustment for tension feature on this pedal it is constructed well has some weight to it and does not feel cheap at all i would definetely get another one if i needed another pedal,37,10
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,seems to do what it need to do i feel like i want to tighten up the tension a bit as it is really almost too easy to make a change with your foot I have only used it for one show so far but I am sure it will perform as expected,50,11
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,nice and smooth feel works great use it with a kemper,11,12
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,this pedal is awesome i still have not used the exp output control i have a triple flashback tc electronics so I am planning on checking it out but overal a great volumne pedal no power required just plug in and go it also it is pedal-down resistance is adjustable which is one of my fav features along with a tuner outout big props,62,13
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,what i expected after reading reviews decent pedal like the size and feel wish it was not passive,17,14
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i like this pedal i did have it cut out on me once i like the possibility of using as an expression pedal that is why i bought it over the silver one it is nice and big it is better than the eb jr that douchebag ambient players use be a man and buy this,56,15
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,great value but they need some weight at the bottom when you extend the boom the stand will fall over i use some small bags of sand as counter weight for the money they work good in my music studio but if your looking for some thing to gig with this is not a good choice,58,0
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,one turn to loosen or tighten for adjustments and it just falls apart in your hands cheap plastic pieces that are brittle and too light of duty of metal for a boom arm i think i could have made a better stand out of pvc pipe some glue and fittings do not buy them if you have to move them anywhere,60,1
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,these are very very light duty stands they might be ok for home or home studio use but not much beyond that they are light flimsy with low grade plastic and metal parts not for any kind of professional application,40,2
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,this was an awesome deal and worked perfectly for us thank you,12,3
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,light light duty not at all what i expected when a mic is placed the stand topples,17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,these are very lightweight intelligently designed stands when i ordered them i thought they were just giving you a choice of mic clips for each stand i did not realize that they were designed to have both clips on simultaneously in different places interesting why not so these are not real heavy-duty i would not let big ed the roadie manhandle them and i would not mount any neumann u87s on them but for spares to have around the studio they are great especially for less than 15 apiece recommended,87,5
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,it is a great purchase it may be of a cheap material but it gives many possibilities of movement,18,6
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,pretty good stands for the money i suppose i would not think they would be rugged enough to withstand multiple transportation scenarios at least not without putting them in a protective case of some kind,34,7
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,it came as expected could be bit more sturdy but makes sense for the cost,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,literally useless these do not even work for my 8 year olds jam room set up total trash all plastic even the screw in parts zero stars,26,9
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,really cheaply made but 4 for the price of one quality stand,12,10
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,wow this is fantastic perfect in every way,8,11
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,i wait and write reviews till I have had time to actually use them i bought these for my daughters at christmas last year who are in a choir and the mic stands are more solid than they appear and inexpensive i needed this type so i could use them in front of the choir but the stands set out to the side so as not to block the view from our audience,72,12
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,these were very flimsy got them for church and our singers said to return them,16,13
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,a real multi tasking microphone stand for two microphone works well for seate acoustic sets,15,14
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,2.0,negative,total waste of money internal parts are brittle plastic and do not hold up even under minimal use,17,15
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,came with a damaged box broken pieces and missing clips I am glad it did although one look at how crappy this thing was made and i was sure glad i had a reason to return it that would not cost me a restocking fee not even close to pro audio,49,16
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,a little on the flimsy side but it does what i need it to do,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,the microphone holders are not big enough for wider mics but works nicely besides that,15,18
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,good occasional use stand not sure it would hold up to constant use plastic pieces look and feel a little on flimsy side,23,19
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,very semple and easy to use i wish if this product would have sound adjustment control,16,0
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,the first one i received the display did not work second one works great easy to use sounds great on playback through headphones,23,1
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,recording to usb drive worked fine for a month and now nothing we use multiple usb drives in rotation at the church to record sermons and songs to mp3 this was the ideal tool for a little over a month totally disappointed,42,2
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,same as gemini rmr-1000 with different lable no operating instructions product states it does not work with above 4 gb sd cards well it is working with a 32 gb scandisk ultra micro sdhc it will record anything you feed it via rca,40,3
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,noisy made high pitched squeeling sound when loading and playing songs cheap is not always a good thing,17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,first of all this is a no frills recorder there is no way to do anything to your recordings other than adjust the volume of input and playback the buttons can be buggy and need pressed quick and hard not held upon booting up i have had the sound be very quiet like the auto gain inside the unit is not on restart fixes this the sound through the headphones has problems on my unit there is interference and other sounds so it is not good as an extra line out for audio playback the recordings do not suffer from this problem however and sound great recorded at 128mp3 sometimes the buttons do not respond and the unit takes a few seconds sometimes up to 10 secs to set up finally it only accepts 4 gb and under sd cards and no sdhc the usb stick seems to handle any size this is not perfect but it is better than the gemini recorder does the job with a little patience,165,5
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,2.0,negative,i can not get it to work with my mixer can not say how well it works because i think i need to update my other equipment,25,6
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,excellent recorder at low cost highly recommend this device,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,very much enjoy thisit does not recognize all usb stock thou sucks but great,16,8
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,works nice but for registration songnames no possebillities,8,9
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,what a piece of junk it records sporadically but never consistently tried to use the recorder to record via a usb stick some tests worked some did not nothing recorded missed several recordings because even although it said it was ready and recording timer was ticking after hitting rec button nothing recorded not an improper wiring issue since some tests worked fine with the audio system no hard copy users manual and no online manual lousy customer support for this product i should have spent a little more and got something that actually works,93,10
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,i got 2 of these and they work great love it and the only thing i do not like about it is it do not have a remote but other then that love it,32,11
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,defective right out of the box would not record on any media recording volume clip indicator always on,18,12
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,the white controller boxes do not seem to be quality i bought 5 of these none worked well enough to be usable you will notice this issue if your lights or a variation of astays light / on when you turn the power off it is like these control boxes are not stopping all the power from going through when in off mode so that is an issue the led strings look good the remotes look good it is just the power / controller white box that does not seem to perform up to standards with 5 sets we tried all combinations to make sure to rule out everything other possible component in failure uniformly it was the white little controller box that seemed to have the issue not sure how to resolve this maybe a better controller will make these use-able,134,0
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,fantastic product great value we have purchased several more sets and will probably buy more in the future,18,1
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,awesome package works flawlessly for a month now,8,2
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,great lights adhesive strip did not work had to buy additional hangers but for the price pretty cool lite set,20,3
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,lights work very well but i have two issues minor issue is that the remote is very weak it only works at half the distance of my tv receiver or satellite remotes major issue is that the power supply connections are so loose they are constantly working themselves apart and have to be pushed back together often unfortunately where i have this installed that is very difficult and in reality should never have to be done,78,4
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,received on time typical chinese instructions in broken english and very fine print have seen similar lights for msrp of 39 and 49 for only 1 meter length remote is necessary but dysfunctional but hey at this price this is a bargain not sure if can daisy chain or not according to instructions no but looking at unit it looks like yes have not tried yet they are bright with adjustable light intensity various colors mostly used for accent / mood lighting up stairwell and behind curtains for nice effects for this price it is a good buy not sure how long they will last,103,5
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,saw this for much higher prices but decided to give this a try directions are typical chinese but pretty simple to operate have to plug in correctly even knowing that i got wrong first time around and there is a line coming out of the white plug in that goes no where has pull tab for battery and takes standard lithium battery easy to find have not figured it all out but it is really pretty coolletting you change colors and pick how you want to operate for mood or christmas lighting clever ledhow long it will last have nobut at price i paid does not make a lot of difference on other sellers saw some adverse comments but so far this is working well will use to replace some of my older christmas lights next season,143,6
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,it is a lot of stuff for 10 it broke soon after turning it on but i was able to fix the defective transistor i am just it was just a fluke the lights work great still not sure what to use them for but fun to play with,48,7
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,got 2 of these and both do not turn off goes into dimming red glow,14,8
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,the leds look and work great however the remote or controller box not sure only allows me to change to 2 colors after about a week of using it the only way to get the other colors is to hope it registers the fade input right now they are stuck on blue also the sticky tape on the back is not the best so plan on something to hold it down could be a great product,75,9
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,just received my replacement of the generic led and like others my two units will not turn off although the colors on the remote actually match the correct colors of the led when on off is red not off the only way to turn off the lights is to unplug the power this unit is the second one with the same problem,62,10
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,i found this on a one day sale for 6 and bought it on impulse they were impressive for 6 but half the strand no longer changes colors and is now stuck on white only i bought the more expensive inateck brand strip and it is much better but for 6 i can not be too mad,55,11
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,lights seam fine but i bought two of these light kits and one controller shorted between the red and green so the red led lit up whenever the green lit up and both power supplies are faulty one never worked and one only works when lights are almost fully dimmed one star because the lights do work,57,12
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,i know these things need fine tuning on the production end control module but for the price and the amazing effect they have i will still go with 5 stars they may not last forever although i have two sets doing some lighting at church and have been for about a year but if you only get a feel for the possibilities with this set it will be worth it,70,13
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,i bought 2 of these one had a section of lights that was partially burnt out would only produce two colors right and neither of the strands shut off all the way i would try a set with a different reciever as it does not work vary good with the remote,51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,like some others mine will not shut off all the way the green stays on after multiple attempts to turn it off and ended up unplugging it,27,15
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,worked great for the first 15 minutes then it failed to respond to commands requested and received a replacement with the same issues receive your credit,26,16
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,looks great but selling these myself and other things i know this could be at a better price point lower,20,17
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,there has no instruction on how to configure thebuttons I am not sure if thisis defective or not but pressing the power off button will not turn off the led strip it just make it switch a very dimmed greenthe light are still on instead also the led strip gets very hot just after about 5 minutes leaving it on steady lit,65,18
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,very inexpensive and worked great these leds are bright but can also be dimmed plan ahead when laying these strips down as there are parts in line with the cord that need to be out of sight,37,19
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,i love these lights and will be ordering lots more to put up in my mancave,16,20
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,great product works as advertised power brick does not get very hot when powering whole string the two plastic eyelets on the white control device broke off when screwing down the first one i thought i just tighten too much but the second one was only tightened until it would not allow the control module to lift up and it too broke off ended up using ultra-strong velcro,66,21
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,the led strip is amazing in terms of light output and programmability however the sticky back is a little weak and the remote range is very lacking 1 or 2 feet at the most still great value for the money,40,22
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,work just as described only downside is the adhesive on the back is not very good would be 5 stars if not for that,24,23
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,works great and gives out good light but not bright white has bluish tint,14,24
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,these light are great for indoor use the lights themselves are waterproof but the control box and power box are not waterproof i placed these around the tops of my kitchen cabinets as accent lighting i suggest if you want them for outdoor use that you buy the 15 foot extension cord that runs from the control box to the lights that way you will have more options as to how to run them,74,25
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,returned them odd colors / not solid full light at one end-no light at the other makes you feel it is going to blow-up it looks so odd may be worh 5 for the plugs,32,26
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,kit came with everything needed except for connectors if you want to cut the strip still going strong today the sticky material used to hold the strip up is not all that great so be prepared to use 3 m tape or something else to supplement the light is bright enough and can be dimmed or brightened up from the remote remote works well feels super cheap but they are all the same i have a few of these from multiple different companies / vendors and they vary very little in design,86,27
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,when i first plugged this in i loved it but the 3 m tape does not stick well at all the jumper wires needed if you want to make turns make horrible connections that short out very easily i spent over 30 to get this mounted properly and then the controller completely quit save your money spend a little more on a higher quality led product and be happy,68,28
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,these are pure garbage one of the power supplies did not even work the adhesive does not stick to anything one slight bend and half of the strips went out straight in the trash,32,29
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,so they do not turn completely off and the battery was almost dead a day after i started using it or so i thought not all the colors that are on the remote display the entire red column does not work for me except when i power off then there has a red glow sticky back needs additional adhesive I am going to leave them in place never change thewhile i look for another controller box,74,30
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i bought these for my wife they are defiantly not noise canceling not do they fit in your hear sound quality is average,23,0
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,pros sound was good construction was decent easy to connect charger cable included cons would not stay in my ear had to push them in so hard that it hurt to wear them and they still fell out they allowed a lot of ambient noise pass-through did not provide much background noise attenuation could not connect them properly to my pc maybe a pc driver issue but do not have the time to mess around with it difficult to switch between bluetooth sources had to manually turn one off to connect to the other ie phone and pc,95,1
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,bad experience with these they connected to my phone via bluetooth just fine but any movement caused them to cut in and out i disconnected and reconnected several times but the same result each time upon arrival one of the ear cushions was missing from the package so i had to scrounge up another one from another set of buds the ear pieces would not stay in place and fell out of my ears constantly i tried different sized cushions but it was the design and/or weight that caused the issue can not recommend these at all,96,2
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i would not purchase these again I have only used them three times and I have experienced problems each time i have static music breaking up even when phone is on my lap and headphones are charged another issue i am having is with the left ear piece the little rubber part which sticks into your ear falls off when not in use i have traded it out with another headphones part but it still seems to not fit i would recommend looking for another brand,84,3
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,in case you only want reviews from people who have actually purchased theI am trying to figure out how to return them never felt the need to do that before one of the reasons that i purchased these headphone was they said they were also for running that is laughable they will not stay in your ears i got so angry at these things that i had to settle down a bit before i wrote this every other set of in ear headphones that i have purchased has has three different cup sizes and i have never had a problem with anything falling out of my ears neither side will stay in i was walking around thei am constructing and the sound went completely away i reached up and both were gone found them about ten feet in back of me maybe if itape them to another pair non-bluetooth,153,4
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,these are not noise canceling the volume is just set at a very high level even at the lowest volume setting on my iphone it is pretty loud i could not raise the volume higher than 25 i had them on for 5 minutes and started to get a headache i like loud music but like the option to lower it to a soft level if needed even the female voice that announces the functions power on power off and more is very loud also the keyboard on my iphone would not function when connected to these earbuds i tested these with my ipad as well same issues with volume and keyboard,112,5
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,worked great when i got it went to recharge it and will not recharge at all,15,6
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,very bad very very bad th worst headphones used,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,the fit is great the price is great but this thing seems to pick up disturbance and drops the signal a little too often listening to music on these speakers reminds me of the days when the cool kids had sony disc players with 5 sec skip protection and had to walk around like ninjas to prevent the music from skipping so long story short it seems to work ok but drops signals a lot also the cable is too long and has a rubberyness to it so it will slightly grip your skin if you turn your head the force of that grip may loosen thefrom your ear so you will have to adjust it often just getting a tie and looping the loose cable will be good enough to prevent this issue I had 100 buy again if the thing did not drop signal so much,148,8
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,they lasted for 8 runs at first songs would skip then it would turn off i thought they were sweatproof apparently they are not,23,9
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,these are extremely uncomfortable in the ear you should look at getting something different,14,10
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,headphones really work great for the price i wear them when i work out and they stay in place,19,11
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i was not happy when i got this product because i was looking to exchange earbuds to remove ones that were on the device because they were too big i contact the seller it took multiple attempts for them to say they do not have them but the orginal product is avertised with plastic earbuds replacements,55,12
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,they get a clear signal nice sound at first i really struggled to keep them in my ear but then i figured out the rubber piece above the ear-bud is supposed to secure into the upper part of your ear since then a great experience for a low cost,49,13
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,the only earbuds that stay in my ears during my workout I am not too concerned with the quality of the sound but it seems to be pretty good i wish they would give you more of a warning when they need to be charged but other than that i love these,51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,I have been really impressed with this headset I have used these working out cycling and on the bus to work they have good range and excellent battery life they have lasted at least 5 hours in one use which is way more than i would expect,44,15
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,works very good for me the battery charge works for about 3 hours it is nice to work in the gym,20,16
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i received the headphones without one of the earbud pads they did send a new set to resolve this issue the headset is comfortable and i liked using it the problem i am having with the headphones is that they lose the bluetooth connection even during a call,48,17
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,the best nc bluetooth headphones for the price notice i did not say the best headphones they do not cancel out much noise and the microphone is not as clear as higher end headphones also the range is pretty limited you do not want to be more than 10 feet from your phone or other device otherwise it will drop the connection that being said i would absolutely purchase these again they are good deal i have a very nice bose pair for flights with a lot of background noise and then this cheap pair for exercising and at the office,97,18
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,headphones stopped working after 40 days which is 10 days after the return policy extremely frustrated would have been decent headphones for the price if they still worked i guess that is why they are cheap,35,19
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,the device will not hold a charge also the proctor is too bulky it keeps falling out of ears with movement,21,20
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,worked great at first but thrn got caught in the rain while running lost volume and none of the controls worked put it into a bag of rice in the sun and controls came back but now every time i sweat too much on a long run the controls on the chord short out and stop working can not even turn them off,61,21
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,no bass the sound quality is poor the fit is uncomfortable i can turn the volume up to maximum and still no bass,23,22
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i realize they are designed a little different from other bluetooth earbuds but these just barely work the sound is good although my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and i can not type anything with them connected they do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help overall i would not recommend them unless you want this very particular style they are just too awkward but are ok for cheap bluetooth earbuds if want better ones I had spend the little be extra to go aup which i plan to do when i can,124,23
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,yes the included ear tips are too big for my ears no these are not audiophile quality fit was improved dramatically after spending about 10 seconds to remove the included tips and replace with some spares i had from another older pair of earphones 15 seconds back in ears and problem solved sound quality is certainly adequate i have not been able to get a tight enough seal to really drown out other sounds and get the deep bass of a good set of in-ear monitors but for walking around cord-free the sound is far better than some I have owned over the years and i have no complaints a few years ago you would have had to spend significant for this sound quality in a cordless headphone for less than 20 they are fantastic i can not comment yet on battery life as they have not died yet after probably about 4 hours of use over a few days pairing is a bit of a pain works fine with my iphone but my laptop seems to think it is a keyboard although it still works,183,24
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i tried it the earphone buds they give you are pretty crappy so you will have to get new ones the batter life is crap so you will have to buy something else eventually or just do not plan on it replacing your current crappy device I am staring at mine right now just sitting there waiting to be thrown away i should not be biased at first it was great i plug them in charged them up almost wrote a great review but now i see them beeping that they have low power 20 times every 5 10 seconds during my music at the gym telling me in some phony voice about battery low it is great when they say power on and power off since it is helpful to know but it is like shut up i hear you the battery is low just be quiet and let me hear my music or my phone call but then they shut off so if you want to keep the battery at full forever then great but if they are used for backup or when you need them headphones buy new earbud covers and have an extra charger cord ready for i dunno whenever you need them battery life is not very good hope that helps,205,25
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,good sound really easy to pair with the iphone 6 sometimes has issues with the volume level although it might be with my phone sometimes the volume is really quiet then i get a text message and it goes to really loud but it does not happen much and I am very happy overall with the headphone comfort and sound,58,26
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,does not stay in your ear uncomfortable and painful to wear sound quality is okay,15,27
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,this is perfect for running and i mean it it perfect it changes my keyboards i do not see predictive words when typing when paired with my phone galaxy s5 after i disconnect it everything goes back to normal i love this wireless headphone bluetooth,45,28
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,wore these on an approximately 3 hour trip on my harley was not uncomfortable and i could hear them just fine over my bike at 70 mph,26,29
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,for the price these are certainly a great deal the sound is clear the reception is good and the noise cancelling is good enough that i was able to hear my music clearly even riding on a motorbike on the highway my only complaint is that they do not stay in my ears they come with multiple earbud sizes and I have tried them all but even the one that fits the best still tends to fall out a little too often but again for the price i can not complain,89,30
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,disappointed it is fine if i stay in the same room but do not go to the next room at this price although what else should i expect you get what you pay for as the old saying goes,37,31
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,awful they fall out constantly and are huge,8,32
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,pros bluetooth setup quick and easy uses standard micro usb cable for charging included cons comes with only one set of earpieces so if they are not a good fit for you you are out of luck sound is mediocre at best volume control is flakey inconsistent they work sometimes but usually do not charging port cover is flimsy and tough to open with a fingernail even with the earpiece fully in your ear the rest of the earphone body sticks out of your ear by nearly an inch i think this is primarily why they will not stay in your ears too much leverage would not recommend poor ergonomics very low quality even for 20,117,33
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,so far these earphones arnt the best their kinda bulky and it is not a clear sound at all the base is not great either also they kinda hurt you are ears after a while but i mean 20 is kinda a lot but i would have rather invested in a better pair anyways good luck,53,34
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,product is garbage for a product that you are supposed to be able to run in i could not even turn my head without falling from position i never write reviews but this was so bad i had to do not get caught up in price thought i was getting good deal at 20 they are not worth 20 cents,57,35
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,this earphones are the best i just got them today and if the earbuds are to big you can change them,21,36
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,good for listening to music not good for watching videos or movies do to delay,15,37
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for cheap quality sound does not get very loud and they slip out of the ears easily when working out,24,38
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i use them riding my bicycle they cut out every time i turn my head,15,39
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,sound great especially for being bluetooth super affordable for workout earphones they stayed in pretty well when i ran but it was a bit bulky on the actual earbuds overall it is a great set of headphones as a backup and for doing activities i will definitely be looking into more bluetooth headphones that would look nicer for more business-like events i love these although i also received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review,78,40
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,these earbuds are pretty comfortable to wear they are very stable in my ears and does not fall out by themselves pairing it through bluetooth was easy and i did not encounter any problems the design of these earbuds are similar to a lot of other bluetooth earbuds i really like the little droplet design the added to them but thescheme is a bit dull for me sound quality on these earbuds are pretty good i do not expect them to be the best since they are bluetooth but these are pretty do able overall pretty good bluetooth headphones i received this in exchange for a honest review,106,41
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,great deal for the price i get about 45hrs of music listening charge,14,42

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,can not beat this kit for the cost files are great nut spacing ruler is great and mine was not sharp like others said the action ruler is a nice laminate cardboard with a really cool scale design on the sides that make it easy to get a good measurement on the string and the string winder actually is two pieces and the end comes off and has a hex for an electric drill so you do not have to manually wind case is great quality with some extra room so you can toss a few more tools in there if you work on your guitars or want to this is a must have,111,3
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,files are worthless i will need to buy another file to complete grinding down the saddle,16,4

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,i asked about the quality before ordering and was honestly let down one of the nut files is improperly marked with 3 - 6 stamped on the handle on one side then stamped opposite on the other side of the handle i messed up a nut before i noticed it was improperly marked the files are of lower quality and I am not sure if they are gauged correctly you get what you pay for so buyer beware,75,6
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,1.0,negative,this kit is a toy not a real luthier tool,10,7
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,pleased with the speed of shipment and the quality ofgreat for the price,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,1.0,negative,poor quality file sizes are misslabeled square corners on files instead of rounded,13,9
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,4.0,positive,this came fast you get what you paid for folks the file faces are numbered so notice that when you try out the files they are different sizes nice case sw,31,10
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,4.0,positive,pretty good set of guitar nut / saddle files for the price the height gauge is nice to have,17,11
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,initial review the wording on the box makes it questionable but once you look at the files it becomes clear that this set is for acoustic guitars not electric guitars the file are definitely not slim enough to file the nut for the 1st 3 strings on en electric guitar nut i will add more once i have used them a bit but i wanted to get that word out there for anyone who thinks this set will work for the great 99 dollar electric guitar kits on sale here stay tooned,93,12
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,exactly what i need to quick small repairs,8,13
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,plastic measure card not marked accurately files are not sized properly and the edges vary a lot not for precision work not for my guitars,27,14

Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these for purposes of skype when gaming microphone 1 was basically dead on arrival would only record the faintest of sound no matter how close i was to microphone or how loud i spoke i spent waaay too much time trying to troubleshoot the problem including double-checking sound card drivers and more before just trying microphone 2 well did not i feel dumb when 2 worked just fine anyway my results with a very limited sample size is equivalent to a coin flip 2 bought i dead 1 works fine 50/50 not good enough for me i would not recommend this product as a side-note i paid for next day shipping on these it took7 days to deliver them to me they changed their delivery date 4 times what a waste not amazons fault i live 9 miles from the biggest socal amazon distribution center,148,1
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4.0,positive,i ended up returning this microphone although it was easy to use and good quality i bought it to add voiceover to videos but i did not hear much difference in quality between using this microphone and just using an app on my iphone,43,2
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,received the microphone just as pictured did just as it says plug in and go fast shipment very satisfied a to the seller,24,3

Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,for the price it is very good before purchasing this one i had bought another 10 microphone that was not worth even that bad quality and broke after six months this one has been far superior use it with skype chatting while playing multiplayer games and basic voice recording stuff my kids use it to record let us play videos and when they play minecraft multiplayer and they love it,67,11
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,I am pretty disappointed with this product i bought this for my child who loves to sing the minute we got it we plugged it in and it does not even work i threw the packaging away so i was not able to return it this microphone was a really big disappointment,49,12
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,2.0,negative,i do not know why every time i try to record with this mic on my mac it does not allow me only on imovie and even in that app it keeps making a weird noise in the back ground it work good for the first 5 mins and then i do not know what happen to it,55,13

Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,this guitar needs new steel strings so it holds it is tune better i contacted customer service with an issue and they took care of it promptly and courteously,28,0
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,i recieved the guitar and it was not what i expected it to be the amp plug was loose there was chipped paint on the neck of the guitar it will not stay tuned for very long and when i recieved it there were fingerprints and smudges all over the body i was not very impressed with this,59,1
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,very disappointing it looked so beautiful in the pics and when i got it i felt like i was a beginner with no respect all over again giving me something that looks like there was no care in making it i thought it was going to be a good deal when i seen it but when it got here this so called new guitar looked like crap like a 8 year old put it together the decal around the sound hole was a poor sticker that is falling off there are dents all over the bottom feels like it was made with plywood from mexico the neck is so thick i swear only basketball players could play it with their big hands the g string buzzes sounds like crap this is the worst deal on here for guitars i would not send my worst enemy here for this guitar,148,2
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,the finish paint the sound and another things are so diferent that i was expecting i do not recoment this guitar for any body really this is a bad product,30,3
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,hi good evening i from venezuela excuse me i like the guitar and i want to buy righ now but i noted that the guitar has some problem in the paint because in the picture has awhite please answer me thank you,43,4
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,bought this for my daughter who wants to learn to play different instruments she is happy with it and plays often,21,5
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,this guitar will not stay in tune i would reccomend it for someone that likes to fix up guitars because the finish is pretty yet even with new strings it will not hold tuning i would not reccomend it for beginners unless the tuning problem could be fixed it is hard to learn to play with a guitar out of tune,59,6
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,cheap very poorly made but for the price i did not expect much so i guess for a beginner is okay,21,7
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,even if you are a beginner do not buy this guitar as soon as i opened the box and saw it i knew it would be a piece of junk the sound is terrible plugged in or not save your money up and get a nicer one not this,47,8
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,toy guitar i thought this guitar was going to be worthy with the shipping and handling cost i could have bought a real worthy used guitar at guitarcenter if it was my guitar i would give you one star however since i bought it for my 10yr old brother and likes it because it is blue i will give you a 2,61,9
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,so i was pretty excited about buying this and although it was cheap it seemed legit however my friend went to replace the strings and realized that it was a nylon string guitar that was sent to me with steel strings of course this bent the neck and rendered the guitar pretty unplayable I had definitely like my forty bucks back,60,10
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,i see a lot of people were expecting a miracle for under 50 i was expecting a very cheap guitar that i could use for learning the basics of hand placement and movement i got exactly what i expected a cheaply made product for a cheap price and it even came with a ton of extras do not expect a 500 - 1000 guitar for 50 expect a 50 guitar and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how much you get for your tiny money,82,11
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,great product for the price strings included are cheaply made definitely recommend purchasing better made strings and a warning to be careful in tuning these cheap ones as they tend to break in the middle and almost took out one of my eyes twice on the same chord electric portion of guitar is made possible by battery within guitar which i did not really care for but for the price it is a great starter electric / acoustic,75,12
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,i am really glad that i purchased this,9,13
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,poorly put togther paint had runs damage above one fret,10,14
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,it did not meet no expectations poor product will never by again and hope noone else does as soon as i tuned it the neck separated emailed did not get no reply no money back no nothing,35,15
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,ok the product arrived with details thanks you,8,16
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,so many things you can do with these brushes i highly recommend them,13,0
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,these brushes are as good as or better than any others i have not as stiff as rods and a bit sturdier than wire brushes these belong in every drummers gig bag,32,1
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,edit unfortunately these have just fallen apart the material that the brushes are made from is brittle and they break off at the point where they leave the handle after maybe 3 hours of use I am down to just 4 bristles on one of them shame because i like the feel but they are just so badly made i have to go to 1-star and definitely do not recommend anyone buy these i like the weight but they are not brilliantly made the plastic caps from the ends fall off and when they are fully extended the ends of the brushes left in the handles rattle pretty bad the handles are a little short too another 1 1/2 would make all the difference but cheap so good enough,125,2
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,the pair i received was very fragile slightly impassioned playing and the rods started falling out,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,bought for fun and one of the plastic strands has already fallen out without much use okay for the price,20,4
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,they are fine brushes as far as performance goes and for not being metal no real complaints there but they do not retract very well at all every time we try to push them back down no matter how carefully it shaves off part of the brushes so that kind of sucks i assume that after a while it will not be so bad but hopefully this does not lessen the life of the brushes otherwise they sound fine and work fine the black and blue colors look cool,86,5
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,decent quality does not sound the same as a metal wire brush but is definitely softer on things such as a cajon or such,23,6
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,they are brushes and they are cheap that is about all i can say,11,7
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,can there be a zero star category these brushes are cheap and terrible they sound awful and arrived bent i do not recommend purchasing them at all,27,8
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,pretty cheap plastic pieces broke off first time i used them but what do you expect for the price,19,9
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,helps keep the noise down for my kids they are definitely a cheap set but that is what i expected for the price my 5 year old loves them,29,10
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,only got one brush when there should have been two the brush did not retract over all very cheaply made and not worth the time or money i returned theand ordered from another company,37,11
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,okay brushes but order only comes with 1 not a pair,11,12
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,the bristles are very weak and break too easily they have an interesting sound but they are not going to last more than a few hours i broke two bristles off in the first five minutes and I am not a heavy hitter,41,13
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,if you need a product to amplifier your music this is it i love the big knob the headphones jack and the 3 usb ports i love it i use it for my computer to play video and music works well for me,43,0
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,this was a very disappointing purchase this unit seems to be the perfect solution for someone who only requires an output interface but it lacks support for any sample rate greater than 48khz or bit rates other than 24-bit it is also very quiet almost 25 30 less volume output than my firewire solo for the price i can not even recommend it as a windows interface as it would be wholly unnecessary it does exactly what is says on the box bu the box does not give you the whole story and neither m-audios website or the amazon description mention the sample and bit rate limitations it is possible that a firmware or drier update could correct these issues but it honestly should not have to i can not give a recommendation to anyone in regards to this device,134,1
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,extremely disappointed with this product i was hoping for a simple usb da with good quality converters and a little control the interface has not program to control parameters and only works at 44khz 24 bit when tried to switch to 48khz 24bit a dialog pops out saying it is not supported it might be ok for music but not recommended for video returning the unit ps i got bunch of driver irql not less or equal m-audio blue screens regardless of what usb port i had it connected,89,2
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,using to connect to krk rokit 8s to my macbook works perfect with ableton the usb hubs on the front allows me to power both of my midi controllers and charge my phone if needed great purchase for a small production studio setup,43,3
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,was kind of hoping for 48k phantom power love the volume control knob great feel portable easy to use great product,21,4
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,works for my set up all i needed it for was a usb dac for my m-audio bx5s,18,5
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,using it as a standard hub for music production and studio monitors works just fine for me,17,6
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,this is my third m-audio piece of gear and my second m-track hub i bought my second one in jan 2017 and now it is june 2018 and this is the third unit to go bad within 18 month period this stuff is garbage I am really tired of m-audio at this point and will never buy again,56,7
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,the usb ports in front stopped working a couple months after i bought it i like the large volume knob but it sucks that i can not use the charging ports,30,8
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,usb ports did not work and low volume for headphones,9,9
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,it worked fine for a few days and then this morning i plugged in my akai mpk mini like i have since i got the device and noticed it was not working properly also i was not getting any sound out of the m-track shortly after this i began to smell electric fire it was coming from the mpk i quickly unplugged the mpk i tried to plug it directly into the computers usb port the mpk was destroyed i decided to see if it was the m-track hub that was faulty so i plugged an old flash drive into it it did the same thing so i quickly unplugged everything it is highly possible i got a bad device but i will still be cautious of m audio gear in the future rip akai mpk mini,134,10
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,i chose this audio interface because all i needed to do was connect a pair of studio monitors in my room kinda wish the volume wheel was clicky but i also kinda like it the way it is the usb hub is wonderful i only wish they were 30 ports maybe in the next model this is not a headphone amp so do not expect crazy loud volume from the headphone out overall very satisfied with performance looks alright usb hub is awesome,82,11
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,excellent piece of equipment well made good sound card i was advised by a studio sound engineer to buy this hub for my particular needs,25,12
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,the potentiometer sends a signal to the left channel first then the right so at low volumes you can only hear out of the left speaker only at about 1/10 of the dial does volume come out of both channels i returned it,43,13
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,was disappointed that it is a soft covered book description failed to state this just assumed it would be a hard cover,21,0
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,this was not what i expected it is very thin and more like a paperback book i was not happy with it and i had bought 2,27,1
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,i cut the edges if the pages shorter so i could put stick-on alphabets on the edges so that my mom copuld more easily find the addresses and phone numbers of family members,33,2

Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,i did not look at dimensions when i purchased it was my fault too small lesson learned,17,6
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,while it does have an eye appealing cover design it is actually very cheaply made no tabs for the various letter sections plain paper cover horribly laid out entry blocks very cheap paper stock will not buy again,38,7
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,small address book for those of us old fashion folks that prefer to keep addresses written down so we do not lose them,22,8
Office_Products,1523309563,4.0,positive,larger than i wanted but nice heavy leave at homebook,10,9
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,ordered two but not what i would have bought if i had see the inside first,16,10
Office_Products,1523309563,5.0,positive,looks great will help me get rid of sticky notes,10,11

Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,i loved the address book just what i wanted but it arrived damaged and could not give it as a gift like i intended will keep it as cost too much to return,33,19
Office_Products,1523309563,1.0,negative,one star for the colorful cover however it is a softcover so when your filling in information you constantly have to be holding done the book using the left side is nearly impossible i picture myself writing out christmas cards and having to hold the book open instead of holding done the cared and envelope puts a damper on it the job for sure not worth the money,67,20
Office_Products,1523309563,2.0,negative,it has no tabs so therefore it is useless to me looks nice although for a book not an address book as such i would be eternally hunting and folding pages over i foresee this becoming a big mess quickly,39,21
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,love this phone if only the caller identification would work it worked fine on day 1 day 2 worked on and off day 3 caller identification not working tried moving the phone to different outlets removing the batteries and putting them back in tried new wire and more the phone works great otherwise loved the caller identification when it was working much larger than most and easy to read oh well,67,0
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason and more this is one of the few corded phones with caller identification and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless and more also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house,99,1
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,i love this phone have three of them easy to read simple to use can see caller identification easily have two on desks one on the wall they have worked for 9 months now,34,2
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling it lasted 5 months you can not get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail buy a nwb phone at your own risk i had to buy another phone at t and it works fine,54,3
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,it is a good phone that does what i need it to do nothing to fancy but just enough for what i needed,22,4
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,this matches the phone i had on my wall all i had to do was use the same hanging bracket hang the phone and go i did not have to remove wall bracket plaster wall and paint,36,5
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this is a good phone that works well the thing to be aware of is the feature buttons like ringer on are all on top if you put the phone on the wall you can not see the buttons and what they are meant for i use the ringer on / off button a lot and i had to write with a marker on the front of the phone where the ringer button is,71,6
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,to me this phone needs to be off the market i have had more problems with each phone i recieved,20,7
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this is my second easytouch ii i like the easy to read caller identification with option to call back once the identification is in the memory large easy to use buttons and speaker feature so i do not have to pick up the receiver if I am working on my pc,49,8
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,phone did not work at all first of all the seller did not send the ac adapter i had to order it then when it came the phone did not work at all the only thing that worked was the caller identification and that is the only reason why i gave it 1 star,54,9
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,easy to set up and works fine would buy again recommended to several of my friends especially those with hearing problems,22,10
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,i bought this so i could have a hard line for a storm i also bought it for the speaker phone and it is terrible this is a great phone if you do not mind holding it up to your ear but for the speaker phone it is horrible,48,11
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well although for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter 120vac to 6v 100ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 aa batteries it does not this one takes 4 aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for thei am sending it back,187,12
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this phone is very good for the price i bought this phone for someone else this is the 2nd time I have bought this phone the first time i bought this phone it was 3999 in staples everyone should have a corded phone as a back up if the power fails or power failure in your home the manufacture has this phone listed as white but the phone is a beige that is the only fault I have found with this phone,79,13
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this phone has no mute button which made it absolutely useless for the application intended i would not recommend if you need this option otherwise the phone was very nice,30,14
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,phone works fine i like the one touch memory buttons they would be better if there was more room to put name on each button,25,15
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,somehow i had the impression that the phone had a message waiting led indicator but what they do not tell you is that the same led is used to indicate missed calls which to me makes the led totally worthless the phone i had before used the same light but it flashed green for missed calls and flashed red if there was a message waiting this phone makes no distinction between the two i had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated i never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting issue because for stuffing the phone back into the box,118,16
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,after shopping around for a standard phone with callerid and no answering machine no power outlet nearby i came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced i like the look and feel of the phone the buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good however when the unit is wall mounted the lcd display is angled down and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it of course that depends on how high your phone jack is and how tall you are i bought two of these phones and both locations i put them were too low to see without crouching down the other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well i do not know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference i could not try that because the unit did not come with an ac adapter plus i have no power outlet close enough to reach so i had to take both phones down and put our 15 year old ones back up,191,17
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,i actually like the phone quite a bit it works pretty well in almost every regard sound quality is very good buttons are easy to find and use and the feature set is pretty good overall a nice phone and a good value however thisis advertised as having 20 number memory which is 10 one touch and 10 two touch i have not been able to get the two touch feature to work i tried calling the customer support number i could never get an answer i was always put on a queue waited for a couple of minutes and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call i left messages and never got a call back i twice tried recalling immediately after getting booted i tried for an hour no joy do not buy northwestern bell phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong,149,18
Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,this is a real lemon the volume does not work properly and distorts the sound the touchtone keys stick even although i have had this phone less than 6 months i would like my money back,36,19
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,the keyboard tray that arrived was not what is pictured not even close the tray itself is plastic flimsy and the bottom edges are sharp which were cutting up my legs until i puttape over the edges i will never buy from this seller again,47,0
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,i liked the size and price of this product it fits a full sized keyboard and mouse / trackball with relative ease the wrist rest was a nice surprise it is not as cheap as i thought it might end up being the mouse pad however is although that is not my gripe with this thing as i said before it is nice and big seems to attach to the underside of a desk rather sturdily also the left and right swivels are nice and make things convenient the tilt works nice the lock to control it works nice as well it slides in to tuck away completely as long as you install it far enough back this thing is wide and can be very long when pulled out completely all good traits in my book the only downside to this product is that it hinges all it is support in the middle of the tray making the platform quite wobbly it does not feel weak or unstable just wobbly other than that it is a fantastic product for the price if i could give it 4 and a half stars i would,185,1
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,purchased thiswith the hope that it was a quality piece you get what you pay for the keyboard tray is plastic a feature which was not mentioned in the description i will give them credit as they did say the tray was modular very misleading the unit is flimsy and unstable that is the tray moves quit a bit when you type not good if you are a touch typist my recommendation is to purchase a more expensive unit from another vendor you can not trust a company who will employ misleading descriptions,93,2
Office_Products,B00009U175,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get this product now that i have it installed not so much in order to fit the keyboard and mouse on the tray it makes it wobble a lot when you type the entire tray leans to the left it is not as stable as i hoped it would be i am going to look for a replacement and probably return this one,68,3
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,installed on a small corner desk and having been using since it arrived holding up so well,17,4
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,very well built will most likely outlast me lots of steel little plastic,13,5
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,our ito has so much stuff on his work area that finding his keyboard was a real chore we made him install it himself he got it on the right way the first time that is saying something for the instructions just kidding it is easy to install,46,6
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,overall quality is decent two factors keep it from getting 5 stars 1 there is bit of vibration when i type in this regards it is much better than the fellows keyboard tray it is replacing but it is not as solid as my workstation at work hard to characterize the actual amount of bounce suffice to say i can live with it but it is not optimal 2 there are two width settings basically comes with three plastic squares and you can use 2 or 3 of them i did not have quite enough space for 3 so i ended up using just two might have been nice to have more options 3 the left and right end caps of the keyboard tray are just pressure fit they are not screwed together will have to see how long they hold up meanwhile i will try not to fidget with them,153,7
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,apporximately 28 inches usable width using all 3 planks apporximately 185 inches using 2 planks apporximately 95 inches usable space from the front of the shelf to the far end this includes a slightly lowered area where the wrist rest s would be inserted beyond that distance there are cord guides cut into the planks on the back that are appoximately 025 inch round followed by a slightly raised backto prevent things from getting pushed over the shelf the height and tilt adjustment are released and locked by a single handle the keyboard tray may have a tendency to retreat downwards slightly for people with firm typing pressure or if the track was not attached to the desk securely the track may need to be installed with it is front apporximately 4 inches behind the front of the desk to allow the keyboard tray to cross behind the front of the desk when pushed straight in although this may vary with the selected tray height,165,8
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,this platform utilizes a strong and stable platform arm i had a need to fit a keyboard under a narrower-than-usual desk space and the regular under-desk keyboard trays with support guide channels located on the outside were all simply too wide this design utilizes a central arm think crane boom arm that connects to a steel sub tray i threw out the main plastic tray and made one of wood it is strong stable versatile and fits my needs to be recommended especially for smaller desk openings it was a bit of a fuss to locate the support arm in it is front-to-back orientation that is when the tray is slid under the desk one wants it to disappear entirely under the desk conversely when one pulls the tray / keyboard out from under the desk one wants it to fully extend out for effective use not have a portion yet remaining under the desk however no big deal,156,9
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,the keyboard tray is a little bit bouncy it lacks structure but it is sufficient for my daily use at work,22,10
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,all the hardware is missing for thishow the he shall am i supposed to put it together now i have to go find all the differnet sized screws spend more money and waste time,35,11
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,after putting the tray together to attach to the desk it would not angle down like the picture it only went in straight so it did not fit what i needed pretty flimsy if you used all three panels,39,12
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,i installed this keyboard platform to a secure table but the platform itself shakes / wobbles / bounces i had to wedge a thick book between the platform and table so that the platform would be somewhat stable i would not recommend purchasing this,41,13
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,i have gone through 2 plastic kensington keyboard trays in as many months not only do the screws fall out i just read that using super glue will help this but the screw sleeves on the tray are plastic and just crumble apart terrible product and what a pain to have to remount another one after already having this thing attached to the underside of the desk do it right the first time and buy a different brand,78,14
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,easy installation plastic keyboard / mouse tray foam wrist pad for keyboard does not adhere to keyboard tray and is a little larger than the slot that is cut in the tray metal bar that is attached to bottom of tray during installation if you are using the extra plastic tray extension for your mouse be aware that the tray can be sensitive to pressure as the metal bar does not extend across the entire length of the tray overall i have been pleased with this product when using the mouse you just do not want to put much pressure on the tray it does not feel like it will break just bends down a little,112,15
Office_Products,B00009U175,4.0,positive,the kensington underdesk adjustable keyboard k60067 works well the installation directions are vague and not well written the product is well constructed and despite the poor directions easy to put together it takes two people to mount the under desk bracket easily however one person could do it the tray is long and requires a large desk opening note the dimensions when ordering overall very pleased with the product,69,16
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,the quality and finish of thewas better than i thought it might be it was easy to install and works great i would buy anotherfrom this company thanks amazon for good merchandise,36,17
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,i used this keyboard tray to replace one that came with our desk the old one had metal slides and hangers on the edges of a wooden tray the corners were sharp and would catch and tear my pants legs and desk chair this one is durable plastic and it is supported by a central slide arm i no longer have the catching problem in addition i can move the kensington tray to the most comfortable height and angle,78,18
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,it is sturdy and just fits in the space between the drawers on either side of my desk slides easily in and out so i can get it out of the way when not using the computer mounting instructions did not say how far from the deskto place the bracket i got it wrong the first time otherwise installation was easy,62,19
Office_Products,B00009U175,2.0,negative,i was expecting this keyboard tray to be more adjustable and not so flimsy i am still getting used to it but so far i am not very pleased with it is performance,32,20
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,looks great nice and big bounces with each and every keystroke bought two both of us quit using it within a couple of weeks it is just not sturdy since it is only attached at one point which is in the middle,39,21
Office_Products,B00009U175,1.0,negative,if you are looking for a quality keyboard tray keep looking although i was pleased that the support bar and articulating arm were metal the tray itself is plastic it is a fairly sturdy plastic however the tray bounces up and down when you attempt to type do not pay more than 30 for this thing you would be better off making one yourself I am currently trying to return thisto the seller not amazon and I am having difficulty getting my money back i certainly do not want a replacement issued i do not want it at all definitely keep looking for a higher quality keyboard tray kensington has some nicer more expensive trays but after this one I am leery to buy a tray from them again my advice would be to look at the bush articulating keyboard tray still on the expensive side but appears to be of better quality,148,22
Office_Products,B00009U175,5.0,positive,first a response about the hazlewood review that text should be added to the seller review the fact that the product is not the same pictured is not appropriate as the product review it is just that the seller shipped the wrong product duh anyway regarding the product itself i use this every day it is well made and sturdy i can put significant weight on it fully resting my arm on it and it fully supports it easily slides in and out from under the desk the slide mechanism is made of thick gauge metal,95,23
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,this is my first laser printer and at first i was very happy with it then the honeymoon ended first of all the toner cartridge is fitted with a smart chip so you can not refill it yourself this is in the opinion of many an illegal practice as it prevents you from using a third-party toner refill note that the 1250w previous model does not have this feature so you may be better off with that one do not ever try to use the duplex printing feature print on both sides of the 1350w if your document ends with an odd-numbered page the resulting output is misnumbered also do not do anything on your computer concurrently with printing as the driver has a very short attention span and forgets which page it is printing many one-sided pages emerge smudged on the reverse side paper feeding is fair but occasionally the printer stops with a jam message you must open the cover and look for a sheet of paper jammed inside but you will not find one honestly forget minolta and look elsewhere for real,184,0
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,warning this is a gdi printer therefore you can not set this printer to work on a home network using dedicated tcp / ip print servers that is d-link dp-301p linksys etherfast print servers and more as a gdi printer it does not have a builtin command processor in other words it is a host based printer relying on your pcs processor as the brains to process print jobs i made this mistake be forewarned do not buy this product if you wish to use it on a home network,88,1
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,this was a great printer as far as print quality and speed but what minolta does not tell you in advance is that if you either refill the cartridge or use a non-new or non-factory cartridge the printer goes into deep cleaning mode permanently while printing and slows down to about 6ppm it will not go back up to regular speed unless you install a new minolta cartridge this of course is a completely bogus excuse for forcing you to buy minolta toner which costs 130 i called tech support to confirm that there was no workaround and the woman i spoke with had received 4 complaints that morning on that issue so i sent it back and bought a samsung ml-1710 which although a little bit slower 17ppm instead of 21 can use any toner and seems like an excellent little printer,141,2
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,I have worked in a print shop with lots of high end laser printers and i have to say that the low price of this little thing had me thinking twice toner seemes reasonable to replace i print 50 to 500 pages at a time at home and jet printers were killing me for b w printing you can not do anything but be surprised at the quality and speed clear crisp even with a photo was a bit confused at the instructions for putting in drivers but worked it out easily hooked up quick and i was off and running in 10 minutes reasonable all around could not be happier,106,3
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,i work at an office supply retail store where i sell printers all day long we ran a sale for this printer for 65 and for the price i could not pass on it what other reviewers have said about the page limits is correct it will slow down when the counter has reached the page limit however if your cartridge drum and toner is in good condition you can very easily find replacement chips and a bottle of toner at any online auction site i got a 6000 page chip with toner for a total of 22 after shipping so printing with this is almost free about 1/3 of a cent per page in toner costs the quality is not the best on the black and white laser market but for just a basic laser printer it does the job well,140,4
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,a cnet reviewer tested this and discovered that it is output tray could only handle 10 pages and then the pages went everywhere i wish i had known that i would never have bought it consider this it prints 21 pages per minute so you can only leave the printer for 30 seconds before you are in deep do-do and that is when the output tray is still on the printer mine broke in the first week and you can not repair it,80,5
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,i am using this printer for more than a year and so far seen no issues ppm is excellent i would hight recommend this printer,25,6
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i hate this printer it tells you the cartridge is low when it is not and the paper guide never stays on so i have to take a page off one at a time i can never leave this printer unattended,40,7
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,the printer installed fine under windows xp and small text looks ok but pictures and large text are very streaky pages often print a little crooked even although the paper looks aligned ok in the feed chute when it prints it almost always feeds in extra sheets no matter what type of paper i use and this often leads to jams on documents over 5 - 6 pages or so it will dump paper eveywhere because the receive tray is so poorly designed does not matter how i adjust it not to mention the toner limit of 1500 pages and the new toner replacement for 6k pages costs as much as the printer i made a big mistake buying this printer and will buy a different make once the toner runs out konica-minolta should be ashamed for creating such a low quality printer,141,8
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,although the printer requirements list windows98se as the minimum oldest operating system this printer will install and work just fine in windows95 if you are using a parallel port lpt1 the windows98se or newer requirement comes in if you are going to use usb i bought this for my sisters older system that she just uses for e-mail and some web surfing look around for an active rebate that cuts the price nearly in half,75,9
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,i got around installing the annoying software by installing it using the windows printer installer it will ask for a file location goto the driver directory on the cd find your language and windows version and select the only file that shows up only the printer driver is installed no other popups or crap is installed on my pc it is a fast printer and great for personal use,69,10
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,i purchased this printer through an office supply store and am quite unimpressed with it is output the printer will suddenly start giving errors such as fatal laser unit error causing the printer to sieze and need to be restarted and this was only after 10 months of light usage a total of 2700 pages were printed from it the toner cartridge and it is connection can at times also be a bit faulty in that it uses the toner despite being on save mode like a sieve just not a good investment overall,92,11
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,the printer worked well for a short time after the toner was empty i tried using a guaranteed remanufactured toner refill it did not work very well so i tried another guaranteed toner refill i refused to pay more for a toner cartridge than the printer cost the second toner smeared everywhere and did not print a new konica-minolta cartridge did not fix the problem and konica minolta refused to service the unit even although it was under warranty save your money,79,12
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,5.0,positive,I have had this printer for a few months and it has been flawless in operation the sheets coming out of the printer did tend to fall out like another reviewer said until i figured out that the support for the outbound pages was not fully extended the printer status message does appear on start-up but it is a very minor irritation other than that it is a gem i just refilled the toner cartridge with a generic refill for about 20 and it works ok the internal chip has hit it is limit and the printer is now operating at 6 ppm which is ok for my limited home use 6000 page aftermarket chips are available now for about 10 to correct this they are easy to change so if you are willing to do a little work toner can be pretty cheap,140,13
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,2.0,negative,so I have been using the printer on and off for personal use i estimate i have printed about 200 pages of items the last print out was fine no fainting of ink and and more that would hint that the toner was low but minolta does not care about that it sets it is toners to stop working and gives an error message first of all the error message is of no help you need to research what it means via the website as for the online status bar it does not tell you anything except there is a communication issue argh what a ripoff to summarize pros prints well cons status page worthless and confusing error message confusing and toner set up is a rip off,123,14
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i wish amazon gave the reviewer a no star option i appreciate the speedy printing of thisbut that is all also that is not saying much since it was my first new printer in several years and i had missed several generations of speed first problem i find that the top paper-holder that is suposed to keep the pages in order while they come out does not pages end up falling over the front of the front of the machine so that you have to pay extra close attention to make sure you catch all of them and that they are in order bigger problem is that it jams a lot and it is very difficult to pull the paper s out it has a vice-grip on the sheets so that you end up tugging and wripping the paper then the area where the tornis is too small to fit fingers into to manipulate there are not enough removeable parts to aid in paper extraction do not biu tjos [ romter i think it is an example of you usually get what you pay for,184,15
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,I shall get right to the point the printer is going to cost you a bundle to replace the carterage which will cost about 80 after a few months it jams a lot do not make the mistake i made and buy it from staples on sale for 99 your better off buying a dell printer for 200 also the paper tray is outside and jams a lot i got so upset that i took this printer lifted it up and threw it to the ground and broke it after it kept on jamming again and again for my business i have a dell printer it almost never jams do not be cheap and stay away from this piece of garbage,118,16
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,i bought this printer about a month ago at staples for about 100 dollars it worked fine at first good print quality but it soon began misfeeding papers this thing is pretty tenacious about holding on to stuck papers so removal means shredding into tiny pieces from several angles and hoping that you will not miss any and that you do not get burned a few days ago after several paper jams in a row it froze up it is still frozen i use this for my work and now I am stuck just like the papers the machine keeps eating my previous printer was a hewlett-packard laserjet 1100 and i never had a single problem with it during the years i used it not one paper jam ever nada it was not compatible with my new laptop unfortunately to sum up please buy a different printer,141,17
Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,4.0,positive,setup is okay printer instalation is fairly easy if you have multiple usb ports that is usb001usb002 be careful to select correct one printer is very fast and quality on text is good have not tried graphics yet toner saver mode prints to light to be of much use printer is slightly noisy because of constant runnning fan suggest leaveing it off when not in use i paid less than 100 for it at that price it is great if your paying over 12000 go with the brother 1440,86,18

Office_Products,B000238C2S,4.0,positive,i am happy with this purchase what a cute retro phone i am a bit diappointed in the background noise slight static slight buzzing when talking on this phone the noise is not loud enough to ruin a conversation,39,1
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2.0,negative,i bought this phone for my retro-basment it worked about 6 - 9 months and then stopped i replaced the cord with no avail i paid 60 for it it is a piece of junk however it does look good,38,2
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2.0,negative,i bought the crosley phone and the crosley wall phone they look good and i like the ring but they are cumbersome to use for phone calls and the sound quality is terrible these phones are good for nostalgia and looks not for use,44,3
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5.0,positive,this was just what my grandson wanted for his birthday and he loved it it looks like the old phones but with a shiny chrome finish just like the picture it worked well,33,4

Office_Products,B000238C2S,4.0,positive,this phone is sooo cool our kids think it is super cool and it is a nice land line phone to sit out the ringer is not that loud sometimes you can hear a little echo all in all i would recommend it can not believe it costs this much although,49,6
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4.0,positive,good value looks just right from the photos ringer is very period but not loud and jarring would buy again,20,7
Office_Products,B000238C2S,4.0,positive,i liked the phone enough that i am buying my second and why do i need a second you ask well that is because the cradle holding the phone and serves as the line on / off mechanism just broke without doing anything to it the cradle fell apart because the plastic yes plastic piece rod connecting the cradle to the phones interior decided to snap off all by it is lonesome so while the exterior appears quite sturdy the interior does not seem to have the same apparent durability that being said I am buying another one because this one lasted about 5 years there are not any other really nice phones stylistically speaking and it did serve well while it lasted i would like a longer cord but i do not think that is available,128,8
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2.0,negative,this was more or less what i expected the brushed chrome looking surface came slightly scratched in a couple of places a fingerprint magnet of course but works well and looks good my one real complaint is that while the sound is loud enough on voice calls i wish there were a way to jack the sound up slightly update failed after a little over one year buttons simply stopped working very odd and it is now useless,77,9
Office_Products,B000238C2S,2.0,negative,was very excited to find a replica of an old fashion phone when i rceived the first one it did not work returned for a second if I had not been so worried that the first did not work i would have noticed how cheaply made it was and how fake looking the brushed chrome finish looked sent the second back also would not recommend,64,10
Office_Products,B000238C2S,5.0,positive,my cousin asked for this as a wedding gift i have one in my home too and like it very much the service was fast and accurate,27,11
Office_Products,B000238C2S,1.0,negative,the phone is terrible it lasted one week and broke i would tell anyone not to but it go elsewhere,20,12
Office_Products,B000238C2S,1.0,negative,theis not solid metal it is plastic with chrome finishing for it is price i would expect a better qualitymade in the united states and not in china ringer does not sound as loud as a vintage phone would ring do not buy it it is a waste of money,50,13
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,i would not buy thisagain there is no screws to hold the shelf together only pegs that you have to glue in and it was the worse thing ever that i had to put together not happy with it at all,43,0
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,it can be picked up at staples store but around 50 or above it is light and stable i am satisfied,20,1
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,i ordered this sorter and it arrived in a little flat box what the website does not tell you is that it comes completely unassembled and they send you about a dozen wooden pegs and a little tube of glue and a bunch of teeny tiny nails to hammer on the very flimsy cardboard backing i decided to ship it back it was not worth my time and effort to go through this for such a piece of junk i will say that the lady i spoke with at amazon was very sweet and kind and treated me very nicely through the whole phone call but amazon needs to let folks know that thisneeds a ton of assembly,119,2
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,for the price of thisi was disappointed to find that the shelves were made out of cardboard not what i was expecting for the price,27,3
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,4.0,positive,i ordered this for my boss so that we can use this in our copy room,16,4
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,it would have been more cost effective to purchase the all cardboard one sold at staples,16,5
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,we use these at work and i knew that this would be just what i was looking for great for keeping things separated at first they may seem flimsy but after you get it together and let it sit it becomes very sturdy it really worked out well for what i needed very very pleased and it was shipped very fast,61,6
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,the dividers were made out of very thin cardboard as we were putting this together the flakeword mailbox cracked and i could not even use it very disappointed in this product for the amount of money instead i bought a cardboard mailbox for 800 and it is made much better do not buy this product,53,7
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,i really like this product it has only one drawback and that is the glue that comes with it it is inadequate in amount in it is ability to dry quickly and in it is bonding power i have a lot of experience in these boxes by fellowes because I have purchased many of them over the years for the resource room where i work with students who have learning disabilities i got two 24 compartment sorters and had the same problem but the good news is that it is fixable all you have to do is purchase an epoxy glue and you will find that it bonds quickly securely and you have enough of it to go around i also recommend driving 2 small nails into each end of the sorter to strengthen it while the epoxy sets up with those two caveats this is a great product and well worth the money get the epoxy and the nails or you shall be wishing you had not ignored this caveat,165,8
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,2.0,negative,the shelves are cardboard the thing comes in parts that get put together with glue and thedoes not match the picture looks like something out of the 70s,28,9
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,thewas broken in two and had been used and returned the pre drilled holes had been srewed into them and broken on the sides of the holes so you could clearly see that someone had tried to assemble it and must have returned it,47,10
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,1.0,negative,the shelf broke before we even had it assembled the shelves are made of cardboard not wood or even laminate very disapppointed do not buy this one,26,11
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,purchased this for my classroom it is very helpful and easier to keep things better organized this is the secound one I have bought and it is for me the first one i got i use as my students mailboxes and they empty them at the end of the day before going home,52,12
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,5.0,positive,I am a teacher and handling paper is always a chore with this product my students can turn in their papers in alphabetical order which reduces my paper-handling tasks substantially,29,13
Office_Products,B0006HXL7G,4.0,positive,i got thefellowes 25400 12-section compartment sorter melamine laminated medium oak laughing out loud medium oak not full oak i was thinking it was all wood it is not the shelves are cardboard however it is a vary nice cardboard and was vary strong with the plastic supports on front of the horizontal card board shelves the assembly was some what ez for me but i am good at that all in all it is strong after assembly and looks good once you get past the vary nice looking cardboard the price is also the lowest you can get and not get something that is made of all cardboard,107,14
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I have had the printer for two weeks I am in the process of printing invitations and have gone through two ink cartriges of bothand black i am priting only about 40 cards on both sides yet i used up the ink cartridges in one sitting i did not even finish rinting them at over twenty dollar each it is not a cheap printer to use the low price of the printer does not make up for the high cost of running it,81,0
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,mine has lasted longer than any printer i have ever had they all seem to get clogged eventually but not this one works great does not need ink as often as others say nut it is not an office printer just for casual usage mine last more than 8 monthsyup,48,1
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,i got this printer handed down from my mom i will have to say it is a good little all-in-one printer i would not say it is the fastest printer in the world but for my needs it works fine for being a home printer the scanner is really good and has clear crisp images once again hp never ceases to amaze me i would buy again,64,2
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i have had this printer for a few years now and am very happy with it for the 80 or so paid for it and myself and two teenage boys using it it has worked great for all our needs pictures school papers copies and more as for the ink i always get the refills from cartridge world where i can get both for under 20 and they usually last a few months,72,3
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i had this printer for about 1 1/2 years only and it already broke down i was never happy with the software it comes with it is cumbersome overloads your computer with heavy code that is unnecessary freezes all the time and takes a whole lot of time to install and i have a decent 18ghz cpu 1 gb ram computer i just wanted something that allows you to scan and print this is my 2nd hp printer first one was also a multifunctional and was also frustrated with the software i decided to go for another hp to give them another chance but now I am convinced will never buy a hp again,110,4
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i purchased my hp 1410 a few days ago and i am delighted with it i owned an hp 1210 a few years ago and kept it until i wore it out and really liked it so i got the next best thing i like it because the computer is not needed to just make text copies or printing pictures for the money i do not think one can find a better little printer and it does not take up much desk space at all i am so glad i found it and at a less expensive price regards hl ragan greenville texas,102,5
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I have had the printer for some time now and i agree with everyone on here who mentioned how fast the ink goes in bothblack but what really makes me mad is that the printer jammed one time and now it is busted when i went to print in sucked in all the paper and now it does not work thanks for making this in china like everything else that is made there it is junk,73,6
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,when the cartridges are replaced the machine automatically runs a test page fair enough however for some time now it runs the test page every time it is turned on on tech assistance web sites many others report the same problem forget hp tech support this machine is a cartridge-eater avoid,51,7
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,everything is designed to be an inconvenience every time you turn it on a full page test print is done and wastes ink it prints horribly fails consistently and is awkward to use in every respect it jams and does not feed correctly print processes will hang endlessly stay away no matter what,52,8
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,a printer is a printer i am more impressed with the editing of scanned pictures i scanned pictures from 20 years ago and they look like new pictures the image editting software is easy to use i quit using the software that came with my computer and the software that came with my camera i only use hps software now,60,9
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i bought this printer around mid 2005 it worked well printing and scanning my usage is very low i print a few pages a month and maybe scan a few pages a month some time ago the scanner just stopped working all scanned pages came blank i tried to contact hp support but they could not fix it concluding that i should exchange my all-in-one with a new one i bought an hp because i thought it would be a relable printer for a long time now i am stuck with an all-in-one that can print and not scan,102,10
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i have had this piece of garbage for over a year shame on me for keeping it you get what you pay for noisiest clanking and banging back and forth i have used more ink just resetting this so called consumer best buy just try and print out an envelope i have tried to allign after each new cartridge and i get error cartridge stuck or page did not finish printing i hope this machine is outdated and would not recommend this to anyone save the money frustrated in jersey,84,11
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,i have nothing negative to say about this printer it works perfectly and i have had no problems it is quiet and much quicker than my last printer so i am happy my ink runs out fast but that is because my 8 year old seems to think she has to print everything she sees [ ] just wanted to pass this info because i am sure there is someone out there that appreciates saving money as much as i do,80,12
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is easy to set up and use for the person who uses it every now and then,19,13
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the psc 1410 is simple and easy to use but it has the smallest capacity 5 ml print cartridges I have ever seen be prepared to buy new ink cartridges every week,34,14
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,i have not been having any trouble actually using the printer however it goes through ink very quickly the hp site reckons you will get apporximately 150 pages but i do not think it is anywhere near that i would be surprised if you get through 50 pages before running out of ink I am referring to black ink i try not to use the colour too much but it appears to be running out quite fast too if you want a printer that you can use fairly often say 10 pages per week then i would not recommend this,98,15
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I am not sure what to say about this it has been a very frustrating product for me after every page i print i get two errors one says that the ink cartridge cradle can not move and the other error says paper jam the paper i have in the tray is not jammed in i have looked repeatedly for any obstruction i even shined a flashlight inside and i am baffled as to what is causing the error no other printer has given me this much frustration i have sought help and even my sisters husband computer repair is his specialty is confused as to what the problem is i would not recommend this printer for anyone,116,16
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviewers comments about the ink cartridges hp has totally scammed their customers by putting so little ink in the cartridges required for this printer I have had this printer about six months and I have already spent more than the cost of the printer on ink and it needs more again my last printer was from hp and i was happy with it i got totally burned on this one guess what brand my next printer will not be,81,17
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,it is very simple to print in black and white and save theink for when you really want to use it pull out theink cartridge when you hit print you will have one button to push to tell the printer to print anyway and that is all there is to it since i print many pages of college level papers i find this printer to be so good that I am ordering a second one i broke the first ones glass by knocking a tv table into it but it still works the cartridges last a long time a person with no technology know-how whatsoever can use it me i admit it and the person who really knows computers will love it too i can not speak highly enough of the quality of the print and photographic work and the cartridges are available everywhere i got a free dell printer with my laptop but i want another hp also i can copy pages from books since the top can accomodate thick hardcover books,172,18
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,past inkjet printer died and i needed a new one fast and at a low price this fit the bill plus i could get rid of my old scanner to boot it seems to be printing and scaning fine and quility is good have not had it long enough to use all the options yet i have had it long enough to find so far the only draw back ink the cost of cartridges are a little steep,77,19
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,I have been using this multi-purpose printer for the past 6 months and i have not had any problems with it yet the print quality is good and scanning is decent but not as quick as some stand alone scanners,38,20
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is so good it has never let me down it has great graphic quality and will look just like the original if you scan,26,21
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the printer is not more than an ordniary inkjet and they changed the ink cartridge size to very small ones so you keep buying them it seems but the worst part of this printer is the software that goes with it if you want to install all the features be ready to let go of 780 mb of space that has to be bloatware incompetent programming if you choose the light version you will only need 384 mb of disk space how can this be i regret having bought this hp printer and it will be my last from them,96,22
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i got this printer actually the hp 1401 from walmart for 49 bucks a couple of weeks ago when i went on maternity leave since then i have printed over 100 christmas letters 4 lost dog posters including large pictures printed return address labels with graphics scanned my medical release from my doctor and emailed it to my work and printed tons of recipes this thing does it all i bought an extra ink cartridge under 15 bucks and still have not needed it great buy,85,23
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,this was a great buy for an all in one device i needed something at a decent price that could copy scan and print this was definitely it it came quicker than expected in the mail and it prints off copies really fast hooking it up was very easy too i recommend this for anyone looking into all-in-ones,58,24
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,I am a college student and i mainly use this printer to print out documents and photos so far so good i love the fact that this printer is very compact it is not like those humongous all-in-ones that not only are heavy but take up a lot of space this printer is as wide and as light as a regular desktop and prints pretty quickly i really love it i have absolutely no complaints,73,25
Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,nice to have it all together in one package i will be out of luck if it fails service was excellent from amazon don maxwell,25,26
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,i was skeptical because of the price but I have been using both off an on for weeks now and have had no issues with either,25,0
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,i received the ink cartridges and the ink was beautiful for maybe 2 weeks and then thefaded to green and yellow and the black became grey striped i only printed maybe 4 - 5 pages and it started messing up i missed the note that is was re-manufactured i have been trying to call the company so that i can get a refund and i have left several messages but they have not returned my call do not purchase this ink cartridges from this company i want a refund,89,1
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,this product is certainly priced right for the remanufactured cartridge market but the quality of the ink transfer is a problem the best description of the issue is that for example with a laser printer if the toner is not fused to the paper it smears badly and in some cases can be wiped completely off the page with as much as a puff of breath this product is an inkjetthat does not require fusing since it is actually ink but even after a couple hundred pages having been printed the ink still smudges and is uneven btw all tests have been performed on the dell printer for which the cartridges are intended without any failures the alignment and nozzles are aok as well,126,2
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,they were either clogged or dried out or something they did not work nothing i did would fix them i installed them very carefully and followed the instructions would have been better off buying new ones,35,3
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,the remanufactered toner cartridges came in as expected they work great in my dell printer thanks,16,4
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,i ordered a set of dell ink cartridges from eforcity in january and when i received them thecartridge only printed in red and the black cartridge lasted for 2 pages of printing i was very dissapointed as i have ordered these same cartridges from amazon several times and they were great it took me 4 months before eforcity returned my money to me this is not good customer service i told amazon that i would never use their company again but my daughter changed my mind i can not blame amazon for one bad experience with a company so i am trying again through another amazon company to get my cartridgesas long as the cartridges do not come from eforcity i will try one more time,127,5
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,not a drop from either theor black and white huge waste of money and time,18,6
Office_Products,B000BUY032,1.0,negative,everything looked good when i opened the box however after installation in dell 720 printer the black cartridge would not work correctily i bought two sets for these and neither of the black worked theworked just fine do not know if i just got bad cartridges,47,7
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,those dell to529 and to530 - 2pack-blackink cartridges that i has ordered only used for 4 pages copies and than all the lnk is gone and fainted can not come up and shown up any works on paper those inks can not be use any more totally unused therefore i rated idont like it,55,8
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,it was certainly much cheaper to buy these from amazon than dell but i have to say that the ink takes longer to dry once it is printed out it smears even if just another piece of paper prints out on top of it i will still order it again although it is fine in every other aspect,57,9
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,very pleased with thecartridge however the black cartridge has streaks in the printing i cleaned it according to the printers instructions several times but this made no difference anything i try to print in black is streaked and unreadable so i am displeased with this product because of this flaw,52,10
Office_Products,B000BUY032,4.0,positive,thecartridge was good with true colors the black cartridge printed ok i would recommend to my friends as well,21,11
Office_Products,B000BUY032,2.0,negative,worked fair for a short time butphotos are streaked and not sharp would not buy it again going back to dell,23,12
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,my black ink cartridge was not working when it arrived and this company went above and beyond to fix my order,20,13
Office_Products,B000BUY032,5.0,positive,this ink worked great in my dell a920 printer and at that price i stocked up and bought 3 black and 3cartridges,24,14

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i just purchased two of these banks one for me and one for my 24 year old son both banks worth just great and efficiently i have had no problems with my unit it is extremely easy to retrieve a coin tube and place the coins into a wrapper there are more expensive units but i think that this unit which is a lot cheaper will work for the average person to avoid jamming the unit you do need to not flood the unit with coins this would be just asking for trouble which would not be the units fault this is the little bank that can,107,1
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,after i ordered this bank i was amazed at how quickly it arrived it replaces one i had stolen and is superior to the previous bank i am very happy with both it and the service,36,2
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this bank was purchased as a gift it has help motivate my child to keep track of his change he started using it right out of the box thanks,29,3
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this money mill bank is easy to use and it works well with any bank wrappers which is a money saver by itself i would recommend it if you do not have lots of coins to sort or if you do not need to do it very often i am pleased with this purcahse,52,4
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i purchased this for about 2000 and i followed the directions carefully despite that a coin slipped into the mechanism there was no way to remove it even although i tried that as carefully as possible i threw the device in the trash i did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins and i now separate coins by hand the advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins so you avoid counting them,81,5
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,my husband is very happy with this bank he had one for many years and when it wore out he purchased this one which is very similar to the one he had he gets free paper rolls from the bank and when the bank is full he rolls the coins himself,51,6
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i got this for my son and he did have fun with it but i spent a lot of time trying to unjam the coins from the mechanism as an actual coin sorter it stinks the number of coins or even the types of coins that end up in each roll is fairly inconsistent also it comes with a top to keep little fingers out of it but there is no way to keep the top on so my son got his finger caught by the rotating coin sorter once and was pretty scared until i could pry his finger out of it i would not reccomend it,107,7
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me,14,8
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,did not work motor would not work out of the box junk,12,9
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it is noisy and it needs tube wrappers not the flat type on the good side it does a fine job of sorting the coins,24,10

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,does not count the coins just keeps dropping them in the slots even if the wrapper is full,17,15
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,came in the mail all of the packages for the coins were smashed,13,16
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product the coins get lodged in the top do not flow into their correct coin slots and uses the batteries like crazy i spent more money on replacing battering by using it the first day then the cost of this product it works better tothe coins in their respective coin slots up to the fill line and there is your counting process very disappointed in this product,73,17
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,like it but it does not stay down on the first try,11,18
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,cheaply made and the latch system sux it broke the first time i tried it it is definatly not worth the money should be ansold in dollar tree,29,19

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the product broke on me in the first week of using it,12,21
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this is well worth having because my husband is always emptying his pockets of change,15,22
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,not as good as the old one without push to start but still does the job,16,23
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it did not sort the coins effectively the coins often dropped down inside of the sorter frankly I had like to return it for a full refund and maybe try another sorter,31,24
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,the money coin sorter is great but had one problem the dime cylinder was too small at the base to accept the wrapper i tried several different ones as i had a previous coin sorter that finally broke after 10 years i called the company and their customer service department sent me a new cylinders for all the coins and the new dime one works awesome company magnif that makes this product,72,25
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,fun way to collect change entertaining to watch the change go to the correct coin holder,16,26
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,eh it is alright jams a lot plus it is hard to get the paper rolls at the right height,18,27
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,terrible box open pieces fell out not usable,8,28
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i bought one of these coin sorters in a yard sale and it finally gave out coins would not roll down the track so i purchased this one worked fine tested with coins dropping into the proper coin tubes my old one was auto start / stop and this one has a switch in the rear inconvenient but not a real issue however when i went to insert the preformed wrappers that came with the unit into their tubes the penny and dime wrappers will not fit the bottom of the tube tapers some probably to make it easier to insert in the machine but too narrow for the wrapper to go all the way into the tube top sticking out about 1/2 i tried with some other wrappers that i had and they had the same problem so i really can not recommend you buy this unit that said I am keeping it because i still have the tubes from my yard sale machine and I am using them instead,166,29
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it comes in very handy to count change,8,30
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this is a simple but automatic sorter works on batteries occasionally does not sort a coin and the coin slips down behind the scene when this happens you just turn it upside down and the coin s slide out for an uncomplicated sorter that works 90 of the time it is just the ticket,52,31
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the plastic is very thin and can break easy i had to re order another one because the original came in pieces broken all over the place the way it was shipped but the product was completely ruined as of the product itself it is ok not all that great coins get stuck even if you put a couple coins in at a time,63,32
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,nice unit do not overload except for that all works fine,10,33
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,gave it as a gift broke down during very first use he only inserted a couple of coins so we did not overwork it must just suck would not ever buy again,31,34
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,unfortunately i never got the chance to fully utilize this product it arrived with a huge crack down the side so i returned it and found a better sorter for my money i think that the plastic used is not the best quality unless i just had some very abusive delivery person however from what i could tell the hopper seemed pretty small i do not think it is meant to process s lot of change at once,76,35
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,great counter used it everytime i came home with pocket change had it for over 15 years but the sorting disk now slips on shaft only changed batteries 2 - 3 times in that time will jam if too many put in only negatives is lack of overflow area and if coin tubes fill up and are not emptied coins can back up chute into inside of machine making retrieval difficult,69,36
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,did not work at all coming out of the box it is crapp being returned,13,37
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this is actually a no star rating very disappointed failed on the first attempt tried again and again it failed this product should be discontinued do not buy,28,38
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,new and improved from the last money mill i had for 15 years do not put paper coin wrapper in tube i do not know why they show to do that just fill plastic tubes remove it and slip paper coin wrapper around coin and tap it down forcing coins in alignment it is so easy i like the new power button and wider tray on top,62,39
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we leave this on the kitchen counter so i like it cuz it does not take up a lot of room easy to use,23,40
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,did not last through three loads was surprised because it did not look as cheaply made as the others kinda sad but will keep looking for a decent one,27,41
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it is to slow i was expecting more money wrappers,10,42
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,reliable a simplified version of a very similar coin sorter i used for years,14,43
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,do not buy this it is bad you are better off counting by hand,13,44
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the penny papere does not fit in the tube the coins get caught easily not worth the money,18,45
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,a replacement unit figuring it out but looks like a keeper,11,46

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,can not handle volume states it can only do 6 - 10 coins at a time but still gets stuck gets clogged below cheap plastic base broke week one broke completely week 3 do not do it,33,49
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,if you keep your change and take it to the bank this it is for you,15,50
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,nice dealgets bumped in shipping needs more insulation outside box ok but once you open the product box it shows signs of pressure the lid on one of the banks this time was cracked,32,51
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,pretty crumby quality for the price i paid,8,52

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i got the money wrapper and the coins shoot out when i use it i have to manually put the coins in each slot pissed me off it is to much of a hassel to return it,36,57
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,do not buy it i had about 15000 in change to count and roll took a few days because i had to stop so often when it says it only can manage 1 to 10 coins it is not kidding it jams up alot i said it will be good to keep by my night stand so when i empty my change it will not be much so i ll use it like that still jams you have to stop remove tubes and shake it upside down to get coins out it is disappointing but when you only pay about 20 bucks you get what you pay for on the up side it is better than nothing,113,58
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the change keeps getting caught in the middle of the machine and i need to turn it upside down to get it out also the dime wrappers do not fit in the dime slot,33,59
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,i had one of these for years and i dropped it went to amazon and read reviews of so many but went back to what i know I am glad i did,31,60
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this is piece of junk avoid buying this jams incessantly after just a few coins save your money also the dime tube will not hold standard dime paper tubes it is too small,33,61
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it arrived with a broken case that was broken in several places it was disappointing because i had saved up a lot of change for my twin boys to put in and sort i could assemble in and hold the pieces in place with several rubber bands but it is not a long term solutions,55,62
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i bought this machine and two to three weeks later it broke the mechanism stopped working i was a little late in reporting the problem but i expected better customer service from gohastings i have to go and order another but it will not be from gohastings very disappointed,48,63
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,not happy with it first thing is the description says it includes 1 coins so i bought wrappers and it does not have a slot for 1 coins the slots fill up before the wrapper is full when take the wrapper out of the slot it does not add up to the full amount per denomination pay a little more and do not make the mistake ordering this like i did,69,64
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,does not have an automatic coin sorter but has to be manually turned on my old one turned on when i dropped in coins i like my oldone better but this one does work,34,65
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,came used and broken repackaged with scotch tape,8,66
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i received a money wrapper coin sorter as a gift it worked well for a few months then began experiencing problems money slipped into the sorter and i had to get it out finally the battery died and i replaced it three times it would not turn at all i called customer service left my phone number twice and they never returned my call sorting by hand is a lot easier our use walmarts sorter it is free,74,67
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,works well but did not come with a lid as pictured,11,68
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,no power to actually sort coins it bog even with new batteries i wished i had done something else,19,69
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,the on off switch fell off the first hour amazon was great about giving me the ability to return it wish someone could recommend a really good coin sorter,29,70
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it arrived defective a critical operating lever had never been placed in the machine,14,71
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,have one myself and bought one as a gift very helpful to have,14,72
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it does the job for me and then some i follow the directions because i do not like my things breaking feed it a few coins at a time and it works the tubes do not fit the exact amount of change the cardboard tubes are counted for but i took the time to double count after filled all you have to do as add 1 nickel after it is full in the tube an the pennies dimes and quarters all add 3 after filled in the machine I am okay with this for 23 I am happy plus I have got a lot of ready coin rolls for the bank,105,73
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this one replaced a prior money wrapper which i had for many many years our grandson is the benefactor these days laughing out loud,21,74
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i had one of these in the past tried a different style i am back as this style sorts so much faster,22,75
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this is a nice little sorter for someone who just wants to dump their change from their pockets when they get home from shopping and more it does get stuck if you drop a handful of change in at once need to drop the coins in slowly just a few at a time it is fine for my needs i am happy with the product,66,76
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,listen to the negative reviews this sorter jams mostly because the coins can not generate enough momentum to roll down the chute towards the containers i only had this for a month before it started jamming because the sorter is essentially one piece i could not take it apart to clean it to see if this would help i had no choice other than to buy another one save yourself the 20 and look elsewhere,76,77
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,I have been saving loose change for a long time and the time it takes to sort it out and count out the number required to fill a coin wrapper takes a good while this money wrapper coin sorter makes all of this so easy do not have to put all change in a wicker basket any more just put it in the coin sorter and it is all done saves time and money,74,78
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it arrived with a piece of the housing broken off and inside the machine i decided to keep it since it was not interfering with the mechanism the coin sorter does work but an occasional coin will drop into the wrong receptacle so using the sorter with wrappers is not a goodif you have to fish out the odd coin,61,79
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,when i opened the amazon box the box for the coin sorter was somewhat mangled and i was immediately concerned this was a gift for my teenage son and he did not care about the condition of the box and was excited to start using the sorter however it was impossible to try out given that the on / off switch was broken through the clear smoked plastic you could see the on / off switch shoved back inside the machine with no way to pop it back out i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 only because my son really likes theof it sure seems like we received a sorter that someone else had already returned and no one fixed,119,80
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i have this the instructions are not clear it feels cheap and i still have not gotten this thing working i am not exactly wanting to either as i feel it will fall apart,32,81
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,thiswas broken when i received it the start stop button on the side was loose inside the product and chips were missing or broken on the top of the container i had one like it that lasted well over ten years this one was very cheaply made,49,82
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,awesome it is so helpful and we got what we needed has made our lives easier i would recommend this100,23,83
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it did come with a crack in it but it is ok for the use we need thanks for your survey,21,84
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i have had one of these for awhile now first the motor went out and now coins fall into and get stuck in the middle of the counter i would recommend to pass on this one,36,85
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it is hard to place the coin wrappers in the tubes it is also hard to get the wrappers out of the tubes the top of the device was cracked on the top a piece of plastic fell off when it was taken out of the box,45,86
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,easy to use and does just what you want a sorter to do came promptly and works great a good acquisition,21,87
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,unfortunately despite it is attractive design useful to see when it jams it jams way to often at least you can remove the top and coin holder turn it upside down and clear it out again and again,37,88
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we bought this product to replace one my dad had by money machine that was many years old it is basically the same product but for a bit less money except for one thing the original machine had a button to push to make it spin when you put the money in this one has a switch which is either on continuous spinning or off when it says it comes with coin wrappers it does 1 of each type but banks will not accept wrapped coins any more because of too many people filling them with slugs so no matter we bought a second one for our boys ages 5 and 7 to learn math money sense they love it the product is durable unless you drop it the reason we needed a replacement in the first place,138,89
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,we had an older model of this bank and liked it very much this version iss even better it has an on / off switch and works very well,26,90
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,nothing i would spend money on constantly jamming up tried different ways to use constantly jamming and drop coins inside unit,21,91
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,this product works very well i hope it lasts because we have had a few of them and they do not hold up,23,92
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought this as a gift since i already have one i knew it would be good as i expected it was up to standard on quality everything was as it was described and works really well the person i bought it for can not stop telling every one how much they like it and use it i will definitely buy another as a gift in the future,68,93
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i sent it back the same day it arrived because it was broken the box it was mailed in was not damaged the product box was open and a medium size piece of the plastic at the top of the sorter was broken off and inside of thethe on / off switch was in the bottom of the box since i could not use the sorter i can not give it a true star rating,75,94
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this coin counter has helped me tremendously in the past few months turning a project that would have taken months into a project that has only taken weeks and i have already started on another project with this coin counter i have counted almost 1000 in just a couple of months i highly recommend this product,56,95
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,it is made so poorly not like the one i had for 10 years too much of a hassle to return and get new one,25,96
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it was exactly like the one i have and we are going to use this new one as a gift,20,97
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,the machine jammed because i put too many coins in too fast i found it easier to sort out the coins and then fill the plastic tubes by hand i had over three hundred dollars in coin if i dort the coins at he end of the day i can run the machine,53,98
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,my old coin sorter had an automatic sensor when you dropped in the coins it started automatically to sort and distribute this new model works great as well except it has a manual slide switch to turn the motor on after you drop in the coins it was not listed with the switch as an option and there was no mention of the switch on the advertisement it is not a big deal except now you have to wait for the coins to go thru and then manually shut it off where before with the automatic motor sensor you could drop the coins and walk away not that i did but i could be doing something else within hearing distance just to make sure it shut off,126,99
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,machine works pretty good but still have to count coins as it misses one here and there still it helps to count many coins fast,26,100
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,works well but is a bit noisy then in motion from the battery operation i thought that the old model was quieter but this never jams like the old one,30,101
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,first let me say that iv bought 3 of these prior to this one and i am happy to say that this one worked exceptionally well the money was sorted very quickly but the only problem is that the quarters nickles and dimes never dropped into the plastic holders thankfully i had extra containers from the old ones I had bought and i switched old containers with the new it seemed the new containers holders of coins were not held tightly in their stationary holder instead of asking for another bank i was happy to find something that worked other than that i absolutely love it,106,102
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,i just used my coin sorter and it broke within the first 2 mins sorry i purchasedwould not recommend,22,103
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,we have had this model of coin sorter for fifteen years or more and i dropped it so we had to buy a replacement i was glad to see they were still around when the grandkids were small we used to collect our change and deposit the rolled coins into bank a account for them now that they have grown we just keep collecting and rolling coins to deposit into our own account it is surprising how fast your pocket change adds up,80,104
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,takes a handful of coins and disperses them rapidly older model did not have on / off switch was on always highly recommend,20,105
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,money wrapper coin sorter compact small accurate great for all the spare change coins add up to make dollars and more,20,106
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,it will do the job if the coins dropped down slowly it could be jammed if too many in the compartment at once it is not 100 with coins dropped to the correct slots but mostly works it is still better then separate and wrapping coins by hands the battery compartment was already cracked and damaged when i receive it I am trying to get a replacement however the system does not allow me to do that the replacement option is grayed out and there has no way to contact the seller,88,107
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,no it is not top of the line but it is sufficient for emptying your pocket at the end of the day and sorting it out for you this is not a commercial coin sorter just a gadget to sort coins without sorting them yourself i like it and get comments from my wife all the time,56,108
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought this for a gift i did open the box and see that only 3 coin wrappers were enclosed i bought a bag of coin wrappers at the dollar tree,31,109
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,it is a money sorter how much can you really say about it so far it is sorted things correctly and it has not broken,22,110
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,my wife enjoys this since it makes wrapping coins very easy all pocket change goes into a collection dish to be wrapped daily,23,111
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,the unit itself is ok have had one for many years 10 in fact they have changed no auto on / off no spring return on coin tubes packaging needs to be addressed no protection for top and bottom of box resulting in slight crack on unit does not effect performance,49,112
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,very satisfied with my purchase and was very satisfied with the time it took to receive the coin wrapper sorter,20,113
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i have hunted for this product for over 3 months i have purchased others and took it back eventually i got this one from amazon i had it before and now i have another one this is the one to get,41,114
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,although we carefully followed the instructions to pour in just a few coins at a time in the 2nd batch of 5 coins the machine gagged on a dime and became inextricably jammed disappointing since we once had a similar sorter that worked well for a long time,48,115
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,purchased thisto replace an old one which ceased to function this one was overpriced but available it arrived on time but it was in many pieces as it had not been packed properly the return policy was excellent and i received a refund very quickly i decided not to replace the bank,54,116
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,nerver did work got this for my husband how embarasingg to have him so very excited but then to not have it work he was so disappointed,27,117
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this was defective did not have switch it was bought and sent as a gift they did not keep the box or invoice,21,118
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i really like theof the money mill bank but after using it a few times i noticed a crack in the plastic all the way down one side and another one starting at the top where the lid fits if it did not break i would be very happy with it,53,119
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i am a waitress and i use a coin sorter everyday this is by far the best one i have used for the price just remember the slower you insert the coins you will prevent jamming i do not care if you buy the most expensive one they will jam if you throw in to much coin for the machine to handle do not hesitate to by this machine it works wonderful,70,120
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,bought this one to replace similiar one that i had used for many years but had quit working this one seems to be about same quality only complaint is that this one is not automatic so it does not start when coins are dropped in it has to be manually turned on if i had read ad carefully i would have known this when i ordered it but it is not a big problem this one will do fine,78,121
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this coin sorter sucks keeps jamming and does not sort properly spent more time unjamming it than it would have taken to sort by hand threw the device in the trash,30,122
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,just like it says as long as you do not drop more than 8 to 10 coins in at a time it works flawlessly paper coin tubes drop into the machines tubes nicely and it is relatively easy to see when it is full if you read the directions in sorting about 85 of random coins and jammed about 5 times mostly user error also known as impatient girlfriend but overall job well done one thing i will mention that is important if you do not notice when one coin tube is filled and keep loading coins they will all pill up in the chute and you will suddenly have a major problem then when you take the over-filled tube out you have coins falling down the chute and going everywhere again easy to avoid but you do have to pay attention a little overall good price and good purchase for the casual coin sorter,148,123
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i received andifferent from i ordered it was similar however i returned it and received a total refund,20,124
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this gadget is worth it is weight in coins all you do is drop the coins in the top turn on the motor and stand back while all the coins are sorted and dropped into cylinders ready to be packed into rolls,41,125
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,it is very cheaply made and you have to put the rolls over the change after the money is sorted which can be difficult at times likely the wiring will be bad,31,126
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,i bought this coin sorter for my dad about 5 years ago he loves it it is probably one of the best presents I have ever given him he has been using it on a near daily basis ever since i got it for him and he has never had a problem it does great sorting out his pocket change,56,127
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,this bank is very useful i have not experienced a coin jam it even has a switch if there is a jam and the coins will continue on to it is destiny the coin wrappers are so handy and makes it quite convenient when taking the coins to the bank this is a very good product,54,128
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,product is not made well at all battery cover can not have any weight on it or it will not work we have to put a small folded piece of paper under it on one side so that there is no pressure on battery cover then it will work what a pain,51,129
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,this keeps jamming and does not sort properly too many coins end up in the wrong cylinder do not waste your money on this thing,23,130
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,5.0,positive,i bought my bank at a drug store about 6 years ago i had it sitting on a bookshelf to dump pocket change into everyday after work i never used it for mass sorting probably 2 dollars change at most i think over the years I have only used two sets of batteries i had to toss it last week and i am here to buy a second one i like another reviewer dropped it onto my tile floor and it did not recover well but i do take all of the blame the only piece that ended up broken seem to be the most important the rotator to send the coins down the sorting ramp but the motor still worked well,121,131
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,i bought this money mill bank for my husband to help organize his change he used it for about a week but from the beginning the motor would get stuck on when nothing was in the bank sometimes it would shut off if we shook it but other times we had to take out the batteries to get it to stop running then my seven-year-old nephew played with it for a few hours repeatedly putting coins in sorting them all then dumping them and putting them all back through and it stopped working completely it would probably have been more worthwhile for us to get a slightly more expensive model that would be more durable,114,132
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,they look good and they are relatively thick unfortunately they are extremely flimsy further the adhesive squares included for hanging them did not stick to the cork panels unfortunately they did continue sticking to my walls once the cork panels fell off now all i have is a bunch of broken cork panels they broke when they fell and numerous adhesive squares i have to pry / scrape / steam off my wall might have worked better if I had hammered them in place too late now i do not recommend this,86,0
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,when these arrived they were moldy smelling and crumbled apart waste of money,13,1
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,so these get very mixed reviews but there has a simple way to make them great i noticed another reviewer suggested using mod podge to seal them before use do it just get the matte version gloss does not look good and get your own mounting tape what comes with them is not great but the best part of these is the unique look and thickness of the tiles they are much thicker than others i did something a little different after i used the mod podge i drilled into the cork and hung them on door / wreath hangers see picture works fantastic i really really like these tiles,104,2
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,great boards but tape that comes with it does not work well buy your own tape for wall hanging,18,3
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,this product comes with adhesive strips to hold them in place i would have preferred that the adhesive had bee a bit more substantial there was enough double sided tape to put a 1 x 1 patch of tape on each corner more would have been better,47,4
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,redid my wall with these tiles and it looks great the old tiles were falling apart,16,5
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,a lot came damaged or uneven some squares were off almost an inch so they could not be used,18,6
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,the cork in the two different packages did not match and it was impossible to stick this to the wall a disaster,22,7
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love thebut sticky wall tabs do not keep boards mounted i needed to nail them on,18,8
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,horrible product the first thing i noticed when opening the package was a strong horrible chemical smell i thought it would subside after airing out but after a week it never did the dye on the boards comes off easily and the material is very crumbly,46,9
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,using for bulletin board on the side of my stainless steel frig i had to ditch the magnets works well,20,10
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,we received two sets of these cork boards the second set was clearly a return two of the tiles had stickies on the back making them stick together and break and one actually had a thumb tack stuck in it completely unusable i would like a replacement sent as soon as possible thank you,51,11
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,this board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles 4-pack 82va-4 this corkboard is wonderful i did not use the stickies that came with it i actually attached it to an old window it turned out great you have to use something like scissors to cut it heavy duty ones not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that so i used a pair of tin snips it worked great cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes but the kicker is i used gorilla glue the one where you dampen one of the surfaces i dampened the cork it worked beautifully and now i have a really cool bulletin board for my new office adding to the industrial chic decor already there love love love,139,12
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i love these cork tiles the darklooks great on my light walls and i like how thick they are compared to other corkboards i have tried in the past i put them on the walls around my desk at home to hold pictures / papers i used the enclosed sticky back tabs to put them up in sept 2013 and they are holding strong never had an issue with them coming off i also used an exacto knife to cut them to the size i wanted highly recommend,89,13
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the board did not stick to the tape provided maybe i used the wrong side,15,14
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i really do not like these they crumble and they are all very different tones so they do not create a seamless wall,21,15
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,we ordered a six sets of these for a clients home office and used the sticky foam the came with the items to install we wiped down the wall and then applied the cork to ensure the best stick after being up for just a week the client reported that literally every single piece had fallen down she tried repeatedly to re-stick them and finally used a few heavy duty command strips which finally worked for a few we unfortunately bought these a couple months before installing them and so we can no longer return them I have used these types of cork boards before with little trouble but this was just plain embarrassing we now are having to refund our client and install traditionally framed cork boards instead beware when buying this product that the sticky pads are not great quality and a huge hassle to work what the heck and apparently do not stick to all wall types,156,16
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,very nice i use them on my wall by my desk and on the fridge,15,17
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,when i received the cork squares i mounted them they did not stick well and fell off the surface when i tried to work with them to resecure they fell apart and breaking,32,18
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,cork tiles are great however the sticky tabs do not hold the cork side they stuck to the wall but the cork side is not holding,26,19
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i can see how these could potentially break apart they look pretty fragile but as i was covering these with fabric attached with spray adhesive they are just perfect for my new corkboard i especially love that they are 1/4 inch thick thicker than most cork tiles i found on amazon because most push pins are 1/4 long and i did not want to poke through to the wall,68,20
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i bought these to cover with fabric when they arrived one was already torn most of the way across they seemed to crumble as i worked with them and there was a big mess on the floor when i was done I have worked with other cork tiles before and did not have this problem,54,21
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love these i have put them up in my office the best part they smell like smoked brisket laughing out loud,19,22
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,bigger than i expected using to bring more life into a room,12,23
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,they are nice cork boards but have a strong oder to them like liquid smoke i hope it wears off quickly if it does not it will be the first purchase from amazoncom that i throw away three days later and two nights of feeling sick from the oder even after spraying them with a vinegar water mix that was suppose to help i had to throw them away plus i now have to go buy something to repair the wall from hanging them with the stickies they come with what a waste of money bummed,95,24
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,as many of the other recent reviewers stated this is too crumbly to be useful they are also thicker than other cork tiles on this site so i thought furniture tacks would work to put them up but they were too thick i tried nailing them in which is when the office became a gross cork fest waste of money and it is a shame they are really cute in the trash they go,73,25
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these do not stick no matter how many sticky squares i use the boards also crumble easily and they smell bad i wanted to hang these on the inside of my pantry cabinet door and they have been a useless disaster if i had the packaging still I had return them,50,26
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,unfortunately these arrived moldy under the plastic wrapping i had to return them re-purchased a similar product at the hardware store instead which cost me a bit more but they work fine this kind of cork can have a pretty strong smell although be forewarned i kind of like it but not everyone will,54,27
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,they are a greatfor my espresso wood in the office however they are a little messy they leave crumbs if you touch the side i think it is due to how big the pieces of cork are not a huge deal once they are put up if you do not take things on and off much,54,28
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,have not yet put them up but they look like exactly what i wanted,14,29
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,first off i was excited at the possibilities of making my own design on my wall with these cork boards that is where the excitement ended first off they smell terrible I have washed my hands twice after hanging them and my hands still smell bad I am hoping my room does not continue to smell otherwise I am going to have to remove them completely i ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles i could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke they are very fragile do not hold them on the corners simple gravity will make them snap in half i accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble the other one i held in the middle and it still broke in half they also bring a ton of cork dust when assembling simply put they are very poorly made,148,30
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love the boards but the stick tabs do not hold these up i had to put nails in each one,20,31
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,we purchased these to protect the wall behind our dart board they work fine for this purpose however if you were going to use for posting things on a bulletin board they may not stand up to everyday use,39,32
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i applied to a regular eggshell paint finish and the tiles fell off of course i did not buy heavy duty tape the whole thing just went straight into the trash and i have some of the tape still stuck on my walls,42,33
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the cork crumbles it is pretty messy does not completely fall apart but chips easily very flimsy too,16,34
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i am making several different things and gluing these to them then using left over to make a cork board,20,35
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,look good but do not stay stuck to wall and crumble apart easy,12,36
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i ordered this product to create usable space on an indoor window not subject to temperature changes the pieces were difficult to make a clean cut even with a new blade in the mat knife and within 48 hours after applying the cork squares they began to fall off of their adhesive attachment tape leaving squares of very difficult to remove white tape a real pain in the at,69,37
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,love the board and the price for the pack but the sticky backs that come with it do not work for beans,21,38
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,did the whole ceiling in my office with these now it looks good smells good and is much quieter,18,39
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,very poor quality and very crumbly we could not use them in our office big disappointment,16,40
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i have to rewrite my review i gave this product more stars in the beginning the sticky pieces wldnt work so i tried gluing the adhesive to the back of the boards i used two sets and put all 8 pieces together within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose the cork started breaking in half and my childrens artwork fell while i was gone i had caught it a couple times when i was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times i wld not recommended this product the cork is not thick enough and even adding 3 m adhesives did not keep it on the wall waste of my money i will have to purchase something else,128,41
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these boards are extremely difficult to hang i have tried several different types of hanging / mounting strips and nothing works in addition the mounting strips have stripped paint off my walls i am not even posting anything heavy just my childs artwork these have created a much bigger headache for me than they were worth,54,42
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,provided tape does not holdto the wall used command strips instead crumbles very easily,16,43
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,terrible cheap and they were all on the floor the next day,12,44
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,poor quality cork board if it is not already broken upon arrival it will be once you try hanging with the adhesive pads that the cork comes right off of walking into my office the morning after hanging them i discovered all but one had peeled away from the supplied adhesive strips the last one was about to fall and two of the other three no had large chunks broken off due to impact with the floor do not waste your time patience or money on this product,86,45
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these are terrible bought them to go behind an electronic dart board game greatbut after putting them up the next day they had all fallen from the wall and broken double-sided tape did not hold up on clean / painted wall also the boards were covered in what appeared to be some sort of white mildew inside the shrink-wrap terrible product do not do it,64,46
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,bought these to go under plants on side tables in order to protect the wood perfect for that purpose thin enough to cut easily and dark enough not to stand out on my dark wood tables,36,47
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i do agree that these are a bit crumbly but if you are careful with them it is not really that big a deal it is simply a side effect of the material they are made of they left a few crumbs out of the package but now that they are on the wall i do not see any problem and they look very rich with the darker colouring as opposed to the usual more bland corkboard squares you can buy i also did not use the adhesive that was in the packet with the squares i used command strips instead both because I am in a rental flat and also because i just wanted to give the cork squares a solid foundation they look great I had buy them again,124,48
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,horrible crumbles with the slightest touch spent nearly 100 for 24 tiles and now have to replace with another product would rate lower if possible,25,49
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,if i could rate these 20 i would i ended up just throwing them away i opened my package and they started falling apart on me i literally had cork all over the place after taking them out of the plastic i did not want something that was going to disintegrate horrible product do not waste your money,56,50
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,these pretty much starting falling apart as soon as i unwrapped them and they left a mess on my kitchen table they are not exactly what i was expecting and probably will not work for what i wanted to use them for which is an aesthetic protective covering for a coffee table i will likely shop around for something mre suitable,59,51
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the cork boards are fine but the tape to attach them was old and dried out,16,52
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,adhesive stuck to the wall just fine but not to the actual cork and they kept falling off the wall and broke into pieces,24,53
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,you are going to need some super glue to really get the stickers to stick to the cork board once you do that these boards will stick to the wall just fine if you do not use glue the double sided tape that comes with it will not stick to the cork board not for long at least,56,54
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,unfortunately these cork tiles crumble at any touch very messy and unable to be used as a bulletin board you only end up with cork dust,26,55
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i was skeptical about ordering these after reading other reviews i should have listened to what i read these are horrible quality just taking them out of the wrapping they completely fell apart i hung a few of the tiles and every time i pin something to them brown cork dust falls everywhere just disgusting and completely not worth the price do not order these,65,56
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,order one batch of 4 like them then ordered 2 more for a total of 12 individual boards the first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch so i just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional the 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum i bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1 squares of double sided tape per board any less and the board may still stick to the wall but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration the additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards the boards themselves are very nice and do look very nice too so it still gets 4 stars for that but loses a star for the lack of proper mounting material,199,57
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,would not recommend right out of the package this was a crumbly mess i wanted that cool look of spacing cork tiles out for pinning and more not the right thing for that i have it stuffed up on a shelf now should probably toss it out before it stays up there for three years getting dusty and making clutter,59,58
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i ordered the dark cork tiles in two batches they were significantly different inhence they did not match as i expected them to,25,59
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the included double side tapes are not sufficient to make the cork stay on the walls plan on making them stay a different way,24,60
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,fell off wall in less than 2 wks and all the cork chipped at corners the cork is pretty although just does not stick with provided adhesive,26,61
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i bought these for my sons room but i will not use them they are going in the trash when i first opened the package the smell was so strong that i had to leave them in the garage i had hoped that the smell would go away but after a week in our garage they are not much better then on the day they were opened,66,62
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,a little flimsy and crumbly but overall I am satisfied with these lil guys this darker brownwas a little harder to find than the standard cork and the material is a little different too as you can tell from the picture it is not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything it is more like a bunch of little chunks formed together which i think gives it kind of a neat textured look unlike a lot of other ones i looked at these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins they did make a mess when i put them up and I am not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted but oh well still worth it oh i also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares,143,63
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,these squares are a nicesturdy and look nice the major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package the instructions clearly state that 6 adhesive squares allow for the best bond to the surface but only include enough for four per square sadly i already posted items on the board only to have two of the squares fall off within an hour perhaps if i had enough adhesive squares this would not have happened,79,64
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,good size and easy to work with in terms of application and fit definitely recommend for a variety of crafting projects,21,65
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,most places sell much thinner cork than what i needed this i actually use as protective backing for the wall surrounding a metal tip dartboard works great for that purpose,30,66
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,these boards were easy to put up on the wall with some double sided tape the heavy duty kind so far they are still on the wall the thickness of the boards are perfect for utilizing them as a bulletin board i love theof them too,48,67
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,the board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles are thicker than many of the lighter cork tiles i found in stores the texture andis perfect too,29,68
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i ordered two packs one arrived crumbling and looked totally different as if it had not been pressed enough i returned it thinking it was a fluke and was quickly shipped a replacement which had two tiles with broken corners i sent them all back they are very nice looking cork boards thick and a nice darkbut go to the store to buy them so you can make sure they are undamaged and all match,77,69
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,the cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated which makes the fact that they arrived all 4 sheets in perfect condition all the more impressive their corners were squared and no chips or holes i cut them to size with a razor blade and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartments walls really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls looks professional and fantastic the provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment but if they do start to slip it is no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails the surface is somewhat porous meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully fair value for the buck which is becoming a rarity these days,127,70
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,my daughter and i painted them purple and black and made a decorative bulletin board with them the students love it,21,71
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i used this to fill an old window frame to use as a tack board works greats it does have a tendency to crumble when cutting use a very sharp blade and go slow,33,72
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the product leaves crumbs or bits tends to fall apart the more you use it does not hold push pins well,20,73
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i bought these to maybe use for an earring hanger but I am not positive anymore the four cork tiles are pretty thick and theis nice and dark it is however flaking a bit like piece of the cork are coming off like a lot of pieces they are still intact and will still be usable they are just leaving a trail wherever i take them,66,74
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,this stuff seems to be the right thickness to go behind my dart board and give the sheet rock a rest two packs did the trick three squares above three below and one on either side the mounting system of my bandit dart board still fits perfectly even although the edges of the dart board are over some of the cork it comes with a bunch of double sided tape squares i only used one in each corner just to get the squares set and then used a few finishing nails for more strength all of this and it has a pleasant smokey scent,104,75
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,I am making a largewall in my office and gluing this onto corrugated plastic panels which will be attached to the wall the highly inadequate adhesive squares are completely pointless as i want this stuff to stay attached to the wall for more than a day and the sheetrocked walls in my office have some texture I am using contact cement the edges of these squares are easy to damage and the detritus they she had is non stop i only hope once i have it mounted and framed it with molding it will cease to she had so many cork crumbs i gave it 2 stars because I am committed to finishing my project i do not like it i may hate it in the end and have to revisit and change my review,131,76
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the product is crumbly but worse all the tiles fell down and no i have sticky double sided tape on my wall i can not get off,26,77
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,it was a little messy as others have said but not overly so i used it on a floor that does not get much traffic a half bath but it was down in a day and looks good I have had it down for about a month and is holding up so far theis great and the thickness is perfect i had little cork pieces everywhere when i cut it but it cut well i thought and a few minutes with a vacuum and voila i like it,89,78
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,glue patches too small tend to stick on wall but not on the more open tile many failed to adhrere,20,79
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i built a picture frame and cut these out and glued them in works great to pin up pictures it looks great and works perfectly,24,80
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i had been searching all over for the correctand density to replace some old broken cork tiles on my daughters cork wall this was an exact match if the previous tiles are any indication of the durability of these tiles they will last quite some time the current ones have been up for i know over 12 years,60,81
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,they do not hang with adhesives provided so i used command strips they are kind of curved but that is only obvious if you hang it curving away from the wall they are very delicate if you drop them they will probably fall into pieces be very careful when handling these on a positive note theis very unique and expensive-looking it adds an artsy element to my room i use it to hang my jewelry and it keeps it very organized I have had them for a few months and so far they are still intact it is a great price so do not expect too much handle with care,107,82
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these cork tiles are a good thickness but they are very crumbly the consistency of the cork is much looser than that of a typical cork board i would love to find good quality dark cork but this is not it,40,83
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,my delivery never showed up not sure if the company or the mailman is to blame but there is no tracking information available when you purchase this product the seller did resend me the items after i called to follow up about a week later if you need them as soon as possible bewarewas what i expected when it showed up I am liquid nailing them to a chalk board if you are dumb enough to use the double sided tape squares they send you then you deserve to have them fall off your wall the company should not even provide the little squares for this use there has no way they can hold the weight of the cork tile plus whatever you thumbtack to it,121,84
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i installed these with no problem but then discovered they are too thin for regular pushpins the pushpins only go halfway in so can not tack anything to the nine squares i painstakingly hung up arrrggghh would not recommend just spend the money on a big regular bulletin board i got these from a big box store fyi,57,85
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,these tiles are good quality for the price i would reccomend buying mounting tape to hang them rather than using the mounting squares that come in the package we used the provided squares to start with and most of them fell off the wall the cork tiles are quite thin and several of them broke when they fell after buying a heavier duty mounting tape we were able to create a custome cork border for my daughters room that looks very nice,82,86
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i put this on a wall do not use the cheap double sided tape spread an even coat of clear silicon on the back and it will be fine,27,87
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,the boards are perfect for my project but the adhesive that comes with them is not great,16,88
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i bought these to install a wall of cork tile after i did some research on pricier higher-quality cork tiles produced for this type of application i decided did not want to spend the money on the pricier tiles so i opted for these the dark stain makes them look like they are higher-end than the typical square cork tiles you can purchase at the store and they are significantly thicker and sturdier I am very happy with them for the price,78,89
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,yes these are flimsy and crumbly and the adhesives do not hold the damned cork tiles up and they charge and outrageous price for shipping such lightweight materials a real rip off yet i can not find any other dark brown cork tiles out there they all apparently come from the same place and charge high shipping rates someone should manufacture a better product,62,90
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,makes a nice natural looking cork board the board is slightly darker compared to the pictures but has a nice overall tone the only problem with this product is that it is very crumbly and gets everywhere when installing,39,91
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,regular office chairs are not designed to provide back support to someone sitting upright at the computer they are also not designed for people who like to sit up that little bit higher cushions and back supports did not give me what i needed and i was uncomfortable all of the time so i took a chance on this drafting stool and I am really glad i did the back is upright and fits right in the small of my back providing very good support the height without the lower section of the central shaft is perfect and i love the foot-ring having the back support and height i need are essential but being able to use the foot-ring to change the position of my legs is a great bonus it assembled very easily and and is sturdy enough for my 180 pounds i definitely recommend this chair,147,0
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,i use this as a seat to go along with the podium in my classroom so that I am not having to stand all the time the chair comes with three cylinders that you wedge together to get it to full height however i personally found that the chair at it is full height was too tall for me to sit on comfortably I am 55 and it looked incredibly undignified to have to hop to get into this chair in front of students after a vigorous application of wd40 and a rubber mallet i managed to disassemble the chair and remove the shortest of the three cylinders which still left me with a nice tall stool and let me sit in it without needing to jump the only complaint and the reason that i knocked a star off is that i felt the price was set a bit high for such a simple piece of office furniture that being said it has done everything i need it for up to this point,170,1
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,purchased 2 chairs for a basement renovation that included a new study area office for the kids biggest question was making sure the chair would fit in our application from both a height and comfort level they have worked out great ability to adjust via optional center posts provided was the trick for us strong good quality for the money seatwas nice rich only recommendation i have is to go slow with the directions installation directions were vague and a little difficult to understand they could have been much more descriptive and clear,96,2
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,good workmanship it was delivered on time unfortunately the instruction is not very well explained i have to assemble and disassemble to find out how i can lower some more the seat height in addition to the regular controlled adjustment,40,3
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these drafting chairs for a reception desk what junk totally unstable they fell apart after only 2 days of use i called oj commerce to explain what was happening with the chairs employees falling as they used the foot bar to get into the chair having the chair flip over seat felt like sitting on a piece a plywood a real liability well their response was to bad if i could afford to send these crappy chairs back to them i would have instead they went into the dumpster after having them for only 3 days opps wish i had done a video review of them before i threw them in the trash,115,4
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,purchased 2 of these chairs for use at the front desk of a hotel the chairs are very poor quality after just 1 week of use the fabric on the seat is already showing wear the foot rest is wobbly and tipping the mechanism to adjust the height of the chair is very difficult to use we are very unhappy with the quality of these chairs when the company was contacted to request a return and refund they refused saying they would send 2 new chairs but would not accept a return why would we want 2 new chairs when the ones we purchased initially are unacceptable you can only return anif there is a part missing or damaged,121,5
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,the chair very nice and good price niceeasy to assembly the stool can turn around quick delivery i enjoy it i highly recommence it,23,6

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,flimsy seat creaks and is not level foot rest will not stay put despite repeated tightening I am going to try to take it apart and re-assemble before sending it to the landfill very disappointing although do not waste your money on one unless you are a lot lighter than my 175 lbs,48,11
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,i bought this chair for my work bench in my basement utility room excellent feel no more dead butt while sitting on a hard chair it adjusts to the perfect height for working at higher than counter height very comfortable and easy to assemble,45,12
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,looks nice couple of teeny blemishes on the cushion but overall a nice buy instructions are pretty simple but there really should be a note that you need to sit on it to make the three centerpieces really fit together or use a mallet they kinda fit if you try to do it by hand but it would not lock in until i sat on it wheels are smooth and no apparently problems since assembling and starting to use it,81,13
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,this chair was cheap once i built a brace for the footbar and welded the footbar to the base and took off the back rest which bent when i simply leaned back this was a nice stool please add a way to bolt the footbar to the frame and stop selling such a poorly designed product,56,14
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,decent chair with assembly taking less than ten minutes there are actually several configurations you can use for different heights very pleased this is actually the same chair as the model with arms even ships with the bolts for the arms and the holes are there so if i were to order again i would get the one with the arms and leave them off i could even alternate and put them on for a while and then take them off i was thinking i could put one arm on and leave the other off but i am afraid that would leave things off balance and throw the world in to chaos,112,15
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,not comfortable really poor quality do not waste your money,9,16
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,i have purchased 3 of these chairs in july the seat cushion has close to nothing in it you can feel the screws coming from the back side of it i can not find any warranty info on them i would think that these would last longer the 4 months very disappointed,52,17
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,great light-use counter chair will not take heavy daily use,10,18
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,while cheap that is what we ended up with broken back light metal bends easily would not recommend for a lot of usage,23,19
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,looked great in the picture when i received the box i opened it for assembly the directions are extremely vague i recommend using just the longer one of the tube posts because when i put both of them together as the directions showed it made the post crooked and the chair was off balance i had to disassemble the chair and use the single longer post on it is own the back support has no adjustment other than forward and backward slightly would be nice to have a height adjustment on that the seat cushion itself is not extremely comfortable for having to use this chair on a daily basis for my job i was disappointed with the final product,119,20
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,cheap piece of chinese crap uncomfortable seat rotates at an angle flimsy when extended what else can i say returning,20,21

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,this was for my wife who works a lot at a sewing machine and at a cutting table she reports that she is very pleased with the chair,28,29
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,circular leg rest will not stay in adjusted position but falls down to lowest position o matter how hard you tighten lock this makes the chair very uncomfortable when adjusted to a high position my last chair was very uncomfortable because thelift would not stay up does not anyone make a drafting chair that actually works certainly not flash furniture,61,30
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,loved this we bought two and they are great at a great price,13,31
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,this chair is very comfortable and reasonably priced the only problems i had is that the first order came in with the wrong part that mounts the seat to the base and the foot ring does not want to stay in one place other than that i love this product,49,32

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,the included written instructions are dreadful worthless use your common sense instead the seat is not really stable if i were you I had look elsewhere,25,37
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,i had to do a bit of filing to get the central piece to fit into the foot piece but once done the chair is fine and comfortable shipping was timely and everything you need to put it together was included,41,38
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,easy to put together and nice looking chair padding is thin so for the price it is a good deal worth it,21,39
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,this chair completely fell apart within 3 months the seat and backrest are shaky the foot rest is a hazard and a few of the wheels came off pro the pattern is cute con unsafe and unstable,37,40
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,the footrest fell apart in the first week and pieces of the chair continue to fall off to this day it will be out at the dumpster within a week or so if i do not get hurt when it falls apart while I am sitting on it,46,41

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,the foot ring on the chair will not stay in place it also sits crooked not worth the money at all,21,45
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,i bought this chair for my office at work and the chair seat height is very tall at least 32 inches this is at it is lowest setting i measured my desk and the proper seat height for me I am tall is 29 inches so even with high heals i would have to tippy-toe to get on my chair every time instructions are one size fits all i suspect seller uses the same instructions for several chair types seems okay to me now I am not as mechanically inclined as i am computer savvy and assembled this chair by myself i wish i did not have to return it as i like the solid quality and sturdiness but it is seat height is just too tall so my search continues too bad,129,46
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,this chair is not the fanciest you will find the parts are a little thin and wobbly on occasion the back rest depends on hand tightened knobs but structurally it is very sturdy it has not tipped over once i thought it would because of it is height and it is comfortable keep in mind that it is really an average drafting chair but once you acknowledge that it is a great buy,68,47
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,this chair was cheaply priced thus it was cheaply made it does the job but it is uncomfortable and falls apart frequently spend the money on a nice chair the way i see it i am out 50 if i would have just spent 50 more up front I had have a nice reliable chair also instructions are completely ridiculous thank god for common sense other wise I had be screwed in assembling it,70,48

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,this chair is exactly what i needed it is the right height and comfortable the only problem is that the footrest does not stay put it slides down to the base and i have to continually readjust it,36,57
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,my office mate and i bought standing desks and decided to purchase 1 chair for those times we need to sit this chair is rickety and made of cheap materials which i suppose only encourages us to actually stand however for the price it is ok and serves the purpose of a quick break here and there i would not purchase again,61,58
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,overall great chairs assemble very easily function very well and look very good would recommend these chairs to others,20,59
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,i wanted a tall chair and it is but seat could be a bit larger to give more stable feeling,20,60
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,the shipping was fast because i have a prime the stool was nice but the handle for height extenders was broken also the back pad base was not balanced why i did not return it because i do have studio class and i need it to i can draft it is easy to but it together if the back base were balanced over all i think it is worth 50 not 79 you can buy it but i think you need to look for something less money if you going to buy this stool,90,61
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,the chair was easy to assemble after it is assembled i find it comfortable i needed a chair which would allow me to set comfortable at a bar height for work at a computer over extended periods this chair works well,41,62
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,there were some mixed reviews on this chair but i decided to take a chance on it there is very little padding on this chair and it seems no matter what i do i can not get the seat level I am only keeping it because it is too much trouble to send it back,53,63
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,the chair itself is of fair quality and assembled with ease the problem is with it is comfort not designed for humans of average height this is by far the most uncomfortable chair i have ever sat upon within the first half hour i had leg cramps followed by lower back pain wish i had my old broken chair or even a barstool at this point,66,64
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,it clearly show 2 different height ranges but only comes with one when i contacted the supplier it was more than obvious that i was bothering them i sent the chairs back,32,65

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,it was the cheapest drafting chair i could find and it feels like it i have no problem sitting in it all day but it is far from cushy does the job i needed just fine although,37,67
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,i got this to use in my new sewing room because my new work table sits a lot higher than my old one when i got it all put together although it was too high no problem there are three pieces that connect the chair to the base so i took out the middle one put it back together and it is now the perfect height it was really easy to put together no tools needed because it comes with it is own allen wrench love the foot rest,87,68
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1.0,negative,instructions show arm rests and mysterious missing second cylinder do you see arm rests in the pic i do not think so so now i have to call or write or whatever and frankly i prefer not having to make the time,42,69

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2.0,negative,we had to improvise putting this thing together after doing so we found that it tilted forward we were able to improvise a correction for this but as much as this looks like an easy to assembleit is not,40,72
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5.0,positive,the shipping was fast assembly was very easy my husband is a little handicapped so i assembled it for him and it was simple,24,73
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,the instructions are sketchy i had extra parts i needed to use common sense to assemble it the foot rest is a foot rest and will not support your body weight for home use only nice product,37,74
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the chair and it is operation great buy if this meets your needs,20,75

Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,i had a lexmark 1120 and another one from the 1200 series i thought i would upgrade since those two served me well the fact is adown and work with all the features it promises severly disappointing it is designed to scan only one pages at a time i wished they advetised that so if i want to scan 14 individual pages i have to wait for every page to upload before i can do anything with the document this was not the case with the previous lexmark printer i couls scan more than one document at at a time i this case simpler is definatley better,110,0
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,just got my printer took about 30 minutes to set up just loaded the software and set up the printer then plugged it it it searched for my network and all i had to do was enter the network key no fuss no muss worked wirelessly first time print scan fax all wirelessly i love it,56,1
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,horrific every time i come home to visit my parents i spend half of the time trying to set up or re-set up this piece of junk the user guide is absolutely no help i was not surprised to see many other users having the same issues have never had this much trouble with my brother or canon products maybe you should look for an alternative there,67,2
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,if you want something to print do not buy this if you need something to drive you crazy and take up desk space it may be for you it works when it wants to and 9 times out of ten will not print something you really need printed even when the cables are directly connected to your pc the wireless is a joke and it uses up ink like crazy i will never purchase another lexmark printer and will be happy when i can throw this printer in the trash,88,3
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,I am using the all in one as we speak and figured I had warn the world why they should not buy this piece of garbage the good wireless prints double sided all in one decent printer the bad this is my third lexmark x6570 my company contracts with them so until they run out of these they keep sending me more of them the problem with this printer is simple poor design it swallows ink i do not even pay for my ink and I am complaining about how much ink this thing uses i have the settings on draft and it still goes through ink like no other now the ink i can live with because the prints are actually decent but the scanner and fax unreal anyone who has given this printer a good rating has not used the fax for more than a page these things jam everytime i thought mine was defective but after 3 it is the design trust me on this one your money is better spent elsewhere i have only owned lexmarks printers and this one is by far the worst,181,4
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,i thought this would be a great machine sadly the automatic paper feeder often jams and the ink yield is very very low i printed two tax returns and the cartridge is out of ink,35,5
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,i purchased one of these from walmart because it was cheap and had scanning and wireless built in what they fail to tell you is that the reason the printer is so cheap is because it will suck the rest of your money in ink cost this thing uses more ink than any printer I have ever seen no exaggeration i replaced both myand photo cartridges at the same time with brand new ones after printing 6 pages of business cards which btw would not print straight on the lexmark but printed perfectly on my mono hp laserjet the photo cartridge was empty 6 pages that is all you get folks nothing cheap about this printer except for the construction my only other complaint is the lack of driver support lexmark does not support linux / unix systems their recent linux driver sdk is a joke if you want good printing stick with hp they are the only ones I have found that can print well support everything and last forever,166,6
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,i bought the product because it is wireless and i can print from my living room to my home office however half the time i get problems communicating with the printer it tells me to unplug the printer and restart only 1 of the time does that work then i have to reboot my pc to get it to work other frustrating things is in the middle of a print job it will lose the wireless connection reboot again it has to be the worst printer i have ever owned for reliability just do not go there,97,7
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic product it performs perfectly and if some would simply read the manual and follow the menu you would realize that all supposed shortcomings are fixable you can change the number of rings till it picks up you can disable autoanswer you can tell it to scan after dialing so it runs like a normal fax machine great product you will not find anything from hp for this price with these features love the duplex printing module,79,8
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,in answer to all of you who own apple computers both my imac and macbook are on my wireless network the printer works flawlessly with both i have not had one bit of trouble with the lexmark wireless x6570 printer working on all of my computers both apple and pcs the software set up was easy on all of my computers you only have to hard wire the first computer on your network and the rest set up wireless i am not a technical person but i had no trouble setting up the printer no matter where i am in the house i can print out anything that i want to and go later to the office to retrieve the copies i am very happy with this printer which i have had for over a year i will not buy anything but lexmark printers,144,9
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,we have had the printer about a month now and it is been great I have used the fax scanner and printer functions including dual sided printing and it works like a champ i had problems with my previous hp printer the wireless has been a great feature too the only problem I have had was a slight glitch installing the software on one computer but the problem was with the previous printer uninstall program the program hp did not uninstall all of the driver information and i had to manually change the port settings on the computer the other 2 computers on my wireless loaded the software just fine also currently the place i buy printer ink does not have generic replacement inks for this printer,123,10
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,the lexmark x6570 all in one is everthing i was looking for quality all the way,16,11
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,1.0,negative,even although the documentation says the printer supports macintosh it does not at least in wireless mode there is a problem with the software and lexmark told me outright that mac was not supported printer worked ok for a while but the cartridge life is very short and the cartridges themselves are expensive finally while trying to put a new cartridge in this morning the printer decided to align itself while i had the door open and it shattered one of the cartridge bays against the side printer is now useless junk,90,12
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,so far the only complaint i have is that to turn the power off when you shut down your computer you have to unplug the printer from the wall i have never owned a printer that when you push the power button does not turn it off do not know where lexmark is going with thisbut it lacks any logical sense to me,64,13
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,this is a nice printer loaded with features the fax capability over our normal phone lines works great this could be improved by making the number of rings befor the fax pick up user selectable wireless printing is great the scan function is somewhat troublesome in that it sometimes locks up but this may be an operator problem,58,14
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,this printer is sold at a great price and generally works fine however lexmark gives this printer away to stick it to you on the ink i used to replace the ink after about a month of use when it started warning me and then stopped printing then i found out how to bi-pass the warning and so far it has been three months with the same usage and even although the indicator says that my ink is empty my printout are as good as when the new cartridge was put into use this is very misleading and one could even say that lexmark is stealing a significant amount of unused ink from it is users,115,15
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,the printer has been great the duplex and auto feeder is a nice feature with no problems so far my two complaints however are the software that came with the printer trying to scan documents has not been easy with the software not giving much in the way of options the other complaint is that the wireless drops off and will not reconnect with my computer so i just keep it pluged in with the usb,76,16
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,overall this printer works well it does drop the wi-fi connection after extended period of non-use but i can deal with that the print quality is fair my biggest complaint which is leading me to get rid of this printer is that it drinks ink at an alarming rate from an economical stand-point the initial price is great but the ink costs are killing me this printer is as good as gone for me,74,17
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,the wireless setup worked like a charm i was printing from my wireless laptop to my wireless printer in no time but the honeymoon did not last long the printer cartridges ran out in no time i thought maybe the ones that came with the unit were not as full of ink as the ones that I had get from the store so i did not get to alarmed well i found out that the cartidges from the store were just like the ones from the printer box very short on ink intially if you did not know better you would think that there was something wrong with the ink cartridges but there has nothing wrong other than the typical manufacter ink scam except even worse if you print to any degree at all do not buy this printer,133,18
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,i find this a good printer but it does not explain the different functions associated with the printer also the troubleshooting information is no help at all other than that it is an ok printer,34,19
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,5.0,positive,I have had this for about 4 months now used lightly but regularly mostly black and white love it i held off on buying a printer for a while because they are often more trouble than they are worth but this one went well above expectations everything works as expected although i have not used the faxing wireless secured is flawless and a great feature if you move your laptop within the house copying and scanning work great for my needs personal my favorite feature automatic double-sided printing hard to find feature and i have yet to see another company offer it at this price what a paper saver now i do not feel as bad when printing you have to change it is settings in xp in order to print both sides by default also i set the default to draft quality printing by default which saves on ink i have not had to replace the cartridges yet and the quality is fine for personal use the only con I have found is that the automatic paper feed has not fed in the paper in the couple of times that I have tried,190,20
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5.0,positive,emerson design slimline phn emsem2116 i was looking for a simple good and ecomomical wired wall phone for the bathroom i did not need a bunch of features and this one is doing a fine job,39,0
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2.0,negative,it came without the cord connecting the stand to the handset pretty obnoxious,13,1
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5.0,positive,this phone was purchased to set up my voip obi202 phone system great phone,14,2
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1.0,negative,poor working of switches for ring we put on ring off and could never get it on again threw this phone away,22,3

Office_Products,B001308IKK,4.0,positive,works well enough be aware it is very light weight which works for me,13,5
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1.0,negative,it was a waste of 10 just glad i did not pay more apparently some people receive some that do work but this is really cheaply made,26,6
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1.0,negative,the phone connection remains on does not hang up when it is installed as a wall mounted device the hook switch on the handset is not depressed when it is placed in the vertical position on the base this is a design problem that can not be fixed i contacted tech support they are worthless,55,7
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1.0,negative,this product is the worse product ever i just wanted some kind of cheap temporary phone before i found a better deal on a landline phone cheap definitely describes this product it stopped working within a couple of days it no longer called out instead it would give a beeping tone also when someone tried calling in the person on the other line would not be able to hear what i was saying my advice even although the product is cheap do not even bother buying it,85,8
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2.0,negative,if you just need something as a backup phone it is okay although it is probably not a good one fore someone who is hard of hearing,25,9
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2.0,negative,my biggest complaint about this phone is that it is ridiculously light the base itself constantly flops around on the desk like a dead fish as you handle the handset the only way to keep it in place is to fasten it with the screw mounts or use some sort of double-sided tape second it has quite a bit of static I am not sure if this was a fluke but my other handsets worked flawlessly while this one produced an audible click and pop as i moved the unit around the desk finally it is very very basic not many features here the keypad is lit and it does have a volume control switch loud or louder but that is all no caller identification saved number features in essence this is a barebones cheap and ultimately disposable phone that you would only get if you quickly needed a device to talk,150,10
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5.0,positive,ok i do not give it 5 stars unless it is good does what i want tastes great or whomever i gived it to was happy merry christmas and happy new year,29,11
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2.0,negative,the phone works ok however it has a very cheap feel to it and i do not expect it to last very long the problem is it is so light every time i answer the phone the base also lifts up and then falls if you are going to attach the phone to the wall this phone might be ok but if you are looking for a desk phone try something with a little more weight to it,78,12
Office_Products,B001308IKK,4.0,positive,in a world that depends on phone mobility i still have a hole in the kitchen wall where a phone was supposed to be located well this phone fills that hole very adequately at a nice low price nothing more nothing less,42,13
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,these liquid chalk markers do not erase completely off the chalkboard therefore leaving a ghost shadow of the previous design would not recommend,23,0
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i got these markers to work on slate cheese trays and they are fantastic they are easy to write with in spite of being a broad tip and the add a bit of fun to the cheese tray the only drawer back is the white is very difficult to remove from the cheese trays so I have given up using that for a bit ofon the buffet table try these markers,71,1
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,not what i wanted they do not write on black dry erase boards,13,2

Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,nice colors but what has the point of chalkarkers if they can not be used in place of chalk they do not erase at all,23,5
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,these markers were awesome to begin with after about 2 weeks i noticed that a few of them were not writing as clearly as they should now after a month there are only 3 - 4 markers which actually work,39,6
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,it takes a lot of shaking to get these pens started but once done they work great used both on ideapaint and glass surfaces they write well erase easily and provide a nice compliment to dry-erase markers,37,7
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,alll pens arrived dry as a bone i would like replacements if this is ever read i have not had time to address this but the ink had dried out by the time they arrived,35,8
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,i ordered this for a menu sign specifically for the white was going to use the other colors for accents and i opened the box to find my 8 pack was only a 7 pack and the white was missing seeing as how that is the one i needed i will be sending this back now i have to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for them to receive it before i get refunded,76,9
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,most pens did not work dry only one did beware of this product it is cheap enough that i did not bother returning it,22,10
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,maybe I am the idiot for not reading the directions for using chalk but apparently chalk on a chalkboard is designed to be permanent love what you write or throw away your chalkboard you would think amazon would be more careful when selling a product,43,11
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,great markers however you need to know how to spart them so they work they do require quite a bit of shaking priming until the tip of the marker starts displaying someonce primed they work really well great vibrants colors which can be easily wiped off from the board,51,12
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,the first time they were used they worked well i followed all the diretions on how to keep them and they did not wrk consitantly would never buy them again,30,13

Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,these work great they do not run the chisel tip gives you a nicer end to work with they last a long time great for my menu boards,27,16
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,out of the 8 markers only 2 work well i followed the instructions on all of them but i only get half of a line or after i press tip i get a glob of paint will write for money back,41,17
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,chalk is as advertised it works bright colors what more can you possibly say about liquid chalk one two three,20,18
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,we use these for menu-writing and they show up really bright and beautiful with a crispthey do not however erase from chalkboard paint they will come off reasonably well from the a-frame easel more shiny surface but are mostly permanent on the paint that said i will continue to use them and repaint because their finish is so bright,61,19
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,only disappointment is that not all colors show up on black i do not know if that was mentioned when i bought them or not,24,20
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,after numerous shaking and pressing i thought i iucked out and go the dud set but no it just takes a wee while or rather a long while to depress the ink the first time as soon as the liquid was flowing it all went well took a few efforts to get it looking the way i wanted but i am happy cleans of glass and mirrors easily too plus it looks great,73,21
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,these ruined our chalkboard we had used the chalkboard with regular chalk so it was not new it had been seasoned with chalk already and the special cleaner that is really a rip-off do not buy these unless you are writing a permanent message,43,22
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,these are nice colors and work well but tend to dry up really fast i felt like i wasted money on these,22,23
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,love the bright colors on my business chalkboard that i painted to display my pricing i have been able to succesfully remove by using a magic eraser as i do run monthly specials i need to change the message so far have been able to do that,47,24
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,the markers work great and will purchase them again i recommend them to whom ever would like nice smooth writing markers thanks,22,25
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,i love these chalk markers the bright colors are much more vibrant than chalk my customers notice my black board immediately,21,26
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,they do not last as long but there are diffrent colors and i am happy with them i had no problems with them not working like other reviews have stated,29,27
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,we use these markers at work for our special signs so twice a day every day they work well and write well for a while some of my coworkers press the tips too hard and ruin the tips but if you are gentle they are work really well we use black and green chalk boards if there are ghost shadows then we just wipe with rubbing alcohol and voila good as new I had recommend these but there are cheaper ones out there that work / last just as long,85,28
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,i had to use a mr clean magic eraser o get the marker off of the chalk board thewas great but not worth the time to clean the board they would be excellent if you wanted your words to stay up for some time,46,29
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i do menu boards for a couple of restaurants in town and these markers are great for permanent marker on a chalkboard with an authentic chalk look the marker tips wear down pretty quickly which was annoying a positive is that the colors are crisp bright and opaque you can clean this marker off after you make a mistake if you act quickly i keep a spray bottle and paper towels beside me while i work if you wait too long if you realize you have made a mistake a while later you can get the marker off but there has usually a ghost line where the chalk marker used to be after a few weeks of these chalkboards hanging it is almost impossible to get the marker off,126,30
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,bought these for use on some fabulous chalk boards that were made for a lobby these boards were made using chalk board paint the markers worked and looked beautiful until it was time to erase wet erase and it did not come off yikes do not purchase if you are planning to use them on something painted with chalk board paint period,61,31
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,2.0,negative,liquid chalk is hard to get out to work with i have to keep pressing the tip down to get it to come out,24,32
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,5.0,positive,works as advertized my wife loves to write with them we use them on our led board and they look outstanding thanks,22,33
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,greatbut the markers do not work as advertised it takes much more than a few seconds of pressing to get the ink flowing one marker arrived with a damaged tip another one is an almost translucentuseless on a black surface a third marker did not work even after many minutes of pressing when you can get the markers working the results are great not worth the effort in my opinion and not a kid-friendly product,79,34
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,4.0,positive,i love these for use in the classroom very fun and bright to use on the word wall i was disappointed when i used them on chalkboard paint but that is my own fault they are made for nonporous surfaces i am still using them on the chalkboard paint even although they can be a bit difficult to scrub off they are fabulous on smooth surfaces they do dry out with time if not used I have had mine for 2 months and had to work a bit to get the ink flowing again in a couple the tips do fray if used on a rough surface some colors white blue leave more ghosting than others overall i give these a thumbs up,124,35
Office_Products,B0019FJQOQ,1.0,negative,we purchased this product to use on our office chalk boards and ended up ruining the boards after one use with the pens beautiful colors but beware,27,36
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1.0,negative,i had one that suddenly sent my printer into convultions and it appeared that my hearty but old printer was done when infact it was due to a faulty cartridge from these guys i had bought a set of four and when i replaced it with another cartridge the malfunction stopped but suddenly there was a huge puddle of ink oozing out of my 940c this ooze is ongoing and it is very messy it left a large amount of ink inside of the printer which is hard to remove and it will continue toout under the printer thank god for cheap ink that is water soluble but none the less these cartridges are no bargain it will take days for my fingers to turn white again,129,0
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1.0,negative,i was very pleased with the service from this company especially when they replaced one cartridge that did not survive the mailing no protective padding in the envelope however i did not get around to installing one of these cartridges until a few days later my hp psc would not recognize it i even surgically removed the barcode from the old hp original cartridge and attached it to the remanufactured one no go bummer after looking on-line i found that the culprit was probably a missing chip that hp installs in each of their cartridges my psc is very old and still works like a champ but the difficulty and expense of finding new official cartridges makes me as angry at hp as i am with the company that sold me cartridges that do not work live and learn,135,1
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4.0,positive,i bought this because it seemed like a great deal 4 black ink cartridges for the price that they change for 1/5 of an hp cartridge i installed it and it has worked well so far so good,38,2
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1.0,negative,2 of the cartridge work 2 not the ink is dry and do not work bad experience,16,3
Office_Products,B001QIM102,2.0,negative,very unreliable print cartridges first two cartridges failed after a few pages,12,4
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5.0,positive,this is my 3rd-4th purchase of hp-15s from amazon / printronic and based on my experience with these refills i would estimate the usefulness to be 95 I have only had one that i would consider a shorter than expected life my hp 3820 still provides acceptable service and keeping my hp 3820 useful would not be possible without a reasonably reputable supply of hp-15s,62,5
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4.0,positive,very good value I have tried one so far and it needed to have it is contacts cleaned with a pencil eraser to make it work but one that was done it works very well it is not as clear printing as a new hp cartridge but it is good enough for my purposes mostly printing out sheet music if the other cartridges work as well this is a very cost effective replacement ink,70,6
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4.0,positive,i have not used them all yet but so far what i used is good theis correct on the cartridge i have in there now the black it is printing like it should with no problems so far i am happy and would purchase it again thanks,48,7

Office_Products,B001QIM102,5.0,positive,bought these for my mom because she prints a bunch of useless garbage from email and online the price is way better than buying them new from the actual manufacturer she has not had any problems with them,37,10
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4.0,positive,ink tends to come on a bit thick and real test will be in how long it lasts seems to be a real value although,25,11
Office_Products,B001QIM102,5.0,positive,works just fine in the printer would buy again fast service nice price can not think of anything else to say,20,12
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4.0,positive,they work good i got the 4 of them and just one did not work good but they last good and they are okay not so bad to be so cheap in price i recommend this product,35,13
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1.0,negative,unfortunately i had to return this product as it was not compatible with my hp printer i was so disapointed,20,14
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1.0,negative,unfortunately i had a very bad experience with the purchase of this product prior to a trip to the united states i bought this phone which i stated that was sent to the address where i would stay me the phone arrived the day indicated but back to my country and install the cordless charger never does not work not charge the cordless handset 2 days after i send an email to customer service stating this situation it is been 3 weeks since purchase and i have not received a concrete solution to my problem i have shown that i can to return the phone to an address within the united states however i have not received a response yet so now i can only say that my experience with this purchase has been very very bad once again i can see the flaw in that incur many e-commerce companies large error is the after sales service which is what a buyer needs to end if you have problems in conclusion when you need a solution that never appears anywhere,178,0
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,the overall product is ok the menus are ok it seems sturdy enough setup was easy the problem is the functionality the speaker phone is completely unuseable even with the volume cranked to the maximum everyone is at a whisper and even if you yell you are a whisper to the people on the other end the corded another issue hand set sits on top of the speaker and mic and you can not turn the speaker phone on with the hand set off of the cradle that right there makes thiscompletely useless to me even while using the corded hand set you have to speak louder than usual for the people on the other end but the volume if those talking to you is fine overall not good i would recomend spending a little more on another product returning this one and trying a panasonic,147,1
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1.0,negative,do not buy this product l512cbt i had problems with the blue tooth connecting to my cell phone the pairing went fine and all works fine until the base looses connection trying to reconnect using your cell or the base will not work you have to reset the base and repair your cell i just called motorola and they admitted it is a known problem and are unsure how long it will take to fix if ever they suggested to take it back when i asked if it is just a couple of units and if i get another would it work they said no all of them have this problem,108,2
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,a very nice phone that is easy to use the only trouble is at 9 pm cdt and at 3 am cdt the phone diconnects from the bluetooth portion with my motorola i880 happens almost everyday motorola technical support is working on the issue hope it will not be too long until that problem is repaired no complaints otherwise very happy with the product and all other motorola products i have purchased,72,3
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,could just be a defect of my phone but when using the handset the buttons seem to be very indistinct i use the cordless handset for teleconference calls and 80 of the times i have to dial and redial my conference codes for the phone to get it right for example I shall dial the buttons for 1234567899 but my conferencing center will say sorry you dialed 223457799 so frustrating,69,4
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,4.0,positive,i just received this phone and have no complaints with it except the instructions have images that i was unable to understand even with magnifying glasses just the same it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it by using the menu on the control panel i also like the way the handset feels in my hand it sure beats my vtech 58 that was horrible,67,5
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,5.0,positive,hello dear i have chosen this telephone because i liked it visually and at the same time i like the brand i like it for i am happy with how it functions nobody it was my decision,37,6
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,4.0,positive,the buttons on it are hard to press although have to redial numbers all the time other than that it is a pretty good value for the price,27,7
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,this phone appeared good for the price but fails to deliver on basic performance with an iphone 5s i have found that the unit will not acquire bluetooth automatically and the bluetooth connection gets dropped on it is own the whole point this is so that i can leave my cell phone put in a good reception spot and not worry about calls not ringing and maybe have the spare handset by the bed not comforting to wake up the next morning and the blue paired light is out on the motorola and i have nowhen the thing dropped my cell phone more or less useless for that calls placed out from the motorola handset are not clear there is static and folks on the other line have complained somewhat when the very same call is switched directly to cell phone the static miraculously disappears i wish i had gotten rid of the motorola but it is not really worth the hassle or shipping,165,8
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this phone like other customers i have had trouble with loose power connection failure to stay connected to cell phone clunky buttons that are hard to push and delay in connecting when you start to dial also the menu is not intuitive the whole thing is a nightmare i bought this because i liked the combination of corded and cordless i wish there were more choices of this combo because motorola did an absolutely awful job that makes me question buying anything else from them again,91,9
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,the user interface leaves a lot to be desired 1 on the main phone unit there is some sort of delay when you first start dialing it takes some getting used to you press the first four of five digits nothing happens then they all come out at once why does it need to be that way 2 the intercom is difficult to use you have to open a menu select a handset by pressing the arrow key a bunch of times then select it this is needless obviously the person who designed the user interface never intended to use it themself 3 the message waiting indicator if you are using phone company voice mail is really small and hard to notice i would not recommend this phone,131,10
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,5.0,positive,love this set I have gone threw so many cordless phones becuase they will not stay charged so I have tryied many till i seen thease and I am very please with the clear talk and the charge stays for quite a long time,40,11

Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1.0,negative,after a few weeks the phone no longer dials the right numbers for example i will write the number 444 - 333 - 2222 and it will dial 444 - 443 - 3322 or something like that it almost seems to be random i although at first it was because i have a wi-fi router close to it when dialing from my remote handset but it does the same from the hub which is hardwired to land line it is a piece of crap i will never buy a motorola phone in my life,85,17
Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,1.0,negative,my at t cordless phone with bluetooth is getting old so bought this motorola at a good price talk about user friendly not a chance with this one i like things to go smooth and easy with little hassel with this unit nothing is smooth and easy the bluetooth in itself is interesting enough when you get into range with your cellphone it should connect by itself once the programming is done but not this one you reprogram all over again and again and again hassel hassel and more hassel for a name like motorola this should be a top of the line phone bye bye motorola,106,18

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,more than half of these pens do not write,9,3
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,i like the colors that are included the coverage of theis good i wish there were a couple more yellows only one and a few more glitter pens i ordered this set in part so i could use the container as a storage container the plastic was more flimsy than i anticipated and after less than 20 uses the lid tore / broke this would not however prevent me from re-ordering this gel pen set again,77,4

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,the selection of colors is nice but the pens are too thick pointed the ink flows quickly and makes dots when you write it is fine for artwork / coloring / shading but not for writing alone,33,8
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,half of the pens in this pack do not work at all very disappointed,14,9
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,these are great pens so far I have used them almost every day and so far no complaints the only thing which is probably true for all pens when they are new is for me anyway is to give them a little tap on something lightly a few times to get the ink down and the ink starts to flow out nice and even the container has a variety of different kinds of ink from glitter to florescent to metallic and pastel to name a few i love the glitter pens since they do not get clogged with the glitter as almost every glitter pen I have purchased in the past 5 years so i would honestly recommend these pens to anyone actually I have even recommended them to family members and even purchased some for my niece who just started college and she too says she loves them i really hope this helps,149,10
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,after reading the reviews i tried out all the pens as soon as i got them barely any of them worked not only that but there was this nasty orange coating the inside top of the canister I am returning it the day i get it because it is just unusable just save your money this product is not worth your time,59,11
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,2.0,negative,this brand does not work well for some reason some of the pens worked okay others just did not write i have some gelly roll brand pens that work much much better i bought these because the price was so much better but the quality was lacking,45,12
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,the gel pens came in a timely manner they were all that i could hope for in a pen they write very smoothly-no skipping at all the colors were vibrant and just as was claimed there were metallic neon and regular my favorite are the metallic-but they all look pretty and special when drawing or writing with them thank you very much patti kojis,64,13

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,i love gel pens and was excited to see this canister available you can only imagine my frustration that over time i continued to discover pens that did not work ink dried out the customer service was so disappointing when i contacted the vendor i was told that i should have contacted them right away however i did not know which pens worked or did not because i did not try all 48 at once which i did not think was reasonable i will not use this vendor or recommend them due to the poor service,92,17

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,we run a photo booth company and need metallic gel pens very frequently the company decided to go with a different brand of pens because the ones we normally purchase do not all work on black paper these american craft gel pens are not great at all they do not show up on black paper nor white paper that well most of the pens had exploded already in the canister when we received them and most did not work at all we are going to use about 35 of them while the rest are just going to sit i was expecting something good for the price that it was labeled for please do not waste your time on thislike another reviewer said only buy if you have money to blow,132,20
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,this was a joke from the beginning it took eleven days for this to get to me and when i received it the box fromit was packed in was in great shape after opening the box the plastic container these pens were in was broken the bottom was falling out a number of the pens were without the tops they had come off a number of the pens were dried out and more of them the ink had leaked out of the back of the pen all over others i would not waste my money i do not know whether this is the fault of american crafts although i have received faulty material from them before or the company that sold these i do not ever have this experience on amazon and do not expect to have it again,142,21

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,when i was in junior high gel pens were definitly one of the fads going around i had recently been in a doodling mood and got the sudden urge to draw on myself with gel pens i know childish but still fun and they do not stain your skin like markers or normal pens so hunting for my gel pens i did and not too long after I had begun i found them but only 5 of them worked i knew somewhere still had to be selling these things so amazon i checked out and sure enough gel pens i bought the 48 pack of american crafts gel pen canister and absolutely love them for the past few days I have just been doodling away very happy with this product i have yet to try out every single pen andbut the ones I have tried so far are great,148,36
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,the pens were very cheaply made and when i went to write with them the ink either did not come out or looked streaky i also had 3 of the samefor about 4 or 5 colors,38,37

Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,47 out of 48 pens worked some of them i had to scribble with a few seconds for the ink to flow and some of them start writing a bit scratchy but after a few seconds of writing the ink flow comes out smooth fast shipping too,47,39
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,i ordered these for christmas and they were packaged poorly they opened in shipment and went all over the box when i tried to get them replaced i was told that i would have to re-order very bad business now i will not have the gel pens for christmas very upsetting amazon should not sponsor sites they can not support,56,40
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,this is nice canister of pens great selection of colors and easy full coverage when drawing great price per number of pens also,23,41
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,1.0,negative,many of the pens quit working within the first few minutes of using them the glitter may be getting clogged up in some but even the metallic ones are refusing to flow i could not get them to write once again no matter how or what i tried all the old techniques to get the ink to flow with ballpoint pens when i was in school failed this assortment is proving to be a real dud nearly 25 of these pens do not work after the first use i always recap my pens they really should not dry out i can clearly see the volume of ink is in the inner tube frustrating to say the least do not buy unless you have got money to blow,125,42
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,5.0,positive,i make greeting cards for my family and friends I am thrilled with the gel pens i ordered from this seller i will order from this company again everyone has given me great reviews on the cards they have gotten this year,41,43
Office_Products,B003PJ0ICI,4.0,positive,this is a greati love to work on mandalas and thisdoes do the trick for what i love doing the variety of colors is great the only problems i had with thisis the packaging of the pens is really flimsy before you receive thisi highly recommend that you buy a holder that will stand them upright when they are not in use the pens will onlyif you lie them on their sides i learned the hard way my bad rolling on the floor laughing like any product treat this product with care when you receive it i still need to go out and get something to hold them properly they are in a plastic bin away from my kids right now do not be lazy like me,135,44

Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,we need two phones for our 40 unit motel that covers half a block in town by putting the base at the center of the property these pones are able to reach into every corner of most every room we had been using vtech phones but they did not have the ability to lock the keyboard since we have to carry these in our pockets this set has been aimprovement only feature they do not have is a speaker phone which is nice at times but gladly give up that feature for the key lock feature,97,0
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,this phone is easy to assemble and works very well it does have an unusual ring tone which is scaring my cats,22,1
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,i have had these phones for about 6 months now and could not be happier they work very well and i am not sure why anyone would buy a more expensive phone the only thing i would probably change is the ringer they are all kind of annoying other than that the battery life has been more than enough as has the range it is a good deal,68,2
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,the phone was at a good price point especially for having 3 handsets very easy to install set up and use the only two features i wish it had that it does not have are the following speakerphone either on the base or the handsets i wish the display would light up at night hard to see who is calling or who you are dialing at night other than that the sound quality is good and the range is good also,82,3
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,excellent I am very happy with this the only thing is that the keyboard and the screen does not light up,20,4
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,very nice phone it was more than i excepted,9,5
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,the caller i d does not light up can not see who has calling,11,6
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,what bugs me most about this phone is that the screen does not illuminate making it very hard to see who has calling it does not make any sense the ring tones are also very harsh when on a call it is often very hard to hear the person on the other end even with the volume set to the highest level if it was not such a pain in the ass to send this back and get something different i would,77,7
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,1.0,negative,after 3 days one of the headsets stopped working it was just off not showing any signs of charging i am returning this and looking for a more reliable phone,30,8
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,sound quality is very low i also expected two phones and only received one that is probably my fault for not reading description but i would not recommend this product,30,9

Office_Products,B00403T1YO,2.0,negative,the sound quality is not great and it has no speaker phone feature,13,11
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,5.0,positive,it is a simple phone once you get used to it as it has a few slight quirks but you quickly overcome them after a couple uses this phone is overall straight forward and does exactly what it was designed to do conversations are clear and the display screen is easy to read these do not drop calls nor do they get any interference from my wifi network the only thing i wish it had was an option for back lighting even if it was a feature you manually turned on or off it would be nice to have at night in dim lighting in any case i have learned to get over it and really like these straight forward phones i especially recommend these for a business setting since they are not illuminated they perform well with a long range and have long battery life,146,12
Office_Products,B00403T1YO,4.0,positive,these phones are lightweight simple to operate and low-cost they work quite well at distances outside our apt and this is good when i am walking around the muted ringer options are very good as the sound of the phone is not irritating to me overall a good product for the price,52,13

Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,nice to have all the handsets but the quality of sound on these is just terrible we could not even hear the other person on the line am returning these as soon as possible,30,5
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5.0,positive,a good system for the price simple and does the job another review complained about the sound quality but i find the sound to be quite good i think it really depends on the infrastructure / provider,35,6
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,after going through 4 phones over the last 7 - 8 years with panasonic and getting tired of the lost connection to base message from their handsets i thought I had try this one from ge phone arrived nice silver finish although flimsy feel handset did not snap into base i felt it was a bit wobbly no speakerphone on base unit but that was already known buttons offered stiffer resistance to the touch than panasonic if you consider that a good thing audio call quality was atrocious while calls did not drop the audio came in and out like shortwave radio for those of us who can remember decided this was unacceptable quality for something brand new returning to amazon i guess it is back to panasonic,125,7
Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,voice quality poor entries in telephone book on one handset do not register automatically in others,16,8

Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,this phones base unit will not mount on a wall if you need it in a place such as a kitchen where you want it out of the way of water or other kitchen hazards this is not the phone for you also it is very small in size i called the manufacturer to see if there was an adapter that i could purchase but the customer service rep was snotty and told me to go somewhere else to purchase one that worked best for me if i could find one and that those types were not manufactured anymore i could not believe her attitude i can not say how it sounds because i am re-packing it and sending it back i have purchased my last ge product after today,129,17

Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,it was much smaller than i expected i actually returned it for a refund,14,1
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4.0,positive,small size easy to take places like a football field for plays,12,2
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5.0,positive,great for the counter in my aging parents apartment it reminds them of upcoming events and i can change the message whenever i visit good product,26,3
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1.0,negative,i liked my dry erase board a lot but the dry erase display had slipped out of the border and now has a bubble underneath my students find it annoying and so do i i wonder if mine is just a defective one or if all of them are like this,51,4
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1.0,negative,we bought 3 of these they have all fallen apart and are now in the trash i do not recommend,20,5
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,1.0,negative,within 15 seconds of taking this board out of the package the rubber feet fell off and the frame around thecame apart i used double-sided tape to put it all back together but it is still not a great product,41,6
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5.0,positive,exactly what i order and order came in fast just wha i need for my event coming in may movie night,21,7
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,the aluminum frame fell apart within the first 2 minutes of opening the packaging super glue did not work but for now it is staying together by shoving poster putty into it,30,8
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,silver frame broke as soon as i got it and I have had to glue it back twice not sure if i just got a bad one,26,9
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5.0,positive,nice desktop whiteboard at a great price helps me organize my day meeting times things to do just right for me,24,10
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,5.0,positive,i am in the habit of using a dry-erase board to keep track of work-related tasks and to-dos but after a move i no-longer had a wall in a convenient place to hang my board on i was very happy to find this board with an easel it is just the right size and the easel is adjustable it also is two-sided so you can flip it around to write additional lists notes,73,11
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4.0,positive,i have enjoyed owning the dooley aluminum framed double sided magnetic dry erase board with easel it is easy to set anywhere and helps keep me organized,27,12
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,i had the same experience as some of the other reviewers here the rubber feet did not even make it out of the plastic packaging so do not count on those staying on this however is not a big deal what is a big deal is that the aluminum frame is one piece with a joint at one corner the bends are fine but the joint is not attached to anything and the entire frame pops off sounds like a cosmetic issue right unfortunately the stand is part of the frame so if you are planning on using the stand you will have to figure out a way to keep the frame from springing off i had a board i bought from a store once that had a metallic finish that was also a dry-erase / magnetic board but unfortunately i can not find it again guess I shall have to keep looking,145,13
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,i bought this for displaying my band magnets at my merch table and liked that it had an easel back i will not be able to use it as intended and would not buy it again this board is white and magnetic on both sides something cool i was not expecting but it is cheaply made the complaint in the other review about the little plastic feet coming off straight out of the box is accurate for the one i received as well the metal frame around the board will not stay on and it will not even pretend to it is like it is spring-loaded to pop away from theof the board possibly these problems can be fixed with a little gorilla glue but aftermarket consumer repair should not be necessary it also either came dented or dented very easily when i was taking it out of the package i was at target after i had already ordered thisand saw larger magnetic boards there for less money it would make more sense to me to buy one of those and set it on an easel stand of it is own than to buy this particular board again that is probably what I shall end up doing,204,14
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,4.0,positive,pros the price on this dry erase board can not be beat overall aside from small issues below it is a really nice desktop dry erase board perfect for to do lists or whatnot writes and erases nicely with the expo brand pens i have not the pen it came with which does not write well cons the marker that it comes with is cheap and completely cheesey so you will definitely want to get another if you plan to use this a lot also you will need an eraser because it just comes with a tiny one on the cap of the marker which does not do the job also the tiny black feet on the stand of the board have already fallen off straight out of the box leaving a sticky residue in their place and need to be glued back on,138,15
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,when i first received this i was seriously skeptical seemed flimsy and cheap but it does the job I have used this to open a number of those hard plastic covers on electronics the shrink wrap dvds even a quick straight line cut on some documents overall it is a nice little tool and the safety features are great for someone like me who is always cutting myself with anything and everything sharp if there was one wish it would be that the blade were just a little bit longer,90,0
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,you would think a tool as old as a utility knife could not possibly be improved upon but scotch succeeds with this package opener there are a lot of little touches that make it pleasant to use the grip is very comfortable and designed to make it easy to hold at the correct angle the extender slide is positioned where my thumb will not accidentally activate it during use the blade is short enough to allow the package to be braced on a table to make it easier to cut it is just one of those designs that gets out of your way so you are focusing on the task instead of the tool my wife tried it and she found it easy to use as well the one thing keeping it from 5 stars is the blade popped out once during use,140,1
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,as an amazon addict i get packages all the time this is a nice little tool to get your amazon boxes open quickly and safely after a while maybea year or so the blade does wear down so i have bought replacements,42,2
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1.0,negative,like all of us I have sworn luridly at the plastic bubbles in which everything today seems to be sold why can not they just go back to little cardboard boxes with windows when i saw thison another website i thought I had licked the problem but after less than a month and maybe four or five packages the little blade broke right off and i ended up right where i started from digging and tearing at the plastic with my kitchen scissors i suggest you use yours too or else a sturdy knife do not bother with this el-cheapo,98,3
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1.0,negative,scotch safe cut does not work safe your money for something else worthless worthless worthless,14,4
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1.0,negative,this is was junk threw it out the day i got it too much trouble to send it back,22,5
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,1.0,negative,i hate it wish i never got it this product is beyond pointless more dangerous than a razor blade by itself already returned i thought it was going to be somewhat helpful like the ones you see in infomercials just a major waste of time / money,44,6
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,this package opener is the perfect gift for children grandparents and klutzes like me i can not tell you how many times I have dealt with papercuts or poking myself with a pair of scissors this little gizmo totally eliminated that problem it works effortlessly and you will find yourself using it for a million little tasks that you would never thought about before and it makes the perfect shower gift teacher gift or just a gift to yourself,77,7
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,i have been searching for anlike this for a long time now thank you so much for a nice christmas present from me to me merry christmas and thank you god bless you all alex christie alexchristie attnet,39,8
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,i like that this little guys small enough to fit in a pocket and that the blades smaller than a boxcutters so it is a bit safer zips through any tape plastic envelope top and more with easethe contour handle is a nice touch too,40,9
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,i think this is a greatblister packs are so difficult and can be so dangerous to open usually i use a scissors sometimes a knife and always think it is going to slip and slice something else i hate blister packs so this is something i feel fills a definite need and although I had like it better with a bigger sharper blade like an exacto knife it was able to open most of the packs without problem those very thick plastic casings did not work very well i think it is good to have around for general use definitely helpful but it may not work for all of your needs,106,10
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,hard to open packaging is a pain literally I have poked and cut myself on those plastic clamshell type packaging why do companies think they need to package products like that it is a waste so the safe cut package opener is supposed to take the pain out of opening those tough packages i tried it a few times and it does indeed make those packages easier to open it does not work just like magic although you have got to put a bit of effort into getting it to slice through the packaging and you have got to make a number of slices across the packages to get them open it is handy to have around and we are glad we have it to help with those crazy plastic packaging,123,11
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,this is really just a light weight easy-to-hold box cutter / razor except that just does not pop the blade out more than a small fraction of an inch this allows you to cut through plastic without cutting into the contents of the package a very simple elegant solution it does work packages are easy to open and I am not too worried about damaging the contents not that i would intentionally cut over a sensitive area at this price it is a good tool to get recommended,82,12
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2.0,negative,this tool is simply the pointy cornerof a razor blade i do not see how anyone can think it is more effective than scissors possibly more safe because only about 3 mm of the blade sticks out and hardly does any damage it is basically a worse version of a box cutter the mechanism to slide the blade in and out does not even lock so much for safe it also does not cut through tape with any relative ease at all the only thing this might be good for is gift wrap,92,13
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,this works perfectly for me and i give it quite a workout with my near daily deliveries from amazon no more using my keys as makeshift knife or running to the kitchen to get a knife and risking cutting myself this fits comfortably in my hand and feels natural to use I am quite happy with it,56,14
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for the scotch safe cut package opener however it did not seem as tough as i had hoped the refillable blade fell out while i was cutting which was not an ideal situation by a long shot the blade is very small and not the best for thicker packaging the plastic piece that held the blade was not as substantial as i would have liked the best part is the design which makes the utility fit quite snugly and firmly in the hand it is also attractive to look at perhaps the next generation of scotch safe cut package openers will be more to my likingscotch safe cut package opener 170b,115,15
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2.0,negative,the blade is so small you have to get it exactly positioned correctly to even have a chance for it to work if you are off perpendicular the cutting is erratic I have tried it on a bunch on things packages from amazon dvds and of course sealed in hard plastic items it eventually worked on all of them but in all cases a plain scissors would have been easier i even had trouble opening the dvd but once a cut is made on the dvd plastic you can easily rip that open i searched around for the refill blade and found it on one site for 3 all in all i think this was a poorly designed poorly executed product stick with a good pair of scissors for now,129,16
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,boxes packages cds dvds and more this littleis amazing no more hassles trying to open those pesky cd wrappers it makes fast work of boxes and more it is small enough to be compact not bulky and easy to hold very excellent tool to have,45,17
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,it is perfect it does exactly what it says it does it seems very safe it is very easy to handle it cuts through that horrific clam she shall packaging like butter and it is certainly easier than a pair of scissors will this change your life no if you do not have a problem using scissors would i buy this no does packaging drive you up a wall and you want the easiest possible way to break it open this is what you want,81,18
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,4.0,positive,handy little gadget pros low cost small blade less chance of chopping off an appendage ergonomic handle easy to push blade in and out of it is holder cuts through tape cardboard plastic wrapping cons i pinched my thumb skin while sliding the top button back to retract the blade because the blade is so small you need to exert some pressure on packaging materials to make sure it cuts deep enough the sharpness of the blade can dull quickly overall this is a handy tool for those who need to keep something small in the knife drawer for the many amazon packages that come to the house and it is much easier to cut with than scissors or a knife,118,19
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,5.0,positive,i really like this package cutter it works well easy to hold safer then other package cutters i have used highly recommend,22,20
Office_Products,B0055CAS1O,2.0,negative,the nice thing about this package opener is that it is cheap really cheap the downside of this is that it is cheap really cheap it feels incredibly light and flimsy the blade is not all that sharp and is absolutely tiny it is not weighted at all and this device actually made opening packages an irritating procedure I had highly recommend something different for your own sanity 2 stars out of 5,68,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,as the brits say it does what it says on the tin the switches are nice and a cool blue led is included for nights in the forward berth of our boat the solar panel worked flawlessly and installation on our boat was simple i do not have any way of knowing how many cfm of air this thing actually moves but you can at least feel air movement when you have it on blow in mode recommended for an inexpensive ventilation device if you have sun available,88,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,this small vent is intended for installation in a small utility trailer although i can not yet report on how it works when installed i found the battery operation of the light fan and directionality of airflow works well no sunlight indoors so do not yet know how the solar works the fan makes minimal noise when the unit is held as it will be when mounted however that disappears to no sound when tilted as little as 5/10 degrees,80,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i put two of these on my 45 foot sailboat one set to suck and the other set to blow it was like a vortex of very mildly detectable solar powered tornado wormholes was created running through my boat from front to back it almost caused me to lose control of my helium indoors only r / c zombie shark but luckily i am an excellent air shark pilot and pulled through i am afraid to set them both to suck as it may because my ears to pop or i could pass out as it sucks all the oxygen out of the cabin but i think i can get out sometime in the 3 weeks it would take to do that i do have a scuba tank that should drop from the over head in an emergency air loss just in case i think the head trauma from the last time it deployed changed things in my brain so i kinda keep it taped up there,165,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,this vent does not move much air you can barely tell it moves any air not worth the price do not waste your money ricko,21,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,got what i ordered it looks good easy to install works fine how long it will last is an open question,21,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,nicerealy works maybe a bit weak for an exhaust van but has worked continually for over a month,19,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped,19,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,purchased 2 of these fans for a boat in june they look fine and nightlight is a nice feature they are crap do not buy them unless you just want a nice nightlight the fans will not start and operate unless you smack them even in bright sunlight so you become the switch they have a one year warranty so we will see how that goes,64,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,it was great while it worked worked for 1 year and now it will only run on battery solar part does not work,22,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,does not do much very little air is moved,8,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,unfortunately this product did not hold up as advertised we are looking for something to replace it to fit in the hole that has been cut into our outbuilding any more damage would be bad,36,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,do not expect a crazy difference but it does the job it works the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night again it is a small vent do not expect big vent differences in temperature I am happy with this product sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass went right in with some caulk vent is a tid bit noisy again to be expected it really does change the temperature i can feel it if i move my hand under it and the other on the other side that is not insulated and without a vent about 10 - 20 degrees difference consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this i think mine was about 40 at home depot,125,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works great for my outdoor she would just the right size and easy to install,14,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,thisstopped working after about 3 days,8,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,I am not sure if the fan is supposed to spin both ways but mine will only suck air in it will not blow air out which is really what i wanted,31,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,lasted 1 year all rusted the circuit board is poorly made and fragile would not recommend this vent,18,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,update will not work anymore it has been few months now and every time i go to the boat it is not running few hits and it starts but stops again so need to remove it and thrown away,37,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,installed this solar vent in the front hatch of my sail boat about 4 weeks ago it is working as advertised no issues with leaks in normal weather conditions have not tested it in green water conditions although,37,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,better battery would make this a 5 star,9,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it is ok for a tiny room tiny tiny room,9,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it was noisy and only lasted six months not worth the postage spent on it,15,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally no air that i could sense,14,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so i returned it for my money back otherwise it worked and looked nice if it were not for a bedroom application i would probably have kept it,41,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,so far so good works as advertised after 3 months the light is a nice added feature,17,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,well built and fairly nice to look at airflow is lower than hoped but adequate,15,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,terrible lasted one month what a rip off,8,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,do not buy this airflow is minimal and hardly worth the trouble it just does not have enough power,17,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,good vent i wish it had a way of closing when i turn the vent off installation directions are very general so take your time and think it through if you not at handy person,35,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,installed it and met my expectations it does not move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent pros you can invert air direccion in / out works at night by means of a rechargable bat and has a cortesy light cons does not move large air volume,49,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,i put the su force in my small greenhouse nice features not as much airflow as i expected then it quit working after a couple of weeks i have not had time to try customer service so hopefully they will make it right,42,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,i bought three of these to put in my rv they stay on all night running on the internal battery they are very quiet but they do not pull / push too much air,30,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,works great is good quality and i like the features however the fan power is a bit weak if you have a small greenhouse it works fine but not for any house over 6 x 8,36,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,high quality although full engineering i use it on my salt water coastal cruiser there is never too much ventilization in aboat,22,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,using it in she had that is being built will not know till i experience it,15,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,works once in a while when it feels like it too many switches confusing design blue light is inadequate and when the fan decides to come on it hardly moves any air at all,34,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,i did not like them they are not stainless steel plus the inside is made of very chip plastic i guess i got what i paid for,26,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,this works awesome in my vehicle never leaked once properly installed even driving 65 mph on the freeway in a driving rain,21,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,used in an 8x12 storage she had to keep humidity under control it is not going to win any prizes for air movement but it vents enough to do the job during the summer looks better than most options,37,37
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,i would like to have it in place a while before i pass judgement the last one different mfg let me down after about a year,26,38
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i live aboard a 40 feet sailboat and these vents supply me with outside air when conditions dictate all of my hatches need to be closed the addition of the lightng feature is the future will prove a plus it is surprising how much light is put out,48,39
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,looks good and runs fine so far no more condensing on the boat interior instructions are poor on setting switches for anyone installing them the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small it is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2 hole leaves room for doing an epoxy coating onor hatch coring,62,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it does not work plain and simple instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes,30,41
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works great for venting rvs that sit out in the hot sun,12,42
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,noisy but circulates as long as the sun is shining on it,12,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i installed this myself and it works great,8,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,very low flow but does the job i used it to vent an outhouse stink pipe and it works good battery does not make it through the night but it is mostly needed for hot days,34,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,cheaply made does not seem to have much airflow do not know what it was meant to ventilate certainly nothing larger than a shorbox,22,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works well clean and easy to use and install started up right away we are using it to vent a greenhouse,21,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,I am still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so i can not vouch for their efficiency but i wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is not 45 or 5 as stated in various comments here the instructions that come with the fan say cut a 45 diameter hole using the template provided the template measures 425 not 45 i cut a test 425 hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat so do not order that 45 hole saw and mandrel for 50 i used a 7 adjustable circle cutter that i got at harbor freight it worked fine i am replacing the plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so i have the luxury of doing this work in my shop the only other comment that i have about the fan is that the ss cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates i have quite a condensation problem in my boat so i am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust I shall keep you posted,201,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,this solar vent was very easy to install and can potentially replace one meant for a 35 hole on my boat this replaced a 45 vent leaving a little bit of abut there is a beauty ring included that hides any size difference quite well the light is not enough to read by but will help you see the other switches in the dark the fan direction can be changed and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night it looks great easy to install I am very happy with it so far it was 3 times cheaper than those available at west marine so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment,130,49
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,these are great low profile and work just fine my issue is this the exterior screws are rusting after only a week outside i doubt they will last very long the worse part the rusty water is leaving rusty streaks on my sailboatsruining my gelcoat and causing expensive damage to the paint i dunno what to do update today about one year later they broke seems they are not as waterproof as i had thought,77,50
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i used in in mobile storage transport trailers does good job of keeping humidity in control hawaii 80 no mildew since installed,23,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,to slow battery did not charge well instruction not clear it can be good for someone but not for me,20,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,bought this sunforce stainless steel solar vent for my new vinyl storage she had to be cooler inside i think it would be a better unit if the electric fan in it ran faster i felt outside just under it and it does move some air just not enough i guess well built and durable housing also,56,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,right out of the box it was slow to operate and you could see that the fan was not running true it wobbled and made a slight rubbing sound within a month it quit working due to a broken wire from the motor looking for a less expensive to the nicro i guess you get what you pay for,59,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,the sunforce 81300 stainless steel solar vent appears to work as advertised helps to lower temp in rv in hot weather and circulate air when rv is not occupied without having to plug rv to power sold by amazon with free shipping at b000bynglu,46,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,we are using this in a small hothouse and it works just great it was easy to install and seems to have reduced mid day temperatures significantly been working for about 3 months with no apparent problems,37,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,this solar vent stopped working within six months of installing it and being after june 2012 amazon will only give me a partial credit and i pay for shipping and sunforce can not even return my phone calls or emails do not waste your money and now i have a hole in my she had,53,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,short and sweet works great in my small greenhouse looks expensive i would buy this again if i ever need one,21,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i thought it was a bit pricy but the thing does work the light works as well this is not a tornado fan but is a small solar fan which we will use to move air through our cargo trailer,40,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,well i have never owned a home hence never had a lawn to uphold just bought our first house and the back yard is huge-we worried like crazy over all the dandelions that were sproutng up everywhere this spring a helpful neighbor recommeneded this product and we are amazed at how well it worked we sprayed about 12 hours before it rained i seriously wish i had some before and after shots within just a few days all of the weeds were gone from our yard it was amazing how fast it worked i mow the lawn weekly on the riding mower-i am the one that does all the yard care-i sprayed almost 2 months ago and there are still no weeds also-i can tell exactly where i sprayed because the grass in those spots is so green healthy and grows beautifully this stuff is a no-brainer it kills the weeds and fertilizes the ground so soft lucious grass comes up quick great stuff i intend on buying it in bulk next spring-i love it,175,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,when moving into our new house we did not notice the lawn had not been kept up very well for most of the summer the yard was full of dandelions and crabgrass fortunately this ortho weed-b-gon is effective for killing dandelions and crabgrass i sprayed each weed numerous times and used up one bottle on the entire lawn it is killing the weeds and not the grass except for the crabgrass from the time i sprayed this weed killer on the weeds to the time they started to die was about three days at first the plants looked wilted and then they started turning brown i dug out all the big weeds once they started dying this weed killer is great for when the weeds are still very young it kills them fast and they just sort of disappear into the grass the crabgrass seems to die a bit slower and probably needs more of this weed killer to do the trick I shall be buying another bottle soon the rebecca review,170,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,I have liberally coated weeds in my yard 3 times and they wilted a little but are still alive after 3 treatments a complete waste of money,26,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,this is the only product that works i wish it were safe to be used around dogs knowing that we use it only where the dogs do not go i ordered four at one time and two are already gone,39,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,did not kill crabgrass even after repeated sprays but it did kill some of my bermuda grass on other weeds it was slow to kill or ineffective will not buy again,31,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,this is completely ineffectual i am very disappointed weeds thriving despite my spraying,13,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,had quite a bit of crab grass growing in my bermuda lawn so spot treated it with this stuff did absolutely nothing to the crab grass but it did kill my bermuda grass sprayed it about 4 weeks ago crab grass is still thriving bermuda still brown dead,48,6

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,it works on clover weeds but it did not work on crabgrass on my lawn not buy this any more,20,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,the weed b gon worked great but it took about 7 days to see the full effect on the weeds,20,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,the title pretty much says it all i now have brown patches where i used to have grass and the crabgrass survived,22,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,i used this on my weeds and they did not even blink days later they were still there like i had never sprayed them very disappointing,25,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,my granddaughter loved these stamps i will by another set of these rubber stamps when my gran-daughter birth day thanks,20,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,this version of the product is new to me but it really works on crabgrass one application and the grass was dead in only a few days,27,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,1.0,negative,i bought this for spots of crabgrass the crabgrass laughed at me it did nothing at all a waste of time and money,23,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,2.0,negative,i bought this using prime as it was cheap but the weeds came back or were not killed immediately like roundup did,22,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,4.0,positive,worked well on your standard lawn weeds very handy to take care of those annoying weeds that you got from your neighbors lawn,24,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,this tool does the job okay i kinda wish i was able to actually see it before buying be aware that the inner extention part is flimsy pvc and wobbles about when in use but for the money if you do not need to extend it much it is okay blade fairly sharp,52,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,this product is junk the rope frayed in the very first use and no contact information for seller in less then 5 small trees the rope was tangled and frayed into the cutter making it unusable,35,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,i needed a tree trimmer to trim-off dead branches or prune crossing branches which i could not safely reach i have not used the saw blade i have only used the pruner it telescopes to it is longest length easily and it is easy to lock in place the pruning cut is clean and quick with minimal force it is well made and sturdy it is not heavy so it is easy to maneuver when it is fully extended very good for the price i would buy it again amazon was the seller,92,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,used it once on a single tree fell apart before i was done pruning the long saw blade is thin and flexes a lot making sawing difficult the cutting portion of it snapped in half during use the metal hook broke in two pieces and finally when bringing it back in the collapse / expand locks broke total junk,57,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,the first thing that i noticed was that thetrimmer that i received was labeled as fiskars not a wallace same part number and i suspect that all the different trimmers are made by just a few companies the blade trimmer worked very well cutting branches up to about one and a quarter inches you really have to pull to cut them that big or larger but that is what kind of leverage you get with a 6 lever arm they are all like that the saw blade is pretty flimsy and trying to cut a 3 branch at full extension is nearly impossible the tool locked to full extension easily and held well the unit is lightweight but seems strong enough for home use,124,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,for the price it works great every now and then the rope binds up but I have never used one that did not if you can get the hook over the branch it will slice through it saw blade is a little flimsy but effective did not have any trouble with the blade binding good for home use but not a commercial trimmer,60,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,broke on the first use funny to receive an eight foot package although in the us post,17,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,the recipients were delighted even although they arrived after christmas and they did not know who they were from maybe i should have ordered them earlier and called the company or something to include a merry christmas note saying they were from us i do not think they have used them yet so i do not know how well they work i selected this pruner because i think it is lighter than some others so will not be as tiring when reaching up,79,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,thiswas not available through amazon so i bought it through walmart it is perfect for light pruning particularly when you do not want to use a ladder the light weightlocks tight when extended also allowing you to place the end of theon the ground eliminating the need to always hold it up the pull on the line is easy the blade is sharp enough to easily cut through branches that fit the maximum opening of the jaws i have not used the saw blade and probably will use it infrequently if at all all of my work with thisis around 8 - 10 feet as i trim the branches over my driveway or excess growth in my small wildlife pond light duty yes overall rating for my purposes excellent so far,136,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,whatever happened to fiskars reputation i have one of these i bought a few years ago and it was great this is horrible the blade is flimsy and theis weak it must have been made in china,39,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,it was a lot lighter than the previous one that i owned the handle pulled out of the locking collar for the extention the first time i used it pretty flimsy flexes a lot i would recommend paying more money for a better quality one the old one lasted years without any issues,53,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,it is not the sturdiest thing around but it doe the trick nicely for pruning up around the yard it is more than worth it if it is your livelyhood keep looking,29,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,the fiskars works great it is length allows me to prune my neighbors orange tree and now that i am having fresh orange juice every day i feel much healthier,29,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,looks great and that is where it stops the cast iron on the clipper broke within the first ten minutes of use the saw blade is flimsy and by the end of the first tree it was bent and dull i am very disappointed with the quality i went down to ace hardware and rented a remmington electricsaw and it was awesome my fiskarssaw went to the dump with my tree trimmings if you need to trim roses from a distance this might work for you anything else is out of it is league,96,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,works alright but the saw is a little weak and flexes a lot makes it more work to get the job done,22,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,today was my first try in using this and it actually worked okay for small branches only but i do not expect it to last very long the pruner blade is plastic did not see that in the description it was not noted the saw is actually metal but took some effort and was not very sturdy i already had to tighten the screws and i doubt the rope will last long either glad it was on sale,75,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,first thing after unpacking the thing the pruning head was wobbly on the handle as if it did not fit it does not really the saw is pretty bad so it is a bit of fight to saw off any reasonably sized branch after a few uses the hook snapped it is made out of really cheap metal you expect that in a fight between the metal hook and a branch the metal hook should win but not so with this pruner overall a waste of money do not buy i had a bit better expectations of fiskars i will try the corona pruner next so far all the corona products i got seemed to work as expected,115,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,we bought this last winter and were only able to use it on small branches the the cutting blade was always jamming and then the pull rope broke as someone else mentioned the long saw blade is thin and flexes a lot making sawing difficult do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more for a tree pruner that will last,62,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,based on the price a good value cons the saw blade is thin theis fairly flexible pros the saw blade may be thin and thea little flexible but i cut through a overhead 3 white ash limb about 10 with quickness and ease theadjusts nicely and securely the lopper worked surprisingly well i cut through several white ash limbs up to an inch in diameter on the first pull i was impressed,78,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,2.0,negative,the pruning saw is ok the rope is too long and there is no place to store the excess rope so it is constantly getting in the way when making cuts very annoying the bigger issue is that it was supposed to ship within 48 hours and it took over two weeks to arrive i did not receive any type of delayed shipping notification i am sure there are better products with more reliable shipping available,76,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,great set of pruners to saw back branches it is worth the price would recommend this product to anyone i took the chance and got my moneys worth for sure,29,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,1.0,negative,compared with the corona version of this i used to have the fiskars is next to useless the cutter chews the branches and the saw bends,26,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,4.0,positive,i have a fence line that is lined with small trees and i needed something to prune the tops and high branches this pruner did the job and did it well i had read some negative reviews on this product but the truth is this is a 32 tree pruner you are not going to be able to take it out with you everyday to make a living or to cut down a 5 diameter limb but if you need something a couple times a year just to keep your property looking good it is worth every penny of the 32 the only reason i did not give it five stars is because of the lock on the extension clamp the clamp works great but you need a screw driver or pocket knife to pull the lock lever over a raised notch to loosen the clamp i just do not like having to have a tool to operate another tool other than that it works great,162,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000HHSD8W,5.0,positive,works great and meets my needs perfectly great price and good quality replaces an old pruner will not hesitate to use seller in future,24,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,items arrived over half were already broken the welds are very weak they are just very poor quality i would not recommend at all,24,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these are perfect for crafts some were used for crafts and a tomato cage,14,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,very useful but two of these cages had broken unattached pieces,12,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i loved how tall and sturdy this seems to be i also like that i can bend the bottom legs to fit into the potting soil i do not know how well it will handle a strong wind i will update my review when there is a strong wind here,50,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great price usually 7 - 10 a piece at home depot these are just as good quality if not better than anywhere else,21,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,perfect little cages about 35 feet small but work great giving support to plants while small and can probably double cage later with bigger cages if you would like I am satisfied,32,5

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,all of mine came in the mail in great shape i used them for halloween ghosts cute,17,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very weak compared to the ones that are coated the coated ones may be an entirely different brand i am unsure,21,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are far to flimsy to support a tomatoe plant,10,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great buy cheaper than anywhere else I have found and just as good quality,13,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are not strong or sturdy enough to support a full grown tomato plant i had to stake them to keep them from falling over,24,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,flimsy we will see how they hold up on the plus side the delivery was fast,15,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they were exactly as i expected and i have used them in my garden in retrospect i wish i purchased asset that were a bit taller,26,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,my tomatoes are all over the ground because these cages broke yes the tomato plants snapped the welds on them do not be pulled in by the low price get the slightly more expensive ones at your local landscape place these are junk,42,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i only needed a few cages for smaller cherry tomato plants so this seemed like a good deal the plants i have used with this only 3 so far have snapped the welds and caused the whole cage to fall over i ended up having to stake my plants anyways better off spending the extra money to get sturdy cage,60,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,bends easily goes into dirt easily good value,8,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,flimsy got better ones at wal-mart for cheaper and twice the quality guess these get the job done in soft soil,21,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,mine arrived great n no broken pieces they are lil but work,11,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i purchased several of these for my summer vegetable garden a few of them showed up with the welds broken and a couple of more bent however you pay for what you get we all want something from nothing at this price these were probably made by some eight year old in their backyard behind their house in china i have no problem with that the price was very good and i am extremely happy with this product i will order again next year,84,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i ordered a box of 10 and only 1 was in the box the cage is very flimsy and was bent in several place do not waste your money,28,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,product okay only received 8 cages instead of the advertised 10,11,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,came in great condition it is sturdy enough for all my plants however i wish i had ordered a taller one than normal my plants are thriving and growing so tall i should probably have given it five stars as i did read the dimensions before buying just wish i had ordered a taller group,55,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,what can i say they are tomato plant cages they work as expected,13,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very thin wire small circles expecting wider circles may not hold my large tomato plants and hold up to the winds sweeping through,23,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are not sturdy try spending more money on something that will hold up to the weight and height of the plants as these do not work best for mine,30,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,low quality product some of the welds were coming apart when i took them out of the packaging,18,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these are a little fragile but once you are aware of that and handle accordingly they seem to be just fine,20,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,when you think of a normal vegetable garden plant cage you get this i was iffy about ordering them from all the rough reviews but I am very happy i did yes they are on the smaller side but they are working just fine at this point my plants are outgrowing them per se but it is definitely also helping keep them up and not sitting in the dirt which is what i wanted anyway,72,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,ordered three sets a few came with a broken weld but otherwise great for the price,16,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,I have had these before and found them to work well I had recommend them,13,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i know that these break easily but 6 of the twenty that i purchased were broken in the box did not want the hassle of returning them so i fixed them myself with my little mig welder,36,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,some arrived damaged like others said but overall still pretty good,11,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i ordered this pack of ten and received only 9 of them of the nine i received 3 of them arrived bent and two of them had broken joints not happy with this purchase at all and not worth the trouble to return / exchange them my recommendation is shop elsewhere,49,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,flimsy but they do what i need them too,9,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,the cages are great however only received 9 of 10 cages,11,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,only 9 of the 10 cages arrived and 2 broke when taking them out of the box leaves only 7 usable and doubtful if they will last long have not gotten a response regarding the missing cage,35,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,what can i say they are tomato cages smaller than expected but they will work fine great price too,17,37

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the pieces are not welded together well and 3 of the 40 i ordered had spots that are not welded at all,20,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,excellent cages for the price I have had them over a year and they have held up well they are on the smaller side so if you were looking for the large super heavy duty ones these are not it it was hard to argue with less than 3 a cage especially when i needed enough to for 20 tomatoes the only reason i knocked off a star is the quality of the welds while they have held so far they seem much more likely to break than my coated ones,90,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,cheap badly made avoid these and spend a little more on better quality i wish i had,17,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for i guess two of the cages had broken top rings that came taped together really that was the manufacturers fix and the ones that actually are intact are welded together pretty poorly i doubt they will last one season,44,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,very poor quality 1/2 of the order needed to be modified on site to deal with broken tack weld s home site by house actually was a dollar cheaper each also,31,48

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i bought 15 of these and i have had no problems with the wire breaking,15,51

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these were exactly as i expected them to be none of them were broken when they arrived which was a plus they are a thin wire and i broke a weld when i was cleaning up the garden area this fall but that was my fault i used these on my tomatoes and they worked really well i think they will last for many years with good care you certainly can not beat the price i needed about 15 cages and this fit my budget perfectly,85,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,was only 7 tomatoe cages i just want my other 3 tomatoe cages,13,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are awful can barely get them to go into the ground for not bending this way and that just super cheap and not worth the month once i finally got them staked they did work but will probably throw them away at the end of the season and get something better for next year disappointed,56,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,trust the negative reviews the welds are weak the galvanized metal will disintegrate under the slightest pressure,17,57

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are the flimsy little thin gauge ones i could have bought these cheaper from wal-mart,16,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,there is a saying that you get what you pay for and in this case that is exactly true these are cheap plant support cages i ordered two packages when the price was lower than normal i am glad i paid less than the average I have seen because the build quality was suspect at best several had poor welds or breaks in the wire one package had the three vertical supports secured at odd places leaving a hugeon one side of the cage i would not recommend these after one season I have had to trash 3 out of 20,101,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i did not read the label correctly so these are a bit shorter than i had thought but so far so good in my garden they have been working fine for my green beans and cucumbers as well as tomatoes if i make a larger garden next year i will be ordering more,52,61

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,the wire cages were very flimsy and fell over as soon as the plants were mature,16,66
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,product is sturdy i was pretty aggressive with them while trying to get them around some juvenile plants that should have already been caged i will order more in the future,31,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,tomato cages do good until the tomatoes get big enough to bear tomatoes and then the whole cage and plant just falls to the ground i had to end up driving a stake in the ground and fasten the cage to it so it and the tomato plant would finally stand up,52,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,final sale really out of the 10 4 was broken and there was no way to return the items,19,69

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,cheap wire thin gauge bends easily not like the cages i remember,12,75
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they more then 6 of them are falling apart when i pushed them down the welding on them is very cheap,21,76
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,yeah a couple broke but nothing some electric tape could not fix i thought it was with the price served their purpose held the tomatos plants up cheaper material than some in store ones but than again they ask for like 4 a cage update7/30/2016 these are def mostly junk now that my tomato plants are fully thriving my plants are screwed all flopped over in my garden waste of plants waste of money,73,77

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these are as described but the size is way too small for any decent sized tomato plant,17,89
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they are just ok cheap but will do the job,9,90
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,half of the wires were broken at the welds fortunately for me i own a welder and stuck it all back together also whatever they plated / painted it with stinks washed it a bunch of times was a bit leary to even put it near food i planned to eat,49,91
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i was iffy ordering this after reading all the bad reviews at 23 i figured i will give it a shot to my surprise the packaging was excellent as all ten cages arrived in excellent conditions not one of them was damaged and all the welds were in good shape please note that as described those are the three prong thin gauge 33 cages made for the small grape and cherry tomatoes they are not for full size tomato plants for those you need the 54 four prong heavy gauge cages,91,92
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,as expected all 10 cages arrived neatly stacked in a box the cages were straight and in perfect working condition,20,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,good but need to be a bit bigger taller,8,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,very cheap and flimsy they break with any pressure applied to them like removing from box or placing them in the ground the welds are very weak i would not recommend thisfor purchase a couple came damaged in the package as well,45,95
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i ordered a box of 10 and only received 7 in the box the ones i got work great for my tomatoes,22,96

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,wish they were not broken when i took them out of box,11,99
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy a few of them broke as i was trying to push them into the ground they will do for small things such as peppers or eggplant but for tomatoes i would recommend something larger and more sturdy,41,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,inexpensive they work just fine put them in my garden this year all but one hopefully they will hold up no updates mean no change might have to add to this at the end of the gardening season,38,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,after reading reviews about broken welds i was fearful that these trellises would arrive damaged but i am a yankee cheap and i do not need a heavy-gage vine-holder to support potted padron peppers and cherry tomatoes so i ordered the inexpensive 10-pack in spite of all the reviews warning that i should not package arrived in two days and i just inspected all 10 not a single damagedall welds intact thanks,74,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,initially constructed of good gauge wire ok the welds on every one of the bottom rings arrived either with one two or all welds broken functionally useless i could understand if one or two welds came loose in my handling and inserting them into the ground but these arrived broken as if there was no quality control what so ever on the upside the price was ok but have found better quality locally at about the same price and i have had my hands on these i bought two packs of ten of panacea 89723 plant supports sight unseen worst transaction that i ever made on amazon,107,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these were very cheap and part of them were already untacked at the welded spots guess i got what i paid for,22,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,some of the cages were bent upon arrival but it was not worth complaining about since they are wire and easily bent back in shape they are perfect for my tomato plants and will buy more in the future if i need to,41,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good quality sturdy tomato cages can not beat the price,9,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these are a great deal compared to what sells locally all of the spot welds held securely i have no complaints,21,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,this supported my tomatoes nicely until my plants outgrew them i now use this on smaller plants,17,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good inexpensive tomato cage looks like I shall get a few years use out of them,15,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i bought 3 packs of ten not one arrived cage perfect every one was bent and the metal is so pliable that trying to stick the cage in the ground causes more bending some of the cages had bad joints that had come loose i destroyed one of the 3 boxes when opening it so i can only return 2 of them i will count the one pack of ten as a lesson learned,74,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,worst quality of anything i have ever purchased on amazon i had to bend half the cages into shape there were a dozen broken welds among the cages and there were two that were so mangled i could not even use them despite my best effort i felt like i opened a whole box full of the ones that were rejected after a pile was picked through at home depot very disappointed,71,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i bought these tomato cages last year i am reusing them again this year and they are holding up well i liked how much cheaper it is then cages in the hardware store the tomatoes like the cage as well the box it comes in is gigantic my dog kept barking at it shipping was fast and theis sturdy,61,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these reviews for 5 stars is way over zealous i purchased 4 boxes 40 total 5 had broken welds or completely disconnected hoops very poor quality control coming from this manufacture the metal is flimsy and mine had a very distinct awful smell as a cherry on top i have to say if tomatoes season was not out i would have returned all 40 and gone local,66,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,there has were pretty cheap so i was not expecting much however they would often bend when putting them into the ground what was the worse was when they fell over when the tomato plants were full,35,114
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these are excellent stakes for plants like bell peppers jalapenos and more they are definitely too small for tomatoes although,19,115
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are already rusty at the joints like they have been sitting outside for a year or two found some feathers on them guess they will do the job but i wonder how long they will last very large package so i hate to ship it back,44,116
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,decent price for what you get some of the welds broke while inserting into the ground but they still served their purpose good for small-med pepper plants,27,117
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i would not recommend using these for tomato plants they work ok for pepper plants although some of the welds were very poor quality you get what you pay for with thisi likely would not by this again,39,118
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would these were the cheapest things i ever bought they are definitely not for tomato plants could not hold up a small roma variety plant garbage,32,119
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,only recieved 5 of the 10 i bought and paid for i would love to have the other 5 since I am making grapevine trees could it be possible to get them,31,120
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the cages started out well doing their job cherry tomatoes were ok but cages bent to the ground with weight of beefsteak tomatoes I shall figure out what to do next spring,31,121
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these tomato cage were very weak and flimsy some of the rings were off when the cages arrived and some fell off before i could stake the cage in the ground,31,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,several of these had welds that had already come loose also they are smaller than the standard tomato cage but i guess that is on me for not reading size closely but the lack of good welding is urksome,38,123
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,good cage but too small for tomatos better for peppers and eggplants,12,124
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,i did not get 10 of them every poor quality broken and welding is very week i would not use for plants i am using for christmas trees so i am sure they will only work one year and let us see if they will make it thru a minnesota winter storm i doubt it but let us see,57,125
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great in the garden especially for my tomato plants,9,126
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,they are only okay tomato supports a couple of the welds or solders or however the metal is attached to itself came apart right out of the box some did not seem like they were ever really attached there are enough in the pack that you will get a couple of ok cages but if you want something that will last for more than one season look elsewhere,65,127
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i wish i got them when i planted but even using them a bit after was not a problem sturdy and did not rust,23,128
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,hard to find in the summer but these did the trick very stable plants,14,129
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy and do not hold up very well the only way that they function is if you bundle the together in groups,24,130
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,tomatos have not escaped as of yet cage seems to be working,12,131
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,nice product but i only recieved 9 out of the 10 products i ordered,14,132
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,arrived quickly exactly what i needed at the home depot there has only bee the large tomato cages this is exactly what i needed for my peppers and I am even using it to support my watermelon plants so they have somewhere for the vines to grab on to,48,133
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very small and some came with broken spokes i would not recommend these for large tomato plants but only smaller varieties make sure to check the measurements before ordering these they are not the large ones you see at the stores,43,134
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,i am sorry to say i have to revise my review below all 4 of the supports continued to bend under the weight of my beefsteak tomato plants despite being tied together at the top my cherry tomato plants did not bend the cages but probably did not need the supports anyway a few of the wires broke it is possible i did not have enough soil in my raised bed to support the buried wires i will try again next spring after i straighten out the spokes and use framing wire to hold broken wires together they did the trick i found it helpful to 1 make sure soil is deep enough to cover legs to the first circle for strong base 2 tie together upper circles of other tomato plants with string to provide more sturdy support i found that without doing these two things the supports actually bent forward on my raised garden bed,155,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are a value but the cages themselves can not support much i grew 5 different types of tomato plants and the cherry tomatoes got out of control since they grow like a vine it caused each of the cages to tip i had to rebend the legs in order to support the wieght for peppers and small tomato plants they work fine just secure them well or use a steak to help keep one end up from tipping,79,136
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these said heavy duty they are not very thin and not well built at all tacks where they should be welded have either broken off or were never there to begin with,32,137
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,quick delivery a couple were either missing welds or they had broken but they did the job,17,138
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,where can you get ten of these for this price yea no where they cam in a few days yea one was a little busted in a few spots were the welds were not the best but i would definitely get them again,42,139
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,cheap some were broken right out of the box,9,140
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great for my potted dwarf tomato and pepper plants,9,141
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,fell apart easily they were the size i was looking for,12,142
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,economical small to medium sized tomato cage we use them for tomatoes and peppers and they work well,18,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,arrived quickly was exactly what i wanted ok price could not find the small sized cages at local stores worked out well,21,144

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,only a 4 because one was broken but the rest were great and also a great deal,17,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i put these on my tomato plants a little late in the gardening game so it was a little more difficult to get the cages around the bigger plants i ended up having to bend the bottom wires out but it still works well to support my plants,48,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they still look perfect a few months later very happy with quality,12,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,stackable for easy storage but made super-duper cheap welds in multiple places came loose in the box before i even had the chance to use them,26,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very cheaply made when you goto push these in the ground be careful they snap easy very cheaply made found better deals at home depot lowes and menards,28,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,they break or bend easily compared to the ones i bought at home depot you get what you pay for,20,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,nice and sturdy i got them for small tomato plants,10,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the soldering of the metal vegetable cages is very poor already 4 of them have come apart and I am sure that the rest will give me problems because they are very thin and it will be difficult to support mature plants with vegetables on them,45,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,does not even deserve a single star these are too small for tomato plants and more than half of them arrived broken should have just spent a little extra and bought some from local hardware store would not recommend these to anyone,41,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,were a little small but we used them and will continue to use them for years,16,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,if the product was not defected it is what i expected unfortunately a handful of the welds were broken i have many old versions of a similar product that are rusting away and the welds are still intact kind of pathetic that these show up broken out of the box,50,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,easily broken but you get what you pay for not the best if you have small kids or dogs running wild but now that the garden fencing is up the cages stand a chance,34,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these work as described some of the welds on them are a bit shady and look like they can snap at a moments notice but so far they have held up for the past few months,36,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,this is the lowest quality product i have ever bought on amazon 2 of the cages were not joined properly the others were super flimsy,25,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,the cages arrived not connected in several areas they should have been soldered at the joints instead we had to tape them together would not recommend and will not purchase again,31,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,it is what it is supposed to be,8,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,totally useless flimsy circle forms were partially broken off vertical forms,11,163
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,cheap made and will see how they do they came apart as i was putting them around my plants and some was already apart,24,164
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,good plant cages i am using them for my tomatoes very happy,12,165
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,as others have mentioned these are very cheaply made cages they are the perfect size for peppers smaller than your traditional tomato cages but 5 of my 10 had at least one weld broken with 2 having the whole bottom ring falling off when pushing them into even moderately hard soil they are so thin they bend right over after this season they are headed for the trash,65,166
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,pretty flimsy but i guess you get what you pay for they were also all bent and some were broken when they arrived,23,167
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,better than the ones at the big box with great amazon convenience,12,168
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,good cage and a good price but take note that these are smaller than the normal size you get at a retail garden dept not for large tomato plants but good for smaller tomato plants and peppers,37,169
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,came in perfect shape very good purchase i recommend this product,13,170
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,they arrived in good condition and I have had no problems with them they are lightweight as advertised so not for healthy tomatoes but great for peppers or beans I am using them for cucumbers and hope they can handle the weight,40,171
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,they got bent in shipping i just bent them back and they work,13,172
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,not the best quality but great for the price,9,173
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,can not beat the price my plants love the support,9,174
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,exactly what it said it was they may not be heavy duty but for the price they are great,19,175
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,i purchased these cages on july 20th 2014 and used them to stake my container tomato plants positives well made large study but easy to bend and adjust weather resistant negatives expensive these cages saw very heavy use and elemental exposure in my garden over the summer they all worked well and all 10 are still in perfect condition sitting outside and awaiting this years garden excellent purchase the only downfall is the price point these are great for individuals who are for whatever reason unable to procure tomato cages from their local garden supplier,95,176
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,works great i have left them outside for a year and it has shown no signs of wear rust these are very sturdy,23,177
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,not even an entire season in and several of the joints on these have snapped they are useable at the moment but if they have begun to fail already i do not imagine they will be staying in the garden for many seasons more keep looking for other cages maybe you will find something that is a better long-term investment than these,57,178
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,quick shipping and great price will add more comments to this review after I have used it,16,179
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,I am writing this after a long summer having used all ten of these in my garden they worked perfectly held up to a bummer crop of super tall super heavy tomatoes very pleased will absolutely buy them again,38,180
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,sad i purchased these this year as my tomatoes bore heavy fruit and these cheaply constructed cages could not handle them every single cage warped and bent under the weight of the tomatoes early girl sweet millions yellow john and brandywine varieties i not only would not recommend these flimsy things i consider them detrimental to any gardener,57,181
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,working well for my tomato plants although not high quality by any means,13,182
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,exactly what i expected my tomatoes are really large and the cages are holding up great,16,183
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,I am a novice gardener but i felt that this cage worked fine for my needs went into the ground easily and sturdy enough for all the plants i used them for i am using them with roma tomatoes jalapenos and red bell peppers,43,184
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,these are very flimsy I had tried my best pushing these cages through the earth and they all bent i bought over 10 of these and am very disappointed if your soil is very lightweight then these might work for you i will not buy these again too cheaply made,49,185
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these are very short and pretty flimsy compared to most cages but they seem to be doing the job edited april 28 2015 we had a very windy day late in the growing season and almost all of these cages blew over i lost a lot of tomatoes and several whole plants save your money and buy bigger better quality cages,61,186
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,i initially got these for tomatoes being a first-time tomato grower at the time i really did not know any better thinking these small cages will be enough for tomato very soon my tomatoes outgrew the cage and the plants started to bend the cages now i only use these to support smaller plants like peppers and basils so the winds do not knock these plants down i do not advise getting these cages for tomatoes but great product and cheap price to support smaller plants,84,187
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,very weak soder joints thin metal not worth the money had to replace already one month later found better for less,21,188
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,larger then i was expecting but then again i ordered it from work without a tape measure handy my plants are small right now so i tied them to one of the legs but later these will be good i expect them to last forever too,46,189
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,these worked great for my tomato plants they are not a very thick wire but they will get the job done if you are rough they will break so use them carefully the price is right,36,190
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,great for my tomatoes and peppers and at a great price too my tomato plants are not big enough to have much use of these yet but my pepper plants did great when a storm him and it was super windy can not stress enough that the price for these is wonderful i could not find these cheaper anywhere else,58,191
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,great price when starting a garden we did not know how things would turn out so we bought these which worked great on the peppers and small tomatoes but when the beefsteak plant took of it was overwhelmed by the plant if your planting larger tomatoes have some faith they will get big and get a large cage because this will not support the large fruit,65,192
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,not well made at all solder joints dont hold up these cages collapsed under the weight of my tomato plants,20,193
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,before getting them i did not expect high because of the low price when i got them they are totally more than what i expected even nicer than the ones from stores my tomatos are growing very good on them,39,194
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,as the title says i feel this was a really good product for my use i planted gladiolus and they became unruly i ordered this very quickly and think it works my flowers are upright and were able to look normal in terms of tomatoes however i really do not know if this cage would hold up really big tomato plants i have a few this year that are monsters so all in all it is a very nice lightweight and basic cage,81,195
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,10 cages for 21 with shipping the same cages are 350 per at home depot and i have to spend 3 gallons of gasoline to get to home depot the quality is ok and will last a few seasons best for smaller plants does the job,46,196
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,cheap price under 23 and cheap product at least half broken very flimsy i should have paid more for better quality cages i would not recommend this set to anyone,28,197
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,1.0,negative,these tomatoe cages are flimsy and poor quality only 9 or the 10 were in the package four of the 9 were bent i would not recommend these tomatoe cages and will not purchase them again,36,198
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,5.0,positive,sturdy and a great size for our jalapeno and bell pepper plants kind of small for tomatoes although unless you grow them in a pot,25,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,these cages are not really appropriate for tomatoes i use them for hard-to-stake perennials as stated above they are much cheaper online than i can get locally go figure,31,200
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is an easy way to measure the rainfall in your locality one or two minutes is all it takes to set up the easy-to-read gauge,28,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand consists of three thin pieces of light gauge metal connected by small rubber connectors and the rain gauge itself is connected to the stand by a small rubber connector and after assembling the pieces the result is wobbly leaning rain gauge that is barely robust enough to stand being stuck into the ground i selected the product because of the price and the old adage that you get what you paid for certainly is true in this case my recommendation pay more for a stronger and more robust rain gauge,93,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the black pieces do not stay together well to make a nice sturdy base and the plastic water holder cracked within just a few days of using it,27,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,I am not one to write negative reviews but this flimsy gauge is garbage if you filled the tube with quarters it still would not be worth the 13 plus the decorative holder is cheap plastic so cheap it is bent out of shape and barely holds the tube upright it certainly does not hold it straight i would have sent this back but i ordered it back in january and only opened it today you have been warned,74,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cute but super super super cheap flimsy plastic plastic posts would not fit tightly flopped all over gauge barely sets into the holder for the price i really expected better looked like metal which shows me i need to read the descriptions more closely this seriously looks like it could have come out of a quarter machine I am keeping it because it is more of a hassle to return but if you are thinking of purchasing it because it is cute move on and just get one of the more utilitarian ones,89,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i foolishly thought the frame was wrought iron it is just cps cheap plastic s it does not stand up straight wobbles like mad the tube is fine although it would be nice if the markings were legible from a bit of a distance,42,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,gave this as a gift and she loved it she could not wait to put it in her garden,18,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i love this rain gauge i know it is plastic and a lot of people complained about this rain gauge it is top heavy when you use all the extensions so i only used one and it stands good enough my other one was glass but during the freeze it broke this one should withstand our rough weather,58,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,threw all my boxes away it rained and it did not have any water i looked and rain guage was broken,20,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is ok the post is not as sturdy as i would have liked,12,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,rain gauge is elevated above ground so sprinkler and weed wacker are not a problem very easy to dump old water,21,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,my rainfall gauge cracked after 2 months of use in new jersey,12,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the gauge is thin plastic so make sure you take out the water guage before it freezes easy to take out and dump the water out,26,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,do not buy this rain gauge i purchased it in september and today i was checking the amount of rain and saw that it was cracked from top to bottom it was a waste of money,36,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is a nice rain gauge with a sectionallong enough for most gardens i did not use all of the sections because i was placing it on a 14 diameter pot time will tell if the markings hold up to our texas sun but the tube is plastic so maybe will not shatter or crack if rain water freezes like my glass one did,65,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,nicely made looks good the rod is made in 3 pieces and about 3 foot long,16,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,pressed fit forthat is not tight at all wobbles all over the place in a little wind,19,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to read and the stand is good,8,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,it does the job but just barely funny amount markings in 8th of an inch plastic stake does not stand firm,20,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,gauge part is very clear and nice it is why i purchased it the holder is plastic and thepart is too flexible it droops to one side with 3 of rain anyway I shall use a metal stake to strengthen it still gave it 4 stars because for the price it is still worth it,54,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,good value for simple plastic rain gauge metal stand adjustable height,12,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the plastic holder is so weak the gage cup is always on a 45 degree angle,16,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made plastic post barely stands up,8,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i know this was a reasonable price but too cheaply made will not hold up back it goes,18,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,great product i will build a better stand,8,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheap when it is in the ground it bends over especially after rain i would not recommend this,19,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the holder is not very strong when the vial gets full the bracket bends i ended up throwing it away,19,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i bought it as a gift i only gave it a 4 because i did not use it,17,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,great now since the tube is plastic it will not break as easily as others that have glass,17,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,first use measured rain but could not withstand wind cheaply made will not stand up now,15,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,plastic cup holder does not remain up right with heat and rain in gauge i love the style it just needs metal cup holder that will not bend in the heat of summer sun,34,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is all plastic but has accurate markings,8,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it was pretty flimsy would not reccommend it,8,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,kind of flimsy but should have expected that for the price that i paid,14,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,works of course catches rain water but but the stand that mimics a wrought iron stand is in fact very flimsy plastic there are three sections of plastic rods that you just force into the next section to assemble the stand we had three inches of rain overnight and it started to bend due to the weight of the water i shortened it by one section and that helped but i do not think this will last,76,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,rusted with in a day and very flimsy comes in 3 pieces and easily comes apart when you try to move it,22,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand is a bit flimsy the corned part broke off when a squirrel tried to sit on it i now have the measure type stuck into a planter that works as an alternative,34,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is junk it is not capable of standing straight up,11,37
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is a good thing to use and have,8,38
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,theis a little flimsy but otherwise it works fine,11,39
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,due the summer weather the plastic hold is deforming and really hard to keep the gauge straight,17,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,works as expected measures same as my other gauges the stand is a bit flexible but does not seem to affect accuracy,21,41
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i like the design but the way that the sections of thedevice go together leaves it being somewhat unstable thus you will need to put it somewhere that it is not going to get bumped much as this can because the sections to disconnect easy greentape would probably correct the problem but does detract a little from the appearance,62,42
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,works fine easy to read and looks good,8,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i wanted something to put outside to catch the rain but have been fearful of the brace that the gauge fits into since it is plastic and not metal,29,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i should have read the reviews or the description but the photo fooled me the gauge itself is very well made and solid the holder and the 3 pieceis the most ridiculously flimsy thing i have ever seen in my life if you do not mind making your own holder the gauge is nice,68,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,pretty well made good for the price i would order it again,12,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the plastic container will not break like a glass one,9,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very flimsy and really not worth the money bad purchase,10,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,love thiscaptures rainfall accurately easy install do not expect thisto display news report of rainfall but actual rainfall for residencel,24,49
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this gauge works great with out breaking the bank easily pushed it into the ground and it is working great catching rain water,22,50
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,when it filled to 3 it would bend over and spill the water too flimsy,15,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,first rain stake bent under weight of 2 inch returning,10,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,very flimsy for the price not sure if it will last long outdoors,13,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,kinda cheesy but for the price it is functional and unbreakable i put it in my glass tube which was always breaking holder and it measures the rain not sure if the plastic holder would hold up but the measuring tube is molded out of some pretty robust styrene so it should last much longer than glass,56,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i happen to have a piece of rebar available and i wire tied it to the rebar theis weak and wobbly and the wind can easily knock it over the top portion is all plastic and when the wind blows really hard it comes loose it is tricky to get the gauge in the cradle to where the male on the gauge to fit in the female plug at the bottom of the holder in my opinion it looks nice and for me it is in with irises and looks nice you can not see the rebar for something that can be visible by others however for practical use if you only use one section of thewith the gauge it may just work but I had be skeptical that in mind if you have a wooden dowel dark inor a piece of rebar to attach it to it works well,154,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i purchased this rain gauge after my glass gauge broke i wanted a plastic version that was sturdy yet pretty this is exactly what i got i have already dropped this gauge a couple times and it still looks perfect so this design is very sturdy i was am a impressed and recommend to anyone needing a sturdy yet decorative rain gauge,62,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,was not impressed it is plastic the gauge weighs down the holder,13,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i bought this for my friend she is very happy with it,12,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the holder is not quite the quality i would have preferred but works well and looks good the graduated cylinder is very good and easy to read i just went out and read 3 1/4 of rain last night,39,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i will have to come up with another stand good deal at 3 dollars rain vessel nice stand not able to use outdoors too flimsey,25,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it is plastic and the wind blows the guage out of the holder it is a real disappoint,18,61
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,looks nice very lightweight hope it will last for at least the whole summer,14,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,works pretty good having trouble getting it to stand upright in our garden keeps leaning over just have to find a way to secure it is all,27,63
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,oh my gosh it brought me so much good luck happy liquid sunshine and rainbows yes rainbows the week after we bought this we had record rainfall here in socal i mean like a lot of rain is this a coincidence surely not buy this rain gauge make it rain it is like magic i tell you,53,64
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was happy to find an inexpensive rain gauge but in this case the adage you get what you pay for seems to apply the black holder is very flimsy plastic and it is hard to get standing up straight and stable in the ground within a month the plastic gauge tube had cracked so now it is worthless as it will not hold water i would not buy this product again,69,65
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,should have known given the price will not stay upright plastic frame wavers in the wind,15,66
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made had to drill holes deeper and glue stand together,12,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the stand that comes with this is hilarious it is just three pieces of metal that sit inside each other a breeze would take it out,25,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,cheap plastic probably will not make it through first storm,10,69
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the stand is a little flimsy but the quality of the measuring cup and holder are nice,17,70
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,very good rain gage works good and looks very nice in the garden,13,71
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very nice to have in your yard or garden the leg extenders to not fit snugly and it does not stand completely straight out of the ground however you can lift the gauge out it is holder without disturbing the setup,40,72
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,love this rain gauge replaced two other rain gauges that i bought with this one one gauge was glass and it froze the other one was not tough enough to handle a hail storm but this rain gauge is perfect big enough and tough enough,43,73
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it only rains once a year here in the pacific northwest from october to may haha our kids are obsessed with all things weather related and were so excited to get this rain gauge set up it is a very simple design with easy enough to read markings on it in inches and mm our older ones get to empty it in order to start recording rainfall for a new day we homeschool a couple of our kids and they keep daily journals including a section on the days weather their favorite part of their journal entries is donning their raincoats and rainboot for recording the rainfall they call the gauge the test tube which is sort of what it looks like this has held up well to daily testing / emptying and has already proved itself to be fun and utilitarian,139,74
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,does it all well and yet it is very simple,10,75
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very nice being able to able to extend or shorten the height is an added bonus,16,76
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,great for the money works well it is plastic and the black holder is delicate but functional,17,77
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is the second purchase for thisthis is for a friend i love mine and is very easy to read,22,78
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it does what it is supposed to do a little on the cheaper side but for the money does a good job,22,79
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,great my mom loved it holds a considerable amount of rain water,12,80
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,if you are looking for simple functionality this is it the gauge is supported by the top so you can see all the way to the bottom of the gauge the container and mount are plastic although,37,81
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,holder is flimsy probably will not last long outside,8,82
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,grossly inaccurate i noticed heavy rains did not seem to measure up with this gauge 1fluid ounce equals 1805 cubic inches according to this gauge 1 oz 1 inch of rain,31,83
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,cute and it catches rain i hear now if it would only rain so i can see it in action,20,84
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,cracked in less than a year rendering it useless,9,85
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,nice little rain gauge with an iffy sort of stand it does what it is supposed to do but requires viewing at an particular angle,24,86
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i ordered 2 of these and one broke i contacted the company and they replaced it quick great service the unit comes in pieces the reservoir is plastic the other components are metal not fancy or indestructible but a great value for the price it does what it is supposed to,50,87
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to install and read i needed a rain gauge that did not need to be posted to a wall or fence and this works perfectly for us,27,88
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the plastic tube broke in the first freeze if you live where there is winter do not buy this,19,89
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is a very cheaply made product do not let the picture fool you the plastic parts barely fit or do not fit together at all after 20 minutes of trying to attach the main holder to the plastic rods i gave up,42,90
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we finally got some rain so now i can tell you this little gauge works fine it is rather small so you might want to find a spot close by,30,91
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,luster1646 rapitest spiral metal rain gauge with stake this looked nice enough so i thought i would try it out well sadly this is just not that great one main issue is the stake it is on should really be one single piece to make it last longer however it is not one piece but you have to assemble it and hope that it will fit together mine took a bit of work to get it to fit together right this should not be the case with a newas a result it actually did not even stay up the other day in a bit of wind and rain so i would say maybe not the best one to use there are better ones out there it did make it during a couple rains before this last one and seems accurate just did not last in the last wind we had it got knocked over where it connects together on the stake and cracked maybe if it had fit right to begin with would not have happened or better yet if the stake was a single piece not something i would suggest to anyone to get,199,92
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,thisis a little bit flimsy it looks great from a far but when you get a better look is not quite so good it becomes apparent that it is flimsy and a little bit on the cheap side so i would suggest that you look elsewhere for a rain gauge,52,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,nice quality does not look like it will fall apart or break in a few months,16,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,a sturdy and accurate rain gauge tall enough post to keep out of brush or weeds,16,95
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,basic rain gauge the post is not super thick or sturdy in our sandy soil it immediately tilted to the side it was hard to get it situated to stay upright kids enjoy tracking rainfall if you want something to last may want to spend a bit more for something sturdier but if monitoring rainfall will be a passing interest the price is right for this model,67,96
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this looks nice but is not stable enough the spike is three seperate metal pieces that fit together but they fit together loosely so the whole thing is unstable and wobbly the rain catch does not sit flat and is pushed a bit to the side by the metal curly i have tried to bend to get it straight but it just will not get level,66,97
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i received this rapitest spiral metal rain gauge for an honest review heres my take on it attractive polystyrene cylinder holds up to five inches of rainfall and is scaled for both inches and centimeters shatter and crack resistant a spiral circles the tube and adds to the look a metal adjustable stake holds the tube up to a height of 36 inches i have mine in a large oak barrel planter on my backso is safe from being knocked over i think however that placed in the ground at the 36-inch height it might be vulnerable to being knocked over it is rather cheaply made and the tube sections are somewhat wobbly but it does the job and looks nice in my planter despite the fragility it is attractive and accurate enough for my needs,138,98
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is basically garbage the cylinder is made out of plastic but the holder is so crooked that the cylinder will not stand straight so you would not get an accurate measure of your rain fall all the metal parts are cheap and I shall made if you want / need a rain gauge i advise you to look at other brands this one is pure garbage not recommended,66,99
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is very cheaply made in fact my husband was carrying to the door to put it outside and the wire that holds the gauge on the stake broke before he even got out the door needless to say it was not welded on properly or saudered but was cheaply made it is worthless now my husband was disappointed as a storm is coming tomorrow and he wanted to measure the rainfall,70,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,one if the most important times of the year for roses is the fall it is easy to forget water needs especially if you live in an area with a dry autumn i really like the gauge itself it is easy to read the stake however is a real weak link it comes in 3 pieces which fit poorly together i bagged 2 of them and just went with a short stake if you use all 3 pieces it is not very stable otherwise this worked out well for my needs,91,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the main reason i like luster1646 rain gauge is the design the spiral design makes it unnoticeable in the garden i find it very attractive to place the rain gauge under the bush however i suggest to store the rain gauge indoor during winter,46,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this is fine for the price the container is plastic which is both good and bad in my northern garden it is less likely to be damaged by unexpected frosts or damage from forgetting to take it in before winter some of my plastic oes do crack or turn cloudy the stake is fine but not as sturdy as i would like it looks decent in the garden,68,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this one comes with 3 equal-length rods that allows for placement at different heights by placing one on top of the other i was not sure if plastic or glass would be what i wanted until i accidentally hit the measuring cup with my hedge trimmer and it flew away in several pieces that when i realized i wanted plastic otherwise I had have to hunt for all the glass shards,69,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,not worth the money at all it is all plastic and i could not get the post to fit in the opening no matter how hard i tried i ended up tossing it and saving just the cylinder for an extra to go with the new rain gauge i ended up ordering,50,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the first thing i noticed was the flimsiness of the carton that this product came in the bottom literally fell out of the carton as soon as i removed it from the shipping box if the bottom had been as hard to open as the top it would have held the contents inside the next thing i noticed was the flimsiness of the metal connector rods yes they were easy to insert one into the other and they were just as easy to fall out i placed the unit into a large garden container and when i went to pull it out the bottom connector remained well inside the soil so i glued everything together now at least it will not fall apart the top is nice the spiral that holds the gauge is nice looking the gauge will fall out if the unit is tilted so place it firmly in the ground i have yet to see what the wind will do to the gauge it is supposed to rain tomorrow to be continued ok update 2017 it collects the rain assiduously and has held up remarkably well in contrast to an older rain gauge plastic that totally fell apart,200,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the rod to fit into the base that you can see in this picture did not fit into the base of the rain gage the rod was too large in diameter even after i tried reaming the hole in the connector to make the hole larger it did not fit securely i havetaped it to try to keep it together for now,63,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,we had an old yellowed rain gauge sitting in the yard since we moved in it was hard to read the bottom was a plastic spike that really was not solid enough to keep the gauge upright this one looks great and it has a metal base that you can extend to make it sit up higher husband loves this easy to read looks like really expensive glass and wrought iron,69,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we have always had a rain gauge and appreciate being able to see up close and personal the amount sturdy but the fittings do not hold tightly the whole thing rattles and moves and as a result does not stand straight even although none of them are 100 accurate the odds go up when the instrument remains vertical the markings are small and without anycontrast or a floater of some sort difficult to see it looks nice and if you are just interested in a decorative accent it is a grand addition to the yard we have a lacrosse technology 705 - 109 rain gauge that is far superior it is accurate clearly visible measures up to 6 against 5 with this one and is durable definitely not a recommended purchase,132,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,exactly what i was hoping for in looks and functionality the rod that fits into the bottom however was much bigger than the hole that it is supposed to fit into i used a drill to make the hole bigger and finally got it big enough for the rod to fit into it weird but other than that it is all good,61,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is possibly the most ridiculously terrible product i have ever purchased on amazon so terrible that I am actually taking time to write the review as it shipped i could not assemble thisthe hole in the decorative holder was too small for the stake so i had to drill it out going up 1/64 at a time until finally i could get the stake in and then it was too loose so i had to wrap it in masking tape seriously for the time i spent cursing at this thing trying to get it together i could have made my own rain gauge do not buy it also as everyone else has noted it is cheap plastic but at least that part was expected,124,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is beautiful very well made and durable i love the fact that i do not have to drill into a fence or something like you do with some gauges we have had over 12 inches of rain in the past two weeks so this will come in handy to collect my own data and not have to rely on the weather report for my measurements i think i will put it away during the cold weather months so that it will not freeze and crack,85,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,as soon as we got this rain gauge we assembled it and put it outdoors since we were getting the outside edges of a tropical storm it is a bit wobbly as you assemble it and we dropped from about a 6 foot high level the gauge itself it did not break it has worked well for the storm i have had rain gauges that were glass break in very cold weather so my hope for a polystyrene one is better i am a weather watcher and call in reports so a gauge that has inches and millimeters helps,98,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is sturdy and easy to install seems to be very accurate,12,114

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,the post connections were very loose and made the rain gauge support very unstable,14,116
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,assembly required the rain gauge did not fit on the plastic poles included without having to shave down theand even after doing so it was an I shall fit it was still difficult to get the gauge actually the device that holds the gauge i clarify on to the post the poles are not sturdy and tend tono matter how far you push them into the earth / dirt once a rain storm finally came along the gauge blew off the plasticrendering it useless rinse and repeat this rain gauge worked once only when the rain was not heavy and the wind was minimal do not waste your money,111,117

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,not what i was hoping for not sturdy and can never seem to get it straight so it properly collects the rain if you want something very basic heres yourjust not for me,35,120

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,lost one star because the holder could be sturdier but the container is very sturdy and thick slightly green-tinted clear plastic i i have a small container garden on my 3rd floor balcony and it should help me know when and how much to water especially the largest planter which behaves more like a garden bed i installed it on the balcony railing using three velcro plant test secure it to the railing the only other thing i would suggest is larger numbers so that i could read them from inside my apartment,93,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,looks like a nice device but as soon as i went to plug it into my yard the spiral broke away from the metal bottom not nearly rugged enough for use in the yard,34,123

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product the stand is cheep plastic not worth the price,14,132

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this rain gauge is very cute in the garden and the opening at the top is very large other people have mentioned that the stake does not stay together very well we had to be careful putting it in the ground but we had a huge rain with very high winds this weekend that blew over many trees around us but this rain gauge did not blow over and measured very accurately,72,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,patrs of stand do not fit tightly together resulting in tilted stand rain amounts not accurate when bent,18,136

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,using the extension rods that came with thisdid not work very well using just one has worked better,18,140
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i live on the big island of hawaii and we have shallow dirt and lots of rock we are an active volcanic island and thiswas hard to push into the ground a metal attachment near the base that you couldon to would make it way easier to put it in securely to more difficult ground types,60,141
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this rain gauge has a small opening at the top it says it measures 5 but holds the same amount of water as one that measures 2 the post pieces can not be put together because they do not fit inside of each other at either end the point on the bottom of the water holder does not fit into the hole in the yoke nothing fits together,66,142
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,sections do not stay together making the stake unsteady had to hold it together to get it in the ground did not use all 3 sections because i thought it might blow over will not return only because of the cost to return it,42,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,shockingly cheap as others have reported not just that it is 100 plastic but the black part is thin flimsy and has burrs on it from where it was injection-molded heres why i bought it although i was forewarned by the reviews i needed the measuring tube for my other rain gauge which is lovely but whose glass tube broke followed shortly by the replacement glass tube I am now using this gauges plastic tube in my original gauge i threw away the black part so i can not report on whether it is even strong enough to stand upright i see that this tube will likely break soon too but this entire flimsy rain gauge cost less than half what my previous replacement tube cost and that one broke in a few weeks mystified that it is so difficult to buy a rain gauge that is attractive not overpriced and reasonably sturdy,147,144
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,measures well but not stay together all the time,9,145
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we stuck the rain gauge into the lawn between mowings so it got weekly handling three months after purchase the wire coil held to the base by a small weld snapped loose and could not be reattached we were already dissatisfied because the inch markings are not in the usual tenths but eighths,53,146
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the material this was made of appeared lower quality it is not a substantial product the lawn service broke it it may have broken anyway if it was made of a better material but i feel it was not the best quality in any account,44,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,now we just need some rain to measure nice looking rain gauge but it is untested so far in so,21,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is real nice however the holder is somewhat flimsy plastic made to look like iron mine sticks outta the ground about 2 feet,23,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is nice that it is plastic rather than glass it looks good and is functional,16,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk it will not go together and if you manage to get the poles together it wobbles and they fall apart i am so disgusted with this i just threw it away i can not be bothered returning it the packing was terrible on thisnot the amazon packaging i would not recommend this to anyone,61,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i purchased to replace broken vile in iron gauge holder fit perfectly the vile is easy to read I am giving 4 stars because the holder is thin plastic and i do not think the holder would last more than 2 years in my strong southwestern sun it would be easy to mount on a fence or woodenbecause i only wanted the vile i think it is well worth the cost,71,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,it is what i wanted and is perfect with it is rods to make it higher or lower to the ground,20,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,listen to the other reviews this is of very poor quality i would laugh if i picked it up at the store to examine it metal is made of cheap thin pot metal and the clear plastic tube flops around because it is too small a fit talk about false advertisement total junk,51,154

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,rickety poor construction should be more solidly built theis made from 3 pieces they barely fit together since this is outside i do not see how it can withstand a strong wind i have not used it yet just put it together i want to return it please send information so i may return this product,63,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,nice rain gauge it has easily read numbers in american measurements,11,163

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,easy to stick in the ground in an open area for accuracy easy to read,15,169
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,gauge works fine the stake is a little flimsy but for the price i enjoy knowing how much rain my front yard is getting more of a recreational gee-whizthan anything for my household i imagine if you are looking for more accurate purposes you might want to go buy an expensive unit,53,170
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,for the price it is great when the first one arrived cracked they were very responsive and replaced it quickly,19,171
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i bought this rain gauge for my husband as a surprise gift he is having so much fun keeping track of this crazy el nino rainfall the perfect gift for him,31,172
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,I have bought 3 different rain gauges and this was the cheapest and by far the best i have two young children who love checking the rainfall levels when it rains the first one i bought was part of a thermometer and rain gauge set the thermometer was at the bottom and the rain gauge sat on top the problem was that the rain gauge was made out of glass my 7 year old picked it up to look at the rainfall totals accidentally dropped it and it was ruined within the first week the luster1640 rainfall gauge is made out of plastic this is much more kid friendly the second rain gauge i tried was super cute but totally unusable frog decorative rain gauge the frog would not stand up and just tipped over every time we tried to collect rain although it was really cute it was completely useless in collecting rain the lusteris perfect it sticks firmly into the ground is easy to read is made of plastic and still looks nice to have in the garden my favorite rain gauge yet and the best price as well,196,173
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the guage has come in very handy with all the rain we have had i like the way there is a small plastic nub on the bottom which fits into the stand to hold the measuring cup,37,174
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,did not know this was a solar light also cool,10,175
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,like others have written photos look nice but are very deceiving the gauge is made of flimsy plastic and poorly crafted for some reason i assumed the product was metal at this price point it should have been i have come to rely on amazon prime to weed out such obviously inferior products but perhaps they have not found this one yet a 199 price on this would have been appropriate the buyer then would know it was a one season throw-away,83,176
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,it is big and easy to read the bottom of the collector has a detent so it fits into the holder securely however this is the problem because the collector can not freely align via gravity the unit has to be installed perfectly vertically to be effective because the frame is plastic it is almost impossible to align it perfectly vertically i would not buy again and i do not recommend this design if i can find a holder that grabs the collector at the oversized lip i think i can still use the collector tube,95,177
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,dog ate it within a week of me putting it in the garden should have known as he ate the one before this one too but it worked well until then,31,178
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,good rain gauge it is easy to read and comes with a stand to make sure it catches the rain the only thing i would say is that the stand is a bit wobbly but it is fine so far if necessary we will attach a dowl rod to it for further support the price is inexpensive and i would say it is a good buy i would recommend this to a friend,74,179
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i wanted a rain gauge so that i could see how much rain fell in my neighborhood i live in a city where actual rainfall can be 50 over or under what the weather folks say has fallen unfortunately since i purchased it it is only rained once but i do not think it is the fault of the gauge itself it is easy to read and empty and is pretty unbreakable,68,180
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,thiswas pretty light the 3 piece plastic stand was weak and shaky i would rather have paid more for a more substantial piece of equipment,27,181
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,just what we needed and great service too,8,182
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,simply put thisis cheaply put together the measuring cup itself is plastic but of a good size and the markings are very legible the decorative metal housing pad and connecting rods stink they do not fit together well thus making the entire aparatus warbly and unstable terrible,49,183
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,arrvd on time and well pkd put it out in the yd just in time for a torrential downpour 25,20,184
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,my daughters boyfriend has a big garden and loves having this,11,185
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,we dont typically get much rain here but a huge storm that came although ths week-end allowed us to record actual rainfall,22,186
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i think it was very low quality when i put it in the yard the hold was too wiping to hold up the cup kind of hard to measure the rain when it leans over so far the black part is very cheap plastic,44,187
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i love it it was delivered fast great price and looks beautiful in my garden,15,188
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it looked cute for a while and worked okay but after less than a year it cracked so all rain leaks out before we can read it,28,189
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,the glass container and holder are very attractive however the poles to put in the soil that attached together do not fit tightly and in fact provide a very unsteady holder poorly made for it is intended purpose,37,190
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,it is junk shaft bends with even a lite wind,10,191
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,section broke off when my husband took it out of the box very cheaply made,16,192
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i really like this rainfall gauge i set it up in the yard where i can see it from the window to check the rain fall,26,193
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for one month in the sun and the plastic was shot,16,194
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,i have this rain gauge and it works well easy mount just do not try to use the screws that come with it as the heads strip easily catches rain and easy to read from five feet away nice low cost only drawback is the limited capacity measures up to 5,51,195
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,wow this came to me just before the fall rains and it works great it seems very accurate fits well in my garden quick shipping,25,196
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we mounted this on ourit looks great and it right on the reading of how much rain we get,21,197
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,we have not received any rain since i purchased this i am sure it will work just fine i like the size it is bigger than a standard size rain gauge and the opening is larger measurements are easy to see,42,198
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,this has a real flimsy plasticwhich holds the guage you push this into the dirt for it to stand up it fell over the first time it rained as it got full i think that speaks for itself,40,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this gauge comes with a stake that permits the gauge to be higher than ground level stopping splash filling of the gauge for the young weather person it permits gathering of weather info in a simple and accurate form and at a fair price,44,200
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product did not even last one rain storm the plastic holding the rain gauge is very flimsy so when the gauge is full the whole thing easily tips over,29,201
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,not all the parts were in the package the measurments on the side were wrong i want over them with a magic marker to see the correct measurment i would not order from this company again,36,202
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,very pretty seemed accurate cracked after a bad snowstorm and all that is left is the post do not really want to buy a new one,24,203
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this product is simple inexpensive and even although it is entirely constructed out of plastic it looks elegant it is easily read and accurately records the rainfall amounts as long as you put it in the proper areas this product does not have any directions for the proper placement and the proper way to read it if you need help the following sites may come in handy copy and paste them into your browser 1 for proper placing go to [ ] 2 for the proper way to read the rain gauge go to [ ],94,204
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,why did not i read the reviews before i bought this or perhaps i could have noticed that it is not metal and glass more like dollar store products and only holds 15 inches of rain i would have to go out in the rain to empty it it is in the trash,50,205
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this is a very good rain guage the numbers are large enough so it is very easy to read it is a good price too,25,206
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i think this rain guage is really made cheaply theis very flimsy i have another rain guage and they never measure the same this one measures about 1/2 of what the other one does although i do not know which one is correct,44,207
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,all plastic the gauge itself cracked after the first year and i hesitate to try and replace it with another as it only measures 1 1/2 in of rain when first ordered thewas missing but the company did send me a whole new gauge includingwhich was nice still it is cheaply made,55,208
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very poor qualitypieces will not hold together and everything is very thin and lightweight it would never stay up in oklahoma winds,23,209
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,i attempted to return it when i received it because it was so cheaply made and was told just to keep it and they would refund my money never had anything like that happen before anyway saved shipping it back which i appreciate,42,210
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,this product replaced the rain gauge portion of an elaborate hi-tech back porch weather station it works great clear large numbering is easy to see from kitchen window and as i take my dogs right past it several times a day it is an easy thing to reach out and empty when needed,52,211
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,very satisfied with the product looked all over for a good foot brush cute will look good on our patio,20,212
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i guess i should have looked closer at the description as i was disappointed that the black part was made of cheap plastic and the container also very thin and lightweight this is a design flaw as when the gauge has any water it does not stand up well,48,213
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this was broken when i received it it is made of cheap thin plastic material i figure i get what i paid for was not worth the trouble to return trashed it,32,214
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,i liked the style of the product but the measuring printing was not correct wish i had known this before purchasing product,22,215
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,stands up in the dirt easily and is not difficult to read from a distance plastic tube removes easily for outing out water,23,216
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,luckily the plastic gauge cup matches one on a gauge i already have so i can use it there when the rest of this thing craps out the multi-piece stake is a joke will not stay together falling apart at the least touch or gust of wind fortunately the one-piece raises the gauge enough to get it up in the open if you pay more than 3 for this you are getting hoodwinked,73,217
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this rain gauge is cheaply made of plastic and only measures 1 1/2 not even worth the money and shipping not recommended,22,218
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,we use it to get a generalof rainfall not an accurate scientific measurement pros measures rainfall nice flourish on the holder consis flimsy and tends to bend gauge dropped once on a stone from about 3 and cracked i glued the gauge and still use it but i will replace it when i get around to it,61,219
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was looking to replace a cheap rain gauge that i had for years this one is cheap but does not do the job and is not worth the few bucks it costs the holder is so flimsy that the rain catcher has a slight tilt the catcher is much too wide so that it fills up to the top with a good rainfall a near accurate reading is impossible my son knew i was looking for one and bought me one as a surprise his gauge will read an inch whereas the lustera few feet away is almost overflowing,102,220
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,weak plastic and does not hold up well in a rain storm needs to be of a heavier gauge post to hold it upright i had to reinforce it with glue not your best choice for a rain gauge luster1640 rainfall gauge,47,221
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,very flimsy and the plastic gauge only measures up to 1 and a half inches,15,222
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,2.0,negative,more cheaply made then i thought it would be the stake bends when put in the ground,17,223
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product was much cheaper and more flimsy than i expected disappointed but i guess i should have known since i did not pay much for it it just looked alot nicer online than it really was once i got it,40,224
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,i was a bit surprised at how weak the support stick is for the rain gauge even with no rain in it it does not stand straight it just waves in the wind as soon as rain hits it it pretty much bends to the ground it also only holds 15 inches of rain believe it or not it rains more here than that every now and then and i can not measure it heck i could not measure it anyway because as soon as the rain starts to fill it it bends over and loses most of the water yes this is a cheap product but save your money and purchase something of quality,112,225
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,poor quality and bad design describe this rain gauge in the picture it looks great but in actuality it is flimsy and frustrating the spindly little post that sticks in the ground has the strength of gumby every time it gets more than a half inch of rain in it it tips over i should not have assumed this was made of glass and metal but i can warn future buyers i wonder if this originally came from the dollar tree,81,226
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this product was recently purchased and recently returned the numbers on the gauge did not equate to any accurate measures in inches or meters there were numbers and line measurements but they made no sense at all maybe you are supposed to guess the rainfall amounts if you are an accurate guesser then this is the gauge for you i was embarrassed to have given it as a gift,69,227
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,well what can you say it is cheap built cheap looks cheap perfors cheap call your local weather,17,228
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,when i first got this gauge i was confused the tube was huge but the highest demarcation was only 15 inches i had another gauge that was of similar size but that ones highest marking was 5 inches i was ready to presume that the lustergauge was incorrectly marked however before i registered a complaint i decided to check with my neighbor who happens to be a meteorologist he explained that the gauge was correctly marked the lustergauge has flanges that angle out and because of the angle out edges it collects more rain than the gauges that have straight edges on the tube so even if it strikes you as being out of kilter it will be accurate if you believe a meteorologist,127,229
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this rain gauge is a nice looking lawn ornament but the stand is so skinny that it does not make it that sturdy a strong wind would bend it,28,230
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,one note it measures only 15 of rain our old one measured up to 2 around here that is significant,19,231
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,what a wonderful guage and looks great in the flower bed easy to read dump the water great price too,19,232
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,it is just a simple rain guage so not sure how glowing of a review one can give it is a little hard to get back in the holder but works fine and is actually kind of pretty to look at the tube is plastic not glass like i expected but seems durable enough would recommend,56,233
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,5.0,positive,the gauges are a terrific buy sturdy enough to sink into the ground attractive and inexpensive,16,234
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the lusterrainfall gauge is wonderful this gauge is easy to read and stays where you put it the best on the market,24,235
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,this is the first rain gauge i have ever owned and i find it fun to observe how much rain we received although it is made of plastic I am wondering how it will hold up to the outdoor elements and if you will be able to read the gauge when the desired location is in the open and it gets alot of sunshine i wonder if the plastic cup will become hard to read in time the stake is alittle flimsy but i have mine pushed in the ground pretty deep so it is not as tall as on windy days it tends to move with the wind i did not realize how much rain an inch is til i seen the gauge i was alittle disappointed that it only registers 15 inches i guess that is alot of rain and you can dump it out and add to the amount of rainfall you keep getting I have made sure to bring it inside when it is calling for freezing temperatures at night but i like it for my first one and for the price it is made for an interesting conversation piece i think it blends well with the landscape and looks nice,197,236
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,the product was exactly what it was represented as shipping was fast andarrived in good shape,18,237
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,this is the biggest piece of crap i have ever bought it looked really nice in the picture but when you get it there has all kinds of spots on it where you can see where they were attached to other pieces i could have bought this at the dollar store and got a better made product also i can not get it together it is very simple just connect them but it is so cheaply made that it will not stay together even with tape surrounding the connector joints they will not stay there has not enough room in the joints for the rods to sit somehow I am going to have to drill bigger holes so they will stay I am very unhappy with this product,119,238

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,1.0,negative,generator is unusable air filter box and cover are both broken in my opinion this is not something that happened in shipping as it is up on top of the motor and completely covered by the top plastic cover i can only assume this was smashed and then assembly finished do not waste your time just go to the store and purchase,61,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,1.0,negative,customer reviews are for other customers to make informed decisions this product does not work it does not generate electricity it does not even start the generac xg10000e i bought online only to avoid sales tax was doa nobody wants to carry a brand new 300lbs generator around to get it fixed i do not either apparently many of you will receive a generator that will not start and when this happens the only thing you can do is to file a formal dispute with your credit card company nobody else will be of any help unless you are willing to spend days and dollars trying to fix a brand new product,124,5

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,4.0,positive,the handle broke almost immediately and it is not exactly something that is easy to take in for service besides i use it as a whole house backup so i am not moving it too much the directions to get started were horrible so use your common sense and connect the battery before trying to start it they did not tell me that or otherwise hid that part but it fires up every time and i am glad i bought it,82,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001UNK6GY,5.0,positive,i just set up this generator similar to other reviewers experience it would not turn over for me on it is first start luckily i had already read reviews on other sites i think the generac site which provided some useful advice you need to fill thetank more than halfway full for it is first start after having repeated problems with 4 gallons in i added another 3 gallons ofand it started right up i can not yet comment on it is performance and reliability I shall update my review if i encounter problems but on paper and based on other reviews this generator should be great,106,10

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,I am satisfied with this purchase it is true that the screen is hard to read from an angle but i do not find that too inconvenient it has a forecast feature that i do not understand where is it getting that information from the manual does not say anyhow it tells the time temperature and humidity which is why i bought it,60,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,i liked the design and style of this product it is also very comfortable to see time and temperature at the same time,22,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,made in china unit was missing terminals for batteries to connect had to make terminals out of aluminum foil did not want the hassel of taking back to the post office and returning after buiding terminals got unit to work why can not we make a clock in the united states,48,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,plus side it displays the temperature and humidity down side horrible documentation and as other reviewers have said the screen is awful hardly visible except at very specific angles it reminds me of my powerbook 520c from 1994 display technology has come a long way since then but nobody told la crosse also there are little emoticons on the display but it only ever looks like and i have nowhat that means,75,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,5.0,positive,a nice and fair priced product i especially like the illumination feature so you can easily read it when the lighting is low seems to be very accurate and responds quickly / well to temperature changes,34,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,i wanted a cheap digital humidity gauge for my condo this one works well but has a major flaw the display is only visible from a certain angle above the unit i can not read it on my desk sitting down but if i stand up i can see the numbers i bought two one to mount on the wall but if i did that i would not be able to read it at all anything would be better i know this is a low cost unit but really this is the worst I have seen for viewing angles,96,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,can i give it zero stars my needs are simple and i do not even care if it is hard to read but this thing simply does not work it sounds the little beep when batteries are inserted but then does not respond when you press the mode / set thingie or any of the other buttons for that matter I am not an idiot with electronic devices so i assume that it is defective the websites support consists of an email form to contact the company and the manufacturer wants a 5 postage fee for returning it i can probably get a refund from the retailer but this is turning into a lot of work,109,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,whether or not this product provides accurate climate data is academic because you generally have to be an acrobat to read it you must be situated at the precise vertical angle from the display or the screen appears totally blank however since the expense to return it exceeded the price of thewe just use it for a paperweight guess this purchase confirms the old adage about getting what you pay for,73,7

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,4.0,positive,pros 1 has a hanging loop 2 reads temperature accurately enough room temp within 1 degree boiling water within 4 degrees 3 highest temperature is reached fast and according to specs in 15 to 20 seconds 4 has stainless steel tynes 5 auto feature works cons 1 backlit light does not remain on will require a flashlight to see temperature when cooking at barbecue 2 auto feature is too difficult to use because backlight is off fork does not beep and backlight does not flash when target temp is reached instead you must look for a tiny arrow to flash comment this is a state-of-the-art device unfortunately the autofeature does not work as stated in the directions rendering it useless in spite of this the fork serves my needs being sure fish and poultry have cooked to a safe temp i do not need the auto features therefore i give the fork a 4/5 because backlit light does not remain onand because beep feature does not work,167,2

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,1.0,negative,this is supposed to provide quick readout of meat temperature you will burn you hand off if you stick the fork into the meat while on the grill it takes a long time to get a read out when the read out finally reaches the temperature it is not acccurate it would be great if what you want is to grill meat until it is a dried out piece of leather,71,10

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B005HONZ5Q,2.0,negative,the clock itself was ok and i liked the looks of it however the humidity clock did not work and the time part was spattered with some type of paint when i called umas customer service they told me to put a battery in it which i explained i already had he then told me to email a mike when i did not get a response from mike after 24 hrs i contacted amazon and immediately had a return label and a credit thank you amazon i finally did get an email back from uma stating mike was out and they would be happy give me a rma but i had already returned the clock via amazon and received my credit i then read a couple of reviews on this clock and apparently there is a issue with all 3 units working on this clock,144,1

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B005HONZ5Q,1.0,negative,very disappointed advertised as metal well i guess it is it is pressed tin the thermometer is pronounced in centigrade fahrenheit is in very small numbers the welds are very poor metal burnt through caps and joints are poor and left open good place for wasps and insects to hide it is also hinged in the middle with the hinges welded on crooked i had to rebend them to make the top open correctly well the best that it can with the way it was put together again disappointed,87,7

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B005HONZ5Q,4.0,positive,i would have liked a different hanging option it is no bad but i was hoping for more than plastic anchors for the outside of my house it is really pretty and looks just as i would have hoped but i had to reassemble the parts back into the thermometer i hope i did it right,53,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B005HONZ5Q,1.0,negative,the thermometer on it stopped working within 2 weeks of hangin it up such a waste of money not worth the price,22,12

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B005HONZ5Q,2.0,negative,beautiful but the only thing that is accurate is the time even in the shade on a 79 degree day it reads 100 humid southern days after a storm and it says it is dry if it were accurate I had give it 5 stars since it is beautiful on my patio wall,49,20

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5.0,positive,good quality seeds they germinate as expected without extra care once the plant develop roots it can spread out by itself i can not buy this plant in the grocery store because is not well known in the united states i like it in some soups and stews,46,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,it was packed well i followed the instructions and planted 3 - 4 seeds in each of the 8 tiny starter pots i have 2 weeks later and nothing i will give it another extra days in case it takes it longer time to germinate before giving up on those seeds i will try another series of pots if nothing happens i will assume there is something wrong with the seeds the picture shows the situation 2 weeks after planting the seeds update i contacted the seller and no response,88,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,the seeds did not sprout i planted them the same day with my marigold plant in planting starters that i kept inside due to njs variable temperature at this time a year the marigolds are ready to be transplanted they are 3 inches tall the lovage did not germinate at all,52,6

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,major disappointment they did not germinate waste of money,10,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4.0,positive,i live in florida and i realized after ordering these that late spring might not be the best time here to grow this but i tried anyway germination rates were good but i think they are sensitive to the heat here it is unbelievable out there right now i am going to try again in the fall I shall update later this herb is amazing although the small amount i did manage to grow smells just like celery leaves and are perfect for soups,81,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4.0,positive,i ordered this after a different packet failed to even sprout these ones did sprout but very slowly maybe it was my fault since i may have planted them a little too late in the year next time I am going to plant them indoors and have lovage throughout the winter great for vegetable soups,54,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,4.0,positive,this birdhouse arrived in time as stated and is very good quality i would have given it 5 stars if it had a rope on top to hang,28,0

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,4.0,positive,bought this to paint for a nursery it was crafted very well and took paint easily it is really cute hanging over the crib,23,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,this birdhouse is cute but overpriced i have purchased others at lower cost i purchase unfinished birdhouses and the use a theme to paint them this one needed a bit more sanding before i could paint and i lost some of the profit i would have made for the finished piece because it was priced higher,56,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,my grandson was delighted with thishe is 6 years old and loves to work with wood he painted it and was thrilled with results greatfor the summer to keep youngsters busy and stimulates the brain sas well,41,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,although the birdhouse is beautiful and nicely made it was not what i expected i wish the seller had said it was a small decorative inside piece i have paid 1 in stores for very similar ones and brought them home for a rainy day project for my children to paint the price plus s h was way too much to ask for this,63,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,i was looking for a regular wood unfinished birdhouse one large enough to hold actual birds this is way too small and i can not find reasonably priced 5 - 8 wood plain birdhouses on your site you are asking me to pay an additional 5 plus to return this 5please advise,51,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,this birdhouse is very small for decorative use only,9,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,i did not realize they were so small cute sturdy but a tad pricey if you like small decorative you had love these,21,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,broke apart in my hands while installing cheaply made shoddy workmanship,11,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,4.0,positive,much smaller than i realized probably will return product since i was looking to paint it and this would be a bit difficult due to size very light weight with some imperfections would be good for a spring wreath or other small craft project made in china,47,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,so small i think the wasp do not even want to nest in it,13,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,4.0,positive,paints up nicely and now adorns my back fence,9,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,these are already put together and nice quality we used acrylic paint to dress them up and it seemed to stick well,22,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,this is for decoration only i did not see that anywhere in theinformation waste of money if you want a real birdhouse,24,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,this birdhouse became a watermelon my mother-in-law loves watermelons and she says these sell first at her craft shows it was light weight and easy to handle the wood is just right for acrylic paints and dries quickly,37,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,poor quality does not come with parts to hang it in a tree or a way to put seeds in it i would not recommend this product,27,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,disappointed it was so small and it came apart twice,10,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,high quality construction i have bought several of these to paint,11,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,this is cute but not a real house for real birds 1 too small for any bird I am familiar with 2 no ventilation holes and 3 the lightweight construction would be destroyed by a predator and/or the elements in no time fine as a decorative craftbut not for actual birds therefore the description is in accurate and misleading,60,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,5.0,positive,my wife loves to paint bird houses and this one is very nice,13,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,4.0,positive,the birdhouse is nice but it is kind of small thanks,11,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,photos are very deceptive it is tiny and the bottom fell off of it,14,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,2.0,negative,over half of the bird houses have come apart i wonder if these are for decoration only but i used them for bird houses and have had them falling apart,30,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,very disappointing part of the bottom was broken off when it arrived and there was nothing to hang it with my kids were disappointed with it they had been excited to paint it,33,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B007Q2510E,1.0,negative,this is a rip off not for real birds,9,25
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,i use this for a rainforest reptile habitat it works great and makes feeding easier i like that my reptiles go right up to it after i place it in the tank and i can watch them feed more easily if you buy this make sure you clean it the next day i am sure this has nothing to do with the design of the product but i have found that one or two crickets will die inside each feeding,80,0
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this another great exo-terra product very well made and functional it is surprisingly heavy and thick and very durable safe for my chameleon or any reptile perfect for supplement coating and feeding crickets,32,1
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i really like theof this but i purchase 35 small crickets for my beardie and dumped them in and i could not close the bottom lid fast enough and oops like 15 got free not cool,37,2
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,my bearded dragon only went to this twice i have better chance to just toss 5 to 10 crickets in for him to chase around looks nice in the terrarium although,31,3
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,does not fit together snugly to keep crickets in,9,4
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my beardie loves it it comes in his tank and he knows what has gon na go down,16,5
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,total junk the pieces barely fit together and the plug will not stay in i have to tape it closed my bearded dragon immediately tried to walk onto the rock in which all of the pieces came crumbling down and crickets were everywhere i would try to return it but i doubt they shall take it back after I have used it once you couldsomething much better,65,6
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,our bd loves this feeder i only give it 4 stars because it is pretty hard to get the crickets in the rock and keep them in there before closing the rock everytime I have tried at least one or two crickets would escape until we bought another product called lees kricket keeper the kricket keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out you can get a lot of crickets at once we now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock then we place the rock in the terranium unplug the hole and our bd will basically sit in front of the opening and grabs each cricket as soon as it approaches the opening,132,7
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i like thebehind this feeder it feels substantial it looks good but it has significant flaws the stopper does not fit and requires modification to make it useful probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store but the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed this may not matter too much with smaller lizards but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you are a dragon just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process so while refrigerated crickets are easy tointo an opened cricket rock warmed up crickets are even easier to get out if you are a dragon by kicking the rock open add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I shall be a customer for life otherwise buy with caution,180,8
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,1 the little cork to lock in the crickets was way to loose 2 the crickets felt it was their safe place and stayed in instead of crawling out to be eaten alive,34,9
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,very bad quality does not work and is complete garbage it is most certainly not worth the money,18,10
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,great way to coat the crickets with calcium and it looks good in my water dragons home,17,11
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,it is very hard to cover crickets with calcium powder every morning somehow to be sure our baby bearded dragon gets his essential nutrients so we use this rock to do it we sprinkle a small amount of calcium powder inside the rock every morning we place 3 - 5 large / small crickets inside covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container after turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner they get fully coated with the calcium the crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder the goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for it is future meal to pop out it makes for a very happy and healthy dragon at play with his / her food baby bearded dragon also likes to climb on the rock and rest a bit good purchase arrived on time and a very hard sturdy design,172,12
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,works good if you want a lazy dragon ours would sit and wait for each cricket and snatch them right out of the hole we have a baby and he loves chasing them now that we quit using this,39,13
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,worked like a charm and made our hungry hungry geckos happy by giving them all the live hunting food they needed while we were gone now if i can just get the mister automated they will be set,38,14
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,got this because i was going out of town and did not have any one to feed my bearded dragon i put crickets calcium food and a girl water in the rock and with the darkness the crickets stayed in and would of course come out for the bearded to eat bc when i got home there were no crickets dead or alive in the cage and my beardie was not hungry or malnourished,73,15
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the piece to close hole keeps falling out,8,16
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,if you are like me and not a fan of having crickets around your house this is a bit complicated to get them into without them jumping out before you can cover them but it does what i need it too and i use a 2nd person to help me fill it and close it quickly,56,17
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,i purchased thisthinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder usually i purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes but for whatever reason they started dying quicker the very first time i used this to powder the crickets my beardies were so happy it was like a buffet the only issue is getting the crickets in and not wasting them the crickets were jumping out as i was putting them in the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage and when i opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside although i had only put in a few at a time i guess for someone more experienced with thisit could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets i would not recommend it at all,168,18
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,got this for my chameleon it works great to coat the crickets in the calcium dust but the little plug falls out way too easy so we do not really use it we just block it with a finger when we shake to coat the crickets and it works out fine,50,19
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,captain for hole broke a little piece but waited due to lost shipment for too long to return works just fine lizard enjoys hunting crickets that come out,28,20
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,put 12 fresh pin head crickets in added calcium and shook plug fits horribly and does not hold them in nor do i think it would hold the dragon out from getting in in my opinion it is made upside down as you have to keep the lid which has the logo trademark and writing facing upwards on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out anyways put all 12 in let a few escape he ate and then i put plug back in went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews waste of money and time to us,119,21
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my bearded dragon loves hunting the crickets out of this it has gotten him way more active then he has been in the past and let us me cut back on the amount of supplament powder i use since i can save it in the rock,45,22
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this rock looks so natural in my frogs habitat i have a rock fountain and added moss i do not use the cricket powder i use cricket drink to bellymy crickets but i can tap several into this rock and put it in the tank pull the plug and let the hunt begin,54,23
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,i bought this on a whim and i have to say i am pretty pleased with this purchase it gets the crickets perfectly dusted and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out my dragon sucks at hunting so this was ideal for him if i dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them but some days i would not have time to individually feed him until he was done now he sits by this rock when he has hungry and makes sure he gets every single one also helps with me not wasting as much calcium / multivitamin dust as i was before,108,24
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,the bottom part does not even fit properly vitamins and crickets easily escape and create a mess if you try to shake it not sure if mine was defective or if they are all this bad,35,25
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,plug was too loose and at the angle it would not stay in,13,26
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this thing is genius i got it with very little expectations and got so much more it is made of great heavy material which is perfect for a heavy monitor that likes to ransack his cage and thebehind it is amazing really helps during feeding times,47,27
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,first off you will need a cricket funnel scoop rainbowmealworms has them for 750 linked below scoop them up in the scoop add vitamin powder to the cricket feeder dump crickets inside and then close shake to coat them if you have finicky eaters this works like a charm the exo terra cricket feeder stimulates the natural hunting / feeding instincts as i sit here typing this i am watching my three female breeder bearded dragon sit patiently picking off crickets one by one [ ],83,28
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,would have given it 5 stars but the little plug does not fit anywhere close to snugly if you have this problem the quick fix is a small rubber band wrapped around the plug and then it snugs on pretty good so the good nice way to feed your pet usually the crickets come out one by one and give the pet some time to breath b / t crickets,67,29
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,it does take either 2 people or to refrigerate the crickets first so you do not have crickets jumping out everywhere i read the reviews first so i have not made that mistake my beardie is really enjoying this and it made adding calcium powder easier,44,30
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,this is a pretty cool product my bearded dragon anxiously awaits the crickets and attacks as they come out of the rock,22,31
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,awesome exo cricket feeder it is durable has a lid to the top and an exit spot with a cork like cover makes for a lazy lizard to get their crickets laughing out loud,32,32
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,my leopard geckos love this and i love that it promotes natural hunting habits with my animals,17,33
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,hard to use theis good but it almost impossible to get the crickets in without them getting everywhere,20,34
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,terrible product good luck getting the lid on before the crickets are hopping all over your house it serves as a hidey hole for crickets to escape being eaten this product is poorly designed,34,35
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,this is totally worthless first the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder when you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free second how do you get the crickets into the feeder every time i tried the crickets just climbed out it took some time to get even a few to stay in long enough to close the lid bottom the few i got into the feeder never came out unless you think this would make a good ornament for your tank do not buy it,108,36
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,greatbut you have to get use to putting crickets in at first,14,37
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,it is very difficult to get live crickets into this rock i lose about 1/2 each time which i consider a waste you can not pour them into the rock without them jumping out all over the house the ones you do get into the rock come right out once you remove the plug either mine is defective which i doubt or this is just not a good,68,38
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,received quickly and brand new as described tried to use it to keep crickets for my frog for a couple days and they all ran out within 5 minutes it was a waste,33,39
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,this thing sucks I have tried so many ways to make it work but every time i try to use it crickets always escape my beardie just climbs on it if i wanted a rock for him i would have gotten one from the backyard and tossed it in the oven,49,40
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,thislooks more natural than typical feeders but not very practical and takes up valuable floor space crickets easily escape while filling more than just a few at a time some users have recommended putting crickets in the freezer for a few minutes to make them a little slower but why should i have to go through extra steps just to use this easy-to-use feeding rock crickets also tend to use this as a hiding spot and not come out when they are not running for their lives trying to escape before you get it closed it makes a good decoration but that is about it,105,41
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,do not even bother buying this unless you feel as if you have money to waste absolute waste of money not even worth the 1 worth of crickets i used this with,31,42
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,horrible to get crickets into does not fit tight and it is just not worth the time and money would not recommend,20,43
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,this product is very creative it is just alittle hard to get the crickets in and the lid closed before they are all over the house my secret is to do it in the kitchen sink so when a few do get away they can be caught more quickly,49,44
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,although this is a very very sturdy product and it is as shown it is very heavy but this biggest problem is the taste of it my dogs would not put it in their mouth they would run away every time i got the toy out so i started smelling it and it has a plastic / rubber smell to it and taste yes i tried it if my dogs can put it in their mouth then i want to know what is in it i have kept them because they are just too cute maybe someday i can get a picture but that is about all i will be able to do with them i am sorry because i really wanted them and thought that my dogs would have funhumunga tongue large for medium large xlarge dogs,138,0
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my dog absolutely loves this tongue she literally wore her other one down to a little nub and i could not find one at any stores i found this and was so excited i ordered it and had it within a few days my dog puts it in her mouth and runs around with it she sleeps with it and takes it everywhere she looks so funny worth every penny,69,1
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my scottish terrier loves these toys this is the 4th and 5th ones we have bought and duff plays with them just about every night,25,2
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the rubber feels relatively durable and this is a great toy for photo opportunities however within less than 5 minutes my boxer / hound started chipping away from the tip of the tongue he is pretty hard on toys although my other two dogs probably would have savored it for a few days before focus turned to destroying it,57,3
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,my shepard mix had the ball section of the toy ripped apart in less than 5 minutes it is advertised as durable but it is not do not buy if your dog chews at all if possible i would give it 0 stars,43,4
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this dog toy has packaging that warns that it is not to be chewed with good advice because the rubber merely crumbles apart even in my hands no small choking hazzard and a lousy toy that the dog is not even supposed to play with,44,5
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for my daughters dogs they treated it like any chew toy we did not get the results that were shown in the photo their little mouths do not fit around the ball portion of the tongue if you are purchasing this for photos do not bother huge disappointment,51,6
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,great fun for pet and family and better than all stimulates people to play more often with your pet fantastic,20,7
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i have two small dogs and both love this toy it always gets laughs from on-lookers but it does not float if you plan on using it near water,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,new puppy is quite the chewing machine she enjoyed this toy a lot and it has lasted quite a long time about a quarter of it is missing but still loved by my dog she does not tend to pick it up by the ball part although so the silliness quotient is lessened,52,9
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,very pleased and so is our dog it is strong enough for him as he is an active chewer,19,10
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for our 60 lb lab mix and although he has enjoying playing with what has left of it it is only taken him about 15 minutes to get it to this point shredded to pieces by my estimate having paid around 15 for the thing this is a 60 / hour toy as you would need four of them to last a full hour as an aside I am a little annoyed at the fancy boutique pet shop that sold it to me it is one thing if i picked it up at kmart or some other discount store where i would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that i was buying a piece of crap but in this case i think it is incumbent upon the owner / operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had to be candid about just how delicate thisis I had be much more inclined to patronize his business if he had done so,165,11
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a cute toy but was not lab tested until yesterday and did not survive as it has a rip in it so it will be going back in the toy box too bad it did not last longer so that we could get a cute picture also picture shows 2 and you only get one,56,12
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it is very cute and funny but my bulldog chewed it up right away thank goodness he did not eat the pieces he chewed off,25,13
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it appears to be a tough toy but it is not great for a photo opportunity,15,14
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the ball that the dog has to put in it is mouth is way too big and makes the whole thing way too heavy dog just chews on the ends,28,15
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,we gave this to our puppy who is about 17 lbs he does not hold the ball in his mouth because it is too heavy for him but the long tongue is great for distracting him from chewing on the furniture he is satisfied to sit and chew on this for a long time,53,16
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,i have 3 large labs and they were not interested at all too heavy and hard my dogs did not like it,23,17
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this is my dogs favorite toy very sturdy i wish all the other toys this sturdy they last a long time,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this works great as a fetch toy and it sure does bring a smile to your face when they run around with the large tongue sticking out of their mouth it works great for games such as tug-o-war or fetch but you do have to keep an eye on them if your dog is a chewer i have a boxer / mastiff mix and he is a very powerful chewer i was not paying much attention and he chewed the end of the tongue off in less than 60 seconds so it does not hold up in any way against a chewer so i moved it to an outside toy we have already had many hours of fun with fetch and tug-o-war i totally recommend this product although it was chewed a bit i am very happy with my purchase and plan on buying the smaller size for my small dog the seller also has great customer service so that is just a huge plus if your debating on if you should buy this let me make the decision for you buy it,178,19
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a great toy both our terriers play tug of war with it and love it will buy again,20,20
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i got a bigger kick out of this than the dog did i think the ball part is a little big not really sturdy enough for my pit bull not to destroy either,33,21
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,great toy but i really should have ordered a smaller size i own a corgi which is a big dog in a small body and need to always order big dog toys because she tends to use or abuse them in a big dog way and even although the larger toy might be a bit hard to carry in her mouth i still am satisfied with the purchase,67,22
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this is a very tempting buy but do not bother our 60 lb black lab had it in pieces within 3 minutes we then closely read the packaging and it said it is a fetching toy not a chew toy it is a tongue are you serious not a chew toy stick w kongs very sturdy and durable oh and avoid the mustaches too from this company they are thinner and likely the same poor quality rubber,73,23
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,what a piece of crap this is i have 2 6 mon old kittens one sniffed it and walk away and has never returned to it the other nicky tried to scracth it and it just swung around and smacked her in the face to wit she bit it and walked away made very poorly and cheapjust a piece of crappy rug glued to a piece of cardboard i should have gone where i always do [ ] or even walmart,78,0
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,the carpet on this is really short and the strip overall is too narrow i tried hanging it on several doorknobs and even anchoring it on the floor to no avail,31,1
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,it is somewhat pricey considering shipment anyway my can does not use it as intended she likes it when flat on the floor,23,2
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i tried it in several locations on the floor on the door and in their faces i rubbed it with catnip and tried to charm them with treats and they still looked at me like i was smoking crack what exactly do want us to do with that thing mom my girls will play with pretty much anything except this thing i went over to petco about week later and bought a super-cheapie carpet-covered 2 stand clawing post with a feather toy and the girls said now that is what we are talkin bout mom in my opinion do not waste your money,100,3
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cat loves her scratching pad and it was the best 5 I have ever invested chooch is not much of a scratcher she does like the side of my bed and the antique chenille sofa in my living room but she has a stretch scratcher and this scratching pad is right up her ally she would not touch it when it was hanging from a doorknob but she has very happy with it on the floor after she scratches on it she loves to sit on it as if to keep anybody else in the house from claiming it,97,4
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,are you kidding me cats will definitely use this thing to scratch their claws on so get one and save your sofa if only for a little while,27,5

Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,huh the cats completely ignore it maybe they should make scratching pads out of nice leather as that seems to be much preferred in my house to these cheapo pads oh well at least those little beasties have not discovered the woodwork and i wanted a new sofa anyway,48,27

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,the thought of this is better than the reality it is weak and flimsy and needs to be glued to the floor in order to stay put otherwise the cats just knock it over and it is another thing in the house to collect dust ended up in the garbage,48,75

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,this arch groomer is flimsy and lightweight moves around too much for the cats to even really brush themselves my cats do not like to lay on the groomer as the photo shows but instead circle around it this groomer just does not work for them and they stopped using it after one night,53,78
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cats love this from the moment i bought it my 2 cats have been all over it they love to lay on it scratch the carpet part and rub their heads against the arch they also love to bat at the yellow ball for the price it was a great investment and makes my 2 kitties very happy,59,79
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the yellow toy was destroyed in less than 30 seconds but the cats still play with the string it took both cats a while to start using this for it is intended purpose but they both like it you need a little muscle to assemble it,45,80

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,it gets four stars from me because it was cheap and would appear to be able to do what it was intended to do the problem is my cat who will not go through it he does scratch at the carpet part but as for using the grooming part forget it it may work better for larger cats but my guy just walks through it and avoids the bristles all together and digs at the carpet,76,94

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,one of my cats played with it for about 2 days then mangaged to tear the yellow ball off so now they do not play anymore maybe more consideration for a stronger attachment of the ball to the groomer would have made me give this more stars,46,116

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,it is a very nice product i thout it would be a lil bigger but my cat wants nothing to do with it except for the ball she actually played wit the stuffing that came in the box goodtho and good price for a test thing maybe she will warm up to it eventually,55,118

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,we got this for our two cats ages 6 and 7 who love being brushed we thought this might give them another option when we are busy we have had it for about a week now and neither one has shown an interest in it it is big enough for our 17 pound cat to fit through and well enough made it has rubber nibs on the inside and outside of the arch to rub against but so far no activity we are still hopeful that in time one of them will give it a try if not I shall give it to a friend who has little kitties they will play with anything,108,129
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,the cats liked it for the first 90 seconds then they ripped the ball at the top of it and totally forgot about this what a waste of money,29,130

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat sleeps in this thing all the time unfortunately that does not really do anything for the shedding situation i bought it for but that is her own fault it is well made and easy to assemble the carpet is a different pattern than what has pictured but that is not something I am worried about she loves to sharpen her claws on it and occasionally i clean a clump of hair off it that is one less clump i have to brush so i consider it money well spent update 7/2/2017 this thing except for the pom pom is still going strong the pom pom has been annihilated as seen in the photo but the cat still digs it whatever makes her happy,118,133
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,my cat loves this thing it was inexpensive but could have been a little sturdier,15,134

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cat loves to play with the little ball but never figured out how to use the groomer part so it is an expensive toy for us,27,136
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,i put it out for my cat and she smelled it a few times and then would have nothing to do with it i kept it for quite a while and then requested a refund and the company was very nice and refunded my purchase it may just be my cat i do not know but you know how they say cats are finicky she may be,66,137
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,the cats treat this like they do everything else with fascination at first and then only occasionally give it a once over the ball came off almost immediately when the cats played with it which i expected no ball on string ever lasts long with cats they do like the plastic bristles and so it was worth the purchase,59,138
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,neither of my two cats will pay this any attention and even if i coax them to rub on it for a couple seconds it only picks up 1 or 2 hairs,32,139
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat loved the puffball to death very quickly i do find that the groomer slides some but she does play with it and enjoys it,26,140

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,this is easy to assemble however the yellow ball had to be retied out for the way for assembly my cat likes to rub on things and he is slowly warming up to this product,35,146
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,the carpet that arrived with this product is not the same as in the picture in fact it is very different one piece had an elk on it also the texture is different than it appears in the picture the ball is a big hit although,46,147

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,my cat found this toy mildly interested and occasionally still returns to it I have shown her how to scratch on the plastic parts but to her this is just a mat to scratch on the ball that was included broke off after a few months of rough play from my gatita,51,149
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,i have no clue how cats knew what to do with this thing but i guess they are smarter than i expect them to be both of my cats use this religiously they groom themselves and rub and play with the toy and even sleep in the middle of it at first when it arrived it looked thin and flimsy but after i assembled it i had no problems with it and it keeps the shape and form without breaking or unlocking cats love the carpeted bottom they love scratching it too,95,150
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,my cat does not go anywhere near this thing and i have had it for a few months now it is smaller than i thought too so that may be why she does not use it,34,151
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,my cat does not like to be brushed but does like carpet and hanging balls so i thought this would be a win however she has never used it and does not show signs that she will,35,152
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,he has a big maine coon cat and took awhile to find the parts that he could scratch on but loved the ball and i kept putting his little cat nip mouse on the rug and he worked it out he sleeps on one side of it like it is his security blanket,51,153

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,we have a brush arch but felt it was to stiff even hurts when you rub across it but the cat loved it showed her this one and she just walked away will not touch it probably because it is light and moves to easy plus no ribs on top donation pile,52,159
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,our cats love this they constantly rub against it and 1 seems to think it is her home base so we will have to order another for the other cats,28,160

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,it looked kinda cheaply made and i was not at all sure that the cats would like it but the price was right silly me the thing has not only stood up to almost constant use los guys are jockeying for position on it i think it is become their all time favorite feline diversion the best part is they do most of their shedding right there so that it can be easily vacuumed,73,163
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,both of my cats totally ignore this thing i even put catnip all over it to make it more appealing they simply do not use it,25,164

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,since my guinea pig loves to run i thought this would be perfect but it is far from it i tried both the medium and larger sizes and both were too small even the largest size was too small around the neck for him it fits around the middle but not around the neck i reccomend not using this product at all it is dangerous to the guinea pigs as it may choke them,73,1
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,I had return thisbut thewas so strapped into the packaging that the packaging had to be town apart to release theimmediately after opening thei knew it would not fit my baby guinea pig it was way too small and then within a matter of minutes the plastic adjustable clasp broke it is really too bad because it arrived so quickly and it looks quite sporty,70,2
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i got the leash faster than said and i got a pink one it worked out although because my bunny is a girl it fit her perfectly and it seemed very comfortable the leash is detachable from theand it is stretchy there is a little bell conected on theand rings every time she hops i was very satisfied with this purchase,65,3
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we recently bought a papillion puppy and she has so tiny i was having trouble finding a harness to fit her the smallest dog harness i could find was for a full-grown toy dog so at the moment she can simply walk through it i was complaining to friends when one suggested searching for a rabbit or ferret harness and that led me here this fit our puppy perfectly and although she pulled hard to twist around in an attempt to chew on the leash and managed to reach it too it did not unfasten i confess i removed the little bell as i fear it may have been alarming her but even that was an easy process thewhich arrived was a lime green almost yellow very cute i would definitely buy this harness again,135,4
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we bought this for our chihuahua pup because of the fragile necks of toy breeds while still growing we can not use a collar yet we searched high and dry for a dog harness that would fit him but we simply could not find anything small enough this completely solved our problems and now we have no problem walking him,58,5

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this is friggin tiny my 6 year old daughter very slight frame can not fit this around her wrist i can not see this fitting anything other than a baby ferret or a small rat they would do well to put the maximum circumference for each of the clasps / velcro pieces i will not be returning them as there is nothing defective but better description is a must,64,68

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,we have a small rabbit and thought this harness would be good for him if your rabbit is not used to being put into a harness it will take some time for the animal to get used it it the first time we tried to get it on him he is 10 months old it took an hour the second time was better also since our rabbit is not used to it he does not respond obediently when we redirect him in time i hope it will be fun for the whole family,90,134

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,product seems well made but i can not really test it because it is impossible to get it on a rat i have four rats ranging from incredibly squirmy too very very docile none of which i could successfully get the harness on so they could walk in it i would not recommend it for rats unless they are very well trained from an early age,64,179
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,bought it and my guinea pig can not use it he slipped right out,13,180
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,this was actually too small for the rabbit i have but the leash clips right off and i was still able to use it it is a greatthough to use so that you can keep your little critters active along with the bigger critters,45,181
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this leash is not rabbit sized this harness is for a ferret rat or guinea pig i do not have any of these animals so i wish i knew it was that small,33,182
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,the large barely fit my small bunnies think dutch or smaller like polish or dutch anything bigger will not fit this is made for small animals like guinea pig ferret or rat,32,183
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,material is the key it is breathable and stretchy great quality given rabbit liked to try and sneak out was not big fan of thei got red but love the material,32,184
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,my dwarf rabbit fit in this and the material was good because he could not slide out it worked well until he grew out of it this product is good for tiny rabbits,32,185
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,the stitching on theundid itself when i opened it and the leash was in five little peices that were not attatched,22,186
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought for my granddaughters rabbit fit great she has a lion hair rabbit the girls like taking it outside of his cage and letting him roam in the grass,30,187
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,seller delivered as promised the manufacturer is skimping on quality i have purchased a number of these vests to help with kitten and cat training and the tabs that go around the body of the animal were always soft so as not to irritate that is not the case with the extra large size the tabs are too short and the velcro is very stiff and is squared off and will irritate the animal as it moves i am going to see if i can fix this as the soft mesh material is wonderful I am glad i did not buy more returning it would have been a hassle too bad,110,188
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,says colors may vary but came in lime green which is the theme of his cage so that made me happy it looks like comfy material and like it will be comfy for my ferret,34,189
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i bought this for my 5 month old dutch thinking the large would fit but it did not i can not get it tight enough for him he slips right out I am going to be getting a smaller one although it was great did not bother with the leash although,47,190
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,well like with any small pet this is a struggle to put on and i still have not put it on yet haha working on it and i can not wait to take out my little bunnies in them i got a red one in the mail and it is perfect for both genders so far it is nice and the material is very breathable good product,65,191
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i sent it back the next day it was not the right size orthe company did not give you a optionalchoice so i received whateverthey sent which was red on a girl puppy preference would have been pink,41,192
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we have 2 pet rabbits and they each have afits well stays-on good velcro and snaps my 5-year-old puts it on the rabbit by herself,27,193
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i have a dwarf rabbit and unlike the other reviews that say this harness does not fit their small pet because it is too small mine does not fit my bunny because it is slightly too big i know one day he will grow into it so i do not regret this purchase,47,194
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,please send me another one and please message me my rabbit is 1 year old i need a bigger leach,20,195
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i have 3 rabbits and am hoping to get 2 rats i bought this at petsmart and my bunnies can just wiggle out if i do get rats I am hoping that they can not just wiggle out the way that my bunnies can the leash is really short so neither can go very far also it can easily be chewed through if you were not paying attention which you should be then the pet could knaw through it and run away,78,196
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,my daughter needed a harness for her rabbit this one fit perfectly she got a red one the rabbit loves it and they walk every day,26,197
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,would have given this a 5 star but do not think the size description is accurate we have 7 guinea pigs ranging in size from small to large and this harness is perfect only for the smaller ones who are now 3 months old there is a little growing room but not much,53,198
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,this is just too cute and the quality is really great for something so small i got it for my sister she says it was great,26,199
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,works for are piggy wonderfully fits great and even although i ordered it in red it came in blue but blue is what we originally wanted to it worked out,30,200
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i purchased a large but could not even use it because it was too small i also did not like how you could not pick theyou wanted,28,201
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,fits my bunny but she always finds a way to get out of it mine came in pink and she looks absolutely adorable in it very fast shipping,28,202
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i liked this harness because a have an extremely small russian blue cat however i hav never had a bunny so i would not know if they pull it only has one real buckle so if moonshadow or any other cat wanted to break away from this harness it would really be quite simple i really do like this harness but i recommend getting a stirdy collar even one from the store and sewing the buckle to where the strap around the belly goes-just to be safe,87,203
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i actually purchased this harness for a 2 lb toy schnauzer no other harness would fit this little guy i purchased thisin the hopes it would work and it does fits perfectly and does not obstruct the dogs limbs,41,204
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i bought this pet harness in the medium size for a holland lop rabbit the harness measurements are listed as 6 - 8 neck and 10 - 11 waist the actual neck measurement on this harness is 7 including 1 1/2 overlap for fastening there is no way i would put an adjusted 5 1/2 neck opening around an animal with a 6 or greater neck the waist opening 9 is also smaller than stated although i could stretch it almost to 10 again too tight for the stated waist size i have used a similar harness for our holland lop escape artist rabbit if the harness was the size i needed i would be very happy with this new one i purchased it is not the size i wasto believe so my other child has a new leash for the stuffed animals not a total loss,143,205
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,perfect size for my rat and the leash was a multi purpose just long enough to walk my chihuahua too it fit him perfectly and i was able to walk him just fine with it,35,206
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,was sent what i was promised it was quick and easy i appreciate the quick shipment even although i did pay for it,23,207
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,perfect fit simple design just what i needed although we do not use it much it is a nice thing to have,21,208
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this is way small my bunny is between medium and large and neither fit him well he hates it and thrashes when i put it on if it fit better it would be worth it but oh well,38,209
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,this product was advertised for a large small pet unfortunately it will not fit my rabbit who is large was not as advertised,22,210
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,pretty nice construction and so far it is the most comfortable harness I have seen on the market for rabbits this extra-large size fits my 6 lb mini-holland lop pretty well i got the large size as well to try it out but it was 1 too short on all the closures it is still a bit tight so i would not get this for an animal any larger than 6 lb also fyi my lop is a breed with a short torso so i find the harness pooches annoyingly in the back where the shoulder gathers my bunny still seems pretty comfortable although,98,211
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i have a 6 lb mini holland lop and this was about 1 too small for the neck and the torso closures there should be enough room to slide 2 fingers in easily i tried the xl size and that fit ok although if your animal is larger than 6 lbs it is likely they will be too big seems comfortable good materials and construction,63,212
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,theof this product is great my daughter would love to take her rats outside for a change of scenery however no matter how many times we adjusted them each of rats would shift backwards out of the harness within seconds rats just do not have the mass in their shoulders or large enough arms to hold the harness in place i have a friend who successfully uses this harness on a rabbit but for us they are useless i do not recommend this product for pet rats,88,213
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i bought this for my english lop and it seemed a little small at first i took him outside into the grass and he ran under a parked car i tried to pull him out but he would not move he kept on struggling and moving backwards and he finally slipped out of the harness and ran away luckily i brought his cage with me and caught him,67,214
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i would have given 5 stars but it is way to small i do not know how they can say it is a large quality and comfort looks great i have a 5 lb kitten and it would not fit,36,215
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,what animal wants their neck yanked on this is a much more comfortable way of taking your bunny out for play and exercising he / she will not get their neck yanked on and for a bunny who does not like leashes maybe this will help theattaches on the back part of thewhich is much better than on a neck,60,216
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,we were very pleased with our walkloved thegreen also all around a great product we would buy thisagain if we had a nother guinea pig,30,217
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i love this it is very nice and it will not choke the bunny it is easy just to click and hold and let the bunnys explore my bunny had no problem with it and he acted like it was not even on i also like the bell on it just in case i ever drop the lease that i can find him hopefully that will not be the case of me loosing him,70,218
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i love thebut the way this thing is designed puts the front of the harness around the animals neck in order for them to not slip out it needs to be a little tighter too felt like i was choking my animal i would not recommend this design,49,219
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,the company that shipped the product was professional and cared a lot about customer service the product itself was well made and it did it is job well enough my problem is with how it was designed the product is supposedly designed to fit both ferrets and rabbits but i found it to fit my rabbit very uncomfortably i had the adjustable neck strap as tight as i could get it while i had the adjustable torso strap as loose as i could have it it was still too tight around my rabbits torso and loose enough around her neck that she was able to squeeze out of it a little at one point i think it leans a little towards fitting ferrets rather than a rabbit i thought that the adjustable strap would make it possible for my rabbit to grow into a little bit but she completely grew out of it in a week because of how tight the torso strap was to begin with if you have a ferret it is probably a great fit with rabbits i suggest waiting until they reach their full maturity before getting one,191,220
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,it probably fits a larger small pet but not a hamster who just wriggles right out of it unfortunately for us we own a hamster and not a different animal too bad,32,221
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,bought 2 of these my rabbits are kind of big rabbit got out of it right away and almost ran off,21,222
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,even although thesays it would fit my size rabbit it was way too small my rabbit could not move around in it when i tried to return it has gotten lost in the mail and i have not been refunded for the purchase,45,223
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i think this might fit a teacup chihuahua but it might even be too small for that tiny dog it looks like it was made for a doll a very small doll i returned it,35,224
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,you have to make sure you train your pet into liking it / being able to use it my guineapig kept walking out of it until i spent enough time usually 2 minute intervals with it on and me petting him then taking it off for 5 minutes then putting it back on for 2 minutes and more until he learned to keep it on and now we walk around campus having fun on his leash,73,225
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i tried it with my hamster he could just slip out of it it was a great thought but do not try it on any kind of hamster,27,226
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,my cat goes from fourteen to twenty pounds her and elizabeth taylor however this would not fit her at her most svelt let alone during her managed to get other people to give me treats and xtra food times more appropriate for a tubby kitten perhaps not adult cat like a maine coon or just hefty normal cat,56,227
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,one of the plastic clips broke while i was taking it off the cardboard could not even use it not worth even the time and effort to return,27,228
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,thewas awesome but the fact that they sent the wrong size of harness makes me mad i have three rabbits and a small does not fit them i needed a medium,32,229
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought this for a small female lionhead rabbit who has always naturally been very slender she has small for an adult female even her dewlap is smaller than a typical female rabbit i went to the petstore and looked at the large size it is too small for a rabbit unless you have a very small breed even the xl would be too tight on a larger breed if you want one for a larger / heavier rabbit i recommend looking elsewhere or simply sew on more velcro to the straps it works great and still keeps them secure for my rabbit although this is a great harness the material seems strong and has a little stretch in it for comfort i was worried about the neckline but she did not have a problem with it it did not constrict her the slip around strap on the neckline gives me added security she hopped around quite happily the leash is short although just pick up a longer one at the petstore or the dollar store i can not imagine her being able to slip out of this harness i could not beat the price or the quality very happy,191,230
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,definitely not for small pets my daughter was incredibly disappointed when she could not walk her pets it just went to waste,21,231
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i got thisand leash for my mini-lop rabbit he is average size for a mini-lop about 6lbs and had to get the extra-large the large probably would have fit him but it seemed a little snug it is somewhat adjustable if you have a large breed you may want to consider buying it in person at a store for easy return if it does not fit it does run very small but it is a very nice harness fairly easy to put on and he seems comfortable in it he has never managed to escape from it but is a very calm bunny and does not seem to mind wearing it the leash is not that long but i feel like that gives me more control of the rabbit although do not expect to be able to walk a bunny like you would a dog ours is a darker royal blue very niceoverall a nice harness if you can get the right size,163,232
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i have little chihuahuas and it looks cute on them good for a triple coat chi as it does not mess up it is fur,23,233
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i thought that thewas a good fit for my bunny i have a mini rex which is like a medium sized rabbit so it is good that it is adjustable and it seems to be comfy for him theis stretchy so that keeps him from choking when he hops to fast for me to keep up it is easy to get on he does not struggle too much and he really likes to go outside i got it because i wanted him to be able to go out but i do not have the money or the time to build a rabbit run also everyone goes nuts when they see me walking my rabbit because he has so adorable well worth it,120,234
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,we bought this for our young guinea pig and after several attempts we gave up because it just does not fit the reviews for rabbits seems to be ok but it definitely does not work on g-pigs,35,235
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i hate thisbig rip off we tried to get this stupid harness on the hampster for an hour but it never holds the hampster in,28,236
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,when i first got the leash i tried it on my bunny she did not like the leash at first and was struggling to get it on her but i managed to get it on her the leash is not that good but you can hook a different one on it i got a bluewhich is a light pretty blue i have not tryed to walk her outside cuz i recommend that u get the bunny used to the leash so she will not slip outthe shipping was very fast too u,91,237
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i was a 2 lb rabbit and this harness was way too small for him i think it is intended for a ferret or a slimmer animal nothing with a round middle it will not ever fit,36,238
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,a harness is great when i want to givea little more freedom than just his pen he does fight me to put it on although,27,239
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,although it is difficult to getto wear his harness it does fit and i feel safer when he is outside of his pen,25,240
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,mislead the size and the fit and became too difficult to return to we kept it even although it did not fit,20,241
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,i have a juvenile dwarf rabbit seven weeks old when i got him and less than 2 pounds this harness was still much too small it says it can be used for rabbits but i think it would only fit rats small gerbils and ferrets,45,242
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,did not fit my pet rat and one of them is pretty big they just slip out of it so completely pointless and not what i thought it was,28,243
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,we puchased these for our 3 guinea pigs and they are awful the leashes do not fit on the animal we tried in vain for 45 minutes to get these to work and the guinea pig simply puts it is front paws through the front of the velcro and slips right out we woud have returned these products the three we purchased but the kids were so excited thinking they would work that they tore the packaging do not waste your money these should not even be sold,88,244
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,fits my rabbit nicely i love to take him on a walk with this my only complaint is that the leash is way too short and the bell fell off very quickly,32,245
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,safe harness for a small chihuahua came with leash and is nice would buy for another dog and wish i had,21,246
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,very well made i would like it a size smaller for my purpose although i wanted it for my chipmunk but he is too small for it and slipped right out other than size i believe it well made and well designed,42,247
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,mine came in black which is perfect because my bunny is a boy and also has black fur c he is a lion head rabbit and it fits perfectly,29,248
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,my guinea pig is less than one year old and this harness was still too small for him the neck is too tight and even once i expanded it with velcro the waist was too tight anyway he looks ridiculous in it and does not like it one bit I am sure it works fine for ferrets but do not buy it for a guinea pig both you and your cavy will be disappointed,71,249
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i liked it over all but there was some things that could change i did not like that they did not have a clip for the belly it came off all the time but it fit good the leash could be longer so they could run more,47,250
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,i bought this for a lizard but it is too big just yet when my tegu gets a bit bigger I shall get a lot of use from it very high quality very sturdy harness i did a lot of tugging and what not mydaughter uses it right now for her rat at her mothers house and she says it is very secure so i probably have to order another one the only downside is that i can not pick my own,82,251
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,these did not work at all our lab had them off in less than a minute we bought them with the hope that it would give her added traction going down our wood stairs as she is getting older and slips on occasion,42,0
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,my 15 year old dog could not walk on our wood floors until we found these booties they are really great,19,1
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,these shoes seemed ok except for the fact that my dog had them off within a half hour maybe some dogs just will not wear shoes,25,2
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,i was going crazy when we put in our wood floors and our large dogs were scratching them i found these booties and have been using them for the past 3 years i buy a new set every year for each dog when they come in the house they have to get their booties on and i have not had any scratches on my wood floors since they are good for the snow but i would recommend getting a couple of pair since they will lose them in the snow if it is really deep you will always find them eventually but it is always handy to have extras on hand they did not like them initially but have gotten use to them,121,3
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i loved theof boots for dogs there were just two problems first the sizing instructions were inadequate and i ended up with the wrong size second one velcro strap per boot was just not enough for an active dog they came off repeatedly and in the snow got lost i think i can modify them to do a better job but someone else should have given it more thought before marketing was started,75,4
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,forget it all the velcro in the world will not keep these things on a dogs feet they are flimsy and easy to pull off i thought they would be the answer to my large dogs wet feet but just getting them on was harder than using a towel thoroughly to get the dirt off,54,5
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,this is the second time that i have bought hot doggers the dog wears them all the time in the house the first pairs lasted two years and can still be used although the rubber padding is wearing in places they are excellent and serve the purpose not scratching hard wood floors the dog took some getting used to them but being food oriented looked forward to a treat the first few times we put them on everyone asks about the slipper wearing dog,85,6
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,the size falls about 1 size bigger i ordered a size medium and it is kind of large on my dogs paws bought it since he tends to jump on us with his claws this works out great no more scratches for us,43,7
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these work great for my boxer he does not mind them and they never come off he needs protection due to a foot allergy the only flaw is that they sometimes reverse thus he is running on the non-padded side which has caused some small pin holes to appear I had rather see padding on both top and bottom overall very pleased as my boxer has worn these for hours at a time with no issues,74,8
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,the quality seemed good but they would not stay on my dogs feet,13,9
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,do not stay on toes drag when the dog walks labrador and they rotate around every time so the stiff grip bottom is on top,24,10
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,super frustrating fell off my dog after only about 20 minutes of playing in the snow size was correct,19,11
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,goodif you could glue them on my dogs feet,11,12
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,keeps the salt out of paw crevices wish they were water proof,12,13
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,did not really hold out a lot of hope for these but ordered them out of desperation my golden retriever loves the snow unless it is any colder than 10 degrees or so her feet freeze instantly we gave them a try and she tolerated them better than i had expected but the issue is keeping them on i fasten them as tightly as i can without cutting off circulation but within a few minutes at least one usually two slip off i have not given up on them and we will use them when absolutely necessary but they are really a bit of a hassle fyi my dog is roughly 65 - 70lbs and i ordered the large they fit fine,114,14
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,it is cute however it kept slipping from my dogs foot,10,15
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,amended my stars to 2 these are poorly made do not stay on positioning of velcro does not keep protectors in place and elastic sock top is useless extremely frustrating for dog and owner sent them back,40,16
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,we have 3 medium sized dogs who quickly start limping when the snow gets in their paws i did not want to spend a ton of money on boots for them and the regular muttluks can each cost as much a a pair of my shoes i decided to give these a go and could not be happier being short they are easier to get on than the regular muttluks we do own 1 pair of those and the dogs appreciate the least amount of fussing with their feet so we are all happy sometimes they lose one or 2 in the deep snow but it is not often enough to say they are not doing a great job,116,17
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,ordered for my pomeranian in a small they will fit a lab sizing is way off totally useless to me,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,our lab slips these off within seconds i will wait a few months to see if perhaps they are too big on him but I am doubting it,27,19
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,fits my 110 lb bernese mountain dog great,8,20
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,get the right size and wrap the velcro tight enough you should not have any problems with these falling off my dog drags his feet badly so i got these for protection he does not mind them at all great product great price,41,21
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,i bought these booties on wednesday just before a major snowstorm by saturday i was back in the store for a refund with two torn up booties that had fleece sticking out of the toes admittedly my dog loves snow so he ran around like crazy in the booties but unless you have a dog that only walks gingerly or only wears them inside i would not / not recommend these boots,70,22
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,these started coming apart at the toes after a few days i stitched them up on my sewing machine and a few days later they were coming apart again,29,23
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,i originally ordered the red but i received an email from the company that they were out of red would i take black instead with this years cold winter these boots are very popular we took in my moms dog when she passed away and we do not have a fenced yard so we walk her the dog is about 10 and when the temperature dropped below zero she would start to walk on three legs and sometimes sit or lay down in the street our local pet store only had rain boots which i bought based on the sizing chart i bought extra large for a german shepard they are too big but we used them while i found the muttluks online use their sizing chart our dog is small for a shepard so i bought the small boots and they are the perfect size make sure to pull the straps tight or they could come off and they are a little slippery on,165,24
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,they do not stay on very well and they are bulky using them for the winter nut not ideal for the long run,22,25
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,for my dog he would not have these on he immediately and successfully got both off in less than a minute my dog would need a more secure type of shoe it gets very very hot in the palm springs area in summer and i did not want my little guy to go barefoot in the 110 degree temperature outside,61,26
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,these are very cheaply made i thought I had try them because of their claim to be non-slip well no matter how tightly i secured these on my dogs feet if they did not come off they rotated around and around and around and around you get the picture so totally not worth it the only good point of these booties is that the toe material is a lot more flexible and soft i had bought another brand before they stay on great but the toe is just extremely stiff with no bend so very unnatural to walk in as my dog as told me and not very comfortable in the toe area these were more comfortable in the toe area but that was it,124,27
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,this is a good product for the price two straps would be nice and the boots would stay on better but it is a good value,25,28
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,i tried so hard to make these fit my dog was great i thought he may try to pull them off he did not what did happen was the boots falling off his paws as he walked around for a very short period of time nothing seemed to work i measured his paws as was instructed they just keep falling off,60,29
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,bought these for use indoors on a 70 lb lab mix had a pair of knock offs that she could shake off in just a few minutes these work very good for what we wanted indoor use for protecting our new hardwood flooring i would not recommend for outdoor use although as the fabric gets wet / dirty very easy,56,30
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,this was a waste of money my chihuahua would only wear them for a few minutes and then they would fall off i kept putting them back on her feet and finally got tired of putting them on her when she was wearing them she was able to walk on the wooden floors but it was not for too long before she was missing 1 or 2 shoes,67,31
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i bought these dog boots for my two bulldogs we have tile and wooden floors and they often slip when walking as they are getting older i thought that these boots would help provide them a little more stability the product itself seems ok but my bulldogs neither one would wear these in fact within seconds they both had them off both bulldogs were able to pull the velcro strap with their mouths and release their paws very easily i put them on them a couple of times in hopes they would tire of me putting the boots back on but they insisted on keeping them off in the end buying this was a waste of money,117,32
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i put the dog boots on my golden retriever and they fit fine my only problem was that i purchased them so my dog would not slide across the wood floors but the boots have no traction for wood floors i will try using non-slip socks next,46,33
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,I have used these to protect the hardwood floors from our dog at my moms house I have also used these to protect my dogs pads outside in some rough icy conditions they have a good non slip rubber bottom and velcro pretty tight they do loosen and fall off after a long while but well worth the price and my moms peace of mind about her new hardwoods,68,34
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i have a german shepherd that drags his hind toes [ to the point of quicking his nails ] and planned to use these on his back feet while on our poolon first use when i apply them as tight as possible they do stay on however they immediately spun so he was walking on the fabric side not the bottom i then sewed the velcro strap across more of the boot thinking that would help it stay on properly it did not they still spin around he has now worn through the fabric side I shall have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up i expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each on the positive side he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on even during / after swimming if i were to order again i would go a size smaller i used the suggested measurement procedure and ordered the large but think a medium would definitely go on and maybe eliminate some of the other issues,187,35
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,the boots work fairly well they do tend to come off and turn around on the dogs foot during use,20,36
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,we were hoping to get rid of all the runners in our kitchen and hallway since our lab will not walk on the laminate floor once in a while she slips then will not walk anywhere she will walk on the floors with the hott doggers on but they do not stay on very well after two days i was tired of putting them on 5 or 6 times a day and gave up back to the runners,75,37
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,1.0,negative,search for these somewhere else you can buy at least 3 sets for this price,15,38
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these little boots are great our 1 year old german shepherd really did a number on the hardwood we recently had our floors redone and these are really great both to prevent scratching but also helps her with traction they are easy to put on and they stay pretty well the only suggestion i have is that they go up a little farther next time i might try a larger size,71,39
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,2.0,negative,i bought these because we have hard wood floors and our black lab was having problems with traction on the floors when he tried for traction out came his claws and so did scratches in the floor the boots are easy to put on however once they are on they tend to roll and the bottoms become the top additionally the boots are easy for my lab to get them off so they are a nice introduction but I shall be looking for a bootie that is longer so it goes up my dogs foot further and stays on better,98,40
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,these skuffies are a god send to our older dog 14 1/2 kodi on our new hard wood floors easy to put on and she never even noticed them or acted like they bothered her the sticky part really helps her get up and keeps her from doing dangerous splits on our floor she reminds us of our grandma shuffling down the hall in her slippers so we call them skippers,71,41
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,4.0,positive,upstate new york has had a very cold winter and these booties arrived in time and saved my poodles paws from freezing it takes a few times to get use to putting them on dog and a few times for the dog to get used to have dog booties on the velcro helps to keep the booties snug on the paws,61,42
Pet_Supplies,B000NV9XCW,5.0,positive,we just remodeled our home to hardwood floors one of my dogs with long legs had trouble walking on them and we were afraid he would fall and get hurt he would lose his balance and sometimes have a leg slide out from under him we investigated different methods and decided on these booties they have worked very well and our dog can now walk confidently on our floors you can tell the difference in his ability when he has them on he knows he can walk anywhere in the house as without them he is very hesitate to walk and goes from rug to rug like he has island hopping thanks for a great product,115,43
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,the ramp does not lie flat on the back seat of my toyota corolla when my lab walks up it the ramp buckles and my dog slips off he could get hurt using it wish i could find a way to make the space larger or return it as is it is just taking up space in my storage she had the ramp has scratches on it from when my dogs nails tried to avoid falling off the uneven surface he slipped off it and could have gotten injured it does not fit on the back seat of a corolla,99,0

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,i recently found out my darling terrier olivia has arthritis she can no longer jump up into the car or our bed i bought two ramps one to keep in the car and the other for the bedroom she weighs 30 pounds and it is difficult for me to lift her so this product is invaluable for both of us it was so easy for her to figure it out i praise her each time she uses it and she seems to enjoy her new adventure the only recommendation i have is it would be helpful to have a handle to grab on to when attaching it to theof the car with the leash in hand one has to manipulate the ramp with only the other which is awkward,130,2
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,i bought this to help my dog get on the bed and he uses it every night each morning iit up against the wall and go to work so he does not get on the bed while I am not home he can jump off the bed just fine now i control when he can get on things and when he can not it is scratchy on the surface like sandpaper but he could care less he hardly waits for me to get it in place at night so he can walk up it to get on the bed it is very light and i can move it easily from one place to the other it also looks nice so i do not have to hide it in a closet so people will not see it worth the money,136,3
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,this ramp has helped my overweight small dog get in and out of my van without hurting her back and legs it is light weight and easy to use,29,4
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,this ramp did not do it for us it would not stay securely on the door ledge and even if it did it was way too steep it is also very bulky the surface is sandpaperish which i suspect did not feel too good on the dogs feet,48,5
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,our 15 year old cat loves to scamper up this ramp to reach his food bowl in our kitchen we put nonslip feet on it so we could increase the ramps height and incline and decrease how far it sticks out in the room smaller footprint unlike the ads picture of the ramp ours does not have a wavy surface,60,6
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i injured my back and am unable to lift my 18 dog at this time i needed to find a solution to this problem since he is not a jumper i searched for a ramp that would work in my back seat i have a 4 dr sedan of my mid-size car not a van or suv this solvit half ramp is a littler narrower than most and it works for me at a slight angle he is able to go up the ramp to the back seat by himself the majority of the these ramps were made for vehicles other than sedan cars fortunately the width works for me the ramp is well designed well constructed and extremely light at 7 s the light weight design enables me to place the ramp in the front seat area so i can use it again for unloading for me the car storage works better than the trunk because of my back he is able to get out of the car reasonably well very pleased with my purchase,174,7
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,works great for a large dog and minivan very light and do not have to fold it yay,17,8

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,i tried to use this with my minivan and a larger dog with hind end weakness a little less than 100lbs the ramp is too short for it is supposed use the angle is too steep when used as shown in the picture and the ramp slipped and my dog fell when i put it on the lower lip it would work for a very small dog who can scamper up a steep incline but not by a dog which has any medical issues,83,14
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,there ramps are great i have two others inside and outsdie had them for years they work great for my little dog who had both leg surgeries,27,15
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,I am sure the product is ok but we did not even get to use it before our dog died i was not happy that amazon would not take it back even although it is still in it is original box unopened because it was past the time limit,45,16

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,the ramp is too steep for the back of my suv when i went to send it back to the seller is would cost me 20 at the post office or 33 atnot worth it i will just have to keep it since i only paid 44 for it,51,23
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,i dislike the surface material of the ramp i had to cover ramp with a towel to avoid hurting my babies paws,22,24
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,ramp is too steep and my lab was afraid to get on it,13,25
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,would not recommend because it does not hold stable to anything you have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it depending on what you are trying to do that is not very convenient,38,26
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,its just perfect for going to the dog park,9,27
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,although the ramp description says it can be used on a couch / sofa there is no way to attach to the couch or cushions so it kept falling off this defeated the purpose which was a safe avenue for my dog to get on the couch very disappointinghas been returned,52,28
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,it is too wide for our kia soul car doors just do not open wide enough,15,29
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,no i thought it would be sufficient to ramp from floor to bed too steep for my little yorkie he will not use it instead I am using it to block access to different areas,33,30
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,this is great ramp because it is one-piece and lightweight i use it to help a senior yellow lab get in and out of my car this ramp is a bit shorter than other dog ramps so perspective buyers need to keep in mind the degree of incline in situations where it will be used,55,31
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,returned it it would work for theshown in the picture but that is about it,16,32
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i have two mastiffs with knee problems whenever i buy dog products i look for reviews from owners of massive sized breeds this ramp is wide enough and just long enough to make the 12 inchup into my mini-van easy for them it is also wide steady and heavy enough 7lbs not to be wobbly or to bounce,59,33

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i do love this ramp it was easy to install and my 16yr old dog can use it with ease rather than climbing steps,24,36
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,i returned thisdid not work at all for my dog i do not see how it would work for any large dog,23,37
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,the ramp came quickly and it is very sturdy i have a subaru outback and it barely fits in the passenger door i have to anchor it with my foot at the bottom so it stays put so my dog can climb into the back seat i probably will try to put something along the bottom so it will not slide it would be great for a van where the door slides open instead of just opening,76,38
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,this ramp did not secure very well to my stairs therefore it was not safe for my pets to use the width of the ramp was good which was what attracted me in the first place but i had to return it because it did not fit well,46,39
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,it is fair the ramp was not secure when our dog walked up it wobbled and was unsteady for a 60 lb dog,21,40

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,i bought this ramp because i needed something for my dog that was not too bulky or heavy for me to use the material on the ramp is very slippery and my dog scratched it up and fell the first time he tried to get in the car then it had scared him so he would not try it again my dog is medium sized 50 lb maybe it would work for small dogs i would not recommend this ramp i ordered a ramp with removable carpet from my local pet store and it works great,96,42
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,this is not well designed and clumsy i would not recommend thisto anyone with a sedan as it is too wide to fit in a back seat door opening,30,43
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,thiswas too large / wide for the door opening for my suv probably works best for vans or sliding doors,20,44
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,not a regular door so it is useless not a normal car with the width of a normal car door no way,22,45
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,a little cumbersome to haul around for a small dog would be great for a large dog and a van,20,46

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,my car is a honday civic back door only opens 1/2 way and never noticed it before nothing wrong with the door it just does not open at right angle to vehicle door does not open far enough to allow for ramp to fit securely seems solidly built although,47,48
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,we have a dog that always wants to chew on the bottom of the bed post we tried several different things but were forced shut the dog out of the room until we found this product it works great and has given the dog full run of the house again,50,0
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,most effective product i have found i used it on an outdoor tree that one of my dogs was found of eating i have both a large lab and a small aust cattle dog both were curious at first but neither were found of the smell and left the tree alone product is also effective at repelling humans i gaged nearly each time i applied it i did not try the product indoors thus i do not know what lingering influence it would have on people largest downside i see is the need to reapply occasionally i reapplied to my outdoor plants once every 10 days,107,1
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,cleared my sinuses right out taste and smell does tend to linger seems to deter my cat pretty well suggest using in well-ventilated environment,24,2
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,the reviews are right this does not really work my puppies did not like the taste however they still licked on it they would just shake their heads after they lick it then lick on it again i would not buy it again,40,3
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,i used this for my puppy that was teething and biting everything that was in sight i used this spray and saw results immediately she had stopped chewing furniture rugs plants shoes even my other dog ha very harsh smell but be careful you can actually taste it which is very bitter soapy taste to it blargh otherwise it worked well for my pooch,64,4
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,we have got a young lab that will chew on anything and was pulling up / chewing up our neighbors solar yard and walkway lights i sprayed this all over the new ones i bought to replace the damaged ones the dog left them alone for about 3 weeks then i found one back at our place but not chewed up i sprayed it reset it and resprayed all of the other ones again this does seem to work,77,5
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,awesome stuff it stopped my puppy from chewing on the molding around the floor knawing off our paint and huge chips of wood our wooden chairs and anything else we did not want her destroying i also recommend telling them no that is not your toy and then giving them one of they are toys that they are allowed to chew on and say chew on your toy to help redirect that behavior it is natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on but this spray really helps to let them know what they can not touch it is really powerful stuff definitely hold your breath when spraying it a mask would probably be better because if you breathe it in while it is airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes horrible,142,6
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,not only did it not deter my puppy he actually likes to lick it this was no help to me,20,7
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,spraying this on things actually attracted our dog she was obsessed with licking it in fact even more than before sigh,21,8
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,when i sprayed it i tasted the bitter in the air i think it had more I shall affect on me than it did my pet it did not deter the chewing i used it unsparingly and repeatedly to no avail,40,9
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it was a waste of money for my puppy he seemed to like the taste it would actually attract him wherever i sprayed it,24,10
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,this was ineffective in preventing my dog from chewing things i ended up buying cinnamon oil food grade which finally did the trick,23,11
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,alright so i tried this on two of my pets a shih tzu and a miniature pig i mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and i wanted to discourage it before it became a problem well this stuff arrived and i figured i should test how good it is or rather how bad it tastes both pets generally take anything from my hand that i offer and then spit it out if they do not like it so for my test i tried a plain old scrap of paper sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu he ate it and then asked for more then did this with the pig as well same result they both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was i going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff i repeated the process once more to be sure i then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean needless to say i decided not to spray it on my carpet since both of my pets seemed to love the taste,201,12
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it does not work as well as other products my dog does not seem to mind the taste when you spray it on things the fine mist goes in the air and you breathe it in and you can taste it it is horrible it also has an awful smell to it,49,13
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,this is a very good alternative to the expensive brands it is just as good I have never seen a single tick or flea in any of my four dogs even although they play outside all day in the garden recommended,39,0

Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5.0,positive,i love this stuff i first purchased this product at tractor supply because it was on sale i used to live in an apartment complex so my two dogs would play with about 10 other dogs daily it was a dog oriented community and we loved it of course they got a lot of fleas within the first few days bad enough to where there were fleas in the house and in my bed so i had to try something i did not want to pay the outrageous 40 for the good stuff so i figured I had give this a shot i have one dog who is about 15 lbs and another who is about 35 - 40 lbs so i got this to use with both of them it was amazing within a day if not hours all the fleas were gone from my pets my house my bed thank god and the product actually smells pretty good an orangish citrus smell my dogs do not like when it is applied but i think that is because they do not like the squeezing noise when you apply it overall great product it is the only thing i will ever buy in the future plus it is a great price,201,6
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,seems to work on my 13 pound weiner dog it does appear to take a few days before it kicks in but overall i think it is effective and not too pricey when it is on sale the smell lingers but eventually it goes away no issues with dog being lethargic or having any allergic reaction overall good product,57,7
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,i put this product on my clean dogs bathed the day before 5 days ago and have yet to see any marked difference the poor things are still scratching,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,did nothing to control fleas on our sheltie if you have a similar long hair breed you might do better trying a different product,24,9
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,this product did not work on either of my two dogs i was very disappointed that it did not provide protection against fleas and ticks as advertised,26,10
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,i read before buying sentry pro that many of these topical flea medications can have alarming side effects i did not use quite as much as recommended rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product i have not seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad i think it is important to mention i took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax and bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days immediately after recognizing i had a flea problem i wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective likely some people find it easier to use the more expensive brand and if i had the extras money perhaps i would have also but i am satisfied as the product did what it promised,157,11
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5.0,positive,i use this product as a preventative measure and because the price is unmatched my dog has had no fleas and she spends a large amount of time outside i will continue to buy this product,38,12

Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,I have used this twice on 2 different dogs it works ok on one but does nothing for the other i will not buy this brand again,26,14
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,bought this product because i like the sentry dog shampoo it smells good and has been one of my favs lately because of the flea season even although i use flea control on my dogs on a monthly basis it still happens in my place i bought this product and the flea trap planning to kill all both on the dogs and in the house none of the products still fleas on the dogs probably it is time to move on to the expensive brands,84,15

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,once your dog gets used to these boots they are very helpful to the pup like the double strap still slips but does not get cold,25,1
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,i bought these for my pooch he has an eleven pound shihtzu the extra small boots were loose around his paws and he was very uncomfortable wearing them he has rubbber boots that fit more snuggly and has no problem wearing those the velcro strap also does not do much and they came off just wearing them in the house the only good thing was i was able to return them for a full refund with no questions,76,2
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,my dogs front paws are larger than the other two i specifically measured and bought the right size size seems just a bit bigger so the straps can not be tightened enough it started to flap out during the walk and i was shocked to see the he got a bleeding blister from his old wounds it would have been better it fit and stayed on in one place but it goest flap flap flap i may need to come up with anto some how tighten it you may want to buy a smaller size because of above price is too steep for me to just try and throw away was looking forward to it hmm 2 stars,119,3

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,simply did not stay on the paws of my pug not sure if it is a breed-specific problem but were useless to me also do not look very durable,26,10
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,just as described but my miniature long haired dashaund was able to shake them off in a few seconds no matter how i put them on might work better on a less hairy breed or a dog more tolerant of things on them he likes clothes but was not digging the shoes,53,11
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,velcro ties do not adjust and fit properly on my dogs paws i thought these were water proof but did not meet up with my expectations a bit disappointed constantly have to check to make sure boots are on dogs paws while walking in the snow occasionally slipping off paws,51,12

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the boots are not waterproof and do not stay on purchased them for our 18 pound pug they are a little large the problem we have is they will not stay on because the velcro is stiff and is not elastic at all our other dog boots from fashion pet are the same except they have elastic with the velcro at the ends and they stay on the elastic does not hold up although the other problem with ultra paws is they have a large foam pad stitched on the inside back of the boot which serves no purpose and actually made the boot not stay on at all removed the pad with a seam ripper and we now have a 30 chance of returning with them on,126,16
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,well made but my beagle would not wear them,9,17

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,quick delivery delayed a little bit by a massive blizzard boots are good although we may have benefitted from a size smaller because they do fall off if they are not on tightly very easy to out in and take off which is huge when you have a squirmy dog who constantly wants to go out,55,22
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i got x small my 10 shihtzu fits great in them velcro closure makes it easy to put on and tighten up his paws are a little lost in the boot we need them for the cold temps so he can withstand the snow while going out to do his business,52,23
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,got these for my 25ish pound miniature schnauzer who loves snow but is having issues with snow andballs forming between her toes when i take her snow shoeing these work better than i thought they would if you take the time to make sure they are on tight they stay on very well it was pretty funny watching her try them on for the first time have your phone ready to make the video once she hit the snow however she got it and off she went just like a puppy again,94,24
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,although the sizing was a bit off slightly large despite closely following the instructions and measuring twice these dog boots were exactly as described unfortunately the dog was less than impressed with them was afraid he would do more damage to his hips trying to get rid of them than simply walking without them it was worth a shot and I had bet the effectiveness heavily depends upon the dogs personality not docking the review for that just one star off because of the sizing issue,83,25
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,unfortunately I have had an extremely hard time keeping these on my pups feet they fall off within a few minutes of a walk,23,26
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,does not fit my dog and a full refund does not cover shipping cost,12,27

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,reasonable product but the x-small were huge on my 75 lb chi-weenie,12,29
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these boots were way bigger than advertised it seems like someone could actually design boots to work on dogs but nothing I have seen is designed well the only upshot was is that my dogs spent more time trying to get them off which distracting them from digging more holes in the yard but it only took five minutes for them to get them off,64,30
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the boots are really nicer than expected however my dog hates them and tries to pull them off,18,31
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the price was great and the shipping really quick i do recommend this seller for that reason the booties work most of the time on our elderly dachshund keeps him from slipping on our hardwood floors however they do tend to slip off because they are not formed to fit a dogs leg outside they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top i think these would work much better and stay on longer if there they were shaped to fit the bend of a dogs leg where the ankle is i think i might bend them and put a stitch there to give them a boot shape instead of mitten shape they really do help although and it is so funny watching them get used to walking in them,132,32
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the xs were way too big for 4 lb yorkie they looked like ridiculous hotpads on her paws she could not walk in them the bootie hotpads fell off immediately come in a package of 4,34,33
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they do not stay on during short walk,8,34

Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,once he got used to them on his paws he loved it walked 1/2 mile in 6 in of snow with no problem,22,42
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i bought these for my puggle pug beagle mix she is very hot / cold sensitive and this winter we have been having has really taken a toll on her when we go out to do her business she literally shivers and holds her paws up off the ground we live in the midwest and it has not been above 20 here for over 30 days now after getting used to these going outside is not as painful for her now she can scamper all around without having to lift her paws while she stands the only complaint i have is the measuring system these were an x-small and i measured as the instructions said to but they are still quite large on her so just be sure to note that they do run a little bit bigger than what you would expect the xx small would have fit better but these will certainly do other than that no complaints with the product,157,43
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,these boots are durable warm keep her feet dry and most importantly stay on her feet definitely a must have,20,44
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,i followed the sizing guidelines and believe it or not my 70 pound german shepherd required x small boots they are the correct width and they fit snugly over her paws but they are far too short and they do not go up past her wrist so they frequently slip off the top material is easily penetrated by her claws and they are coming apart after just a few days,69,45
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,we live in minnesota and have many sub-zero days when it was impossible for our bichon to stay outside more than 30 seconds with these boots she does not mind the cold at all they allow us to go for walks even on the coldest days she was cooperative about using them right from the start and i can get all four on in 30 seconds just make sure you pull the fastener really tightly and they will not come off,79,46
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my yorkie likes them at the begining she had a little problem walking but now she is used to them and they are good for the cold weather keeps her paws dry and warm,34,47
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,we hit 40f yesterday and even although our shih tzu is not crazy about wearing them ultra paws save his feet but i do not like wearing mittens either on most walks 1 block round trip or less he usually throws one or two off so i have to keep my eyes on the road but the ultra paws have made it possible to take those winter walks and pee on all his favorite snow banks one nice touch i noticed was a pad sewn into the inside on the upper part where the velcro wraps around the leg it makes it a bit more comfortable for him when i wrap those velcros around his ankle one of the straps was split and i had to use another strip of velcro in order to use the boot,136,48
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i tried several brands and they would come off when my dog was in a full run these stay on in long distances the tred could be a little thicker and they make the paws sweat but other than that they are golden,43,49
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my buddy could not stand on the tile or hard wood floors his legs would just spread out these gave him immediate traction they were a miracle i tried socks which were fine but kept falling off these stayed put until i took them off to walk him outside,49,50
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,this is a must have in your doggie wardrobe gosh the boots have been such a help because my dogs feet are white it is such a relief whew no more dirty paws i hated to take him for a walk but now it is so much better thanks amazon,50,51
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,the dog i cared for was unable to walk outside due to a yeast infection in his pads and with ultra paws he was able to go for a walk for the first time in a month in a half he had no problems walking in his ultra paws as a matter of fact he was galloping,57,52
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i have a toy french poodle four years old and his name is chunky roberto around twelve pounds usually in winter he was getting his paws and fur wet and i decided to give this product a try is a plus to make sure about the size triple check i got the xs and worked perfect make sure you tight enough so when your pet run the will not come off still working with chunky to put it on he does not like it and i understand is not his nature but once outside he walks and run as nothing first time shoes for my dog it was not bad good for after rain and snow not very wet paws,121,53
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,i have a 13 lb cavalier king charles-poodle mix i ordered the x-small boots her paws measured 1 1/2 the boots looked a little bulky when i first saw them but once i got them on and tightened both straps they seemed to fit well having 2 straps to secure them makes a huge difference there is also foam on the front and the back to help secure the boot around the leg as others have mentioned these are not great for snow more than a couple inches deep i let my dog run through the snow which is about 6 deep and she did get some snow on her legs right above the boots however the boots were tight enough to prevent snow getting inside leaving her paws completely dry we will definitely be using this when we go on walks in the winter,144,54
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I have used the software for years and highly recommend it to our customers for the price it is untouchable it is easy to use installs quickly and does a great job of teaching the language in question i can not understand why anyone would actually pay ten times as much for one of the other brands that at best is marginally better and at worst is largely the same richard bangs co-founder mountain travel sobek host and producer for the pbs series adventures with purpose,82,0
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was the senior buyer for the whole language and education software category at best buy for 5 years in that time the instant immersion brand consistently outsold all competitors we never got any complaints product returns and it was far and away the best selling product in our language assortment in my opinion it is a really great product it sounds to me like the other reviewers above have either a not actually used the software or b have ulterior motives and are associated with one of the instant immersion competitors that sells for ten times the cost we assorted numerous other language titles but none of them had the sell through needed to stay in our assortment,118,1
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,there is no way you could learn any useful spanish from this cd it is not worth it i would not pay a dime for this horrible product do not waste your money,31,2
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,if you want to learn straight vocabulary then this is your product however if you wish to learn how to speak spanish then do not waste your time or money it does not teach you how to construct sentences it basically teaches you random vocabulary and in the later lessons uses huge sentences in which you will only be able to pick up on the random vocabulary words to guess what they are talking about in short this will leave you in the dark on the bright side i now know how to say kangaroo in spanish,93,3
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i have been trying to learn spanish for years most of the products were simply too boring for me to stick with it this product has a ton of content for the money there are 6 different software programs on 6 discs the only complaint i have is that you need to swap discs for each level good and bad in addition to the software there is an audio cd as well as a dvd that you can play on a dvd player and an extra game i have not figured out the game yet but it is an adventure game that you need to navigate in spanish there is no manual so it is not easy to figure out the software programs have gameshows trivia and many photos of items that you need to identify in spanish overall i give this product 5 stars because of the value you simply get a lot for the money,156,4
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this product leaves you to educate yourself the first cd level 1 disk 1 has a word list an easy game a more difficult game and some other material there is no suggestion as to how you are to use these materials or proceed through the lessons it is a stretch to call them lessons since that suggests some degree of organization i give this product one star because you can not post a rating of zero,78,5

Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this would not even be worth a dollar you will not be able to learn spanish with this invest in rosetta stone instead do not waste your money with this cheap knock off what you will learn might be a few simple vocabulary words and some terms or sentences but you can learn those for free from free programs or apps or even from dora the explorer on tv you would learn more from exposure to telemundo than you will from this do not buy it,83,8
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,seems like the program itself is ok but i was looking for something to use while commuting the cds are not compatible,22,9

Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i like the fact that i can sit in my living room with earbuds in my ears in the middle of a group doing their own thing and learn repeating over and over spanish i like how vocab is in a male voice and then a female voice switching with each click i get to hear the pitch differences which have been so helpful i am happy that info is delivered incrementally and you can go anywhere you want basic to difficult and back again you can even wear it while you sleep and learn it subliminally if you like or learn it in your car using the mp3 disc it is very versatile,114,11
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,works great arrived quickly and my wife is well on her way to speaking spanish much cheaper than rosetta stone,20,12
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,great quick and easy way to learn spanish on the fly does not concentrate on the reading of a language,20,13
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,maybe it is me and I am just not capable of learning a foreign language as an adult funny i did not have this hard a time with high school german i just can not seem to learn from these spanish software programs this is the third I have tried for me i have had the best luck with repetitive audio programs i can listen to in the car or while running in my ipod maybe it is just that as an adult i do not have the time to sit and do a program and get nothing else done,96,14
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this set has been around a long time and always a great way to supplement other spanish language courses worth the investment,22,15
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my seventh grade homeschooled daughter has been using this product to learn spanish it is easy enough to set up that she was able to do it all on her own we would purchased rosetta stone at a much higher price but she likes this one better,46,16
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought it for our niece in law and she has not said not one negative word about the software to us we guess she loves it,29,17
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i brought this product to help in college but it was a waist of time because it only teach you the basic for example 1 to 20 this product does not help you at all the software looks cheap and the games are boring and pointless do not buy unless you just want to know random greetings and numbers,58,18
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students it is as good as other systems that cost you much more i think that spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years and this system gives you a good start,49,19
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i purchased instant immersion instead of rosetta stone which way more expensive i started to like it until i found out that there is no written material no book no pdf nothing most would agree 99 of any class I have taken had / required a book this one does not but it needs one I am sending my instant immersion back,57,20
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i took spanish in high school and college so i know and understand what some may consider to be a lot but i am far from fluent i would say i can talk with a child and even then i am not fluent this program did not help me in my goal to become fluent it did help me increase my vocabulary but as far as becoming a spanish speaker this program did not help i also found some errors with the translations an example is the english speaker said i am from a town and on the screen it said i am from a town called madrid like i said i know some spanish but this program has not helped me to become fluent when i read the reviews it was as good as rosetta stone but the tech support was not there i find this not to be true i have gotten the test demo from then and thought it to be more helpful,166,21
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,thank you for sending it on time but the box was destroyed when it arrived because whoever packed it wrapped it in a paper grocery bag really maybe next time put your merchandise in something a little sturdier so when it arrives to your client we do not get damaged goods just a thought i have not been able to start learning spanish because for some reason the disks will not play in my computer or dvd player even although the box clearly states that it is compatible so I am not thrilled but it did arrive on time beat up as it was,101,22
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,it is kind of a fun program my boys 3 and 5 love computer games and to them this is something of a game the vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of here are some words now you repeat them now you answer which is which that seems to work pretty well i have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet so i can not say anything there at this time one factor that i really like is that the program has two spanish speakers so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words we will keep using this and i hope to come back and update this review when i have gotten to the grammar lessons,123,23
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,wasted 600 dollar rosetta stone does not work level 1 works but once the words became anything longer than 6 letters it is basically useless and only frustrates you my mom is from spain and is completely fluent and the voice recognition kept on saying she was not saying it right and later she had one of her spanish friends try it and it did the same do not waste you money if you do i will sell you mine,74,24
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i bought this product for my daughter who is struggling in spanish in college after one week she understood and spoke spanish better than she had after two years in high school her test grades improved and her conversation grade improved the teacher noted her improvement instant immersion spanish 12 and 3,52,25
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,we purchased this product to give us a basic introduction to spanish right off the bat none of the disks would work with a mac i tried three different macs and encountered the same frustration the disks simply will not mount i can not review the effectiveness of the language lessons because we could only open the workbook do not waste your time we will be retuning this product to the store / manufaturer,71,26
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you do not need to spend hundreds of dollars on the other people who spend so much on advertising their product this one is the real deal easy to use ipod / iphone friendly my husband is already speaking a lot of spanish after a month it is truly incredible he is ready for his trips to several spanish speaking countries,58,27
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this program is definitely a good investment to learn basic spanish or just brush up it costs far less than comparable programs like rosetta stone i wish there was more vocabulary in it but i have learned a lot and am able to make and understand basic conversation my favorite part is that i can put it on my ipod and take it with me wherever i go,68,28
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i do not see someone learning the language there is very little actual instruction it provides very limited practice and relies heavily on oral input without accompanying written word brief lessons are followed by a game approach basic guessing results in high scores not worth the money I shall try rosetta stone instead,51,29
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,I have tried several times to give this set a fair shake but i just do not like it it feels sort of like a cut-budget rosetta stone software i do not feel as although I am learning anything the lessons are disjointed and sometimes confusing and there seem to be way more discs than there should be a language program like this can not be taking up that much memory all in all if i needed to really learn spanish I had go looking elsewhere for an effective product,84,30
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my children and i are using this to learn spanish we love to compete with each other on the quizzes on the dvd we have not been able to use the computer discs although because our cd drive broke but we are learning a lot from the dvd however the girls accent is thick and a little hard to understand at times but since they put the words on the screen you can figure out how to say it,79,31
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,have not yet begun in earnest looks very adaquate for what i was looking for the games make it less onerous,21,32
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and i am running on win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program not my machine it slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the cd the product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace some disks require installing programs such as flash and quick time i do not like programs that use because flash contains spy-ware tracking that you have to go to the adobe website to disable some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format if i had demoed instant immersion first i never would have bought it,130,33
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you get out what you put in this system let us you learn words and phrases then match them to pictures and audio with games it would be great for a child to use i had found it necessary to communicate with spanish people who refuse to learn our language i had put it off long enough and now use the system for relaxation after a long day at work this is the first type of system i have used and for the price you simply can not beat it do not waste your money on a more expensive system before trying this one,101,34
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i can not stress enough how absolutely terrible this software is it freezes my computer within 15 minutes of putting it in a help box constantly comes up saying that there is a timing error the quality is bare minimum do not waste you are money on it,45,35
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,save your money just save it and spend on rosetta stone if you really want to learn spanish thanks this is tourist stuff too simple,25,36
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,I have used rosetta stone and I have used this immersion program and this one just can not compare it is repetitive to the point of annoying the graphics are awful and it does not have the intuitive learning progression the rosetta programs have definitely a poor choice,45,37
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I am very pleased I am getting better with my spanish all the time it seems much easier then any other program I have tried,22,38
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,first time user of this product gives a good introduction to the language plus it s fun for the price would recommend to anyone,22,39
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have use rosetta stone and i think this is very similar definitely try it the price is better than most other programs,23,40
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,thank you it was everything you said it was I am glad i decided to purchase this such great service thank you again will purchase from this site again,28,41
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my son purchased this program he is an emt and wanted to learn spanish to help his patients he said he loves the program you can not beat the price it repeats words back to you so you get the correct pronunciation my son-in-law is spanish speaking and bought the spanish to english program his english noticeably improved when he started using the program it is like anything else you have to keep doing it i would definitely recommend this product,79,42
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was pleased when god led me to this product i had wanted to purchase the rosetta stone software but found it too expensive then god showed me this software in a catalogue although i have only used disk one of this program i can say that it is a fun way to learn a language the pictures make learning the the vocabulary easier i took spanish while i was in school now more than ten years later I am using this as mostly a review i like instant immersion and would recommend it because it is fun and you can not lose at 3500,102,43
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this is a great product it is very user friendly and lots of fun i think it is well worth the cost i have recommended this product to my friends and co-workers,31,44
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,disc is damaged has loud humming noise that is very distracting while trying to learn shipping and packaging was however quick and efficient,22,45
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i got this program so i could keep my fluency at about the same level over summer break i was really hoping for a basic program that would simply teach you spanish and allow you to listen to spanish conversations and try to interpret them but this product is clearly aimed at elementary school children it is laden with a heavy graphical interface i would not get this program if you were serious about learning spanish i just could not use it because it is so ridiculous it does not even make sense it might just be better to get rosetta stone but rs costs like 500 dollars you pay for what you get i guess it also never really immerses you in spanish even if you were to ignore the interface it is still a very poor learning experience maybe if you want you child to try and learn spanish this program would be good but from my experience nothing works better than traditional classes and actual conversations with spanish peoples,169,46
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,upon starting the software learning regimen i found it easy to navigate and fun to learn for all the negativity written about this software I had have to say those people are out of there minds what you learn is spain spanish for what you get compared to the price it is a no brainer for those of us who did not learn rudimentary spanish in school this is a great product i come from a spanish background never learning the language i did not have the discipline to learn until now you really need to converse with other spanish speaking people to get it to sink in practice makes perfect i am already thinking in spanish overall I had say it is worth the investment where else can you learn so much for so little wonderful product that is highly recommended,137,47
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought immersion spanish a few weeks ago and when i uploaded the first cd to my computer it was just that-instant it has a male spanish speaker and a female spanish speaker who pronounced the words each in different ways to give a clear understanding of how to pronunce the words it has a clock like list of lessons firstwords food colors phrases countries shopping time numbers and body on cd 1 you click on the topic you want to practice after you practice you can click on a word practice session or an easy or hard game session it has a speaking practice where you can speak and listen to how you pronounce the words it also has a dictionary you can print when I am done with level 1 i will progress to levels 2 and 3 of the other cds i think it is easy and to the point great,154,48
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i found instant immersion to be ok i mean it is no rosetta stone but of course rosetta stone costs hundreds of dollars so this is a great value for what you get i find that it is probably most helpful as a supplement for a beginning spanish class if it is been a couple of years since your last class and your basic spanish is rusty like me or if you just want to learn a few conversational phrases for a trip or to be able to communicate on a very basic level way more interesting than just having a book or a cassette i would hardly call it immersion however unless they sent several spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program which they do not by the way it is nice that it works on both pc and mac i do not see that a lot with software especially when it is fairly inexpensive,153,49
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i started with disc 1 which reviewed vocabulary i really enjoyed playing the easy and advanced games at the end of the program however i had major problems with disc 2 after returning the product to the store and getting the same program i thought it was my computer i opened disc 2 on another computer although i could open the program i had trouble exiting the program and saving my scores disc 2 contains vocabulary to memorize but without the easy and advanced games at the end i found disc 2 to be very boring although disc 1 was fun and easy to use i do not recommend buying this product,113,50
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,there are a whole bunch of comparisons between this product and rosetta stone already but I shall throw my two cents in I have got both and found this product cheap in every sense of that word rosetta stone was definitely the better product of the two and was more what I had call immersion instant immersion is not immersion it is mostly memorization more so than rosetta stone this is not a product you could really learn the language from I had say it is best use is for a student in a low level spanish class to get a little more practice also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp for instance azul becomes athththul or azcar becomes ah-ffffu-cah overall this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other spanish class you almost certainly will not learn spanish from it at least alone then again it would be hard to learn it solely from rosetta stone so at least this is cheaper,173,51
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,in this audio you can hear the lady swallow breath and even hear the spit in her mouth it is disgusting on all levels I am surprised they could not delete these sounds when doing the final edititing all i can hear is her taking deep breaths and swallowing very thick spit either the lady is dehydrated or is diabetic ew,60,52
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i picked this product as a less expensive alternative to the allegedly more robust language software offered by rosetta stone since i had studied spanish years ago i thought this package might help me restore my former skill with the vocabulary which always seemed to be my weak point admittedly i failed to remember that since this is a cd-rom it runs from the dvd and i was not expecting the program to run as slowly as it did but my bigger problem was the interface the lack of instructions even rudimentary ones and the blurred accents of the native voices that i was supposed to mimic it is possible that this product might be appealing to small children since it uses cartoonish characters for me after several hours of frustration i decided i would have to try another approach,138,53
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my daughter chose the rosetta stone-more bells and whistles but instant immersion spanish is plenty for me as i try to learn spanish i am glad i bought it enjoy the ipod program while on my daily walks and look forward to pursuing at my own pace on my computer without feeling intimated in a class room setting and much cheaper too i also have been very pleased each time i use amazoncom-i checked other sites and this was best price and service,82,54
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i got this to help me pass my spanish college class i love it ],15,55
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,disclaimer i am reviewing a copy i received for free through the vine program this is a good program and is worth the selling price i think you can read the other reviews comparing it to rosetta stones and other vendors spanish language programs this is a little cheaper but still does quite well at least in the limited time we have spent with it we have not gotten too far along yet,73,56
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i have used rosetta stone and this product i agree that neither are quite what they promise which is an easy way to learn a language for someone to compare this favorably to rs is highly suspicious to me after multiple failed attempts to get this product to work on my mac i went to a pc laptop to actually check it out this product compares to rosetta stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak this is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list perhaps that is worth the money but do not confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from rosetta stone my problem with rs is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary so in that sense this would be a nice complement to rs the audio cds included in this are actual lessons thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing it is really not comparable to rs at all and any comparison is incredibly unfair they should take those claims off of their packaging I shall be demanding a refund for the mac incompatibility but otherwise would make use of the money back guarantee save yourself the hassle,199,57
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like it but it seems more like a game than a real teaching tool the cd roms do not break down the language like i would have liked them to they teach you the names for colors or objects but do not put it into a sentence for you and I have learned that spanish speaking is backwards so that does not really help speak the language the cd for the ipod is wonderful although it really breaks down why the language is the way it is that 1 cd is worth the price of the whole hope this helped,97,58
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought it because i need some basic spanish for a trip i found it useful to have different methods of learning audio ipod sentences common phrases matching games guessing games and a video i think i got enough of what i need to travel to mexico i was comfortable enough to understand the key words from what people were saying i did use the tech support site and found my answer in their onlinei even asked a question and got an email response in about 3 hours that contained useful stuff but also had links to the exact answer pdf document for my needs i am glad i did not spend the money on more expensive products that would sit on the shelf when the trip was done,132,59
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this progress takes a lot of time to work through but it is very helpful to develop conversational skills it covers travel questions and answers shopping and day to day activities it builds one lesson to the next which is also helpful if you follow through the program you can learn converstaional spanish a person will not get fluent in a this language with this program but it is helpful if you are unable to enroll in college courses it also is good to use between breaks if you are taking a college course it funtions well on the computer and i had no software issues with this program,108,60
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,takes a bit for slower computers to kick up the cd-rom drive I had suggest loading this on you hd if possible seems ok on computer with faster processor and cd-rom / dvd drive the first disks take a little fishing around with unlabeled tabs but this could be intentional to get your mind into another space fun and easy to useincludes flash card type games lots of repetition of vocabulary and as much on pronunciation as you would like covers general travel conversation including medical emergencies and business a great start for starting to learn a new language can not beat the price would suggest for students who are considering or will be taking spanish in high school and/or college it is good to familiarize yourself with the language sentence structure and more before jumping in and this is at your own pace is not mexican spanish but castillian spanish good to use if you are going to take a trip as the basics are very helpful even if shopping great way to start learning spanish and you will find there is much cross-over to mexican spanish italian potugese and more on your own if you go onto learn more languages,193,61
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,well worth the money disc includes many spanish words and phrases and let us you listen as well as see the words in print it allows you to take quizes and receive a score you can record the words in your own voice after listening to the words on the disc you will have to have a headset to do this,60,62
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i do not think there has much i can add to the other reviewers here there has lots of vocab but not a lot of grammar the option to listen to vocab lists on an mp3 player is nice and convenient and let us me review while driving the flash cards are good reinforcement I am not finished with the whole set yet but even when i get there I am certainly not going to be fluent that is impossible but i think this would be a great companion to a spanish class i do not think there is enough grammar to be a stand-alone course although I had like to see more grammar lessons bottom line if you are trying to learn spanish go ahead and give this a try at this cost you do not have much to lose,127,63
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i purchased rosetta stone spanish level 1 and completed it i was ready to purchase level 2 but it cost so much i wanted to try spanish immersion immersion is much simpler and is not comparable to rosetta stone it is good for learning nouns but no way could you learn the language for example in rosetta stone you say a word or phrase and if your pronunciation is good enough it accepts it at first i thought i pronounced words good enough but rosetta stone made me keep saying them till i got it correct in immersion you pronounce a word it records it you play it back and rate your own pronunciation,114,64
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like this langauge learning system much better than other ones I have tried such as fluenz i have not tried rosetta stone too expensive likes colorful clickable graphics menu system excellent organization colors numbers foods phrases and more both male and female speech examples for all games are fun and easy to learn some games show how the word is spelled as well as spoken works with apple products including ipod and iphone professionally done dislikes there is one bad recording for hola on the dvd did not automatically run upon putting in the disk have windows vista had to manually begin install am i actually learning the language yes at least the basics overall this company is on the right track,120,65
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have wanted to learn spanish as a second language for years i have used tapes cds and software but i always found them boring and i did not stick with them what is different about instant immersion spanish is the fun you have while learning the language while the approach used in this software is similar to other more expensive programs it is less of an investment than if you bought one of the high priced programs and still comparable in quality for someone beginning to learn spanish instant immersion spanish is fun and effective it would rate this program a high value for the price,106,66
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,without a knowledge of spanish i was able to skip all of the work to the end and get 90 - 100 on all the quizzes if answers are multiple choice then the correct choice is always much too obvious this makes it impossible to get good feedback on whether or not I am actually learning anything i found myself making flashcards of the material and doing it myself there is a satisfaction guarantee from the publisher on this product and i will be sending it back free spanish flashcard software and literature i found on the internet was much more productive,99,67
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,you know if you think you want to learn a language but are not sure then instant immersion is a great place to start it does not cost a lot and it gives you in miniature what the big boys rosetta and tellmemore give you will not feel swamped likely and you will get a feel for what software language learning is like i sampled the spanish version and i am asssuming the other languages offered are similar remember too one learning source will not deliver fluency it is a long slog instant immersion is a good way to start,97,68
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i bought this package thinking it was similar to rosetta stone i liked rosetta stone but do not believe it is comprehensive or rigorous enough to teach the basics of a language not worth the price it is a great introduction to pronunciation of simple everyday words it would be great for a junior high school student taking the language in school with a text but no way does it teach grammar it is a good supplement this software package was similar in that it did not teach any grammar and had no structured lessons in how to form sentences the only two disks i found useful were the first two which introduced many common words the rest of the disks were just haphazard phrases which might be good for intuitive learning but it was by no means in depth enough to learn the basics if you are a tourist trying to just get by for a few weeks this might be useful but if you really want to learn a language take a college course i would not mind if i had paid under 30 for this but i feel it is overpriced at 49,190,69
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this software is for the very beginners even the level 3 disc 2 does not fligh very highyou are not able to watch conversationnal videos like you do in other brands on the market in the same range of price i tried to play the cd oskar lake and could notit sounds very complicated i went to their website nothing helpful,61,70
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,the title on the instant immersion box asks why does rosetta stone cost so much more it is because rosetta stone is so much better than the instant spanish immersion program i am a spanish and esl teacher i have used both programs rosetta stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face you will be fluent in any language after using rosetta stone however this instant spanish immersion program does not use immersion it teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other you can quickly progress through the cds without learning any grammar how can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences well after you waist 4000 on this product and try rosetta stone you will find out what i am talking about level 1 in rosetta stone will teach you more about the spanish language than a few cds in this cheep program why do i need 3 cds to teach me the numbers 1 through 20 that is rediculous not even my four year old is interested in the program [ ],193,71
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i chose instant immersion spanish for introductory level spanish for my high school daughters they are in the process of working through it and enjoy it as a consumer the things you should know about this are the following it is easy to use there is not much guidance about how to use it but not much would be necessary since you are being immersed it is the same as if you were simply left in a spanish-speaking country and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the cds from level to level it does keep track of your progress as you learn thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at spanish for the price it is an excellent program to read a review of this curriculum and nine other spanish programs available this year see this site [ ] we use this product on an ibook but it can be run on windows as well,162,72
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this product is as good as the expensive and well-known brand why pay more,14,73
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,dvd did not work or play what a bummer i guess i get what i paid for,17,74
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,very bad if your trying to learn how to speak spanish do not buy this,15,75
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,work as described great product for the price recommend,9,76
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i got suckered there is nothing on the cds they are blank,12,77
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i recently got an etrex summit gps and bought this software in order to download the trips i take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them the bottom line is that this 3 cd-rom set does not contain nearly enough information to do that i took a 4 mile hike this weekend near san francisco and downloaded it to the software it does show the track that we walked but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can not tell that we went up and down gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated furthermore the road into the park was not drawn correctly the ranger station and other services were not marked and so on in short the maps provided will not allow you to plan a hike which was the point in the first place right,155,0
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,these maps contain a good amount of detail within the confines of existing technology the maps include dirt roads hiking trails streams waypoint and of course elevation changes these maps cover the entire us and are used in conjunction with garmin gps units i would recomend this software to anyone with a garmin gps who wants to camp or hike with their gps as a navigation tool however be aware they will not be accurate enough in many situations and you probably want to have a secondary navigation tool available to you my experience with the unit has primarily been driving through forest areas and short hiking and camping outings,110,1
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i bought the garmin gpsmap 60csx and about 40000 worth of software i was under the impression that the topo us 2008 product was the digital equivalent of the usgs 24k but due to space concerns i assumed it would be perhaps half the resolution otherwise my gps would be the size and weight of a car battery i was greatly mistaken at how inaccurate it was after reading many other reviews i said heck with it and ignored thesayers in favor of purchasing it in my opinion thisis worthless i recommend that others avoid it garmins units are great but their maps and licensing especially the unlock wizards are a joke i recommend buying another product altogether thesayers are correct,129,2
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i found mapsource to be a top rated program with a short learning curve i like it,17,3
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i paid a lot of money for this cd upgrade for my garmin and i still have not downloaded it after a year i took it to two expert computer shops and they can not do it i went to website downloaded countless updates and drivers and it still will not work i will never buy a garmin product again,57,4
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,it is taking me a while to get a hang of this product but I am able to download and upload tracks for my etrex legend and that was my main goal trip planning also looks useful it does not have many national forest trails in it and the trails it does have are generally poorly labled it is still a good way to make my gps more useful and possibly avoid picking up too many free trail maps to clutter my gear closet one gripe i have but may be me learning is that you do not seem to be able to open a saved map file and then add a new track to it that makes it hard to create a long-term record of ones hikes,123,5
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you want more detail then get the larger scale maps these serve the purpose of their scale 1100000 if you need more detail then you will need mapsource us topo 24k national parks it has a scale of 124000 that should be all the detail you need i only give 4 stars because it does not have some of the main trails of the northeast,65,6
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,good as long as you do not require detailed maps and topography certainly better than the base map pre-installed on most garmin units but simply lacking in detail,27,7
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,they sent me version 302 so i have to download updates to get it up to version 6x why do they send outdated versions and place the burden on the consumer and of course you will only realize your software is outdated when you have mind boggling problems getting it to work or even installed this is the way to drive away customers,62,8
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60csx gps and so far it is been great for that I have also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop and that is worked out well too my only compliant is that the back roads are not labeled on my gps screen so it makes it hard when I am driving and want to know quickly what road I am looking at but the routes are pretty accurate so i can usually identify by that also some of the data is out of date for those remote roads I have found a couple so far that are listed as roads but have been converted to hiking trails or reverted to elk trails many years ago coupled with a more detailed and sometimes more recent although not always forest service map it is just fine well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen gps maps,152,9
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i love this product first copy this disk to your hard disk and then install from there then you do not have to used the cd each time youthe mapsource application also be sure to download the latest version of mapsource from garmin after you install the cd version,50,10
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,basically what you would expect in a 124k topo set the thing to be aware of is that these are topo maps not trail maps although they do seem to have a lot of the major trails on them I am using them to plan a trip to four national parks this fall one notable feature of this set is that it can be installed 100 onto the computer hard drive without jumping through any hoops so once you have installed the maps you can put the cds away for safekeeping,90,11
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,their software is very bad difficult to use expensive full of errors and gives a lot of problems a package costs over 100 and it does not even work,28,12
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,mapsource topo us has out dated maps by at least 6 - 10 year in pa and half the time the map dose not line up with the gps with roads and elevation when i emailed them about update i was told that the government sends them update and they have not gotten any in a while to me it sounds like there depending on other people to do there work for the price they charge they should be checking on the updates or doing them,83,13
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information i was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too certainly mountains do not change often but some trail land does i got it for terrain information of hawaii and it was adequate in this instance there was not the option of using the national park mapset i can not say personally but i would hope the national park mapset is more up to date,97,14
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i got this software a couple of months ago and i still have not been able to figure out how to use it the instructions that come along with the package assume you are a computer geek pass on this unless you have a lot of time to try and figure out how to make good use of it,58,15
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this software used in combination with my gps is fantastic i am more confident in the woods even in the dark the best part is while on the road I shall never have to stop and ask for directions again you will never have to admit to your wife your lost again,50,16
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,many people have complained about the inaccuracies and lack of detail that garmins topo software provides however i am completely satisfied with this product it has more than adequate detail for my hiking and mountain biking needs and provides a ton of additional roadways over the basemap those of you who just intend on getting by with your basemap do not know what you are missing if you intend on doing a lot of out of state travel you would be wise to also invest in garmins city navigator software which places more emphasis on maps of major metro areas the software is a joy to use requiring little effort to copy maps onto a compatible gps also mapsource topo does not require an unlock like other garmin products just install and go,131,17
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,not for the serious hiker this map is way off on it is accuracy want to plan a hike on your pc before hand forget it contours are 100 feet incurements very limited reference points actually had me on the wrong side of a creek no bench mark refferences use your garman gps it is a great tool but do not waste your time or money with this map stick to your usga maps,70,18
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i just purchased this software with a garmin etrac legend i drove to the seacoast down many major highways that were not on the map even although they are 10 to 15 years old on my garmin i am always north of the features on the map i do not know if this is a map error or a gps error the mapsource software on the cd is old by several versions the new software is free online you do get what you pay for this software is not expensive but it is not very good on detail either,98,19
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,probably mapsource deserves a higher rating but i have only used it deer hunting in eastern oregon so far it was easy toand added a lot of detail even in a very rural area with only forest service roads the contours helped me to keep from falling into a ravine and being forced into a direction that i did not want to go i can not wait tomore of the map and some different areas i like the fact that you only have towhat you will be using it did not take as much memory as i expected it would i would not use a gps without it again,113,20
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,it is easy tobut the data is old and does not show accurate local information it was too broad for my use,24,21
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this software to help navigate the logging roads and mountain biking trails in north kitsap county washington state what trails are shown are largely accurate but not perfect some logging roads show a dead-end where it actually continues still although it is way better than nothing and impressive topo data,51,22
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,pros 1 memory requirements are no problem the 64 mb card can easily swallow several states worth of maps 2 if you do not mind not having street names depicted this software can easily allow you to course navigate with the plethora of street detail included 3 contour and waterway detail is spot-on 4 overall i was impressed with the logging roads and trails depicted for the state of maine they matched my delorme paper maps contour-for-contour cons 1 you can not input two waypoints and get turn-by-turn navigation guidance for highway travel a la mapquest rather you have to manually enter waypoints for every bend in your journey and this goes for pc set-up 2 if you want your track to remain right on the depicted road while traveling on highways you must stay in a higher scale cuz when you zoom in you almost inevitably end up a millimeter or two off course on your screen 3 price,156,23
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,while some of the maps are somewhat outdated the program provides decent to even very good coverge to make the gps 60 much more functional without this software you are missing out on much of the capabilities of the garmin 60 series to me it is a must have,47,24
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,very imprecise poor and obsolete software lack of trails roads and more could be even danger in the remote area to person who trust it you will have some use but rather with good paper topographic map,37,25
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you understand this products limits before you buy it you will be happy it shows topographical contours rivers and most streams for the entire united states in addition to that it shows roads that were in existance 10 - 20 years ago these major roads are also named the limit is that newer roads do not show up it also does not support auto-routing even if your gps does garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package is not suited for it the product support could be better neither the manual nor web site tell you how toall 3 cds on your computer so you do not have to swap cds when transitioning between zones the companys web site does not give a good explanation of what the software can and can not do you will be disappointed if your expectations are not grounded in reality garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available,169,26
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i went to the ponderosa and sawtooth mountains with my new mapsource all of the major trails and many of the smaller ones i hiked were mapped the screen was easy to read at both close-up and enlarged formats i would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the mountains and forests,52,27
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you hike in areas not covered by mapsources national parks 24k then this is the only way to get topo maps into your garmin gps unit the scale is 1100000 in united states topo whereas the national parks version is 124000 so you get less detail but complete coverage one nit-pick although it is not garmins fault the 1100000 scale usgs maps are in metric so garmin converted the meter contours to feet which means that even contours like 1000 meters is shown as 3280 feet at least you do not have to deal with elevations in meters although,97,28
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,this gps mapping program is a real disappointment to begin with there is insufficient documentation to get started using it once you do fumble your way through you discover that it lacks detail enough to be very useful it is an outdated program for todays powerful gps units,48,29
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,the detail is pretty poor i was expecting better since the bluecharts and citi select is outstanding,17,30
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,the detail on this software is horrible there has an area we like to go camping and i found the area with this software it has one of the 3 major lakes in the area shows none of the forest roads hiking trails or campsites and i have it set on highest detail garmin makes great hardware but horrible software,59,31
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i found out today 06/28/06 from garmin after i contacted them about a transter problim with the cd software that the last update to the soft was in 1999 i was superised that the program is this old frankly that is not addiquit but there is nothing i can do with that,50,32
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,for hiking purposes these low detail topo maps are just barely ok there has so little detail it is not easy to create waypoints on your gps if your hiking trail is not already represented on this cd and believe me the trail data on this cd is not remotely up-to-date or detailed i honestly can not reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain united states parks one should always rely first on a godd printed hiking trail map but sheesh i was expecting more from these garmin maps,102,33
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i live in colorado and am amazed at how terrible the maps on garmins mapsource are rivers start and stop roads that have been there since the 1800s do not show up none of the trails are named it is really bad i would think that if garmin was going to force us to by their maps they would make an effort to improve them i would say that anyone with a garmin who is going to use it for 4wd roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints,91,34
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i was very dissapointed in finding that the maps on the cd is very outdated the one cover the areas around my house just outside denver must be over 30 years old i am also dissapointed by the resolution of the maps not even near the picture shown on the box,51,35
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this software loaded easily on to my pc i was able to use it on the pc and then download it to my garmin 60cs without a problem i have not used all the features but for the off road riding i have done since i bought the software it has definately helped when navigating especially trying to find the fastest way back to base camp using roads that is powerline or forest roads my only complaint is that this software does not show all the roads and trails in the forrest i was riding in however it was comprehensive none the same,100,36
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this is great product it has great detail and is extremely easy to use i found it a perfect match for my uses from work to hunting,27,37
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,you sent the correctbut we did not order the one we really wanted i returned the garmin etrex vista and you sent refund information thank you now my daughters boyfriend has ordered the correct one for me the garmin map source cd rom is fine and we are keeping it,51,38
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i was not sure what i was getting when i purchased this topo package but am very pleased it is a great addition to the tools that geocachers use with plenty of detail i was also surprised that many of the better known trails especially in state and national parks are marked on the maps however it is easy to get spoiled by that and i find myself wishing more of the trails were marked i still feel that this software will exceed most peoples expectations my state of virginia takes up about 36 mb of storage on my gps so to store a whole lot you will need a gps with a lot of room i loaded mine with just the areas i frequent the most and any planned geocaching areas as the need arises also if you know you are traveling to an area you can print the topo map and put it in a zip lock bag for a map to go,160,39
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,a great map to have when you are out hiking off the trail i can find the easiest route around hills and swamps i wish to avoid long before they become a problem,33,40
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,the topo softwear that is offered by garmin is the poorest quality i have ever seen i called garmin myself and found out that they have not updated the topo softwear in more than a decade plus they have rivers labled as strems major roads missing and no road where there should be a road i was so discusted with garmin i sent my gps unit back if your looking for good quality topo softwear for a gps unit try lowrance gps units there much better than garmin lowrance updates there softwear regularly,93,41
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,if you are looking for a product that provides reasonable topography for camping hiking or just plain trail blazing this is it it is not intended to be used as a street map / guide although it has most major roads amazons price was great and i really enjoy the product my one nit is the installation instructions should indicate to install all cds on your hard drive then actually perform the installation by doing this eliminates the need to insert a cd everytime you want to pull up a chart,89,42
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,it was not easy but i finally got my us topo software installed so i do not have to mess with the cds garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install basically you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder using the copy command from the drop down menu will not work so you have to work around this issue on the second and third cd you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called east alaska and hawaii once done it will take a while do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive i had called customer support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes i discovered that the customer support at garmin sucks i love the gps i love the software but the customer support is a total waste of time amazoncom was quick with delivery offered my gps and software at a fair price and they were a pleasure to deal with as usual i will continue to purchase from amazoncom,195,43
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,not recommended due to poor graphics delorme mapping is a much better product,13,44
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,the software is great but i had to learn from the garmin technical support how to install the software on my hard drive without having to keep the cds handy it is simple just copy the cd s to your hard drive then install from there if you have already installed the software you will have to uninstall it first,56,45
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i use this software in a gps map 76cs when riding an atv it shows many existing atv and snowmobile trails sometimes with the trail name it also shows most logging roads with names where applicable streams lakes and ponds are also listed it is very accurate and makes it easy to see where you are in relation to known landmarks it is just what i was looking for,67,46
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i purchased the us topo 24k national parks series last year because i needed topos of death valley this year i needed topos of nevada so i bought united states topo i was expecting the detail to be less than adequate but was pleasantly surprised every trail and jeep road we traveled was shown as well as all the abandoned mines and quarries we visited if you do not need the terrain detail of the 24k series give united states topo a try first the one thing i am disappointed with is the programs insistence of having the cd in the drive to work this is quite annoying mapsource city select and united states topo 24k both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive united states topo should too,129,47
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,lots of interesting data such as peaks and other landmarks the data is not very detailed sometimes however I am guessing that the data came from the 15 topo maps on a trip i made to yosemite the data had the same error contained on the 15 topo maps and the yosemite park maps itself apparently the 75 map has the right data the data had to do with the layout of some drainages,73,48
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,the mapsource topo map cd is a great addon for the garmin gps units the original maps that were preloaded on the gps handheld unit were very minimal and now i have all the detail i need with the handheld unit i am a paper map kind of a person so i am very happy with the level of detail that comes with this program now my gps has enough detailed information to tell me exactly where i am so i can find myself on a paper map excellent simple program,91,49
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this cd to help me plan a hunting trip in alaska i had planned on using the computer topo in conjunction with my gps to plot routes to lakes valleysto hunt the topo maps for the area i am planning on hunting are incomplete there are large lakes missing from the map so the cd is limited in it is usefulness to me i have a paper topo of the same area and will be able to make my hunt no thanks to the cd-topo,88,50
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,compared to magellan mapsend the detail provided by mapsource was poor not up to date and overall poor quality,19,51
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this product to be able to upload topo maps onto my garmin etrex vista this is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your garmin unit other software claims to work with your garmin gps but they only download / upload waypoints this software is way overpriced it runs off the cd-rom so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps i tried copying the cds to my drive and installing from there and it would not work when pulling waypoints / routes / tracks from the gps unit mapsource always opens up a new map document you can not import into the map you have open without copying and pasting this is probably the most overpriced counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since ms office what this all boils down to is if you need detailed topo maps for your garmin unit you will have to she shall out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software,158,52
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this product is what it is it is not a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it it is a basic set of topo maps that shows most local roads what do you want for under 100 for a set of maps that covers the entire united states it does not have every street name the water maps are a little sparce and some of the feature names are dated i bought i like it i use it for what it is good for bottom line is that this is a tool like any other you would not build a car engine with nothing but a 5 pair of pliers but you could you can mow your entire lawn with a 29 string trimer but you would not this is a basic 100 set of maps of the entire united states for the price you can not beat the detail if i had it to do over again i would still buy topo united states because it works for me,169,53
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i call garmin directly and asked them if i can find a product which helps me find new trails and i can install it on my notebook without using the cd the told me i need to use topo united states i loaded the program but it needed the cd i found out in here how can i install so never ask for the cd this is nasty the trail detail is that it will give you a point i hope at least the trail is crossing it i am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point maybe it is a vertical trail straight up i hate the map i still like the gps do not buy this it is a waste of money attila csakberenyi,131,54
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i installed this software package on my year-old computer but when i tried to start it i just got an error log file to be emailed to garmin their tech support department was closed worse another garmin software package metroguide had now stopped working and the windows uninstaller kept crashing when i tried to remove them a good hour and a half later i have finally reinstalled metroguide and made it run but united states topo is going back to the store i already have enough things that do not work,89,55
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,this software is garbage it barely works even after being updated to the latest version available on their web site try zooming in or panning the map or transfering to your gps and 90 of the time it will crash or tell you an error occured i can not beleive a company with a name like garmins would ship something so completely useless and overpriced if you have a garmin gps and you want maps for your gps you are stuck with garmins software so do not buy a garmin gps either,90,56
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,to bad there was not a choice to give this 0 stars mapsource maps are not good enough to deserve 1 star i spent over a thousand bucks on a garmin streetpilot and the mapsource unlock keys the streetpilot would be a great investment if it used maps other than those ones produced by mapsource if i use my streetpilot as the gps receiver and hook it up to my laptop and run microsofts mappoint i get much more detailed maps and better accuracy if garmin wanted to improve their product they would leave the hardware alone and ditch mapsource,97,57
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,the maps are a great addition to my etrex vista downloading was a piece of cake i was able to get the entire state of mississippi and parts of the surrounding states on the vista 24 mb every road and back road that is several years old are on here typical of any topo map you can go to garmins website to see what is shown in your area going from having only the major roads to having all land marks streams small lakes elevation lines really adds to the gps the amount of detail can be adjusted to your preference I have also been impressed with how accurate your position relative to the landmarks are i rated it only 4 stars because i noticed the price got jacked up from 76 to 90 bucks i bought this only 2 weeks ago,135,58
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this works adequately on my new gps v the only problem is the topo maps do not allow auto-routing by the v to calculate routes around trails and more so it is back to standard gps map navigation but one use I have found is this some points of interest are not in the gps v base map nor are they in the against city select software so i simultaneouslythe topo software and presto i can pick out the topos points of interest set a waypoint up then route to it via the city select map it works fine that is unless you are finding a place which doenst have a road but for driving to trail heads and other topo type features it is helped me but it loses a star since i can not route directly on the topo maps on my v,137,59
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i had said not to buy thisbecause it was an old version that was not true there are 2 versions on the product the application is version 409 the newest shipping version the maps are version 302 they are rarely updated amazon is a great place to purchase this,52,60
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,in a prior review i stated that the mapsource topographical software looked good on the computer screen but that i had not yet tested it in the field now i have i gave it it is first tryout on a long difficult mountain bike ride in a remote part of henry willard coe state park near gilroy california it worked as well on the gps as it did on my pc and again i have no hesitation in recommending it perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with united states geological survey topographical maps or other navigation aids so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed i agree with a prior review that it would be helpful to include a feature displaying the elevation profile of a given route,135,61
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this software where quadrangles have been spliced together the roads railroads rivers and contour lines do not meet across the join line signatures change at quadrangle borders also the data are not up to date in hamden the canal rail-trail is shown as an active railroad finally there are very few identified streets overall the product looks like a rough draft rather than a finished product,71,62
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,the software works fine and uploads easily the maps seem to be 10 plus years out of date since they are missing sections of state highway and local streets in the greater seattle area that have been completed for at least that long it also does not include street names for local streets only state and federal highways i noticed it does include local streets for some small villages in alaska i definately would not recommend this set for urban navigation but i do like the topigraphocal features and the shoreline markers but have not been able to determine if they are up do date,105,63
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,we bought this software for the purpose of locating hiking trails and downloading the info into our etrex vista the vista by the way is a great little unit this topo software is not anyway the topo software did not contain a single hiking trail for many of the falls that we hike to in the adirondacks thumbs way down for this product if you are a hiker,68,64
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this product for hikes and to guide me in navigating rivers only very major roads are named so i can not use this very easily to calculate my route there most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should the elevations and detail are very course no trails are shown i am not very happy i bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job fyi i bought this to use with my etrex legend which i think is just great,128,65
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this product did exactly what i needed it to do and at a very reasonable price this used edition came in very good shape looks like it was hardly used used the upgrade available from garmin just went to help check for updates the program then works well with my garmin gps 60csx,53,66
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i did not care for this product because the maps for the areas to the west of the mississippi river have no street level detail to show county roads or streets away from major cities good luck trying to plot a course to a location out in the country that is any distance 1 mile or more off of a major interstate highway or is not a national landmark,68,67
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,garmin products come with an unlock code they can only be installed on one computer and used on one garmin gps device i bought this produce used and so it is my own fault for not considering that the unlock code would be used as well so yes the disks are in perfect condition yes these are genuine garmin disks no i can not use them to put topo maps into my garmin legend purchasing garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment if you are going to buy them you need to buy them new and you need to purchase one copy for every device you are going tothe maps on so if you have three garmin gps units in your family you need to purchase three copies of the software shame on garmin,135,68
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this for my son in law to use for fire mapping in wyo he has happy with it so i am too,23,69
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,product arrive ahead of schedule and was exactly as advertised i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one,21,70
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,so someone gave me a garmin 60csx with the united states topo 3 cd set i was excited and was hoping i could use this gps for navigation on road and in the boat apparently not first off it takes hours and hours to figure out the mapsource software that is once you finally download the right version then it is not clear anywhere that addresses are not included so after wasting hours i finally do some google searching to find out these maps cover nothing at all really and trails or whatever else you might want good luck i simply wish the names of rivers were on the darn thing i live in florida we do not have mountains so i am scratching my head wondering what good this thing is i guess since i am a boater i could spend 300 to get the bluechart but after seeing the value of the topo maps i am concerned about throwing good money away for a lackluster product oh well it was free so who really cares i can always use it on the boat as a backup unit,189,71
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this mapping software for my gps garmin 76csx was a great help in finding trails and roads it was close for elevation in the area thanks,26,72
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,i always thought that publisher 2000 was easy to use this upgrade is even easier even someone who has never used publisher before can make outstanding postcards flyers newsletters and publications what a excellent product,34,0
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,as much as i hate to admit that microsoft has done a good job i have to on this one the improved interface makes it so much easier to use users of old versions of publisher will be pleasantly surprised that this one is definitely worth the money for the upgrade if you have never used a desktop publishing program before check this one out you will not be disappointed i am running an entire small printing business from this program alone the only reason i have not given 5 stars is because i still want to be able to create text boxes in shapes round triangleinstead of square and rectangle,112,1
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,this is a good product i have publisher 2000 and i like to added features and the new templetes realy worth the money microsoft has done it again with really great features and value,36,2
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,publisher 2002 is a pretty good product i have not had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed once it has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it but stay away from the bundle with the photo editior included because the photo editior has almost no functionality,76,3
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,while most people will tell you that microsoft bit the big one on their latest release of productivity programs the office xp suite i personally feel that they have done ok while the 2002 series does not differ too much from it is predecessors publisher includes what i think to be a very important feature stability there is not a sole on this earth that can deny the reliablity and stability of xp whether we talk about windows xp office xp or microsoft anything 2002 i dare you to try to make if crash good luck for those of you in corporations ask your employees what the most irritating part of their day is you will undoubtedly get the response when my tools crash while microsoft might have changed minor settings in publisher to make it slightly annoying for the few you can not go wrong with the increased reliablity of the product so suck it up shut up and enjoy it,157,4
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,publisher 2000 was bad stupid me i thought maybe 2002 would be better not save your money and buy print shop or print master platium they work better for less money and take up less real estate on your hard drive the interface is even less intitutive that previously the most common task that even i can make word 97 accomplish will not work in publisher sorry microsoft i will not be buying this again everything the other reviewers have said times 10,81,5
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,without a doubt the worst canned program i have encountered in almost 10 years of buying software after 2 months on the phone with support i have still not beat the kinks out of this dog bcentral is only to happy to charge me 30 bucks a month for hosting a site that will never be launched with this pig no wonder they include it with every signup a guarantee that the space on the server will never be used pass on this pig,84,6
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,and you can not find a download for a very specific piece of software your friend needs it surprises you with a wonderful website that let us you purchase a copy for cheap and totally redeems itself thanks internet and thank you amazon,41,7
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and in good condition with activiation code on the package i needed this to access some old files that coulldnt be opened in publisher 2010 worked great i prefer this version in a lot of ways,38,8
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,this product was very price-worthy was easy to install and has performed perfectly since i bought it it is doing exactly what i hoped and more the product itself was in excellent condition,33,9
Software,B00005AFI4,2.0,negative,my goodness you would think a 10 billion company could do better than this they talk about double sided printing you can not even print even or print odd pages you have to sit in front of your computer and print each and every page manually you can not print to an image file well yes you can but the low resolution makes the file unusable you can not print to a pdf printing to a post script file cut off half the image on one of the projects this product assumes your printing service uses publisher guess what most do not david,99,10
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i agree poor girl i am a real newbie massage therapist turned computer user and have found this program to be a web creators nightmare i think I shall cruise on down to the freeware sites to see what i can scare up there i want a fairly simple web page that links to a few more for those of us that know the anatomy of the human body better than html i would stay away from this beast it will make the less confident feel even more so and by the way these other sugar coated reviews does microsoft pay some slouch to type them up all day or what nauseating,108,11
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software i have used in a long long time i am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability stay with the previous version,45,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i bought this product and love the results on my screen unfortunately it does not look so beautiful anymore when i print the pages out the preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode all my other applications print out just fine i contacted novas technical support but the only help they offered was to send another disk which did not solve the problem now they ask me to be patient while they try to figure out my problem i have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed no matter how great the software is if there is no real technical support it is worthless,108,0
Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this software gives great guidlines for begginer scrapbookers,8,1
Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this is pretty easy to use and I am having fun with it i can not compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I have used but from what i see this is really all i need,40,2
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i absolutely love this program and totally agree with the lady that found it to be one of the best programs that she owns i have had no problems with this program locking up or anything i made our christmas cards on it this past year and got lots of compliments i also made scrapbooks as gifts for christmas and got many compliments on my work this is a wonderful program and i am so happy that i purchased it,80,3
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i would like to say this is a great program but it will noton my computer i have never had this problem with any other program before some kind of computer glitch blamed on everyone else other than the person i happen to be talking to at the moment after about 30 mins of several toll calls and a couple downloads no luck well I am off for another program,70,4
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i almost did not buy this program because of the negative reviews but having worked in retail before i realized that people are more likely to complain than say anything posative i love this program i could go on all day about it i have so many ideas for projects and that is great because there are endless possabilities with this program you can make your project as personal as you want it to be add graphics of your own or alter their graphics to suit your mood you can add pictures and make them look antique as well as shape them into various shapes and styles add text here lighten here change colors it is fabulous as far as the pictures printing out clearly I have had no problem of course when altering your pictures if you force it into a shape that the pixels can not accomadate certainly there would be some problems digital pictures work best but my scanned ones have done well too just have fun and play with it i would reccomend this program to anyone interested in a unique and fun way to save their memories,187,5
Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,i was disappointed when i tried to play around with this product it is going back to the store today you can not print out just an element of the scrapbook other than stickers without printing out an entire layout so if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever beware you must print the whole page and you can not export images either this is basically a limited unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have otherwise stay away and save for a real scrapbook program i have not tried hallmark keep scrappin with scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there,143,6
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i already had scrapbook factory on a different computer i have all of my business forms in that program but did not have the disc any longer the only drawback is not being able to copy all of my old forms onto a flash drive if you buy this keep up with your discbecause it will not recognize the program it was made from when you try to open old files from a flash drive,72,7
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,this edition of scrapbook factory is not nearly as good as scrapbook factory deluxe 4 i have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one three is close and as far back as i am willing to go although you can not extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages in four you can create jpegs as well as pdfs of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive it took me all of a half hour before i had my first page done showing people the ropes of the software i gave version four as a christmas gift to a few people took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own you can get a copy of four for about 2000 more than this version and i feel it it well worth it many pages i have done people think were done with 40000 photoshop do not waste your time with this software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves,187,8
Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,what a disappointment considering modern day programs this one is primative it reminds me of apps 15 years ago it is complicated yet limited in what it can do i have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as front it can not be done I have clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest no luck even the tutorial is non-interactive additionally pages can not be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste further each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects the help section is also very basic one good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job additionally no problem running this with windows 7 have not used any other scrapbook programs but i sure would not recommend this one,156,9
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i am extremely displeased with this product the software is anything but user friendly and the graphics are extremely cheesy any attempts i made at developing a scrapbook page were foiled due to extreme frustration with the program overall the product needs a drastic update and i am disappointed with my purchase,52,10
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,to those with print quality issues it is your printer or printer preference settings there is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software it is also easy to use my 10-year-old who never saw it before jumped right in and is creating terrific pages can not beat it for the price,50,11
Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that i can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer this one does not print well at all I have tried printing one of thier premade pages pages I have created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized i have not had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges i do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as i do not use this program another thing i found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic if you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them this program would be ok if you do not want to print the pages out but if you do look for something else,162,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this program is easy to use and helped me create a custom scrapbook page with little effort one caveat once you select a size template be certain to check the result with print preview before you expend any effort i had trouble getting the first page i created to print in 12 x 12 size on a 12 x 12 sheet of paper however i called tech support the first rep did not help much but then i got a follow-up call from derek who had gone to the trouble of downloading my canon s9000 printers driver together we got the print function going and produced a perfect page it is really refreshing to find a software outfit that really cares about the results it is customers are getting it is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy and that more background paper is not supplied but if you start with a blank template hey it is a clean slate and you can let your imagination run wild it will let you drop in your pictures and graphics wherever and help with the lettering for titles and journaling,189,13
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,this cd rom set is a joke if you really want to learn the russian language the first cd just teaches you some random words the second cd does not teach you anything it is set up like a game show where they ask you questions that are entirely in russian then you have to guess the answer this is not for beginners if you want to learn russian i suggest getting books and tapes,73,0
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,i found this product easy to understand and use it was organized as a game playing experience that made learning fun i wanted the english version but it also supported 50 other languages so if you were french it spoke to you in your native language and taught you russian have purchased several other products and i have found this one the best introduction to russian and the easiest to use it is fun,73,1
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i bought this thinking hey it is ten bucks what have i got to lose well the answer to that question is ten bucks if you are broke and want to learn russian save your money for food and get a library card pass on this I had only give it one star but I shall give it two because it is so cheap and you could learn something from this if you put forth serious effort but you would be better off buying the penguin russian course instead for almost the same price,88,2
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a very good program for people who are just starting to learn the russian language this program gives students a few basic words and phrases that will help a student get introduced to the language it is worth the money in my opinion however the program is geared toward a younger age group and does not go very deep into the russian language overall this program would be a good way to start,75,3
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,this is a program that will help you learn russian through games it is purpose is to teach you mainly through listening the purpose is not to teach you how to read or write or even put together full sentences cd 2 is definitely great if you want to improve your listening but have nothing to listen to the cd is all in russian and teaches you to get used to it the first cd is fun because you can play their games or even make up your own using the games they give you before spending 100s of dollars on grammar books and such pay for this program if you can not grasp this simple vocab maybe russian is not for you,123,4
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,before you can learn any language you have to know the names of things that is the key this cd-set understands that and challenges you in a game-show fashion to play along with the game and gain points in order to progress to advance to the next level after all you can not learn to conjugate verbs or understand the gender value mostly foreign to native english speakers attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before it is a very complicated thing russian and ukrainian if it came in a pill everyone could take one too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective huh but this one is just the right speed slow and simple sure it could have utilized more sophisticated graphics but remember when you are a kid in a language you have to be treated like one and being a kid again is actually quite fun,166,5
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,if you want to learn to speak russian this cd will not help you very much it does help you learn some random words and gives you a feel for russian but that is about it however the cds format does allow you to learn numbers time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor if you feel you are weak in numbers time and dates then it is worth the cost to learn them i found that I am very fast at numbers as a result of this course by itself the course does not do much but for the specific area of numbers and time i can not think of a better way to learn it is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language it is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games,154,6
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,i bought this to learn russian as it says it is easy inexpensive and a fast way to learn do not be fooled it mostly teaches you words not sentances or conversations believe me it is the worse the first cd teaches you colors numbers time the alphabet and so on but it does not help with actually communicating with the people although i agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words and three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words but to learn the actually language i find that it is impossible to this is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it is basic words again do not be fooled spend the extra ten bucks and get the rosetta stone russian explorer it has more programs and conversational teachings i recommend that better than this product,154,7
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,my biggest beef with this product is the speakers do not always enunciate which made attempting to repeat what they said a struggle,23,8
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,my husband is fluent in russian and absolutely loves this cd it is cheap and great quality he teaches our son with this cd,24,9
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,nice simple easy to use program i like it a lot better than rossetta stone,15,10
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,received cds that do not work in cd players nuts piece of junk do not get it what a rip off,20,11
Software,B00005RIQ5,5.0,positive,good program for learning another language I have used the german ones and my wife is currently learning spanish with the same system,22,12
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,bought this several years ago to learn russian the cost around 10 was great but the product is very lacking in helping you to do anything in learning or speaking the language if you are going to spend your money on any product to learn a foreign language go with rosetta stone or pimsleur even a college textbook will help you learn more do not waste your money on this,66,13
Software,B00005RIQ5,1.0,negative,there was not a clear voice doing the talking and so when we got to russian nothing was pronounced the way we thought and we could not be understood at all,29,14
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,first of all do not but this if you are a beginner looking for an introduction to the basics russian language this product is only meant for learning words and phrases through repetition and memorization that constitutes the first cd the second on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous it is basically a game that you have no way of winning or even doing well at unless you are relatively schooled in russian the one thing that this product did come in handy with was helping me to at least hear spoken russian from native speakers while i worked my way thorough nicholas j browns the new penguin russian course which you should redirect your search engine to right now if you are looking to this product to help you actually learn russian language it is the best of the best all in all buy this if all you want is to memorize words / phrases or if you need the aid of hearing a native speaker while attempting to self-instruct yourself through the basics of the russian language either way you will only receive any use from the first of the two cds,186,15
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,i liked the combination of repetition of words and games to reinforce learning although the male and females pronunciations were difficult to hear at times also the program stopped running in the middle of the lessons i have windows xp and have not been able to figure out the problem rendering the cds useless to me if anyone knows what the problem is and how to fix it i would like to know,73,16
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my oldest daughter loves dora and took to this game immediately she loves to sit on my lap and play and our father-daughter time is often spent on the computer she can not get enough the 3 levels offer a nice change for children that are getting bored with the game some puzzles she plays at level 1 where some puzzles she plays at level 3 the game is very educational and fun and it follows the same format as the cartoon does she will turn 3 soon and she still loves it I had also recommend doras backpack adventure they make a trip to the library little people discovery airport winnie the pooh where pooh gathers all the friends for eyores birthday party and mickey mouse where mickey and minnie stop off at goofysstation daiseys diner,137,0
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this for my daughter who loves dora but what a mistake she has our old computer which is not a powerhouse but this game is a total memory hog and i had to delete every other game in the computer to install it and it still will not work well so unless your child has a top of the line computer not recommended,64,1
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,this game really kept my daughter s attention she enjoyed the games and learned the activities i am really glad that i purchased this i have ordered others as well,30,2
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,my daughter is 4 and loves dora the game is short and not interesting her also it is seems there are a few glitches in the game trying to get the stars into backpack is nerve racking you do not actually click on the stars but just to the outside of it it becomes a pain do not waste you money,58,3
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,if you child likes to play on the computer and likes dora this is a great game for them my son just turned 3 and loves to play this game after playing each individual game with him he was able to play on his own the different levels are a great feature most of the games deal with number recognition so the lower the level the less numbers it deals with there are also some print-outs tobut not many to choose from,84,4
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,santa left this game for my 5 year old daughter she loves anything dora including this fun game,19,5
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my niece is going to love this game there are a lot of challenging yet reasonable games for the kids to play i am looking forward to her playing it,30,6
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,my son is 3 and a half he has mastered many games like jumpstart preschool and more this game is way to difficult for him there are numbers moving on the wall so he not only has to identify the numbers but try to click on them as they move past i would highly not recommend this game for younger kids under the age of 5,65,7
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,our four-year-old daughter loves dora the explorer so we were delighted to see the release of lost city adventure the reviews so far have been raves from the little one and from us the animation music and sound are first rate but more importantly the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler this program stacks up well against the knowledge adventure titles like reader rabbit skills such as sequencingmatching memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments plus there are three difficulty levels so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level you can adjust accordingly the program works great using the classic environment on our macintosh g4 laptop and g3 desktop computers have fun,123,8
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,i have a 3 year old and after a week she is already bored with this game for 20 there should be more to do it constantly repeats itself and has no real direction very limited number of activities available and really no variety i would not recommend this game at all i am currently reading reviews to find something much more interesting,63,9
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,i thought it was very good it should be for older children although,13,10
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this product because it specifically stated that is is supported mac os x 101x and above turns out that there is a problem with the mouse tracking on os x 102 that makes the game unusable i went to the companys website for a patch only to find out there is not one and there will not be one their solution is to install it in 0s 9 and boot into os 9 to play it i checked for os x support specifically to avoid such nonsense i am very disappointment in this product as a result and would recommend looking elsewhere for both windows and mac if a company such as this can not properly fix their bugs 15 wasted and one very unhappy toddler,126,11
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my 28 month old loved it from the start the graphics are wonderful just like on tv easy to install and ran great on my computer i highly recommend it,30,12
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,the game is outdated and does not work on my daughters new laptop i have tried every trick to make it work complete waste of money i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because i should have known better,40,13
Software,B00006G98B,4.0,positive,my 4 1/2 year old great grandaughter loves it requires a dvd drive to be connected to play it,19,14
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,my girls really like dora and this one is no different they have lots of fun with this game too,20,15
Software,B00006G98B,2.0,negative,this game is ok and my 3-year-old son plays it from time to time he loves dora and diego so i thought this would be a great hit but it has been pretty disappointing there are two game tracks with 3 levels of difficulty my son completed both tracks in about 30 minutes it is pretty repetitive after that even at higher skill levels he gets pretty bored with the long-winded videos in between the actual games i took off an extra star for requiring that the cd be in the computer when he plays the software it is 2011 now get with the program you require me to register the program any way so use a license number like every other software company,123,16
Software,B00006G98B,1.0,negative,i bought this game for my daughter when i tried to install it to my computer the security program ms security essentail warned that it detected a malware so i scanned this game by the other security program tred-micro office scan it also detected same malware finally i threw it away,49,17
Software,B00006G98B,5.0,positive,the following review by isabella 6 years i am a not a big dora fan but my dad got i for me any way because win i was 4 i loved dora but now i am not a b ig dora fan it is a good game parental comment yes she loved the early age oriented dora pc game when she was younger the challenge is appropriate not overwhelming and the outcome also brings on the pride of accomplishment doras stories always have a wholesome moral attached to the characters involvement good graphics easy to follow age appropriate logic level for 4 - 5 year olds,106,18
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i travel on the road all the time and i use my gps and laptop to find my way around i would have to say that the software that comes with the garmin gps is a hundred times more accurate and useful i have found that many of the roads in street atlas were labeled wrong or just plain drawn wrong there is a lot of old information and not updated regularly i live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in street atlas 2004 it still did not have my neighborhood in it and i live near a major city i can not recommend this software for other than very basic information you can get a paper map that will work better,125,0
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i have been using the 2004 version of this program for about 5 months before i finally upgraded to this version on my p2/250 laptop it runs slowly but not nearly as slow as the 2004 version did i just purchased a gps device for it and love how it integrates with it i travel extensively in my job and having the gps feature makes finding where I am going very easy there are some inaccuracies with the pois as others have stated but they are not so far off that you could not find them with a little looking around at least with them marked on the maps you get a very goodwhere they are web based maps are good to have but when you have to travel to several locations in a day it is impossible for me to get online to find where I am going with this in my vehicle i can get where I am going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks i recommend this program to anyone looking for a mapping program especially if you have a gps device to find where you are and where / when you have to make your next turn,203,1
Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,after using street atlas 2005 for one trip i find it was worth making the upgrade one new feature is that it shows the next turn and the turn after that in the show turns window it also gives this information in the voice navigation this will eliminate a number of instances where i have used the voice commands to obtain this information the number of trail points is now settable which can clear the map and reduce theon the computer there is a new version of the microsoft speech recognition software the file system has been simplified with the option to return to the full system if desired via a patch available free from delorme the program loads much quicker i recommend buying street atlas 2005,129,2
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,i bought this product expecting the excellent results i have had from delorme products for years it is been a nightmare trying to get it to work i have tried installing it six times on two different computers and i can not get it to plot a route i put in a start and finish point and it plots a straight line between the two points others have had this same problem as related on the delorme forum so it is not just my computer or my installation technique every other delorme product i have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem i have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply after five days on their forum i was told to follow the instructions for a so-called clean install but when i followed them three times i got the same result I am sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund,159,3
Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,delormes product is dynamic it works out-of-the-box as a gps navigation companion it will automatically start talking to you and guiding you from where you are and take you toward your destination if you get off-track it re-routes you automatically within seconds microsofts product is static or dead connected to a gps it will show you where you are but do not expect it to think ahead I have used it numerous times and it had been helpful because it is an accurate map and shows where you are but that is it there is a lot more to giving someone good directions than just saying this is where you are you want to know when to get ready to turn up ahead so you can prepare for it delormes software will do that for you and do it very well,137,4
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,problems in many areas buggy installation i had to re-install after a squeeky clean reboot on xp had to use msconfig to boot with no other drivers the software still has trouble locating well-established addresses and significant landmarks weak find function can not identify addresses with any intelligence user interface is not intuitive at all ambiguous commands poor screen / button layout I am trying to be patient and tough it out but frankly i would not buy it knowing what i know now i also have msft streets and trips and although it has limitations as a navigation tool the u / i is much easier to use no problems with installation and the data is far more complete,117,5
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i was blown away by this product in the sense that i could not imagine that such a well-functioning piece of software could be rendered virtually unusable by a horrendous interface the controls are tiny numerous and often cryptic to set up your gps mouse for instance you would have to click the exchange button do not even think about using this product while driving it is not suitable at all for a touch-screen display having said that the maps themselves are accurate and the programs packs a ton of useful information,91,6
Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,i have a long commute and wanted to figure out which back roads were ideal i was deciding between microsofts streets and trips 2005 and this program i think the deciding factor was that the delorme software has the ability for me to manually choose other roads besides the roads the program recommends microsofts version does not seem to offer this at least they do not mention it by allowing me to choose my own roads i can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even although they are the calculated ones it may not have as many pois but i was more interested in customizing and alterning suggested routes than points of interest that feature alone made the delorme worth it for me,123,7
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i have used delorme products for a number of years and love the features the 2005 street atlas is a little slow to start but still nice to work with but they seem to have spent their time on features and not updating the database i live in northern virginia and was very disapointed with this release street atlas 2005 is headed for ebay and i cringed as i installed,71,8
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,in some areas the software worked great but in others it was off by hundreds of feet showing me on totally different streets around my house it was consistently off by 800 feet and displayed my position one street away this is not due to the gps receiver the receiver gives the right coordinate data if you plot that data by hand on the map you will be positioned wrong this indicates that the maps are not calibrated right tech support was worthless all they tell you is that you can return it before 30 days of course you are still out the tax and the cost of sending it back do not buy this product until they have fixed the maps consider yourself warned,124,9
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,I am not the greatest remembering maps so when i got a usb gps receiver i was psyched granted at that time i did not have any software but i did not know that so i went out and got street atlas which happened to be the first piece of navigation software i found that was version 2004 I have been hooked ever since i used to get lost in downtown buffalo all the time now i do not get lost anymore i loved 2004 so much i got 2005 and it is a big improvement the user interface is much easier than in 2004 and in 2004 it was easy and i mean super-easy you can install the entire continental united states and fit it comfortably on your hard drive and map out a trip from one end of the country to the other and get there without getting lost for those techie people like me who get lost all the time this program is like a godsend you can even print out directions on your desktop and e-mail them give them to friends so on and so forth without a gps receiver,189,10
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,I have used delorme street atlas since gps receivers were novel and cost hundreds of dollars i have liked every version they have put out and 2005 is no exception the reason i bought the 2005 version even although it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through wine in linux including usb / serial gps support newer versions tested up to 2008 as of this review do not install and/or run well via wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored street-level navigation in linux if you want updated cartography and new handy features go with a newer version all versions of delorme street atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag however if you want a street-level nav program for linux that does not require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps delorme street atlas 2005 is your best bet,157,11
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i use this software to map out a garage sale route it is simple and basic and allows me to flag each address on the route some of the features i could use in the future for a trip or something but right now it is garage sales,47,12
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,street atlas just keeps getting better i can go from anywhere but usually from home to a place I have never been to using the directions fastest shortest or scenic I shall know the mileage and have a good estimate of the time i can locate other places i may need anywhere along the way mealsrepairs hotels and more i find it much faster and more intuitive than any of it is competition we also find it helpful finding hiking trails / points of interest and areas set aside for recreation on weekends the ability to print out a travel package is helpful for when i am not using a pc,106,13
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,street atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of windows is not english or if the user sets languages other than english as their default language set on us version of windows sa 2004 does not work at all so i have to change the language setting of my us version of windows xp and reboot the computer every time that i need to run sa 2005 it was so cumbersome and i wished that this problem is fixed in sa 2005 however sa 2005 has the same problem and it seems like delorme does not care about this problem at all if you are a user who uses different language setting on windows you should try microsoft streets and trips instead of sa 2005 sa 2005 has better gps capability than ms s and t however my choice is s and t for this reason i gave 2 stars because it does a job sometimes when i do not mind rebooting my computer and giving up other jobs that need asian language support i do this once or twice a year,183,14
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,this is a big improvement over previous versions of this software the back on track feature works great if you take a wrong turn the software automatically calculates a new route to get you back on track much much better than microsoft streets and trips in the gps and navigation areas,51,15
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,i bought this software and found that it could only work when win xps regional setting set to united states english since i had to have another regional setting because of my job the software was no use another thing is that there is misinformation on the products box it claims that delorme includes major roads and highways in canada while it is competitors do not the fact is that while delorme only covers major canadian roads microsofts streets and trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of canadian streets just as what it can do about united states addresses microsofts product can produce driving directions in canada too which delorme can not do one good thing about delorme mapping street atlas united states 2005 is that it has a 30 day money back guarantee i have returned my purshase and got the microsoft streets and trips 2005 instead,142,16
Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,i purchased street atlas 2005 as i was so satisfied with aaa mapngo from delorme the mapping program is absolutely great it is operation is really quite simply and anyone can work it it is much better than microsoft streets which i had the 2002 version the only fault is that their data base is too old and does not seem to have a lot of the development in the last 2 or 3 years of motelsstations and resturants,79,17
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i have used delorme street atlas for years in my genealogical hobby i have found it amazing that it has so much detail of both urban and rural roads and also topographical features used in combination with a gps and delorme atlas and gazetters i have been able to locate drive directly to many obsecure locations,56,18
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,as a real estate appraiser i travel from point to point and then write reports about each site the gps and voice functions are irrelevant i never use them the report writing function is where i need a program daily and for my purposes which is entirely for drawing labeling and map notes for each site to be placed into a report this program is an order of magnitude worse than the version it replaced lots of new features just complicate the program and make the simple features i need harder to replicate and work with sometimes the map will zoom or reduce unexpectedly due to a casual move of the pointer that was not intended to produce this effect on balance i hate it the bright side you can find things with it if you are willing to battle and fight the complex functions to do so,149,19
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,findings after brief trial pros 1 provide voice driving instructions but those instructions may be confusing in some situations 2 accept speech commands it is quite fancy cons 1 it will ask you to turn left / right where you are not allowed to do so this is quite dangerous 2 some map informations are egregiously out of date a road removed by freeway construction a decade ago still appears on the map and i was asked to go through it 3 it does not locate my location precisely with gps it claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway i wonder how it can think this way as i did not get into any freeway entrance can i simply jump into the freeway ms streets trips did not show this problem using the same gps receiver,142,20
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,we bought the product for a laptop that goes on exteded trips out of reach of the internet after discovering that the upgrade had no internal help files we downgraded to version 2004 since the databases are not downward conpatable all of our computers that use microsoft money now must use the 2004 version for us this purchase was a big mistake,62,0

Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,just like the major competitor this product is very easy to use and upgrade is a bit slow when first starting up but then the details and reports provided are very helpful have not generated an invoice yet but did try a demo one and i think this product is worth the price,53,4
Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,overall good upgrade was looking to be able to have sub categories and this upgrade does not allow that,19,5
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i spoke to microsoft tech people before purchasing thisand was advised that it would do all that i wanted it to do for my company when i received it the program did none of the functions that i was quie specific about i was very very disappointed additionally the program is complex too busy and the only user guide needs to be downloaded totally worthless program i rate it a 5 i did however voice my dissatisfaction to amazon and they have stood by their customer for which i am very appreciative of,94,6
Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,did not see many noticeable enhancements since 2005 except the performance seems to be much better,15,7
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,the only similarity the inventory management is the capability to enter pluses and minuses to a list of squs,19,8
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,set-up for the program is very easy and straightforward tips and advice for how to best use it have come in handy having to keep track of inventory was somewhat daunting before now with this software i do not worry,39,9
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,this product rocks it is simple but yet powerful much better version than 2005 and 2004,15,10
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,i have always been satisfied with mm and this one is no different sure there are things that i wished were different but when talking about software as you would anything you must look at the totality of the software i believe for a small business this software is much better than others i run two business from my mm and it handles both just fine also this is a microsoft software so that makes it easy to use and pc friendly overall i am more than pleased with this software and have no desire to try anything different,99,11
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i was using money 2004 my books were up to date when i made one of the worst moves i ever made with software i bought money 2005 for small business i have yet to get my books straighten out i have spent days on the phone with tech support they sent me the 2006 version i can not begin to describe what an awful program this is i do not know if i can ever recover from the mess that has been made it is six months now and i am still working on it buy quickbooks and forget this,98,12
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,my first and old money was useful while lasted,9,13

Software,B0009KLGPO,4.0,positive,i have used microsoft money small business for a number of years now but sometimes wonder what benefit other than bill gates getting a little richer i am gaining from the latest version of the product this is one of those years,43,15
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,i love this software for my small business and home money tracking and i love the invoice designer this software is so worth it to keep track of your money and also has forecast cash flow and can help you see where you can save and also can help you get rid of your debt i recommend this product to everyone,61,16
Software,B0009KLGPO,1.0,negative,i had the regular money product and bought the small business addition to manage receivables invoices and more regarding invoices you can create a very basic awful template using the new template editor it is not something you would want to use unless you are a child selling lemonade hey microsoft why not use microsoft word for invoicing templates duh it is only your own product oh and if that is not bad enough when you want to send an invoice by email it does not use the invoice template you have created instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers also remember those customer accounts you created in money well the invoice does not pull in the customer information that is right you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information again for invoices terrible product yes it manages accounts but no better or worse than other versions of money if you are using this to manage bank accounts fine otherwise unless stay away shameful,175,17
Software,B0009KLGPO,2.0,negative,it is more difficult to use than quickbook in a practical sense when i tried to enter a simple expenseit took a while to look for the right pull down to get in when i downloaded my sear credit card history money2006 put expense items into credit column it messed up my balance sheet i always could not get right answer from microsoft support for money2006 although their tech support people are polite,74,18
Software,B0009KLGPO,5.0,positive,i have been using ms money for small business since i started a one person psychology practice after having been an owner of a large group practice where we used quickbooks i never liked qb i thought it was too complicated to get started and now if i want to use the online banking i have to pay 15 a month to my bank and an extra 200 for a one person payroll i found ms money for small business very easy to set up no charge for online banking with my bank and one year free payroll that costs 10 a month after one year seems to me that using ms money for sb is a non brainer and using qb is an expensive and complicate proposition,128,19
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,the dvd installed the map software on the computer with the usual intuitive mac interface the first time i ran map install it prompted me to download an updated version which i did this took 20 minutes i had the 2 gb micro sd card in the gps when selecting maps to upload the interface told me how many gb they would take up and how much room i would have remaining i selected washington and oregon and clicked install the upload to the gps took about an hour the maps look great and the device just works with them without any frustration or complication i tried using the map manager software and also found it intuitive to make and upload waypoints have no fear mac users,127,0
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i first saw this map source described in the amazon description of the nuvi 265wt which i purchased the sample map display shown is what you see when using the pc software not what you see on the gps unit the cd contains cartographic data which the pc software is able to display that information does not seem to be transfered to the sd card or the gps is not capable of displaying it that was dissapointing but I am otherwise satisfied with the product i had a magellan meridian before which would only display elevation lines the garmin with topo produces a similar appearing display with perhaps more detail as to water features streams lakes and more when using the topo maps I have found that the 2-d formats provide a more readable display since the maps are essentially flat the elevation lines in the 3-d view are more distracting than meaningful,149,1
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,after checking the many reviews on various websites i decided to go for it and am glad i did to those out there who are trying to decide whether to go with the micro sd or cd make it the cd the bonus base camp software is pretty nice even although i have not completely figured it out yet I am hiking a lot of trails I have previously hiked over the fourth of july weekend so I shall see how it all pans out compared to my green trails,86,2
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,way too difficult figuring out how to use the product I have essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment,23,3
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this did not work well for thr rogue river trail in oregon not accurate andus down the wrong areas,20,4
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,topography is fine do not expect much about trail information,9,5
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,nice to have but using it slows down my garmin way too much so i hardly turn it on recommend getting the chip instead,24,6
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,as promised simplesimple review good stuff,8,7
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i this does notup comes with antiquated software that is maddening and takes hours dozens of hours to download then is followed three times before i finally gave up with a statement that there was a problem and gives inexplicable impossible to follow instructions i am going to try to talk with garmin but have little hope for it and undoubtedly try to return it to amazon by the way i asked my brother-in-law who is a cartographer and clever with computer software to try to make it work he could not,94,8
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,when i read the product information provided i did not understand this required a very expensive gps for it to have any use at all in searching for a gps that would work with topo i found limited options mostly obsolete low ratings and extraordinarily high price tags it will probably never come off the shelf until we decide to trash it this was a regrettable purchase,66,9
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,one of the few things i bought that i thought was a waste of money,15,10
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this to anyone i bought it thinking it was up to date while loading it i see 2008 in several areas so despite the major hassle of downloading and transferring it I am most disgusted that it is 6 years outdated,43,11
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i found some issues with basecamp loading this map but once it worked it is fantastic very happy with the dvds,21,12
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it does everything you need it for it is kind of annoying that it can hold all of the usgs maps for the whole us on the device at one time especially with all the advancements in data storage on small micro sd cards in this day and age but if you can over look this and the obviously exorbitant cost for something you can basically get for free on your smartphone and this software is only good for what 4 or 5 states it is just quite disappointing to me i bought this a couple years ago for about 100 so hopefully in the last 2 years the price has come down and the storage capacity on the devices has gone up if not i would never she shall out more than 30 or 40 for this software it is just not worth it when you can get all this info for free on a stinking phone,154,13
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the garmin topo is out of date the trail locations inaccurate but it is the only game in town for topo maps better than nothing but not by much,29,14
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,once downloaded i was extremely happy with this map especially compared to the default map that came with my garmin etrex 20 the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it was difficult to download to my gps due to needing an update even before doing so it was brand new and already needed an update being a computer user not a computer guru made this process a lot more difficult and lengthy than i was prepared for and it was frustrating that said once downloaded the map itself is awesome and all I had hoped for however it would be nice if it covered more states considering the price,113,15
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i was hiking in oregon a couple weeks ago and suddenly came to a trail detour the sign said closed for restoration so i followed that for a while but then wondered if i was going to miss a connecting trail to get back to the car so i took a gamble and went cross country to get back on the gps-shown trail i eventually found that i was on an abandoned trail that looked like it had not been used in years which eventually took me to the main trail still in use bottom line the maps got me where i wanted to be but the maps could be several years old and some trails me be wrong like this one there is no update service for this product so if you submit changes who knows how you find out if changes were made so I am happy with the maps but be careful things may not be correct,161,16
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i have no complaints with the maps they are great they have all of the details one needs to complete an outdoor adventure however base camp is not user friendly making it difficult to learn how to get the maps on your device and i do not like the way that the maps are divided into sections i would like them to allow customers to pick the states they want and need and make their own bundle,76,17
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,we use the topos for backpacking hiking mountain biking and offroading i finally upgraded after about 10 years i should of done it sooner we never get lost,28,18
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this is pretty much a necessity if you want to do more than just follow roads with the gps or even if you do just want to follow the roads definitely buy the dvd although and you can share it with multiple units,43,19
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i think how you can interface with google earth is cool the software they give you for maps is basic but putting all of your tracks and way points on google earth is sweet install on to my gps was easy and uncomplicated,43,20
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,worthless i could have taken my family out to an expensive restaurant and gotten more satisfaction than this provided to me,21,21
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i got the topo maps set to use on my gemin vista hcx and the performance is very disappointing the contour line are dark brown over a yellow background the unpaved roads all show up as a dashed line and it is a far cry from the look you would expect from a topo map i spent almost two hours with their tech support to try and tweak the settings to no avail,73,22
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,it took a while to download to my gps about 10 hours very detailed and i have not begun to explore all of it never tried the 100k so i can not compare,31,23
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i was able to route with this and the trail names actually help out alot i do not like how garmin makes you spend more money on a gps that you already spent way too much for,36,24
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,as advertised items were shipped quickly and packed properly i would buy them again or would suggest to others their purchase,21,25
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,all the detail i expected and more some of the roads are a bit dated as in they are not navigable anymore otherwise excellent in my clunky gps unit,28,26
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,says on the packaging has township and range and section data but there is no way to get the section lines onto the map in base camp or on the device so it was less than useless for me there is no way to use this software to help locate section corners it simply will not do it,57,27
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just purchased this product and first time that i used it received message that the map was out of date and needed updating,23,28
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,ideal map for the garmin gps once i was lost but now i am found although the map works very well with the device and is complete in detail if the device goe out you will need a paper map lest ye be lost again i have loaded the map onto the garmin 450 gps and into basecamp program and the two work very well together,66,29
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i got the package and attempted to upthe maps to my rino 610 no maps showed up on the rino 610 i attempted 3 more times each time it took one hour to upload no maps were uploaded i went to utube and found out that you need to unlock the maps the code is on a little two inch by two inch yellow paper i could not find the yellow sheet with the code i went to garmin tech support no phone number on their web site so i filed out the form and got the email reply from them it stated 3 days to reply to my tech support request i was going to copy and paste the email but garmin does not what people to copy the emails there were no instructions or written statements about unlocking the maps in the packaging and no instructions or cd with the rino 610 i am returning both products i will never buy another garmin product again i love amazon however,173,30
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,my dvd player does not work so I shall be using a friends pc to get the topo on my gps i must have read through the summery of this too quick or it was cut short because i would never order a dvd i just hope this conveniently scratchable disk does not require gigs just to make my gps work garmins nice n all but it has the market by the delicate bits it is sad i have no choice it did work perfectly after installation,83,31
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,these maps are pretty good but because of the file size it was impossible to get all of the map data onto the memory card that goes into the gps i had to delete some of the areas that i did not think I had be travelling to in order to get the rest of the maps to fit on the memory card i know this is not a big deal but they should find a way to make the maps fit on a memory card and before you think well just a bigger memory card i was using the largest memory card supported by the gps unit which is the case with most gpss you are limited to the maximum memory card capacity as set by the manufacturer other than that like i said great maps with good detail,137,32
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,disappointed with the lack of trail info buy this only if all you need is topo info because their is very little to no trail maps at all,28,34
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,expensive program but worth every penny when you are back country unfortunately their are not many options available for the garmin at the moment,24,35
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,it was a good product just lacked in a couple of trails which was not too surprising seeing that they are snowshoe and xc ski trials in the winter and roads and mt bike trails in the summer,37,36
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this is one of those products that you have to sit down and play with becuase the instructions are not great and transferring the maps over to a device is not very streight forward the other reviews about these issues were spot on,43,37
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,I have used the mapsource 100k series since 2002 and purchased the 24k series when i purchased my new gpsmap 62s the 24k series is outstanding well worth the investment i do not know if this is a 24k mapsource feature or a gpsmap 62s feature but i wsa surprised to discover that i can plan a route to a street address by road i did not expect to be able to find a street address with with 24 topo map i wish i would have tried a street address before i installed the 24k series then I had know if it was the gpsmap 62s or the 24k mapsource that provided the capability the maps were great to have while hunting,118,38
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it can not be installed on other then c drive somewhat accurate but expect divergence with reality and 24k map so do not make you are life depend on it this piece is not updatable as is every map from garmin garmins software both mapsource and basecamp is quite low quality and usability it is slow and ugly if you care do not expect much support from garmin if you can use google map if you have to use garmin set you expectation to extremely low level i did but i am still annoyed i just do not understand how free google can be so-o-o much faster more accurate and convenient and why on the earth i should plan and verify my trips on google maps,124,39
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the very first track that i tried to mapped out i found is incomplete and incorrect therefore i can only imagine the accuracy of this topo is suspicious unfortunately garmin has a stranglehold not only on the navigation instrument but also with the proprietary software and of course the maps software that you have to own you can not use any other mapping software / product with the garmin gps for the 12995 plus tax shipping and handling i think i have a reasonable expectation the garmin topo would be accurate it is not my other complaint with the topo software is there are no instructions on use i guess the topo engineers expect new users to be intuitive or just learn by trial and error it is sad garmin can not provide easy to use instructions in plain english,136,40
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i feel like i just got ripped off with this product it would be great if topo 24k worked but with no manual and email support that does not seem to go anywhere i have nothing I have been holding on the 800 support line for almost a hour and starting to feel ripped off this is just too expensive of a product to have no documentation 1st it does not want to install on any other drive then c so have a lot of space available just to install it 3 gigs 2nd once i enlarged the boot drive so that the software wouldi tried to use it again with no manual and no help there has little one can do with it unless your into a treasure hunt i think i got some maps on the oregon 450 t but I am not really sure to delete the files the program says find the file you want to delete then delete it what file what has the name of it where is it located oh i guess one just deletes files randomly until the correct one goes away which ever that file is,191,41
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,auto routing yes universal single use mapping trails great except garmin chose brown elevation lines and brown city roads in parts of san francisco distinguishing streets from a high fill of elevation lines is not that feasible as far as preparing to write to a micro sd card a core 2 duo 6300 took 6 hours to prepare a single 8 min write quad core 9550 more than 4 hours more than twice the estimated displayed also firmware update for etrex and 60csx allowing a 4 gig card not quite enough capacity for ca na or wa 24k i made a special card part city navigator nt part topo 24k city navigator nt disables elevation lines when active california is two map files on nt from map hit menu select setup map check or uncheck nt map for your city needs topo 24k is a separate map file for a zillion usgs quad maps by the way even the older city navigator maps cover some roads in death vally that require experienced 4wd operators stripped butte valley road,178,42
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i bought a gpsmap 60csx and the western us topo 24k maps to use for hikes in and around northern california i specifically bought the 24k map version because it has routable trails the problem is that the map is missing a lot of trails for example in mt tam steep ravine is not included around santa cruz all of the trails that make up the skyline to the sea trail are missing these are major heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the gps unit for hikers i have heard that the 100k version includes all of these trails albeit with less contour information I am really pissed at garmin and will probably be returning these maps,126,43
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i diligently read all the reviews before purchasing and thought i could handle the technology the directions are not clear to me to be honest I have spent only about 30 minutes trying to figure it out but I am already frustrated it is apparent i will need extra help to transfer data from this to my garmin will add more to this post if / when i can actually use the maps,68,44
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this really has a lot more to it the the regular topo map from garmin on the regular garmin us topo maps i got everything from the rockie west on a 2 gb card with the 24k topo i had to use 4 gb card for just the 4 states and i had to leave off the bottom of california below la off to get it to fit i put it in a rino 530 the only down side is it take about two to three minutes longer to start up,89,45
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just got into the geo caching and thought that this would be a handy map for me since i live in ca and do a lot of traveling in the western states havnt had the opportunity to use it yet since i am new to using a gps but hope to use it in a few months,57,46
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i have put this into my garmin and it is a real treat on those rides where i am utterly lost i mountainbike and often wander from the regular trails exploring what may be an even greater challenge or a bunch more fun this program has allowed me to accurately find a safe and easy route and gets me home,60,47
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this was my first mapping software purchase so i was not really sure what to expect and ended up disppointed i purchased this as an upgrade to the map that came with my oregon 400 t i feel like the software is second rate I am also disappointed with the map itself some trails i thought for sure would be on there are missing and the trail lines are so faint they are hard to see anyway not worth the money,78,48
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,great product easy to use but does not run on serial gps like the etrex trexlegend serial version,18,49
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,I have purchased the 60csx i love the unit but have many complaints about the mapsource that came with my kit first off the pacific crest trail 2000 that runs from canada to mexico which is to hikers like interstate 5 is to commuters is only listed as trail this is unbelievable also in washington state near shelton there is a campground known as brown creek it shows this as being in the national park it is not it is in the national forest this is a big deal if you are a hunter it is illegal to hunt in the park but not in the forest i have found many areas where the olympic national park is listed inaccurately if there is a better mapping software compatible that is accurate i would love to know about it,137,50
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i must say this is a major improvment over the 100k map i use this in a nuvi 650 and a etrex vista hcx do not expect trails and such because that is not in this topo however streets and navigation is on units like the nuvi even on the vista the contours are such that i can use them for bushwacking if necessary i compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision that one had no streets whatsoever in my area i would recommend it if you can afford the price i got an amazon discount with a coupon so in conclusion much better than the 100k great map for garmins if the price is ok for you,125,51
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,not sure what i can say about topo maps specifically other than you are going to need them if you spend any time in the back country whether you are hiking or backpacking or just bumming around in the woods the maps are clear and easy to read on my garmin hcx legend they are not cheap but what can you do sure you can look around online for free compatible download-able maps from online sources but i found i could not always get the coverage i needed from free maps simply put if you are going to be using your gpsr for anything outdoorsy on the ground in the western states of washington oregon california or nevada just suck it up and get these 24k topo maps not the 50k1 or 100k1 get the standard of the realm 24k1 topo maps then learn to actually read a topo map if you do not know how garmin provides two free to download guides for using a gpsr one specifically covers using your gpsr in conjunction with a paper topo map these are both good resources and are worth reading especially if you are unfamiliar with the wealth of information a good topo map provides get them here [ ],204,52
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,based on what I have seen so far garmin 24k topo falls very short i only base that on looking for two trails in the olympic mountains both trails are in gaia gps but neither are in the 24k very disappointed i just spent that much money for something that does not have two very popular trails i think garmin could have done much better,63,53
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,it is almost unusable it took many tries to get past data errors before it would install,17,54
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i ordered this back in march of 2015 but did not try to install it until i got a new computer that took awhile now i have tried to install it on two different computers and i keep getting an error code 2502 i down loaded base camp hoping this would solve the problem it did not i tried to install an update for net but that did not resolve it either 8900 bucks and i can not get the damned thing to work on my new windows 10 systems is there a fix,90,55
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,in arizona around the big lake area in the white mountains i found several forest road numbers that are incorrect even in the city of tucson the map has alvernon way not crossing the rillito river there is a very nice bridge at the river all of these mistakes are in a small area but i know these places how can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know that is unless you do not mind being lost in the forest i contacted garmin and their response was to carry back-up navagational maps so i guess they do not trust their own maps buy national geographic state topos in my experience they have never been wrong,115,0
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i purchased this for my garmin vista hcx and the two make an unbeatable combo i can be on a trail in the mountains and request a route home the route will state something like this go north to forest trail 122 4 miles turn right on forest trail 122 go to farm road co123 12 miles turn right on i25 43 miles arrive at home 123 miles 65 hours the miles listed are the trail miles and not straight line distance when i have passed a national forest sign that says jones park 17 miles and checked the distance on my gps it matches exactly the find feature is good as well want to know if there are any hot springs in your hiking area do a find on hot spring and the nearest one will be listed and you can plot a route to it as shown above overall a very good product that i highly recommend,160,1
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,this product is not very user friendly and took us hours to figure out how to use,17,2
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it for all intents and purposes useless it did not show topographic lines and was very difficult to find a particular place i returned it,25,3
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,although these maps lack a lot of the detail of 24k topo maps they are easy toand use i use an oregon 600,25,4
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,not very good coverage for arizona disappointed in the detail around quartzsite arizona,13,5
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,a definiteup for my gps really helps in navigating in the back country however it is a bit pricey,21,6
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,if you use your gps off road at all it is must have information it makes getting out and about safer and more entertaining your gps unit will need to have memory available for storage shop smart,36,7
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the disc comes with no directions the basecamp program that comes with it is seriously out of date after spending hours w tech support we got everything figured out and i was able to do what i needed,37,8
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,topo maps are missing a lot of information shame on you garmin people depend on the accuracy of the maps that you sell,23,9
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this is the defacto standard map for the serious hiker backpacker mountain biker or off road enthusiest the mapsonto your pc hard drive to work with mapsource theya little slow on my machine when you zoom in or out but i attribute this to the small memory in my laptop,54,10
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,ok i felt i had to post this review because of the other review i also had trouble getting it up and running the problem is not with the maps it is with the software that reads the maps i spent some time with garmin tech support free and very helpful the problem is these old discs have a much older version of basecamp on them to make this work you need to go to garmins website and get current basecamp also free install it before you install the maps one other thing the big difference between these and the garmin 100k topo is that these have routable trails and roads as well as lots more detail this is what you need for adventure planning,125,11
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the maps have great detail they are easy to download to my gps or print out fairly easy to figure out by using the help button,25,12
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,I am very disappointed with this expensive high resolution map i use my garmin 62stc for hiking but there are very few trails on here including the well established well maintained trails prior to this i used the neo treks app with my iphone which had many trails on very inexpensive maps the garmin gps outperforms the iphone but these maps are a big disappointment,65,13
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the quality of the displays was expecting the map would look very much like a usgs map instead it seems like a kid with a pen sort of traced the contours more important the shading for open areas against timber is missing so parks and meadows can not be differentiated from forest,55,14
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it will notinto the computer when i try tothe program it will not run even when i try to do it manually,25,15
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,works great with my new garmin oregon 450 glad i ordered this against getting the 100k version which other reviewers have said is about useless I am happy with this,29,16
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the instructions with dvd are minimal and do not work nowhere on the packaging or the dvd does it tell you how much memory is required and that you might need to add an sd card to increase storage capacity the manual for my device is minimal in content poorly written and indexed the online help people at garmin online support contact you once a day i am now on day three trying toa garmin map onto a garmin device,81,17
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,hike and atv in the south west find this to be helpful make sure you downthe up dates,20,18
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,very difficult toon my toshiba lap top then once i got it loaded i went on line to see what program supported the program non was showmen i tried adding it to a couple of programs none will support it feel like i invested money that i can not use,51,19
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,great topo maps but lack trail and road detail below the level of paved roads the maps do not even have fire roads let alone established trails in regional parks the iphone with google maps provides better detail and is much simpler to use there are apps for smart phones that will record routes without having to mark way points besides maps on a smart phone are free and are undated automatically basically the garmin maps and gps off-road devices are dated and difficult to use i have spent many hours and hundreds of dollars on a garmin gps sd card and maps only find they make and interesting paper weight save your money and put it into a good smart phone,121,20
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good maps not exactly a usgs topo but still good with the contours and on the ground identifiers the files are big being over 3 gb however you better have a big micro sd chip in your garmin or other gps,41,21
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the 24k topographic map is functional and works fine the hiking trails indicated on the map are not at all accurate on the several hikes i done since purchasing none are correct the indicated path varies from the actual trails by sometimes more than half a mile not a good thing if you are in deep woods if you want accurate trails for hiking buy something else,67,22
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,unable to make version work that was installed on memory card internal memory version works well although does not appear the same on gps as on pc,27,23
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,this dvd does not open on my macintosh i do not know why or where to find out why there is no manual the garmin website is full of hundreds of products and no good information,35,24
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i think the map is good far more accurate than the default map which comes installed on the gps unit in order to use it on my montana gps i had to copy the data to a memory card i truly dislike the micro sd card it is very small and hard to handle drop it on a backpacking trip and you will never find it,66,25
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the first map i ever got for a trail gps garmin gpsmap 60csx segments are easily loaded to the gps from the pc on which the map is loaded i did not find the colors of the map as hard to make out as some reviewers have said the map does not have as many labelled features as I had like i was using it hiking in the escalante-grand staircase natl monument i found things on google earth for example that are not on the map but these are easily downloaded to the gps if one remembers to do it before leaving home i also found walking on an established trail that the gps tracked me about 100 feet off to the side of it was this a fault of the gps or the map i do not know room for improvement yes adequate to get you where you want to go certainly,148,26
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good price it is a complete set very fast safe delivery have not used it for a couple of years,20,27
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed to find that this was the old version of the product next time i will buy from a retailer so i view the product and make sure it the current version tjm,36,28
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought a new garmin gps for hiking and thought i would order a download from garmin covering all the southwest i am new to the gps world and did not know that this did not include hiking trails so needless to say i wasted my money do not order this if you are wanting detailed hiking trails bob,59,29
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,purchased these maps for a hike in the area of the holly cross wilderness in colorado the maps were quite good except that the trails were either missing or sometimes incorrect i used the maps in my e-trex 20 gps and i was pleased with many options that the gps provided the problem is that even the paper maps often have incorrect trails it is not clear to me whether this is garmins fault or usgs fault in any event even with incorrect trail and a gps you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go i used amazon credit card offer to purchase the maps so for me it was 40 which seems to be reasonable i am not sure i would be that content with the product had i spend in excess of 100 which is the cost of the maps on garmins web page,160,30
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,purchased these topo-maps for off-road exploring in our jeep and loaded on a [ new ] garmin 2595 the 2595 has more than adequate memory capacity for both street and topo maps no chip required thou i have read many folks douse their topo-maps on a micro sd so far I am very pleased the maps accurately depict 90 of the secondary primitive and mining-roads as-well-as geographical features and sites in the area of az where we live have not so-far used them outside of a 150 - 200 square-miles of home-base but in our case for our purposes well worth the price,100,31
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,have been using the maps in northern az getting ready for elk hunt works great in the thick timber great buy,20,32
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,these maps are decent although you can get free topo maps i found out that are pretty much as good the only issue i have yet to discover these maps should support the 3d view on the oregon 450 I shall know in about 6 weeks if that is accurate or not free maps do not have that support,59,34
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,i have used garmins map for about a month and find it very useful while the national forest roads are not all numbered they are shown as are the major hiking trails through the superstition wilderness the maps are great for planning hikes knowing the length and elevaton change of any route considered it is also great to see where we have hiked and know what we are facing before we leave the maps work great on my legend hcx we will be getting additional maps for other areas that we spend time in,90,35
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i found this map easily loaded on my computer and then i just downloaded a portion of the map the area i use on my garmin and it works great,28,36
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this map works great for sure the cool thing is you canon as may cards as you would like for various gpss,24,37
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,the maps work very well with my garmin nuvi showing me features that i am interested in to 4wheel on it goes very nicely with the other map programs i have i installed it and one phone call to garmin was all it took to correct one little mistake i made all i had to due was restart the program to make it work,64,38
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,garmin mapsource topo us 24k is a definite improvement over it is 100k series but unfortunately is incompatible with gps 60cs it works great on my pc but on the gps 60cs the contour lines completely fill the screen obscuring the map i upgraded my garmin 60cs with the latest firmware update but the contour lines still obscure the map i am very unsatisfied with garmins topo series of maps,69,39
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,these garmin maps are a total waste of time poor resolution and detail no poi labels not much to like go to above the timber at [ ] and get the real deal,32,40
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought garmin topo southwest easy to install other than that the product is way over priced for what you get I have been using the old delorme topo 30 garmin just does not compare i hunt in southwest colorado roads are miss labeled or just are just not shown continental divide not shown major trails ie continental divide trail rainbow trail colorado trail not shown a lot of garbage that an outdoorsman does not need who needs to know where shopping centers or an atm are when hunting or as garmin puts it on the trail the reason for the purchase was to put a copy on my etrex legend hcx and i wanted to print maps from my pc well i tried printing a map to an hp laserjet printer and it printed the navteq logo over the map i tried to a second printer an hp inkjet same thing after an hour on hold with technical support the technician told me garmin is aware of the problem and i should do a print screen well the same thing printed i logged into my amazon account and sent it back,189,41
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is safe to say that most gps units are not made to be as user friendly as possible and this software is no different however it is not that difficult to use and will help you get a lot more out of your gps having said that it is ridiculous that you have to pay so much to get these maps i got the southwest maps because that is where i live and do most of my hiking but I am taking a trip to backpack in montana soon and it just is not worth it to buy the separate map dvd for that trip if these things were cheaper i would have amazons price is much better than most others but still very high compared to maps for gps units from other manufacturers i guess it is cheaper than buying lots of paper maps but you have to do that anyway because you are crazy if you rely only on your gps when you are in a place where navigation is a serious concern,167,42
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is a map the detail is good for me i did notice that some dirt roads were not accurate when compared with your tracks but that has not been a problem,31,43
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,as with most garmin products this is an excellent map program much more details than the older programs it does take a while to install on your hard drive but who cares,32,44
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,great product very fas shipping i would buy it again if necessary,12,45
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i purchased this software to be able to research and print maps for backcountry exploration by jeep and hiking i routinely use usgs blm and other topo maps but i purchased this to be able to customize and print maps from anywhere in the southwest it is impossible to print maps because the software will put a huge navteq logo across the page when it prints garmin has no solutions this software is garbage and a total waste of money,80,46
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,perfect for what i want very detailed and easy to use,11,47
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,has good features hard to use need to watch youtube videos to help figure it out,16,48
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,very disappointed the map has less detail than the 100k topo map that was pre-installed on my montana garmin should be ashamed,22,49
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,installation works well but keep in mind that unlike the 2009 map that it replaces the 2010 map can not all fit in the internal built in memory of my 260w you will need to decide what to install eg 49 lower states or eastern north americayou have about 5 options the only way around this is to put the rest of the map on an sd card,70,0
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i prefer using the dvd for the update it was an easy process have had a problem with the download process before,22,1
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,there is not a lot to say about map updates for a gps but upgrading my nuvi to the latest maps and points of interet pois was a painless experience i just put the dvd in my mac and then connected the gps to my computer the updates installed and I am set,52,2
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i bought the one time 2011 maps for my garmin 260w gps on dvd and tried to install it after many crashes it finally installed on my gps or so it said when i turned the gps on it said i no longer had any maps rendering my gps into a doorstop i spent hours with garmin support even giving them control my computer so they couldthemselves they failed repeatedly and had me try loading from the temp file as a last resort of course this also failed and now i get to try to contact them again which can take forever just to find someone else there with another badto try of course they will not suggest replacing the dvd as they now have my money and i now have my doorstop i will never buy garmin again,143,3
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i want to update my garmin nuvi 765 t this looked like what i needed after reading the reviews i wanted to make sure i had the most current update i chatted online with amazon and while very helpful they could not verify if this was for 2012 or not on further research i called garmin they gave me the part number for the onetime 2012 update it is 010 - 10989 - 54 and told me the box is blue white and gray the one amazon is selling ends in 03 so it is an earlier version 2009 not the 2012 so buyer beware i love amazoncom but make sure you are getting exactly what you want and do not just go for the deal buy this particularfrom garmin it is about 10 more plus shipping but you will get the most recent update available that is what i am doing,148,4
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i hope if you buy this you wait for it to go on sale or lightning deal i picked it up for 35 bucks for my nuvi 760 for the people that complained that they needed to get an sd card they clearly should have done their homework before buying the upgrade do you expect just any tires to fit on your car just because you have a car seriously of course it is the manufactures problem that they do not have space i think you need about 780 mb of free space say 1 g to be safe to install the full north america map if you do not have an expansion slot you are really sol with this upgrade,115,5
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i got this on the lightning round for 2999 for my older garmin c320i tried to install on my windows 7 pc but windows keep closing the program and it erased the operating system in the gps had to reinstall off of garmin website i then tried on my windows xp pc and it worked great took about a hour to update without any problems,62,6
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,avoid at all costs I have been trying to do this for over 8 hours i am on third attempt locked up two different computers update-installed the disc in my computer waited the download out right before it finished the download it had an error message corrupted data if problem persists contact garmin customer service 3 time it did this i emailed garmin customer service the had me clarify on three different responses which came early morning so i assume customer service is in india i had at least 7 responses and a phone call while i was at work from garmin with no solutions except to retry installing with the disc finally i told him I had just get a magellan or a tomtom he used the old we are an american company and i should reconsider i am very pro american made purchasing but between your customer service probably in india and your product making my gps a useless brick i will shop else where thank you very much,168,7
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have tried to install it for about 5 hours at this point i have tried three computers at first it would crash early on but i was able to bypass the autorun and start the installer manually at this point i was able to get it to download all the updates but it took two hours i have a very fast connection but it was very slow it was within 1 minute of being done when the installer program crashed now when i start over it wants to download from the beginning it is not worth it if i could just return it i would but i have entered my key so i am stuck,116,8
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,my nuvi 200 just did n't have enough room to accomadate the full united states maps so you have to select the next best map to suit your needs easy install tho,30,9
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this was so much easier than the download process from garmin i updated my nuvi 650 with no problems,19,10
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i am one of those who purchased the code sunday may 2 and could not download it it is working fine now i am happy to report and it is updating just fine i docked them a star for the pain yesterday,42,11
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was great roads that i would not come up previously now come up when i enter the address keeping the maps updated ensures new roads are available and the cd was so easy to use i highly recommend it,40,12
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i ordered the 2009 version cancelled it then received the 2010 version in 2 days 2010 version was wrong and i still have to return 2009amazons ordering is constantly wrong,30,13
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read more of the reviews and forums beforehand this has been a time consuming process due to the limited information they provide up front and lengthy customer service wait times tried garmins online help and email help but they continue to provide the same steps after explaining in detail it has not resolved the issue no detailed maps found that support routing,66,14
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have downloaded the garmin update into my unit and find that there has not been any update at all the unit still insists that i need to update it and i do not know what to do please contact me if at all possible with either a new unit or a suggestion as to how to make this work thank you,62,15
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,after spending [ ] to update the maps on my garmin nuvi 265 t i now have a gps which takes 5 minutes to turn andup the maps and it is completely silent no sound i checked the volume settings and it is at 80 t no soun bud comes out of the unit try getting support from garmin every time i call i am put on hold with an estimated wait time of at least 30 minutes who has time for that i think i will just go out and buy a tom tom which is what i should have done in the first place instead of updating something 3 years old,113,16
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,easy to use and invaluable provided the updates i needed and did not lock me into anything more than a one-time upgrade as i might get a new gps sometime soon,30,17
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i needed to update my streetpilot c550 since it was several years old i read in other reviews of some horrors with some of the updates i will have to say i had no problem eventhough it took several hours i am now seeing highways that had not been on my garmin previously the only reason i gave it only four stars is the cost of the update the price is rather steep for a one time use,79,18
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,the ordering shipping and receipt process was excellent i am enjoying the product,13,19
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i purchased the 2010 map update for my garmin gps soon after i installed the update on my gps the touch screen function of the unit froze up and ceased to work the unit will find the satellite start up as normal but will not allow any touch function to operate so the unit is now useless i do not konw if the update is responsible for this malfunction but my gps worked properly prior to the installation,77,20
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i received the updates and installed them on my garmin it definitely made a difference there are streets on there that my old garmin maps did not recognize i am over all very pleased with the updated maps,37,21
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i was hoping that this update would map some areas that were not included when i originally purchased my device did not happen to be fair the service that supplies map data to garmin is not doing their job and my friends bmw does not these areas correctly either it will be a few years before i do another update,60,22
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was a snap to install i had tried updates online but had difficulty even getting my unit registered using the cd is much easier,25,23
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,with the prices of gps units dropping it is tempting to just replace the whole unit as the maps age and need updating at full list price for an update that is exactly what i would have done but at a reasonable discounted price 50 rather than 70 i chose to do the update it was easy and went smoothly my 3 year old garmin gps is now as current maps-wise as new out-of-the-box unit my only wish and what would have made this upgrade 5 stars is that the software would also update the operating system of the nuvi and not just the map data the newer operating systems lock on to satellites much faster than the older ones and the map displays have been somewhat improved as well,130,24
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i reside in a rural area of the southeast the garman 2010 map update gives significantly more detail and is much more reliable than the 2008 version although I am not terribly demanding it has not failed to locate any poi that i have requested,44,25
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,the garmin gps software i purchased works as described several changes have been included i can recommend this procust,19,26
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,the map update is listed as compatible with the nvi 200 series but it turns out that the update files are too big for the 200s internal memory it is possible to do the update but only by adding an sd card in the 200s slot and loading the bulk of the update onto that instead of the internal memory there is no documentation or web resource at garmin that i could find to explain this and the process for doing it is not entirely self-evident,86,27
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,this map update is compatible with the zumo 550 i use for motorcycle touring the installation was easy although it took well over an hour unattended to complete i get these map updates every year and find them to be worth the price the update also installed a new version of mapsource the desktop application that allows creating routes that can be downloaded to the gps it is compatible with the existing data files so you will not lose access to routes you may have already created in prior versions an important tip this will only update one garmin unit keyed to the units serial number shortly after installing this map my garmin had to be replaced because i accidentally damaged the touchscreen a quick call to garmin after i received my replacement unit had them reassign this map update to the new units serial number so i couldit into the new gps good service from garmin,157,28
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i do not know how many streets changed in the two years since i owned my nuvi 350 but not enough to warrant a new set of maps costing 60 to 70 for a product costing 199 but what really is upsetting is that i have two nuvi 350s one for my brother and they will not let me update both nuvis with one dvd this reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes they stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations with lots more happy customers for their efforts garmin should have allowed me to use my 60 map update on both nuvis or made it cheap enough i would not feel so ripped off now i am just ticked off next time I shall try tom-tom or wait for a decent iphone app,153,29
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have received my garmin 2010 map updates on a timely basis and am satisfied with the product,18,30
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,update would notinto my street pilot 7200 without tec help after tec help the 7200 did not perform as well as before the update many of the secondary roads were missing that came with the original program i would not recommend this update,45,31
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,unfortunately i made a bad mistake this was not a garmin map it was just an update for the people who has a garmin with a older version of the map as i rated this a very good map and the price was somehow good,45,32
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,bear in mind folks this cd will update only one garmin unit if you have 2 or more i have 3 one in each of 2 cars and 1 in my motor home you will have to buy 2 or more,42,33
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this product updated my nuvi 650 with no glitches whatsoever the dvd installs to the computer first and then installs the updates to the gps the entire process took about 2 1/2 hours all i had to do was enter the key number on the inside of the dvd sleeve i did not have to go to the garmin site as i have seen others say they did there is now streets showing that did not show on my 2008 version,78,34
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the garmin numaps 2010 america one-time update we moved to a new city and were using our gps to locate stores for shopping the old maps led us to a fabric store and many others that were no longer there we were told by neighboring stores that a particular store had not been there for 10 years we thought the upgrade would solve the problem the first thing we did when we got the upgrade was look to see that this missing store had been eliminated it is still listed on the upgrade as are several other stores that have been closed for 3 years or more i do not really see any difference in the upgrade and i consider it wasted money,126,35
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,upgraded my garmin with no hassle device boot up first time and everything seemed to be working perfectly good job garmin updated 3/26/2012 do not buy the one time upgrade anymore one can get the life time map update for a little more for the life time of the gps it is a worthwhile investment happy driving,56,36
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i must not have looked at it very hard but i was expecting a more up-to-date cd instead of 2011 update is there anything i can do to get a more up-to-date cd for my garmin nuvi,37,37
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,did not include some map updates made between 2007 and 2009 what a joke i want my money back,19,38
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,thanks for the article works great thanks for sending vyu u harto po old gt km u lo re u,20,39
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have an old garmin unit and i did not want to pay for a lifetime map update since I shall be purchasing a new unit in a year or so and all the new units come with lifetime updates while i was waiting to purchase the new unit this one time update seemed like a greatthe microsd card works great i plugged it into my unit and the new maps were included i will use this for a year or so and then buy my new unit great deal,90,40
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,was just what i needed to update my garmin save me from buying a new one now i need a new battery,22,41
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,microsoft mappoint is good for two types of users those who need a super gps and those who need to create maps to go with their presentations and analysis with a gps puck not included ms mappoint becomes a great gps for salesmen delivery men and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner most gps devices fail in this regard they work great from point a to b and could include a detour but forget about going to ten locations it would be great if ms had a self-contained gps device not a laptop which could be programed with the information generated from mappoint by using a pc as the user interface it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen as for the maps it generates we are currently analysing a coal mine and our pitch book was much more comprehensive as a result of using mappoint over copying and pasting googlemaps and the like,169,0
Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,i have been using this program for the past few weeks and am very satisfied with it the software installed and ran without problems on my windows 7 ultimate machine i was dissapointed that the usual irritating microsft activation technology was used if the user just wants a mapping program then microsoft streets and trips 2010 is a cheaper and more practical way to go the programs interface is extremely similar to streets and trips 2010 mappoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in the capability for interface with excel is provided and seemed to work well,112,1
Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,a great piece of software for using a map as a reference user needs a good background in excell or they can be lost,24,2
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,was used and did notcorrectly told by microsoft it wa obsolete so the do not support it an go to forrum for help bad registry keys had to send it back,34,3
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,old version not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies,29,4
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this product i can not find 40 percent of the existing addresses I have entered google map finds them even mss own bing maps finds them but not mappoint 2010 I am sorry i bought it,38,5
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i got this product mainly to import maps into word documents the interface works seamlessly the maps are gorgeous and with a high level of detail perfect for a multitude of applications including illustrations for flyers maps diaries blogs or journals,41,6
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i recently purchased mappoint 2010 through amazon so the price was already better than buying it directly from microsoft or at any office supply stores i am finding it to be very useful for my business we have to generate a lot of maps for our clients and mappoint is better than alternative mapping software from the standpoint of clarity of the maps and boundary definitions we do not need the wayfinding function so having that is of no value we use the territory function to highlight market areas by county or zip code that works okay but is a little cumbersome i also find transferring a map to word or powerpoint documents to be more difficult that it should be smartdraw is easier and it is not even a microsoft product,131,7
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,it is marginally ok for mapping addresses and mapping simple fields but you can not do more advanced functions such as exporting business names addresses and more for this i had to write custom code and extract into excel it has ended up being of little value from a business standpoint absolutely do not buy thinking it can be used as a cheap gis tool,63,8
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i liked the microsoft mappoint 2010 software it was easy to install and works well with vista the software is also easy to navigate and fun to use however it may not be for everyone it seems to have features you may not even use if you just need it to go from point a to b but if you need it for work related purposes or even to map out an itinerary with stops then look no further and the price may even be worth it,87,9
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,i will give it to microsoft when it comes to mappoint it has always been a breeze to setup relatively simple to use and very effective at what it does that being said there has not enough new content in mappoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software unless you absolutely need the new features the improvements on mappoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor pushpin management has been overhauled and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from map settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation also you are now able to import export gpx files making for easier data sharing if you need new features like these then by all means i would recommend purchasing mappoint 2010 if this is your first purchase of mappoint take advantage of the free trial download online and also compare mappoints features to those of the cheaper microsoft streets and trips 2010 personally that is what i use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs,182,10
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,I have had this program for a while now and i can confirm that it is not that good however it is better than streets and trips it has the same abilities but is also suited to add info to microsoft office applications i can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily but if you just want a street guide go with s and t what worries me considerably is that microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application bing maps this application is only available direct from microsoft and the cost varies with the number of seats you license that makes me wonder how long mappoint will be available and whether bing maps will be a better program in addition other map companies like google may already have similar applications or be about to release them i suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you will buy,159,11
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,first if you plan to sync and use this software in conjunction with a gps device you would better have the garmin brand preferably the latest one moreover if you business extends into canada this software will not be of much use for someone who wishes to put together say a national sales presentation or wishes to analyze data by geographic localities mappoint might be just the ticket given the number of options available for businesses today however this software seems overpriced a bit outdated even irrelevant and limited for most purposes other reviewers have rightly pointed out some of it is other shortcomings and limitations on the other hand if your business needs the specific capabilities that this particular program offers you will not find a better alternative what it does do it does relatively well if not easily,138,12
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,mappoint does not recognize some major streets in the community in which i am plotting data technical support was not able to help product not worth my time and effort if it does not work properly,33,13
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i have previous versions of microsoft streets and trips and have used it numerous times for maps and vacation plannning as well as it is gps capabilities microsoft map point is basically the big brother of ms streets and trips however it adds the ability to download maps to a gps device which is definitely a nice add-on and something i wish streets and trips could do and it adds the ability to import or link contact location data from ms outlook and display it custom maps beyond that i can not see where it really adds enough features to be worth the much higher price they charge for map point as opposed to streets and trips but it does run well and does all the functions it is supposed to do so if you really need to easily link and map your outlook customer data then this is the way to go,152,14
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,sometimes the position of the location flag is not very accurate and the data must be pristine as the software can not deal with post office box numbers that are on the same line as the addresses garbage in garbage out sometimes it gets confused if county road is abbreviated as cr or c r or even county road so clean up the data in excel before importing it into map point but for what i paid for the software i am satisfied,82,15
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,there has almost no configuration and to be perfectly frank the resulting maps look like crap the icons are of very poor image quality even if you manage to import a custom one because the pixel range is so darn small and again almost no configurability i feel sorry for everyone including myself stuck using this horribly designed software,61,16
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,been using this product for 3 years total and 2 years on multi user after learning curve we depend on it totally i had to call tech support twice when we converted to multi user but we caused all our problem highly recommend for mac users besides what else is available that can beat it and stay in the nac world,62,0
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,although quickbooks is not geared to handling books for outside salesmen it can be accomodated to give you access to information that you need i have not found another product that can do this running our home based small business it is important to keep records on commissions to sub-reps and income from multiple businesses that we represent quickbooks does this,60,1
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,constant crashing longtimes reports that will not run can not tag line items in purchase orders to a job it is a terrible product and i only use it because i have to,32,2
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am not an accountant so i do not use all the capability of the program for what i need it works fine my complaint is every new version of mac os has required me to buy a complete new version of quickbooks i started out years ago with a windows version paid full price then switched to mac bought another version at full price then when we went to snow leopard had to buy another new version and the same with lion so i have over the course of 5 years purchased the program 4 times this is crazy i could see some reduced upgrade price being fair but re-buying the whole program is just not right because of this i can not recommend this product to someone who is looking for an accounting program,134,3
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have had an awful time with qb mac since my purchase i wish i could return it and go back to qb for windows i have had constant technical issues and no one in technical support can help i think there are great things about the program if only they worked correctly i am incredibly disappointed and if it was not for the brand new mac computer i would go back to using qb for windows in a heartbeat,79,4
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quick books for windows for 20 years and just made the switch 6 months ago to a mac all my data converged into qb for mac flawlessly it is very easy and user friendly,37,5
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for mac really sucks for inventory you can not upload from excel unless you save as a txt file then change to an iff file while on desk top even then some feild are missing,35,6
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,qb has been great for my trucking business this accounting software has really helped keep my business organized little square for mac has been a huge help for any accounting questions i have i would recommend it to anyone trying to keep track of their money,46,7
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,disappointed in intuit they claim that you can make copies for windows users ie accountants but it does not work well when you call tech support they tell you not to do it so how if i am a mac user and my accountant is a pc user am i supposed to give him my account to reconcile also it does not share the same features as qb for windows like alias,72,8
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quick books is a great program but the invoicing module desperately needs to be more flexible and robust i can not format invoices in a way that really works for me or add the text i need to,37,9
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,moving from windows to mac qb was easy and wish i had done it sooner well worth the purchase for the four varied companies for which i keep books,29,10
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we have been waiting for intuit to give mac the full set of features and qb 2011 was the first one that did while it is nice to use it on my mac it has all the same problems as regular qb it crashes once a day if not more we have had a hard time with several of the features it will kick me out for no reason if there is another user unfortunately for us the switching cost of going to another accounting software would be to great but if i was a first time buyer i would tell you to look long and hard at your choices as this may not be the best one,118,11
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love this version of quickbooks better yet because i purchased it on amazon when my hard drive crashed last year all i had to do was log on and re-download the software such an easy recovery the interface is clean and simple I have had a few problems with printing checks it does not recognize they have printed and freezes up my print queue but other than that it is been really easy to use and switch from pc,76,12
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,compared to qb for windows this falls flat too many annoying bugs accounts are slow to update and overall this is just tedious to use wish i stayed with the windows version that version is fantastic,37,13
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this program is not user-friendly at all I am a contractor and purchased this program after it was referred to me by a sub-contractor that i have become friends with I am admittedly not a great business man i do not have a business degree of any kind and i struggle to keep up with my paperwork which is why i purchased this program it is difficult to say the least if you have used previous quickbooks programs and are familiar with it all then maybe it will work better for you but i was previously using quicken 2000 and this is ten times more complicated that being said if you are more business savvy than i am which I am guessing most of you are then this program ight be for you because it really does do everything except payroll payroll costs more a lot more,143,14
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,there are some extremely annoying quirks in this mac version of quickbooks entries rearrange themselves in the ledgers according to check or transaction numbers rather than date which is not the same system as used by my bank on their statements so reconciling is a pain i prefer single-line entries only the ledger keeps flipping back to double-line entries almost on it is own also the backup process presumably designed to improve upon the previous or pc version is actually not an improvement at all as it is no longer simple to save only the 3 most recent backups rather than the whole slew this version of quickbooks is clumsy and not well thought through by the programmers needs workquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],126,15
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,we have a very small business but the same processes need to happen as in a large company quickbooks allows me do everything we need related to our finances without having to hire another staff person,36,16
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,after using quick books for 15 years the switch from pc to mac versions has been awful screens are confusing many reports are missing time to learn the new program was a lot longer than i expected as a regular user i am abandoning the mac version and going back to pc very disappointed intuit should take this off the market until they can get it right,68,17
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product lacks the conveniences contained in intuits qb for windows every customization is a battle it seems i have used qb for mac 2011 for nearly a year now and am ready to get another pc and go back to the productivity and speed i used to enjoy i can not stand the payroll section of qb for mac or the payroll support staff and the price for payroll support,70,18
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i wish i would have known that i would need to pay extra for support i wish i would have know that when reconciling accounts the mac version does not have the same features as the windows version ie unable to sort data by dollar amount unable to obtain a reconcilement discrepancy report,53,19
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,love my new mac but the intuit software quicken and quick books does not compare with the microsoft versions i have been a quicken user for my personal account since their inception but i am greatly disappointed in the mac product i assume that this is due to not selling as many mac versions and therefore less time and money were spent on developing it there are extra steps necessary in the mac products more so in quicken than in quickbooks the reconcile is also an example of an inferior product,91,20
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,I have been using qb99 with windows and got a mac in jan and wanted to get the current version with some help from my qb consultant we converted to qb for mac i love it all my old numbers imported flawlessly and now I am much better organized,47,21
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i think i like the quickbooks for mac much better than windows very easy to use and not hard at all to transfer from windows to mac did not lose anything in the transfer,33,22
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is the first business accounting software I have personally used in a long time i picked up the software quickly and find it easy to use and generally user friendly no problems getting it to do what i need in my construction business but I am disappointed the mac version is not as full featured as the pc version based on comments from my accountant i feel like I am using a 5 year old version of the pc software it works fine just has limitations i know the pc version does not have I am also disappointed the quickbooks payroll for mac defaults to adobe for printing and viewing files macs preview works just fine in quickbooks why does not it also work with quickbooks payroll for mac,123,23
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks on the mac is super easy i was familiar with qb on a pc so perhaps had an easier time getting started with it on the mac it is user-friendly for all the purposes i need to use it i definitely recommend it,43,24
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,my business depends on invoices being correct and this program always has the wrong date on the invoice most of the time i do not notice it until it is too late email invoice it is quite embarrassing to be sending things to customer that are wrong i have asked your technical team to help and that was useless i never had a problem when i used quickbooks with my pc your mac version falls way short of what it could be almost forgot another thing when your program un dates the financial institution information it does absolutely nothing except stay in a non-responsive mode i have to force quit since it never does anything except prevent me from using the program i would never have used this mac quickbooks if i would have known it had this many problems actually there are more but for now those are the only things that come to mind after using this software for about 4 months dr locke,163,25
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,with no ability to create an accountants file it makes for a lot of extra work my accountant writes out changes by hand and then i input everything the windows version has this option why not mac,37,26
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i find it harder to use for budgeting purposes than quicken was i was using quicken on my pc and am considering returning to it,25,27
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have used quickbooks for windows for over 10 years and was very satisfied with is performance and reliability quick books for mac has not been as good it seems clumsy and is not as easy to use,38,28
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac 2011 omits many functions that can be found on the pc version the lack of inventory tracking is a big one why would such a seemingly easy and very needed basic function not be in the mac version,41,29
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i really love the qb upgrade from pc to mac and the smooth ease to transfer all my files into the new format further it is really easy to use,30,30
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,if you only use a mac and you are brand new to quickbooks you should have no problem with this product i have heard horror stories about quickbooks for mac but if you do not know any other way it is just fine i have a very small business new business that i needed quickbooks for and i did not want to do the whole parallels thing so i decided just to give quickbooks for mac a shot as i mentioned earlier knowing no other way is key because you will not be comparing it to quickbooks for windows and you will find that all your needs are being met I have been completely satisfied,110,31
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is great but it has a couple of drawbacks that are really annoying when i customize a report and save it the report column widths are not saved so each time i run the report i have to adjust the column widths also when entering a transaction in the register if the payee exists the details from the last transaction will automatically be copied to the current transaction if there is no detail to the transaction being entered that is no split it is not intuitive to go into the check itself to check that the memo line has not been overwritten by a detail memo line transferred from a previous transaction the result incorrect memos on checks if these are dumb user errors I had really like to know how to fix them,135,32
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used qb for a very long time way before intuit made a version for the mac i have been a recent convert from the pc roughly 2 years it all came about because i had a series of viruses and window errors that drove me to the point of despair along came one of my good friends and colleagues with a gift of my very first mac a macbook i went from total despair to why the heck did not i do this years ago anyway i am know 100 mac luckily intuit has understood that migration from pcs to macs is an ongoing phenomena which will not slow down i started using qb for mac as soon as it came out it makes bookkeeping sooo easy neat and quick i should know i am an accountant by trade cpa I have used heavy duty systems and other light versions qb mac is hands down the best now if intuit made it is turbo tax software in mac then they would be hitting a home run i can not wait to see that happen have fun using qb for mac yucagreengo,188,33
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,I have used quickbooks on various pcs for many years and loved the performance my boss decided to purchase a macbook as my replacement computer last year which meant converting my pc quickbooks file to a mac version i had noof all the limitations I had encounter as a result of this conversion and I am extremely frustrated by some very important functions that i simply can not do at all such as sending out an accountants copy for tax preparation so that I am able to continue to work in quickbooks until the accountant returns his revised copy to be integrated back into my file I have been quite disappointed and i sincerely hope that the mac version will soon be as good as the pc version,124,34
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am a small business owner that went from qb2009 for pc to qb2011 for mac and although i am not a professional in keeping books i can manage quite well the mac version is lacking in a few areas like price levels and the ability to change some categories of items but overall it is well designed and easy to navigate,62,35
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,after reading several of the reviews prior to purchasing quickbooks 2011 for mac it is better than we expected our old version of quickbooks ran on a pc that was full of gliches delays and slow downs it had so many bugs just because it was installed on a pc in all honesty there are some annoying gliches for example sometimes if you click on invoices of checkbook you get pay sales tax or some other innappropriate response over all the ease and speed at which we can now work is well worth the few issues that come up here and there if you own a mac but are an avid quickbooks user we do recommend this product for home and small business use we maintain 2 businesses plus our personal financials with this program and are pleased with it,140,36
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been a quickbooks user for over 20 years but always owned a pc recently a client bought a mac computer and he purchased quickbooks mac what a nightmare would not recommend it to anyone not user friendly and like i said i have years of experience with quickbooks the payroll online only is a complete pain in the butt and you never feel in control i hate this program and hope i can talk my client into changing back to a pc i do not even like giving it a 1 star rating but it will not let me leave it blank,102,37
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,what a relief i get by using quickbooks it keeps me straight on tracking all of my expenses my invoicing and banking matters reports are easy to run and can be customized easily it makes my tax prep so much easier too love it,45,38
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,works but 1 journal entries can not scroll forward and backward to see prior entries quickly as was possible on other windows version 2 chart of accounts not so user friendly to find out how to for example create or edit new accounts and more 4 stars needs some work for ease of use with payroll i tried to get payroll installed by calling intruit and quickbooks and it took 2 - 3 hours then even although i ordered it and gave my cc they did not install it it will be a long time before i waste that much more of my time on the chance that it might not get done again workarounds for 1 person companies are difficult and it would be nicer if allowed to workaround easier for one person for payroll without signing up since it is usually not worth it for one person companies to sign up for payrollquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],158,39
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,many many features from the pc version of quickbooks seem to be missing the help menu is also very weak,20,40
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty,20,41
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if it had the same features as the quickbooks for windows does then it would be a great product i hope that quickbooks for mac can catch up with the features available with quickbooks for windows,36,42
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,reports are tedious in the mac version of qb along with many other tasks as well was hoping the 2011 mac version would solve many of these problems but alas it did not best to stay with windows when using quickbooks,41,43
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there have been numerous problems with this version since it is inception we have had to carry intuit / quickbooks helps since we loaded it on earlier this year problems with financial statements and having to rebuild data have slowed our progress as an entity i had thought that this would be good for our mac shop but not at this point we even had to have the data rebuilt outside the organization quickbooks which was not easily implemented formatting compilation research backups you name it we have had problems,87,44
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love my new mac however quickbooks is really not mac compatible it takes so much longer to do everything i hate it you can not do multiple payments at one time the payment screen closes after each payment you can not right click on an invoice to receive payments,48,45
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i really do not the on-line payroll very difficult to set up also no way to print an invoice for part of an estimate i would like to see a way to do that and to do payroll from the desktop like other quickbooks programs if i had known all the problems i would not have changed i wish they would make the contractor editions in a mac version,68,46
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,not too versatile too worried about security who cares when it is only one user not too user friendly ancient,21,47
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,I have been frustrated with quickbooks for the mac i have used other versions which are better organized I have had problems with qb crashing when I am using reports and told i just need to go to a newer version we do that and not only is the problem not resolved but now reports have been made more difficult to use there has no reason to require me to move my hands from the keyboard to the mouse in order to change the selection criteria for a report i know qb is a good product but not on the mac by cascade who works for peter,105,48
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the quickbooks for mac is far away from the capabilities of the quickbooks for pc they haven a long way of improvements to go regretfully if you have a mac there is nothing else than using the qb for mac the worst part is the payroll service,47,49

Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if have used qb for windows and are desperate to use qb for your mac hold your nose and make the purchase but be aware that the mac version is far inferior to the windows version and if you purchase a couple weeks before a new version is released you are stuck so be careful to check if a new version is coming out soon customer service is an adversarial experience the qb rep first denies that the problem is with the system and accordingly you must pay for the advice if you persist and prevail the qb rep grudgingly helps ideally they take control over your computer and do it themselves because their oral instructions are awful and they fight with you as you try to explain the problem most importantly back up qb before calling for service so they do not delete your files if you ever wonder where bangalore institute of technology dropouts go to get jobs call qb customer service,165,51

Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched to an imac several years ago i ran quickbooks on windows for many years and just this last year switched to the mac version it is good but it could utilize the unique mac features much better it acts a lot like a converted windows version instead of a stand alone mac version it would be awesome if they could make an iphone app that would allow expenses to be entered on the go that would then wirelessly be entered on my office computer i must say that intuit is doing a much better job on the mac software than before i ran an emulator on my mac to run the windows version for quite a while because the mac version was not up to snuff now it is much better and so i switched,134,62

Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for six years the first five were on a windows pc i have reported my problems to apple but the discrepancies are still there they are not huge but they are annoying my biggest problem is when I am writing a check click on an account and run the mouse over the account it does not show what is underneath the main account word like the sub category i might write a check with numerous accounts so it is really annoying the same thing happens in the bank register when you click on the account then run the mouse over it it needs to show what is underneath but it does not it is hard to check for mistakes so you have to do it all over again if there is doubt,135,74
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i constantly have to re-enter data because of the frequent error messages i get from quickbooks and it often makes odd demands refusing to save what i just entered so i have to close the program and start all over again it is a maddening program and i wish I had stuck with the accounting system i set up myself in filemakerpro,60,75
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is not user friendly in the slightest if you have the option continue using the pc version i actually clicked on write checks three times twice it asked me for my security question answer even although i have no requirements for a security question to be answered to write checks same thing happens when i try to create invoices i clicked about 5 times and it took me to the rate quickbooks for mac screen so i thought i would let everyone know what i think they need serious updates for this product,96,76

Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am looking to open a new business in the coming months and i have not done any research on accounting software just assuming i will be buying quickbooks for mac i am so happy i spent the time going through these reviews on amazon i have a mac and my business partner has a pc we were going to upgrade her to a mac so that we could have compatible os for software purposes such as quickbooks however i am now thinking that we will keep her pc and try to find a different accounting program i was amazed at the reviews left on this site the common issues for all of the reviewers strongly suggests that intuit needs to get it is act together thanks for all of the posts,130,83
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for mac for several months i have no prior quickbooks experience i found it easy to use and very helpful it seems virtually impossible to mess up things can easily be added deleted and moved it has been very useful being able to track my business progress via quickbook i do not know what i would have done without it my only complaint is the fact there is not a mobile phone app for mac users it is kind of crazy to have an iphone app available for windows users but not mac users really i hope this will be corrected soon having a mobile app that syncs with my computer would quickbooks really rock,119,84
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if you are transferring from windows to mac do not get parallels and use the windows version the mac version is not compatible with payroll so you have to sign up for their version which used to cost us 189 / year and now cost us 65 / month anytime you type a t in the check field it automatically puts in to print the autofill does not work as good as the windows versions windows info does not translate correctly at random times so you have to download it back to windows and then back to mac because rebuilding the data does not correct it if you are a setting up a new company or first time user it is ok but like i said at the beginning the windows version is better,129,85
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is my firstinto quickbooks after being a long time quicken for windows user the church treasurer and i were trained on quickbooks together he was trained on the windows version while i was on the mac version they mirror each other relatively closely and if you know one you can certainly manage the other the only area of great disappointed was related to online banking the mac version does not have the capability to make online payments through your online banking system through quickbooks for mac this is a great feature with the windows product no double entry just key it once into the check register and send it to the bank for payment with quickbooks for mac i have to double key the entry i key it once into the quickbooks checking account register and then again into the online banking system when i download the statements from the bank quickbooks for mac recognizes the entry for the most part and matches them so i do not have to manually do it overall i am very satisfied with that one exception i use it for church accounting with a couple hundred thousand going through each year no issues to this point,204,86
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am finding that the quickbood for macs has a lot of problems that i had never encountered with quickbook for pcs i was debating getting a mac just because i use my computer a lot for quickbooks and the reviews for macs quickbook were bad my daughter decided to get me a mac for xmas and as much as i loved my mac have had many many problems,69,87
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i run the books for our home owners association we switched to quickbooks for mac a year and a half ago it simplifies everything to be able to send monthly reports in just a few seconds and to email invoices saves a lot of time the 2011 updates are more mac-like i especially like the ability to customize reports so they are not as bland looking great program,67,88
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,all in all it works like the qbooks for windows except often whenever i go into an account it asks for a security question which is very annoying,29,89
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product is the worst some of the selections just do not click open for example i can not open one check book register today and the option to place payments called receive payments is simply not responding this happens daily so i am constantly behind soon i will give up and hire a bookkeeper sigh,53,90
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,had qb for pc for 8 years then made the switch to mac there are many glitches within the software frustrating,21,91
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there is only one version for mac and it does not include any contractor options i had to pay a quickbooks expert to format my invoices and estimates,28,92
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we use to enjoy quick books multi user addition on our pcs we now use quick books for mac multi user mode it lacks many features that we used on the pc version we are disappointed but continue to use it i hope you keep working on it until you incorporate the features that were available on quick books premier dan endsley owner endmark sales and marketing,67,93
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,full of bugs every time i get an update i think maybe this time they fixed the bugs but alas no very poorly designed integration into the mac os like the title says it gets the job done but very poorly,41,94
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as soon as i bought it i was able to download it which was amazing great program perfect for small business such as ours,24,95
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,a major bug that has cost us lost data and time is the no security question exists error message it keeps popping up when we need to access our bank account intuit please fix it another annoying bug that quickbooks needs to fix is that we are unable to remove a user once created a user can not be removed it became annoying when the list of old users got longer and longer we are still trying to figure out how to network quickbooks between two macs apparently the data can not be stored on a server the data must be stored on one of our computers that means if that computer is not on i can not access my quickbooks data from my laptop and if i store the data on my laptop if i take the laptop out of the office my bookkeeper has no access to the data either i think that is stupid,154,96
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,previous user on pc thought it would be easy transition it works but has some flaws my invoices occasionally put the previous days date on the first invoice of the day annoying,32,97
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i upgraded as the 2010 version would not work with lion i noticed very little difference from qb mac 10 if you liked qb 10 you will like this one also it is a good program yes i know it is not qb windows but it functions well is stable and is simple to navigate if you or your accountant are used to qb windows if there are functionality changes I am not missing them considering that intuit has a disgraceful record of supporting osx this program is a miracle just look at what quicken for mac turned into quicken essentials for mac which is the poorest reviewed program I have ever seen if you have a mac and you need an accounting program this is the one to get,127,98
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i do not know why quickbooks and quicken for mac are so bad compared to the pc version i use both and dread using it on the mac and have used both products for years and really enjoy it on pc,40,99
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I had give it 3 stars if it was not missing functions that the pc version has very buggy three updates so far and they still can not get it fixed the bookkeeper we use and a pro w / quickbooks can not figure how to work with some of the issues,46,100
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i bought an apple imac and wanted to use it with quickbooks mistake more difficult to use than the windows-based version still can not figure out how to get the ledger to show up without repeatedly clicking on the register icon and have it do absolutely nothing the help you get when you call in is completely frustrating i avoid calling even if i have a problem because it is so terrible they speak english but they do not understand what you are saying and they always want to sell you something else they eventually get the issue solved but at a great expense of my time because of the language barrier i used to do my own payroll but will now have to go to a payroll service to get it done and will not use the quickbooks payroll because of it being dis-jointed I am not fond of the company they are irritating,147,101
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have run several quickbooks all for mac i have always liked the products as long as i am the only one working on it and it is on our macs the problem is when you bring in a bookkeeper or accountant and they need to pull data or share data to compress and reformat is frustrating i have had intuit qb for mac specialists helping and still ran into issuestry qb essentials online it is cloud type tech so easier for others to access,83,102
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,great but no app all the apps are for quickbook for windows figure that one out intuit iphone app for windows only,22,103

Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i bought quickbooks to help me organize my small business it makes emailing estimates and invoices to my clients so much easier quickbooks for mac makes running a small business very efficient my accountant loves it because all my business receivables and expenses are right there in my mac and printing checks is a cinch i love it i would recommend this program to any business owner,67,105
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks 2011 for mac is a great software one of the most user friendly accountant softwares of all times and very intuitive few bugs although and restricted on vat countries payments and customizing invoices advisable,35,106
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version of quickbooks is awful it lacks significant functionality of the windows versions there are few if any third-party plug-ins available because intuit has not released a software development kit if you are going to convert to mac plan to add the cost of vmware fusion and windows 7 so you can run quickbooks in windows,57,107
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a church treasurer quickbooks has made my work so much easier all of the necessary reports and records a readily available no matter what my pastor asks for,29,108
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i love my mac my employees love having an all-mac office the only downside is being stuck with qb for mac it is not as robust as qb for pcs also intuit treat mac owners like second class citizens the strong message they send us is want real quickbooks buy a pc there is a real opportunity for someone to develop a qb-like program for macs one that has real customer support and has been developed by someone who does not hate macs i use qb because i do not have time to find an alternative as soon as i do I am gone,100,109
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before i purchased quickbook for mac 2011 and was a bit worried with what others said with the 60 day trial period i figured what do i have to lose i have to say it is very easy to use i spent about an hour navigating the different modules to get a feel for the layout and workflow quickbooks makes it easy to enter new customer bills and invoices I have used a lot of different erps and crms some better and some worse as a small business owner it has saved me a lot of time compared to the spreadsheet accounting i was using it is not perfect but it has increased my productivity and decrease my stress,121,110
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac up to and including version 2011 takes care of the most basic accounting / bookeeping needs but that is about it why does not it just have all of the features and functionality of qb pro for pc it is just that simple let me sort in the reconciliation window by column let me find anon the chart of accounts by typing in an account number sub account number or part of an account title or sub account title just the simple things would be a great start and some of these were available in qb for mac 2007 why are not they in this version also the multiuser version is horrendous very little real network-level configuration going on there it just really does not work well at all after purchase we installed then uninstalled and are back to copying files including spending significant time with intuit support and our mac and qb knowledgeable techs frankly at this rate why bother with a mac version at all and just let us mac folks have a pc in the corner to run qb it be just that much simpler on us all and not provide daily frustration with very simple functions beingthanks,199,111
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love many of the new features but you really need a package that is specific for the food industry restaurants cafes and bakeries especially also this program has tons of bugs ie error messages not printing taking forever to print sometimes and other times is quite efficient this version is much easier but still clumsy in many ways,59,112
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i had to buy the 2011 version of quickbooks for mac because the 2010 version does not work with osx lion i could no longer print or email any invoices with my 2010 version and after reading through several forums i discovered my only solution to be buying yet another almost 200 version of this rudimentary software this does not help my feelings towards a company that seems as slow as a dinosaur to make good products buy this only if you have to hopefully some company will come out with better business software for macs,95,113
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this product is very difficult to use compared to the pc version the most basic tasks like setting the ledger you want to open automatically when you click on the icon are frustrating and confusing the payroll situation is a flat out nightmare stay away,45,114
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have spent more than 60 hours on the phone w intuit trying to sort out all the problems w quickbooks for mac 2011 i hired a tutor to try to help me I have paid her hundreds of dollars and she has not been able to get it to work properly either supposedly the pc version is good but i do not have a pc and do not want one I have even been paying 20 a month to intuit for tech support from them they have not sorted out the problems and i wish I had never bought this horrible horrible software it is a nightmare do not purchase this now is there any good book-keeping program on the market suitable for a small business owner w a mac i can not find one the person or company that actually comes up with a good one is going to make a gazillion dollars,148,115
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quick books for mac is not user friendly when i transferred it over from windows i had to call the support line because it did not work like it said it should then the lady who i could barely understand because she did not speak english well told me that this call would be free but if i had to call anymore after for support i would have to pay for it or i could set up a monthly payment and call anytime i want not cool I have used quickbooks for windows for a few years and it was very user friendly quickbooks for mac almost made me bring my entire mac back to the apple store I am used to it now but still prefer quickbooks for windows I am even considering switching to another finance program,135,116
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you are used to quickbooks pc and are expecting the same experience on your mac do not bother I am sure you can find manny reasons if you do a bit of research online but quickbooks mac is a disaster no good job tracking no good invoicing it takes me 10 times the time it used to to make a progress invoice on this version in other words quickbooks mac is at a kindergarden level compared to the pc version intuit should look at all their false advertizing about the products capabilities and think twice before advertizing this version as comparable to the pc version horrible horrible horrible if there was a way to review thisand give it a negative star reading i would ps quickbooks premier user for 7 years,132,117
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i could wax in excruciating detail suffice it to say if you can not access your company file after loading a few bank registers and all you get from tech support is sales pitches for extended warranty forget it i am not sending a file to india or anywhere for what is obviously some glitch save your time and avoid frustration one star is too much how about a minus 3 stars for the time lost,74,118

Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit obviously does not want my business as a mac user they consistently produce inferior products for the mac their support is garbage and now in order to run osx lion you have to upgrade to qb 2011 just to make it more painful intuit has priced their upgrade 10 high than the cost of buying a full version of qb 2011 on amazon thanks for showing me you do not want my business intuit,73,122
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the multi-user quickbooks for mac is very slow it takes forever to bring up reports and sometimes locks up window version is much better but quickbooks will not support the windows version via parallels go figure also the payroll feature is a scam they just want you to spend big bucks with them make sure you find other alternatives for your payroll if you are a smaller company basically do not buy if you do not have too i wish i did not,80,123
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I have spent over 3000 in the past year purchasing quickbooks pro for my small one-person business this year and hiring a consultant to set it up it is clunky and clearly not optimized for the mac when i find that the print invoice feature does not work i spend hundreds getting my consultant to consider the question and then ultimately to advise me to use a work-around arrgh,68,124
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,useless no support for multiple currencies and character limits 9 digits means this software is of no use for indonesia waste of money,24,125
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have loved quickbooks on the pc i recently moved to a mac and expected similar sophistication and reliability plus payroll integration on the mac i do not recommend this change and in fact I am moving back to quickbooks on a virtual pc on the mac the mac version is crude compared to the pc version and the lack of payroll is unacceptable given the even cruder and inflexible online service required from intuit if you are going to do payroll I am stunned by the lack of parallel functionality with the pc product,92,126
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this version of quickbooks is not as complete and easy to use as the 2008 pro for windows sales taxes are much more difficult to pay and adjust the windows version has a button to adjust sales tax the mac version you have to create a journal entry when posting bills it is necessary to manually enter the job name on the posting screen even although you have a po with the job name on it i have been very disappointed in the mac version of this program,88,127
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,frustrating product lacking many important and basic features that quickbooks pc has frustrating tech support they are extremely useless,19,128
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,makes invoicing pos searching previous checks and invoices so easy it takes the hard work out of accounting and can easily be converted to and from a pc version great interface you do not have to even really understand accounting to use it yet the features it has makes it such a powerful accounting program if you want it to be enter your checks invoices and receipts and make up accounts on the fly fantastic reporting and searches that are customizable invoices are also customizable to the extent that you can even insert your company logo do your payroll here as well with a link to intuit payroll module it costs an extra 40 / month but the pc version this feature is build into the program for less than 200 you can have this fantastic accounting program working for you you would be crazy not to buy it,147,129
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is very difficult to operate and does not work like in the pc terrible i constantly lose my latest version that i just updated,27,130
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,did any of the geniuses at quickbooks not think to make qb for mac look and function the same as for windows could not have been that difficult to do that way the transition would have been seamless also have terrible trouble that hundreds of cleared transactions download despite already being cleared and none of my downloaded transactions ever match the ones in my ledger i spend hours longer doing work in qb for mac than i ever did in windows this is the only complaint i have ever had regarding anything mac,92,131
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is different from the windows version it has a few bugs that need to be worked out and i wish i had a pc at work so i could use the regular version of quickbooks,38,132
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,while the mac is far superior to any pc in existence qb for mac is fair at best many features we were used to before switching to mac are no longer there it seems like they just patched it to make it work we are looking at other software and will probably change within the next thirty days,58,133
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i am new to quickbooks for mac as i normally use the pc version the mac version is quite different but it still functions very well there are a few things that i would change on the mac version but it still works great,44,134
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,so unhappy with qb mac no one tells you how limited and not user friendly this product is wait a few years maybe they will get the kinks worked out,30,135
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have a new mac book pro and the program still runs very slow it freezes and is slow this version compares very unfavorably with the windows version i will probably not use this software next year i will not change my mac i will rather change my accounting software to something that will work well with macs,58,136
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,overall quickbooks for mac 2011 has done a good job helping me stay on top of my financial records for my small mental health practice i started out with the 2009 version which had better report customization this version makes it harder to modify memorized reports it is easier to start all over again rather than trying to make changes to an existing report my biggest complaint is neither version will automatically download bank transactions like you can in the pc version i use one of the major national banks and you would think quickbooks would have worked it out by now,102,137
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not like the way payroll is handled you can not do it on you own like on a pc,19,138
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,it is terrible it is my understanding that it can not handle a large database and i spend most of my time waiting for it to work,26,139
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,love this quickbooks very easy to use came from pc quickbooks which had more options for data but I am a die hard mac fan pros nice clean easy to use program excellent support cons unable to make an estimate into a purchase order you have to reenter on pc version you can make an estimate into a purchase order and an invoice seems like this would be an easy fix,70,140
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have a mac and had been using quicken home and business running virtually with parallels never liked theof having windows xp on my new mac hello that is why i switched to mac i was a little apprehensive on making the switch to quickbooks for mac after reading tons of reviews i would have to say the switch has been very easy and satisfying do not believe all the knocks from the pcers program is not perfect but has worked great so far for me i own a small residential cleaning and construction company and qb for mac meets all my current needs do not fear try it out for yourself and see and no i do not work for intuit godspeed from cincy,118,141
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit is not my favorite company pc versions go buggy and they keep selling newer versions when one only needed it to work andthis is accounting not rocket science why can not an older program keep running been hoping another company will take over until then i purchased a mac version it works but is clunky has not been fine tuned to run as smoothly as pc need to learn kb shortcuts as many commands are only menu driven interface with address book is a mystery to me as is starting estimates and invoices from some other number that 1 with the growing mac population i suspect intuit plans on selling betteer versions by forcing upgrade purchases,118,142
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,all i heard was negative stuff about qb for mac i have a small business and decided to try it anyway could not be happier it does everything i need and is very easy to learn,35,143
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,when entering items into statement charges it has never aged appropriately on the statements have contacted supported many occasions to no avail seems to have a lot of problems against the windows version i wish i had never switched to mac version,42,144
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,simplifies and monitors your accounting whether or not it is a family based business a small medium enterprise or a large corporation quickbooks is your answer,26,145
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is an under-developed brutal necessity of life a bug filled cesspool intuit has it figured out most accountants use qb so it is become a standard you have to use it or risk a nightmare during tax season with you accountant the mac version of the program is unstable unpredictable glitchy and inflexible it is as if the intuit management decided that the growing market share of osx users was a necessary evil that they wanted to promote in their marketing but spend as few resources as possible developing this program irritates me to death every day,98,146
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this version for my mac thinking that it would be easier to use than the pc version i was seriously wrong as the mac version is not intuitive has far less features than the pc version and in general was a poor choice on my part there is actually a steeper learning curve for the mac version against the pc but it works i will say that the online payroll services are great,75,147
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quicken and quickbooks for many years i have modified the format to match our construction company needs i do not use the icon format at all rather go directly to the pull down screens i am able to keep my accounts balance email invoices and provide our accountant with a file at tax time i am on a mac and was disappointed that i could not use the on line accounting i have a problem ever year importing my accountants changes it would be wonderful to have the accountant access my accounts online to prepare our returns as an established company it is not reasonable to re-enter all my data to be on line i need an import conversion thereby avoiding human entry errors it is a good product i had to take a class on use but once i did using qb is easy and reliable,151,148
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,having been a super user of quickbooks enterprise accountants version and quickbooks pro and recommended the product to many clients i was a bit concerned about switching my day to day computer use to a mac having been a pc all my computer life i was especially concerned about quickbooks the mac version works beautifully and only has a few differences from the pc version that are perfectly easy to deal with ie the bank reconciliation process does not allow for sorting the transactions otherwise excellent job intuit,88,149
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks for mac is working ok after i got through the initial conversion from pc i had an older version on my pc and quickbooks initially did not want to help with the conversion at all telling me to find someone with a new version on their pc to convert it first on the pc side to make it compatible for a mac conversion after a lot of threats phone calls and so on i got them to convert it for free i have used quickbooks since 1996 but do not know if i would go through all of the hassle again it works ok although i liked some of the features of my old pc version better and it is very slow opening and closing but overall been dependable heather gray,130,150
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it is ok but has shortcomings like you can not set up how you want to sort your payables on a permanent basis every time you log in you have to reset them to sort the way you want really annoying,36,151
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am extremely unhappy with all of the misinformation about quickbooks for mac i have bought computer quickbooks 2011 program and now and support only to find out quickbooks does not support payroll which is the most important reason why i changed to mac so my is waisted ihave been a quickbooks customer for years and am gravely unhappy and screwed,62,152
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quick books for mac is not user friendly and at least ten times more difficult that the quick books for pc it is difficult to move around,27,153
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,many ways to get to the functions you want my only complaint is that there are merchant services credit card billing limitations on the mac that pc users get to enjoy,31,154
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,very good product i wish i had more time to understand all of it is features i think it will be a standard for our business applications sincerely carrie s,29,155
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,let us face it everybody knows that quickbooks sucks but they are the standard we all know that every chance they get they will nickel and dime you to death they come up with a new version every year that is basically like the last version and because either you or your accountant upgrade the other person is forced to upgrade what a scam i switched from windows to mac and of course had to pay hundreds of dollars again only to find out that the mac version does not support sending checks out through your bank there solution signing up for quicbooks online and paying monthly and of course qb online does not support it either do yourself a favor and by quicken or some other program,125,156
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have got a mac you have got a small business you need quickbooks for mac you will hate it but it it is the only one that uses basic double entry bookkeeping instead of hiding it all from you if you have ever used it on windows you will hate it even more it obvious intuit considers mac to be a second-rate platform when i can find a real alternative i will get it it in a heartbeat I had write my own but i do not have the time,84,157
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb 2011 is better than previous versions but even 2011 is not as powerful as the 2009 pc version mac is way behind in their programming,26,158
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,the mac has saved me countless hours versus a pc transferring my data over from a pc and using quickbooks on the mac has been wonderful i also love being able to run credit cards with it there are still some small improvements and glitches to be addressed but overall very good sincerely rod,54,159
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks for mac the reports are very well designed and i like the fact that i can choose my favorite reports and memorize reports if you make a mistake it is not the end of the world you can easily change it,43,160
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,the very best accounting application for the mac i have been using it for years probably since version 10 it is the quintessential program for completing the accounting requirements for several different corporations partnerships businesses that are sole-proprieterships and even a large charitable trust non-profit organizations of moderate size should find it more that adequate it is great for bank reconciliation and cutting checks,64,161
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have been using some form of quicken quickbooks for years when i switched to mac i was disappointed that intuit did not offer a version of quicken home and business for mac only pc i had to buy both the pc version and the mac version of quickbooks first to upgrade my home and business data to quikbooks pc and then the pc files could be imported to quickbooks for mac this did not bother me but after running quickbooks on mac for three years i am totally frustrated the program does not operate with anything close to the ease and convenience of the pc version i have purchased every new upgrade and yet nothing has addressed the issues i have with the software it does not memorize entries you have to manually re enter data over and over if you use the deposit function it does not enter this automatically in the register intuit needs to get it together and improve this product,166,162
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not walk run away from this product as great user friendly the pc version of quickbooks is the mac version is diametrically opposed what a headache this is the 4th time i have lost all my work and have to start from scratch qb does not tell you that some of your information does not translate well when crossing over from pc to mac that is where all my headaches started i have nowhat I am going to do now other than go back to qb pc version because frankly i see no hope in redeeming the other,100,163
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,over the years intuit has really improved quickbooks for mac into a full-featured program that allows me to easily send my financial information to my accountant for review he uses windows and we easily transfer data back and forth works great,41,164
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,this software is pretty good and legit there is no way i would do my own payroll without software like this,21,165
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we purchased multi-user quick books for mac this past february we are still inputting so hopefully we can go live with this product in august 2011 we have noticed that the mac version is not at all like the pc version therefore we have had to go around and create more detail so we can use this program so at this moment it has not been very productive how about making quick books for mac like your pc version we do not understand why that can not happen thank you for allowing us the opportunity to review this product hopefully in 6 months we can give you an excellent review,108,166
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched from windows to mac for quickbooks i have had no problems with the transfer process mac version is different you just need to take the time to maneuver around and find how to do certain things such as reports the payroll system is great and affordable i really like it i can also do payroll from my iphone which is an greater plus when I am not in the office at my computer,74,167
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quickbooks 2011 for mac for about two years and it is a great tool for invoicing balance sheets and income statements i especially like the feature that allows you to download my bank statements into the program and reconcile easy to transfer this information to my accountant for tax filing purposes like the program a lot,59,168
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i previously used quickbooks for windows and switched to quickbooks for mac 2011 when i bought a mac the quickbooks for mac is clearly an inferior product than the windows version hopefully as more people buy macs intuit will improve the product,42,169
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been using qb for mac multi user since december 2010 and i think that it is a horrible program it will randomly disconnect it will randomly not save work that i have done i would much rather use qb for pc it is a much better program,49,170
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it does not allow you to change the numbers on the checks you want to print if you make a mistake you have to print on a blank sheet in order to get the proper check number this is just one of the many faults with the qb for mac i love my mac and do not want to have to get a pc just for quick books i would look for another software but unfortunately this is what my accountant uses so I am stuck with this lousy program,87,171
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the mac version is much less versatile than the quickbooks pro version for pc sometimes i feel like I have stepped back 10 years when i use the version on my mac,31,172
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used qb-windows for years i was not crazy about it but i used it i did not like the way you are essentially forced to upgrade every 3 years but it worked ok qb-mac is garbage nothing is easy getting to your home page is difficult reconciling your bank statement will take 3 times as much effort do not waste your money on qb-mac,63,173
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac does not have anything close to the functionality or features of quickbooks for the pc intuit for whatever reason has decided to abandon it is mac users for this product quickbooks for mac is full of bugs and does not do some of the basic things required by accounting software,52,174
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,when i am printing out statements the system crashes a lot i can not enter data as quickly as with my pc so i have to force myself to slow down a bit i have not figured out how to mobileme from my desktop to my laptop and no once at the apple store can help me because they do not know quickbooks other than the about issues i love my mac quickbooks,73,175
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for the mac crashes on a regular basis and must be restarted sometimes with a reboot of the computer payroll is not included so profitability reports are not available amounts in the reconciliation can not be sorted based on amount so it is almost impossible to reconcile once / month many other features available in qb for the pc are missing hope this is resolved in qb 2012,67,176
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have had sooo many issues with mac 2011 do not get it stay with 2010 they have too many issues they need to work on i have sent my file in twice to get repaired i still can not download transactions properly,42,177
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used quick books for pc with great results i made the switch over to mac computers which has been wonderful but the quick books for mac does not work well at all the biggest problem is that it does not interface with online banking and i can not pay bills from within the quick books for mac environment very disappointing overall it is a poor product which is surprising because the pc version is amazing,72,178
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,like all intuit products quickbooks for mac is easy to use and provides a surprisingly full suite of features i am using the payroll service and the merchant bank service in addition to the usual features all are easy to set up work well and are easy to use,49,179
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am used to using quicken for personal accounting so when i opened my business i chose quickbooks 2011 for mac for my accounting software once i got used to the differences between the two programs i have found it easy to use in general the one piece that i find hard to use is the pay bills section it seems that i often am entering the wrong date for the bill payment but that is a minor issue i wish the program had a better way to show payments i have already set up for future payment in my checking account,102,180
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit still has pretty much a monopoly in this space for small business this is aimprovement over the past mac version and now performs considerably better than even the pc version but still a strangely weak package for what you would expect search as always is horrible reporting is pretty much still a joke and they have left out even the few useful features from the pc side we see a very strange and worrisome problem with moving files from the mac to pc versions balance sheet stays the same but phantom bills show up in the vendor center you would think that almost all of this could be cloud based by now but their online offering just is not there yet updated review software is full of bugs,130,181
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i just purchased qb 2011 for mac however when i tried to open by prior mac qb2009 file it would not open i called technical support and they got farther to the password screen but the windows password did not work i had to purchase a service plan and send the file to them to rebuild i do not have it back yet to tell you if that worked if you read other reviews on this site you will see that i am not the only one with this problem i found it deplorable that the qb tech support person acknowledged it is a bug on there end but still makes me pay to rebuild the file and i was told there was no initial technical support so if you are buying this and do have problems be prepared to pay for tech support reputable software companies provide at least 30 days free support and do not charge to repair a known bug shame on you intuit,165,182
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks the versatility and availability thru quickbooks i have developed and train others to use a simple method to track and reconcile items commonly used in the qsr industry such as gift card sales frequent diner discount cards and most commonly used credit cards many if not most corporations do not offer set up and training to new franchisees at the onset quickbooks offers an easily understood readily accessible product to those franchisees who with a small amount of additional training can be off and running their own businesses,91,183
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,very confusing have use quickbooks pro for years on my pc and it worked great this is even difficult to open to bank account ask for password but tells you there is no password hate the program i will be changing,41,184
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick books is justly popular not only will it help you keep the books but it also captures quite a lot of data you will have the info you need for billing for determining the level of profitability of your jobs and for managing contractors as well as employees it is easy to install and easy enough to figure out but you will be more successful if you do not have a background in accounting if you pick up an instruction book the documentation that comes with the program is not nearly enough,88,185
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version is not compatible with the pc version if i do work on my mac and then save it in a windows format for my bookkeeper to use transactions are lost those who use macs should not buy this product,42,186
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,why is the upgrade with instant savings for previous quickbooks users more expensive that a new version you can buy anywhere online is this how intuit intends to reward loyal customers who have been using and paying for the software for the last 15 years give me a break do you think we are all idiots,56,187
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have to be an accountant to understand how to even set up this application there is not even a book written for the mac beside a useless ebook i never used the pc version that people say is better but this mac version needs to be more user friendly I am not an accountant that is why i bought this in the first place so far it has been a waste of money it is supposed to sync with my pos software and my bank online we could accomplish neither,87,188
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you have a bookkeeper who has any of the latest pc versions of quickbooks you will still lose bank reconciliations memorized transactions reportsjust to name a few when you import back and forth between the pc and mac version intuit has been working hard on this issue for more than 4 years but people are still losing a ton of data most times they work with a pc-based bookkeeper for those that want to purchase quickbooks 2011 they are currently having a sale it is 18395 however if you already own a copy of quickbooks they support their past customers with an upgrade discount the price is just 18395,112,189
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i used quickbooks to do the accounting for my wifes business and it always worked like a champ mind you this was many versions ago and it functioned perfectly even then now with the upgrades and enhancements it is even easier to use spend the time toyour data completely and properly and the dividends are immediate highly recommended,59,190
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks just keeps getting better and better i have been a user of intuits initial product quicken and grown along with intuit to my current version of quickbooks for mac 2010 their software development team through quickbooks for mac 2010 has taken the drudgery out of the day-to-day bookkeeping chores and transformed it into a quick and seamless part of the business it is very intuitive everything you have always wanted to know about real estate but were afraid to ask real estate for the rest of us,86,191
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been a quickbooks user for years on the pc but love my mac and it is dependability intuit has finally gotten the mac version on par with the windows version and i use it daily best part is that this is not just a port of the windows version it is a completely mac product and utilizes the osx interface simply wonderful,62,192
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks mac makes running your daily business so easy you can focus on what really matters your own customers,20,193
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a new quickbooks for mac 2011 user who is unfamiliar with business accounting software i find littlesquares online videos helpful and shelly king and the staff there remarkably gracious and thoughtful in response to my questions and needs once I have worked longer with quickbooks i know I shall have more questions and am confident of a helpful rapid response from the team at intuits littlesquare,65,194
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,using quickbooks on my mac adds all the advantages of the best operating system with the number small business accounting program,21,195
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there has no import feature maybe if you had the mac version still running you could do an export if you are lucky but you cannotthe data why do they even call these things versions of the same software,39,196
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is a great application the downside is that you must purchase updates with little or no added value every 2 - 3 years to stay in a position of product support this upgrade should have been valued at about 2995 for current quickbooks users,43,197
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been very disappointed with this product at first i could not even transfer my pc files over to it my husband did an internet search for help and finally ended up calling the company for help they walked him through a very lengthy tedious process of transferring the files i had four companies files that i wanted to two of the transfers worked two did not then when i looked at one of the companies whose transfers worked i found that none of my memorized reports had been saved it looks like i will only be able to use quickbooks on the old pc that i saved if i want to access the information because it certainly is not available to me on the mac,126,198
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,after getting a new mac i was forced to upgrade from quickbooks 2007 to quickbooks 2011 and found that there has no improvement at all i had no choice about the upgrade since the program stopped working due to compatibility issues i am very unhappy with quickbooks and it is product for mac users if you have access to a pc get the pc version,63,199
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,because i am at work i can not get into all the details as i am trying to figure out why my memorized transactions are not automatically entering i worked with the pc version for years and it was very user friendly i was excited to switch to a mac and have had no problems adjusting to mac software for other products such as microsoft office too many quirks in the mac version would not recommend a couple of other examples as why you should not switch to mac version-printed reconciliations do not fit on one page had an it guy from a large corporation we are an agency of and he could not fix no answers from intuit have to relearn several processes was eventually able to figure out some items by posting in intuit community the help in quickbooks is practically useless,142,200
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,two things i will not use it after importing from other software you lose information secondly it is so hard to customize a form for something in that price range you would hope they put more effort into it it looks like the people at quickbooks do not have any mac experts on their payroll they need to see the light mac is transforming the new computing era get used to it quick,69,201
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased mac 2011 with high hopes from pc version it is completely different and missing reports and audit features also you must type in amounts for vendor on invoices items with 2 or more lines disappear on screen but print ok you can not use qb invoice mailing service on mac why bank reconcile is much harder,58,202
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i would not buy into this product i am being forced to buy the new version which i do not want as the old version which was working fine suddenly requires a new registration that does not work in snow leopard the upgrade is 199 when i can buy the full copy for 180 they have got you by the at and they know it,62,203
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 is the worst ever less than 2 hours after installing it it has corrupted the file and support is terrible once i contacted quicken as instructed by the program they told me that can fix the problem they apparently knew about it but they charge between 250 and 750 to do so or you can purchase the support option for 20 month this is black mail pure and simple intuit really dropped the ball on the mac do not bother,81,204
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit claims a 60 day no questions asked refund but no matter what i have tried i can not get my money back now I shall have to go through my credit card company i will never ever by any intuit product again for the rest of my life,48,205
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,after starting a small business with our daughter last year i became the one responsible for the books and i used qb for the first time after some suggestions from our tax accountant i found it to be an extremely useful program as my daughter has a mac i bought a new mac and have switched to the new qb so i can teach her to do her own books and i candown,75,206
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i had used quicken for years but after upgrading my mac quicken data did not successfully make the change was more or less forced to try quickbooks 2011 for mac i am very pleased so far unlike my previous encounters with pc-type applications quickbooks is significantly easier to learn i am not a professional bookkeeper so my use of all the features will probably be limited the features i have used so far have been interesting and surprisingly fun so far so good,83,207
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i purchased the 2011 quickbooks for mac so i can finally get my finances organized there is a bit of learning involved however i feel good about taking control and making paying bills working my budget and filing my taxes easier,41,208
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this for my solo law practice and I am very disappointed i am fairly proficient on the computer but this program is not intuitive despite the brand name and too difficult even for me there has not enough flexibility to make simple accounting records the help menu does not work half the time and when it does it just sends you to random online articles i would be better off just using excel,72,209
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,since upgrading to this qb version my start up time is triple what it was and my computer seems to be much more quirky do not buy it,27,210
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i keep hoping that updates will fix old problems with quickbooks software for the macintosh and they do not i overpaid even at amazon for a really poor product that has a stranglehold on the accounting industry i feel forced to pay for and use this buggy software,47,211
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not purchase this product if you plan to manually enter in your payroll it does not have the capabilities you must purchase intuits online payroll service to use payroll this is not optional read the fine print,37,212
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 multi user mac should not be on the market user sessions connected the server fail to log out properly and no new data can be saved to the company files i paid extra for data services and have sent my files in repeatedly and the returned files preform no better i have been hung up on by tier 2 support and data services tells me it is not their problem customer support will not offer a refund or credit towards converting back to windows not what i wanted to do i signed up to be a beta tested and got no reply i paid for the software and get no support be warned,113,213
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,I have been a quicken user for more than 10 years so i had few problems setting up a non-profit organizations books with this product thumbs up,26,214
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 for mac disc did not work on my machine i had to contact quickbooks to download the web version the disc looked used and scratced it was supposed to be new,33,215
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i had talked to quckbooks about their software for mac and was assured that it was just like the pc version i then found out that it does not have payroll you have to do that online and pay a lot for that service was also very unhappy with amazon because i was told that i could not have a refund so I am stuck with software that i can not use another thing that i was not happy with on intuit was that they use india or some over seas vendor for support i spent over 8 hours on the phone with them just trying to get my files moved from pc to mac and they still could not do it,120,216
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,am returning after all the bad comments on mac quickbooks 2011 stability and support problems along with forced upgrades and planned obsolesence perception that intuit is not committed to mac version of quickbooks and reading too many negative reviews to have a good comfort level with the product,48,217
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,watch out do not let the name deceive you although quickbooks is a wonderful package on the pc this mac version is awful especially considering the price if it were selling for 75 less i would still slam it but at the price offered here and everywhere it is an embarrassment the worst part for me was the difficulty in money account transfers what has the deal here i had software from the 1990s that could do this efficiently the pc version does not have any problem with it,85,218
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i need a replacement for my microsoft money for our family finances but this program is a serious bookkeeping program much too detailed for us so i returned it,29,219
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter and she got it thought it was great only to find out her bank did not support it make sure you contact your bank before you purchase this software we had to reluctantly return it amazons return policy is only 50 on software that has been opened but they honored the quickbooks full refund after i contacted them or at least they said they would-i am waiting to see,75,220
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,with my quicken i was able to keep track of personal and business expenses unfortunately with quickbooks it will only handle the business expenses quicken was very helpful with reminders about bills coming up and it would give me a warning that i could set of 3 to 5 days ahead of time with quickbooks we can only record the business expenses and track them in order to enter a bill i need to go to the vendors and put in the names and mailing addresses and is set up to print checks and more right now I am not sure if i want to go that way the the conversion from the pc quicken 2 the mac quickbooks was not that smooth most of the all of the vendors and payees that i had never came over as vendors they came over as other for now I shall need to be working both systems so i can close out 2010 taxes and hopefully by 2011 will have an alternative to handle the personal to track the utilities and more and when bills are popping up maybe somewhere in i-work,186,221
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am a mac user and I have been using quickbooks for many years and still do unfortunately every time i use quickbooks i have to switch over to pc in bootcamp in canada only the pc version exists there is no mac version even after many years of requests to intuit there is a us mac version why not a canadian one intuit how difficult can it be to add small things like gst pst and hst to the tax lines as a programmer i know it does not take much to do this once i find an alternative that works on the mac that includes payroll we will switch,107,222
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,having been fortunate to be a beta tester for intuit for the last several years i get to see the raw software before it get released on the street intuit does a great job of incorporating any suggestions that the beta testers provide i have been using quickbooks for 10 plus years to manage my commercial properties having used a pc for 8 - 1/2 years before buying a macbook i was reluctant to migrate my qb file over to a mac version of quickbooks for fear of losing data in the transition i had been using vmware to run quickbooks 2010 in a windows environment on macbook until i installed the release version of quockbooks 2011 for the mac the transition worked perfectly and i have had no problems since intuit did a great job with quickbooks 2011 for the mac to capatilize on the unique features of the mac os,150,223
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,all i want is a webconnector for mac to allow 3rd party integration with qb i was told it would be available soon two years ago surprise on the inuit web site they still say it will be available soon in the forums if you are going to release a product for the mac you need to make it at least as strong or close as the pc verison the ui in the demo is better but still lacking however i still think the programmers are approaching the product from a pc and/or engineer point of view the user experience and the lack of full features make this upgrade hardly worthwhile recommendation wait intuit should not be rewarded for this upgrade,119,224
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,tried to convert from qb pro for windows 2009 to qb for mac 2011 failed even with qb tech supports help followed all the steps the mac version would not accept the same password as the pc version after 30 mins on the phone to tech support in india they told me the only way to migrate would be to remove the password and that i could not do that because i was using cc processing so they would need to conference in the cc processing guys to help me remove my password in the transfer my line got dropped went dead do you ever get the feeling that can i transfer you oh sorry the call got dropped is a standard way for some tech support operations to get customers they can not help off the line the tech support person had taken my number but no-one tried to call me back bottom line i am faced with the choice of keeping a 10 year old pc just to run qb getting a new one just to run it or most likely finding a different product that can do my not complex book-keeping on the mac seems that intuits neglect of mac users is real,204,225
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased this product from jon saul do not purchase from him this product does not come with a registration code and has limited uses of 15 times the product is perfect for what my intended use was however i can not use it because it was not complete with registration code,51,226
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i think it worked better than the 2014 version,9,227
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is the standard right so i followed the crowd and upgraded every couple of years despite the they want how much expense the only problem is that the every version is worse it is more confusing does less that is obvious and easy for someone whose skills are not in accounting and the mac version never did want to sync with my bank or credit cards the end result is that i used it as little as possible and thus my small business accounting data was perpetually out of date when i started my new solo company i signed up with freshbooks instead it updates things immediately it stays as simple as i need and the data is up-to-date without a lot of effort see ya quickbooks i will not miss you,130,228
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick and easy software to help small business owners keep track of their expenses while you do not need to have formal accounting training in order to use this program it probably would not hurt to have access to a real accountant if you are completely without experience we thought we were doing a good job our first year until it was tax time and our cpa made us aware of possible problems / issues that needed to be resolved by no means a result of the software having been faulty just improper use / understanding of it is use on our end it took a good couple of weekends for us to get everything straightened out and we did end up hiring an accountant for a few hours just to help give us some guidance and direction moving forward still use quickbooks to date and satisfied with it,141,229
Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,poor interface with pc products such that when our office changed over to a pc-system we lost all our accounting,20,230

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,instant immersion spanish is a hit for our family i was looking for something for my kids ages 4 - 7 that could be used for independent study i do not know any spanish and this software is a perfect starting point for us the games are fun and even my 4 year old can play all by herself i love the speech practice where it records your voice then plays it back in a word by word comparison with the word spoken correctly the kids are working hard to earn enough points to print out an award for other great early ed product reviews and family posts visit,106,0

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the worst product i have ever bought from amazon i do not recommend it to anybody if you have 30 to waste then you will have more fun burning it than spending on instant immersion software the software looks like it was designed 15 years ago and the jerks at instant immersion have not updated it in 15 years do not buy this crap i tried to install it on my mac and the stupid thing does not install like most other softwares the instructions are pathetic i wish the bozos at amazon would not sell this product i hate it and has setback my learning by several months,109,2
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,old software runs very slowly on my new computer although all the specs say it is compatible also it is too repetitive and the graphics are outdated and really pathetic otherwise it is a nice program for beginners i got bored but if you are new to spanish or want to teach your young children it is a great tool,60,3
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the program is supposed to work with vista but does not after many failed attempts to install making sure sound drivers and computer were updated properly working with topics to come up with a solution and resorting to hiring a professional to attempt to install it the program never installed properly excellent visuals but no sound once you pass the opening screen and enter the talk more section also the interactive dvd which i used on my television froze 10 minutes in topics offers a refund but declares it takes 90 days to do so i do not recommend,99,4

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is probably the worst spanish course i have encountered i have tried five so far and the very best is pimsleur the speaker here gives the impression she is speaking to a five-year-old then there are two discs of just rules with little explanation this company should review the way pimsleur does their their teaching and starting you out with actually talking to another person i was so disappointed in this course glad i got it free at the library instead of buying it i always try to check things out first before buying and am grateful for the internet as i can get other reviews,107,6
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i finally got around to trying this product and it is subpar could not understand the man dictating the words which means quality of the dvds is bad i then went to return to sender and i have passed the window of opportunity darn it wasted money,48,7

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a great way to get started with a new language i use the cd at i go to and from work that keeps the words fresh in my mind the repetition of going through the cd multiple times also helps in retaining conjugation info which is the most difficult for me to retain the lessons on the dvd are very good and allow you to go at your own pace and repeat as needed,76,39

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i had read numerous reviews on this program before i bought it i have had some formal training in the spanish language for work i bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while i am driving to work i have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds i have not utilized the dvds nor the second half however i wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again or this package is great for a person that already has an understanding of the spanish language i think you get a lot of verb conjugation and word usage for the money out of this package and very easy to understand good luck,138,79
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is an easy to use program updates are easy to install and it is a pretty simple program to use,20,80

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the cds provide half the work but the user still has to apply the dedication and consistency to actually learn the language the cds are laid out in a simple format to allow quick learning,35,82
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i would put this product up there with rosetta stone and for the price might be even better wish there were more detailed directions on how mto get the most out of the program which is also my complaint with rosetta stone as with both you have to use them consistently for best results,54,83
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,if you are just looking for a tv type game go for it otherwise a waste of money very disappointed get rosetta stone or sign up at the community college,29,84

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i was sceptical at first but this package definitely helped me improve my spanish still a long way to go but i feel like i got quite far without struggling the box looked a bit cheesy but I am glad i gave it a try had a little trouble working it out at first but worth sticking with,57,86
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,designed to look like rosetta stone but when you receive it clearly it is not the print in the description is so small that is its difficult to discern this fact i suspect this was purposely done to dupe the unwitting amazon will accept it is return but only after i paid the shipping back do not be fooled,56,87
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,there are separate program levels hours of audio content printable picture dictionaries interactive dvd that plays on tb using remote control average retail price 49 there are 4 dvds spanish levels 1 2 and 3 spanish audio deluxe mp3 spanish interactive dvd a spanish cd-rom game level 1 teaches the essential level 2 teaches more complex phases level 3 teaches you more complex phases to learn the language installation instructions are easy you can program you ipad to teach you,80,88

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,instant immersion presents the spanish language in an easy-to-learn manner the games reinforce the lessons students must achieve a certain number of points before going on to the next level my 10-year-old granddaughter loves it and has caught on quickly she did think it was funny that two of the words taught on level 1 are wine and beer but overall i feel teaches a wide variety of common words and phrases I have never tried rosetta stone but instant immersion is way less expensive the set of levels 1 - 3 cost me 30,92,91
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,instant immersion powered by eurotalk spanish levels 1 2 and 3 did not work very well on my mac desktop the discs were freezing and many files refused to open i used this on my main desktop an imac 24 ghz intel core 2 duo os x version 1082 i would not recommend this software if you are planning to use it on a mac i did not bother to try it on a pc pcs frustrate me enough so i am certain that software can not teach me a language on one,90,92

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this was a really good buy you can not go wrong for what it costs you will not feel like you have wasted your money if you are not a real devoted learner we just wanted something we could use when we have the time and ambition even if we only pick up a few common words and phrases it is still worth it if you are more motivated this will keep you going adios,70,95
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,decent exercises but the vocab is random that is my only gripe because it should follow more set categories like textbooks if you are just looking for a supplementary lesson then this is great and definitely worth the 380 or so you save from rosetta stone,44,96
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,the program is well presented it covers the language subject very well it is easy to use and east to understand,21,97
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this was the first product i bought to learn spanish i did no research and saw the cheap price and went for it i tried it and it has very limited material zero grammer rules just phrases and translation that you memorize maybe ok to learn a few phrases but you can find more just online or youtube if anybody is serious about learning spanish identification buy learning spanish like crazy or fsi and professor jason on youtube and if just a couple phrases is what your looking for any youtube spanish channel or phrase book is better also this is spain spanish an I have been focusing on south american spanish,111,98

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the program might be ok but my imac and it did not agree took forever to prepare for operation and then quit suddenly and repeatedly really could not use it,29,103
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i was surprised at the number of interactive dvd s in this set for the price this is a very good buy,22,104
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,a real waste if money there should be some type of manuel to help you with the program i tried to place this in itunes and it would not work this should be very intuitive to use and it is not i hope rosette stone is better,45,105
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this made a great addition to the classes my sister was taking and she was able to ace her test my sons are now listening to this daily i recommend this to everyone I am up next to improve my spanish,40,106

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i just got it and whenever i start the first dvd 1 the programe quite by itself i am really disappointed and i do not recommend it to any one i think i will get rosseta stone,37,108
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,really not very good product nice chart showing how it compares and says even more benefits than rosetta stone but wow this is a very slow non-intriguing software reminds of software from early days of computers worse it seems about two steps ahead of the old cassette learning systems yellow packaging is nice i give credit to their marketing team i hope rosetta is not like this,67,109
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the gift recipient lady likes it very much and is busy at it especially it also seems toto the continental spanish-castillian version,24,110
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i could not wait to recieve this i bypassed my ipod and uploaded it to my amazon cloud this way i can access it anywhere we travel to a spanish speaking country usually every year and I have found this very useful as other reviewers have said it does require that you listen and do the work i do not have any experience with rosetta stone so i can not compare it to that but i can not find any fault with instant immersion spanish,82,111

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have no clue havnet tried it yet bought it for husband for christmas so he can try somthing different while otr trucking,22,116
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,depending on your needs you can begin learning words or phrases immediately the tapes are broken into several categories to help get you started immediately they also incorporate a listening component so that you will learn to say the words accurately,41,117
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,pretty good tutorial but better if you have had some exposure to the language before the games are silly but engaging,20,118
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i my opinion this program is worthless compared to rossetta stone it is a joke the first lessons gave me no help at all,24,119
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,my director of sales is trying to learn to speak spanish and this is an amazing starter tool for her the shipper was fast and the product was great thank you debbie karrer,33,120
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,too much work for me t review the lessons i am not sure how to get into the program i am not that computer savvy,25,121
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this is an unbelievable tool for learning spanish it is easy and fun and way cheaper than rosetta stone i highly recommend it,22,122
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was under the impression this would be similar to the rosetta stone series just at a much more affodable price i was wrong I have only gotten half way through the first disc and it is ok,37,123
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i got this for my son who wanted software for learning spanish i speak spanish fluently as well as english this software is crapware if you want something to help you learn spanish look elsewhere my son after checking it out has never used it further and i do not blame him,51,124
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am learning spanish with this program the choices and different media are very helpful i would recomend using this program,21,125
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it has been said that if you know only one language you do not know that language this wonderful set of learning discs presents a great learning opportunity in an enjoyable format for learning at your own pace in your home if you want learn another language easily this is a great opportunity,52,126
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i was pleasantly impressed with this software i found it to be quite intuitive and easy to follow my kids and i have been able to use this to brush up on our spanish i have not ever tried rosetta stone so i can not speak to the comparison however if you are planning on being able to speak spanish with anyone on a trip with a penpalthis would be a good way to prepare,74,127
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,should be false advertising to compare this to the rosetta stone spanish this has poor audio and the graphics and games are not any better very disappointed,27,128
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have not got to use it yet but is as i expected it to be i have not used it so i can not comment further,24,129
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i purchased this to start learning conversational spanish it is no where near the depth that i was hoping for or that would prove useful in fact most of what i reviewed here i learned in high school spanish 101 it was a good review although w / basics liketravel-related words and more if you need a brief overview of the very very basic words needed to converse then this could work if you are really looking to learn the language then skip it,83,130
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am not a native speaker of spanish so i ordered this and I have played with it once i was able to figure it out i found it to be very simple and easy to use it covers a lot of words and grammar and it offers a way of learning a lot of the basics that for me is very easy it is simple to just click it on play with the software for 20 a day i need a lot more review than many folks so repetition has been necessary for me i like it there are other spanish language packages i do not know how this compares to the others I had give it a b and recommend it to others,122,131
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this was a gift to my grandson he worked with spanish speaking people and wanted to learn conversational spanish i can not evaluate this product,24,132
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am so glad i chose this program to learn spanish i had purchased other programs and had only learned a few words from them the instant immersion spanish proved to be the one that has taught me spanish i feel confident i can carry on some conversations and not feel lost when someone asks me a question in spanish,60,133
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product feels like it was designed for a different era a time when people used to purchase encyclopedias on cd-rom i found the entire program cumbersome and annoying to use in terms of content i feel that there are free alternatives out there that will give you the same benefit this product is not an introduction to the language it is a tool for learning how to ask for the bathroom and how to order a beer you would be better off with a small book or an ios application that performs the same function,96,134
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,hi i did enjoy the cd s but shipping was as much as the product and some of the cd s are not workingthe speaking is wrong at times like no como carne is not how you say i don t eat meatnow is this mexican spanish or spain spanish i don t know what is wrong and what is right i just keep practising i do wish to purchase 4 and 5 but they are so expensive i don t think i will i all i do think your product is good and well packaged thank youmike,90,135
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it seems increasingly important for many individuals to become more familiar with the spanish language after all everyone from the border of mexico down to the tip of south america speaks it there are more spanish speakers in the western hemisphere than english speakers so what is the best way to learn spanish by instant immersion you will learn quickly with the incredible amount of content in this program this is a wonderful course with many different learning methods for you to benefit from if one method does not work try another people learn in different ways so having options in a learning program is very helpful there is always the 6 month guarantee if you do not like the program return it for a refund how can you lose,129,136
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,is this a joke how do i learn from this you are throwing 20 words at me and expect me to learn the no 1 thing in learning a new language is repetition yes that means i should look over the flash cards on my own but i can do that on my own without the software i want the software to help me with this and make it enjoyable how can anyone compare this to rosetta stone you get what you pay for,83,137
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i can not say how bad i found this to be it would not even downfrom the internet the only thing i learned was not to buy anything else from instant immersion,36,138
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,a good low cost alternative to rosetta i downloaded the mp3 audio portion to my smartphone and listen to it back and forth to work i found it helped me more than the computer program in the program both the male and female shake their heads and their lips say yes when you get a right answer but the audio says si would have been so hard to record them actually saying si,73,139
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good learn spanish program it includes a software with six different learning programs on it an mp3 cd i ripped onto my computer then put on my mp3 player a dvd it is more like the second lesson set on the software cd and a game to test you overall it is not bad for a software under 30 if you take full advantage of all the discs i believe you should be very pleased my only complaint would be the case the cds are all stacked upon one another in a plastic case they are also very difficult to get out or at least on my set do not know if everyone is the same so i just grabbed a bunch of empty cd cases i had lying around and put them in there other than the case i do not really have any complaints about this program,148,140
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this software is a joke not only is all the content available on itunes or online for free but the interface and quality is near non-existent i could not run 90 of the program due to getting an error message that my screen resolution was not high enough despite that fact that the resolution on my hd monitor was far in excess of the requirements in addition the mp3 download would notto my iphone an iphone mind you that has zero problems with any other file or software the flashcards worked that is it they were pitiful to say the least terrible art with strange inclusions and omissions i am fairly confident that nobody needs to learn the word for hippopotamus before say book or television or door or house and more not worth 5 let alone 30 if i could give it zero stars i would,140,141
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is quite possibly the worst language program i have ever attempted to use if i could give it zero stars i would i constantly receive error messages despite the fact that i downloaded a patch so it works with my operating system it quits frequently the design is poor it is not worth even 28 no matter how much more expensive rosetta stone is no one should ever dream of substituting this crappy program for that anything is better than this,82,142
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,wow ok i admit that my comparison of online / digital language courses is being compared to rosetta stone but as an educator in general this program is awful they teach you words at random not in word sets verbs are non existent in the beginning phases and the voices and illustrations not photos are boring very elementary in drawing style for 30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you not to learn a language if you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural tested setting online / digitally i would strongly recommend the rosetta stone series i learned more in an hour trial version of rosetta stone than in an excruciating hour of this one this product is very much not recommended for beginners or for anyone who wants to learn spanish or any other language,141,143
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i listen to the lessons in my car wonderful instruction i wish they had a intermediate version worth every penny,20,144
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,designed primarily for beginners despite the claims for intermediate and advanced the talk-back feature does not give you enough time to say what is required and there is no way to adjust this some of the vocabulary is bizzare who needs to know the spanish for zoo animals some of the quiz questions focus on spelling which seems fairly irrelevant to most visitors some quality issues with the cds themselves plus this is european spanish not latin american so lots of lisping involved,83,145
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have been wanting to learn spanish but not sure you should she shall out for rosetta stone this product makes a nice alternative it is not a comprehensive guide to learning the language there has no attempts really to teach grammar or to build a fluency in the language it does however teach a great deal of conversational spanish that you could put to use in real-life situations one thing to note this product teaches spanish with a catalan accent the kind of spanish spoken in spain it is slightly different from the mexican spanish you might be more familiar with,99,146
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,being perceptually impaired learning anything new for me is always a challenge being in the lower income bracket limits my choices of available products to learn from instant immersion accommodates for both without leaving me feeling like i spent too much or overwhelmedinstant immersion spanish levels 1 2 and 3,53,147
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the speaking portion of rosetta stone is overall very good sometimes the feedback to the speaker is frustrating in that it is very picky and arbitrary however i would never use rosetta stone again unless the parent / teacher speaks and writes spanish fluently the student has no chance to learn how to correctly write or speak spanish rosetta stone does not teach grammar they hope the student will learn it through immersion immersion only teaching may work pretty good in very young children but has it is limitations as we age at the very least it would be helpful if they would provide the keys to the worksheets and tests with the answers translated in english,114,148
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i did not find this product easy to use and not very happy with it wishing i had ordered rosetta stone instead you get what you pay for in this case unhappy customer,31,149
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i had a few years of spanish as a teen and speak italian so i got this as a review before going to guatemala for an acupuncture clinical visit it did help me remember spanish but you should know that it focuses on castillan spanish rather than south and central american spanish i am not particularly game oriented but games are used as drills the recording of your own voice really helps in comparing accents at least provided it has the accent that you are going for paired with outreach spanish with audio compact discs the program helped me prepare and at less cost than with the rosetta stone,111,150
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i used to recommend instant immersion to everyone but not any more I have used instant immersion deluxe 20 in the past and it was great much better than rosetta stone at a fraction of the price but this is a completely different product apparently they have bought out eurotalk slapped the instant immersion label on it and discontinued what had been very good language-learning software this is just audio flash cards no grammar no evaluation of your pronunciation although it does let you record yourself and listen to yourself for people who for some reason can not hear their own voices but can hear a speaker on top of that it does not work on windows 7 even although the box says it does i contacted the company and they suggested running in xp compatibility mode furthermore i had contacted the publisher before i bought this product and was assured it was latin american spanish it is not it is cathhhtilian and now the publisher is telling me it is not even available in latin american version which means they lied to me the last time,182,151
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i bought a few different languages from instant immersion much better than the other compnay great visual love the games and the lessons are easy to follow got to have it if enjoy learning a new language you need this for your next adventure in the world,46,152
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this has helped a struggling spanish student tremendously 40 minutes in class a couple of times a week and studying the textbook just was not enough instant immersion was the answer we are very thankful for this software using it for one quarter raised the student 3 grades thank you,49,153
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,was going to purchase rosetta stone so glad i did not spend the money the instant immersion was the way to go after i read the reviews i decided to purchase this program is amazing i have learned more spanish in a week than i ever thought i would do not just think about getting this program just do it this is a fun easy way to learn spanish so glad i found it,73,154
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product does not work on mac osx lion even visited and downloaded patch from support site just does not work sent product back within 20 mins of receiving it,30,155
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,even after downloading a patch available on eurotalkcom the cd will not play correctly on my imac when starting the first exercise i keep receiving an error message super talk error number 13 long integer expected but found something else,40,156
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i ordered instant immersion spanish because it had levels i ii and iii and the promotion compared the product to rosetta stone at a much lower price i thought i could advance quickly to the levels ii and iii with my current knowledge of spanish with this product but it was not for me it does not come anywhere close to rosetta stone which i have seen but have not purchased first it is very basic start to finish and not well done as a language instruction package second the quality of the presentation and organization is very poor and cryptic that is put together cheaply it seems like the videos lessons are out of the 1990s third it does not run smoothly on windows 7 for some reason a little jumpy in the videos yes it is cheap but you get what you pay for in this product and i would not recommend it if you know any spanish at all do not waste your money consider other options which is what i am doing now at an intermediate level,176,157
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my son used this as additional practice while he was taking required language courses over two semesters in college so it was not his only instruction more just a supplement the benefit was worth the investment of time and money he got as in both classes,46,158
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have wanted to learn a foreign this is a great way to start yes true it is not rosetta stone but not everyone can afford it this is a very affordable way to start learning the spanish language try it out it is affordable easy to use and very basic which to me is the way to start learning a new language basic is best you can always move onto a more expensive and extensive program like rosetta stone if you find you enjoy learning spanish and want to continue and become fluent,94,159
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i grew up during a time where french was the primary language taught in schools unfortunately for me spanish is the second language that is needed most in my area of work i once looked up rosetta stone cds but they were soo expensive i nearly cried and promptly forgot about learning espanol i jumped at the chance to learn from these cds and so far so good i love the way the lessons are set up and i love that i can download lessons to listen to on my ipod this is a great way for me to learn spanish while traveling working out or just walking i am loving this language learning program and for the price it can not be beat if you want to learn spanish i would highly recommend instant immersion,135,160
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the interface for this piece of software is really poor the graphics are poor and look like they have not been updated since the 80s the audio is mediocre at best and there is no methodology or pedagogy behind this product if you can learn a language from having words and phrases thrown at you randomly then i suspect this product or any other on the market will do I am sticking to pimsleur and assimil for the time being,78,161
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i can not use the application because it requires higher resolution screen I am using a netbook and the program will not download on a smaller screen so that is kind of disappointing,29,162
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is amateur night for programmers one of their screens seems to have become my default desktop covering all my icons does not show up in task manager and no way to remove it that i can discover even when working between glitches like this it is only so-so and apparently intended for kids only,52,163
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product to anyone it is very childish and i learned nothing i was expecting something a lot more sophisticated not a child level program you are better off buying something else,36,164
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,while the instant immersion people compare their product to rosetta stone this is in a different class and can not really be compared head-to-head however it is so much less expensive that it is a fantastic bargain it does cover the basics and if you are going on a trip in the next few months this is the program I had use it has multiple ways to learn including puzzles and games the production quality is high and there has a lot of material that said there has no grammar manuals or other written reference materials that means that this is focused on spoken spanish if that is what you are interested in then this would be a bargain at twice the price,115,165
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,disk 1 lesson 1 was very good disk 2 does not work in either of my computers i found the web page that mentions there may be a fix for the problem but after trying that the disk still does not work until this is fixed i would not recommend this program,51,166
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,guest reviewer mrs know it all -b well for the money it is a good basic tool to help you learn spanish vocabulary i have worked with rosetta stone language software and do not think this is as structured of courses but for the price who can complain this software teaches you the vocabulary and phrases i did not find the advance conversation lessons to helpful as i think the samples were talking to quickly especially if you are someone just learning the language you need it to be slow some of the games were fun a little hard to figure out sometimes but overall fun i would recommend this product for someone who just wants to learn the basics in a new language and not break the bank doing it,131,167
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,it arrived on time got it for my wife who deals with spanish speakers on the job she has not used it yet,22,168
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is unquestionably the worst software i can remember purchasing in the past 25 years i put my child in front of it with a mic only to discover that it gives you no cues as to when to speak or how to accumulate points are you supposed to speak as soon as theappears and the voice announces the name or when the progress bar appears or after that who knows there is no onscreen guide it is the very model of awful software engineering,87,169
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i purchased this in preparation for a trip to spain in january it is been 30 years since college and high school spanish so i really wanted to refresh my memory and get some basics in before the trip i am having so much fun with the instant immersion spanish i just started and am only at the beginning of level 1 so i can not say how it does in higher levels i love being able to go in and do word practice over and over until i get it and the review games are fun i am anxious to let my 4th 3rd and 2nd grader play along with me also i think they will also really enjoy the games,120,170
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this willon an ipod which makes it easy to use at my age learning a new language is not as easy as it is for a child but this program seems to working it is also far more affordable than the competition give it a try,48,171
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i suck at languages most of the time my english is not all that great and after taking german all throughout grades 8 - 12 i have learned that I am never going to be one of those people that can magically sound like I am speaking another language without sounding like an idiot that being said a family trip was planned for mexico and i did not want to look like a complete tourist while wandering the streets with a dumb look on my face after checking out rosetta stones website i just did not want to invest a weeks salary on learning a new language this product provided me enough to get around without bogging me down with too much information it took me a few times of doing the same exercises but i had figured it would not be an instantaneous fluency i did download the mp3s on my ipod but found myself skipping over most of the lessons and my mind wandering about a minute into listening overall this product helped me out a little bit and the price was right if you really want to become a fluent spanish speaker i do not think this is going to do it unless you are some sort of language magician,203,172
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,contrary to what was advertised the product only included spanish phrases for the ipod and no lecture which are essentially useless by them selves methods of teaching worked well for the pc components but were a little 90s ish,39,173
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i returned this product soon after opening the box the software seems to be a strange and confusing compilation of several different programs packed into one it runs very slowly and freezes up often i could not get the voice recording feature to work and the oscar lake game is outdated and would not run in vista i plan on saving my money and purchasing a more expensive program,69,174
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a decent but not mind-blowing learn-to-speak spanish software package on the positive side it gets you listening to spoken and seeing written spanish the program presents a fairly comprehensive vocabulary that should cover many situations tourists and other new speakers might find them in on the negative side the interface looks decidedly dated and some of the vocabulary might be a bit esoteric for beginners other than that for the price it is a good way to become more familiar with spanish,83,175
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i although it was little to difficult for kids at the young end of the age range advertised it was delived in a timely manner and packaged well but my youngest child was lost on this software however in terms of content it was not as advanced for older kids as i thought it did not teach me anything i did not already know anyway if you are looking for something very basic that comes along with a song that sounds as if only an elevator would be appropriate going down and never stopping,94,176
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,not as user friendly by my expectation but it works,10,177
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,basic spanish could have learned and gotten this from online for free,12,178
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,beats rosetta stone too pricey but this can work,8,179
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is garbage save your money and buy rosetta stone,9,180
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my wife and i have been using this product for a couple of years now we review each time before we travel to a spanish speaking country it will really help getting you through day-to-day when out of the country,40,181
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i used rosetta stone this is nearly as good for the price point,12,182
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was interested in learning to speak the language the program was easy to use but i could not stick with it boring glitchy and hard to figure out the sound difference i could hear i was not saying the words the same but had no guidance to help with the pronunciation difficulties i would not recommend this for someone like me with zero experience with the language,65,183
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,did you ever beat on a garbage can lid with a wooden spoon well that is the sound you get from cakewalks music creator 6 the guitar rythmn sound is also shabby to say the least if you want a good backup music program just invest in band in a box you will be glad you did,56,0
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,well this is not a bad daw i found out after using this that i prefered cubase or sonar which is the upgraded version of cakewalk this is however a good daw to get your feet wet or to record a few mics at one time if you need to work on guitar parts you will need nothing more than this my needs have grown greatly and can not use this anymore but for the starter or small studio i do recommend this or cubase le,84,1
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,because my new samson go mic has bundled cakewalk software i decided to try cakewalk music creator 6 this software is a disaster in stability the bundled software was just as bad i got to use music creator 6 only twice before it continued to come up with an error message stating that the one exe file that opens up the whole thing was missing i must have uninstalled and re-installed this software six times on my computer and cleaned up everything involved with this program short of causing problems for other programs on my computer also customer service was terrible cakewalk needs to spend more time trying out their own software with various computers and operating systems and looking for problems rather than focusing on the art of rigid programming rules musicians do not want to waste time with programming musicians want to create cakewalk should either fix these problems or take a walk do you get it cakewalk i was with this software and oh this is mild commentary as I have had two weeks to cool off a bit i sent it back to amazon for a credit thank you amazon for your graciousness,196,2
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i did not know if mc 6 would work on my laptop it works fine and will probably meet my needs when i get some additional gear and time to use it all,32,3
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this is a great music arranger at a very low price point there are many instruments available and you can interface with actual midi capable instruments,26,4
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,it is great fun it would be much better i had were more knowledgeable about computers and more though overall i am learning how to use the program as i play a digital piano for the price it has a multitude of capabilities for me the tough part is mastering the software i have a granddaughter that loves to record her own songs I had never tell her that she needs to work on her singing it is just great fun,74,5
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,because i got music creator 5 on one of my anther computers but this program u can touch and it have everything u need to produced ur music yes it is professional,30,6
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,i bought this software thinking i could use it to record songs it will not take my guitar input even although it is running through a very good usb device I have only been playing since 1966 and working with computers since they came out i have decided that it was worth the 32 dollars just to gain the knowledge that cakewalk is way to complicated for normal people,67,7
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,great fun i had the advantage of my brother tutoring me on a previous version there are also some nice online tutorials it will certainly take a long time to learn everything but i was able to import and edit sounds for my avant garde music class immediately i can not tell you anything about what ever is normally in these kind of programs but for me it was awesome especially at this price,73,8
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,uninstalled it was getting errors runtime errors with windows 80 pro so i upgraded to windows 81 pro from windows 80 pro but still had runtime errors uninstalled it and errors went away but i had my magix music software install no problems i stay with my magix products they work great and are easy to use,57,9
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,this is somewhat an extensive program that you will have to do some study on to utilize all the features,20,10
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i had tried another software and hated it this was just what i need to compose and record my music,20,11
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,product worked fine then got a free upgrade to music cretor 6 touch having issues and quirks where program now freezes up or is not responsive or needs to be forced shut because of one thing or another need to find help to find the fix to this issue also basic knowledge of the program would be very usefull since all the tutorials are not as simple as one would hope,70,12
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,the music creator 6 is very cool i use it on my music prodjects i can not stop use it it cool,21,13
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,one of the best things is the vidio tutorial caught me up to date quick i was using music creator 3 and jumped to 6 but for the price this works great it takes a little while to find everything but for recording with an interface module you can be recording tracks in a couple of hours i have experience in recording from reel to reel to daws to computers I am having fun with this one thanks cakewalk stvy d,79,14
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this product is always providing new avenues of creativity in my music recording i am constantly surprised by the avenues of creativity it presents i recommend it for any beginning artist,31,15
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,do not buy this first of all i spent hours just trying to get the notes to not skip there has a latency menu that you have to look online by good luck and change to correct this it should have been adjusted from the factory then you can not just go to sharps and flats on a laptop unless you have a mouse then I am not sure if it works or not the old music creator was far better then menus and windows on this are awkard and non user friendly i think I am going to look up an older version of cakewalk music creator on ebay one star because there has not an option for no stars,113,16
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,I am actually reviewing music creator 7 anyway i have been fooling with it for 3 months now and i do not like it for one thing the tech support is some of the worst I have ever encountered the product is not intuitive and the in-program help is not helpful neither is the cakewalk forum i have used earlier versions of cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers but this program just is a constant headache plus all the samples and clips that come with it are trash they are all house and electronica type stuff i do not see anything in the midi library and very little in the audio library that i would ever want to use but that is ok because i have not been able to get the latency down to a reasonable delay anyway not recommended,138,17
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,may be is not your fault but i have a yamaha dgx-640 connected to the computer and i do not get no sound on the music creator 6 i followed all the directions from the creator but nothing i could use some help thanks alexndru davd,46,18
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,if you are a musician like me and a recording artist you will like this software the program is simple and the software is so easy to use upon plugging in my electronic keyboard to the usb along with my microphone i can record and create songs right on my computer sa-weet,52,19
Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,i spend more time being pissed at this program for latency bulls when trying to lay down more than one track at a time not to mention the crackling that never appears at the same spot in playback and recording and whenever it happens when trying to record vocals over my guitar it messes that entire vocal section up all i wanted was something that could let me lay down guitar vocals and drums in separate tracks i have a xenyx q802usb behringer to manage my eqs and i do not care much about midi so that whole part of the program is useless to me this is the first recording software I have ever tried outside of audacity and i was kinda expecting that since i was actually paying for it that it would come with a decent manual and do a good job handling my recording ha waste of my money and my time,153,20
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,although i am no expert in this field i have found a few bugs in the program but so far exporting the audio and re-importing it has solved all the issues i have ran into i have no real experience with other audio recording software other than light use of audacity and an older cakewalk home studio 9 i do wish it had better tools for mixing but it does plenty for it is price,74,21
Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,this may work well but it is complicated i have not made it work well for me the reviews said it was easy but i did not find it that way,31,22
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,this product works well unlike other reviewers i had no problems with installation or hangduring and a new computer windows 8 16 gig ram user interface is easy and intuitive and the results are acceptable this is not the highest end video processing software but it works well and is fantastic at this price point will outperform any software from 5 years ago at any price having played with various programs for about 15 years i am amazed at how my capability the new software has recommended,87,0
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,the sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned it gets better after a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software you are presented with an intuitive interface there are a good number of resources for help in using it starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration the manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer it was not difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips most of it is just drag and drop cutting is easy moving samples around is also very easy there are a huge number of transitions effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy less is more all of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product the usual capabilities exist adding audio recording voiceovers and so on in spite of this the software is not that cumbersome on system resources importing and exporting is straightforward as well this is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with four stars,189,1
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,purchased downloaded version today which turned out to be 4 executable files installation of all 4 gave back successfully installed messages upon opening pinnacle studio 17 plus software the settings defaulted to searching my hard drive automatically for all potential content to build a library from problem experienced is software has now hung on trying to build this auto library from years upon years thousands of jpegs music files video files pinnacle studio 17 plus is now inoperable and only shows the rotating circle status symbol same behavior after repeated close and restarts am unable to go into settings libraries tabs nada,102,2
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,i use this software to edit a small web series there are few special effects but it does well with small things integrating a car chase and animation in my case this software is a vital tool for clarifying picture andon a budget i run windows 8 enterprise on a lenovo all-in-one and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues which corel always did to me if you have simple projects that do not require a whole lot of special effects this is a good budget program and i definitely recommend it,97,3
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i already had a bad experience with pinnacle studio 17 ultimate and found it too difficult to use it is no good for anyone other than someone who has an expert video editor i decided to give it a 2nd shot with pinnacle studio 17 plus and could not even get the software to install i tried several times restarted my computer and more and the installation would not run i saw others comment that they were able to install the software by doing it in pieces but i would not even know where to begin with that ps my computer does meet all the requirements listed on the box,107,4
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after getting past some install issues with windows 81 i found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I have used in the past such as windows movie maker or imovie the ui was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features frankly i just do not have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink i spent on it,80,5
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i tried again and again to get this software installed on my windows 8 desktop by all normal means and it just was not going to happen the cd just would not run i was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up one-by-one by exploring the disc files i had to install them in bits and even that was not entirely successful i could not get all of this product installed on my computer so i was only able to try out portions of it although what i did get installed does seem to be working the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others,119,6
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,pinnacle studio 17 plus is an easy to use program that is great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software but users do not have to be an expert to get good results it is fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features installation was easy as well and ran with no difficulties although it took about 20 minutes to complete i was most interested in the live screen capture feature but it was a bit difficult to find users are required to look for it in program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it despite that small flaw live screen capture works well most of the time for instance it will capture video from minecraft flawlessly but I have had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games all around pinnacle studio 17 plus does a good job with minimal effort,154,7
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,yes i now have two pinnacle products that i should never have purchased the other one is the studio 17 ultimate what was i thinking the product performed before par and i found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what i wanted it to which is to help me edit photos simple right that is what i thought after the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems i had with studio 17 and being charged to get support i just gave up there are so many other programs out there that are far superior than pinnacle systems i would suggest going to your local best buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person no charge to compare programs to your needs that is what i did after i through this in the garbage along with the studio 17 sorry pinnacle this was my last purchase with you,155,8
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after trying and liking pinnacle studio 17 i was looking forward to giving studio 17 plus a try but there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it as many others have pointed out installation takes hours a process that data mines every media file on your computer with no way to opt out i work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no i do not need to get bogged down in every file i ever processed each time i want to create something new the learning curve is steep on this the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly and as others have noted be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating I shall keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors,180,9
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,compared to adobe premiere elements which costs the same this software blows it away in terms of features and capability i was using premiere elements for years but often got frustrated by the limited number of adjustments that i could me sure premiere elements let me run automatic adjustments with lightingcorrections and scene transitions but when i wanted to get fancy this software became limiting with pinnacle studio i am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than abode more scene transitions and I am able to tweak my videos in ways i never could before so far I am really enjoying this software after 3 weeks I am still discovering more that it can do some people noted the difficult installation i would not call it difficult i would call it time consuming but this i expect with any professional level video editing software these installations are huge especially with all the features macros effects and more that it installs also a strong processor is important when rendering videos i recommend 2 or 4 cores,174,10
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,my video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use it did take a while tobut it is a large software package pros easy layout of basic features lots of options / templates for a quick start and consistent appearance great 2d and 3d rendering quick processing good interface cons snails pace install large software needs a fast processor or you lag a bit more advanced features are a little quirky to use steep learning curve if new to this program good program over all it is a nice platform and highly recommended,105,11
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,this program is overly power hungry and takes 5 to 10 minutes to do the simplest things moreover it takes as long as 12 hours to import / ready even a 15 minute video for editing i do not recommended this program for the average user looking to make a quick home vodeo,51,12
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,found it confusing it kept adding things to the video and there no instruction on how to get rid of them i switch back to the old version of pinacle studio,31,13
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,good to have a 64 bit version of software i have used for years,14,14
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,it is good so far just testing it out to make sure it does not have any hang,18,15
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,i tried to upgrade fro ps2 to use my zoom q2hd but this program would not recognize my device for screen capture no matter what i did i went to nch videopad which works just fine adios pinnacle you were a good old hoss once upon a time,48,16
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,it is a very good program intuitive interface and quite functional truth fulfills it is purpose and reduce my ping more than half without any problems maybe how to select game server could be improved to make it more friendly to the user view and outside it is an excellent program,50,0

Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,I have been using wtfast for a while now and i like the program for 2 reason 1 wide options to get the best results 2 great customer service what else would a person want people who are complaining that they are not getting results probably do not know how to get them but surely they are there i connect to a server in canada with a 330ms and get a 185ms on best days and 200 on bad days but the connection is alwats stable so it is very useful,91,7
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,being from sydney australia my average ping to any us / canada based servers is 300ms wtfast brings my ping down to 220 - 240ms which is a 20 improvement this is significant i primarily play mmorpgs and shooters where every millisecond counts it means the difference between landing that raid saving heal getting that agro skill off or firing that all important crit that just procd or not those that are in the know are fully aware of how and why ping matters and use wtfast i now use it for all gaming including steam and origin based games,96,8
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,great product it decreases my ping i tried the trail a year or two ago and i absolutely enjoyed it my ping was constantly low even lower than y lowest ping while using wtfast this is not a tool where it makes it look like your ping is down it actually does improve it but it might not work for everyone a few have already said that it does not work for them so yea,74,9
Software,B00UG9IXGI,4.0,positive,my isp has routing issues that result in a triple digit ping to servers that are only 190 miles from my home wtfast lowers my ping from 110ms to 18ms on those servers where my isp does not have routing issues i see improvement but only by 12 - 15 percent,49,10
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,love the lowered ping i can say it at least lowered my ping in games by 20 and while some might say that is terrible that 20 can be the difference between me getting something off successfully or not in gaming every little bit counts,44,11
Software,B00UG9IXGI,5.0,positive,hello wtfast is a perfect product in all ways and forms i live in rural canada with fixed wireless internet and my ping usually hovers around a good 250 when I am in a game of league i decided to give wtfast a try and it blew my mind when my ping actually dropped to an average of 210 i decided to give premium a try and now i play league with a decent 180 ping per game it also solved my packet loss problem too thanks so much for creating an amazing product it was worth the money devi,100,12
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,i have not noticed any improvements after using wtfast and i normally play with 110 ping did not work for me but i know some friends that have noticed improvements while using it your mileage will vary,36,13
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,no reason to purchase if you have major isp,9,14
Software,B00UG9IXGI,1.0,negative,double the price and worse service than before,8,15

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,with no tax and free shipping it is a bargain certainly will not compete with a 500 mountain bike but it is great for riding around my somewhat hilly neighborhood bike has a good appearance comes shipped in double packaging for protection note the factory installed the handlebars at an incorrect angle nothing in the instructions said to fix it but you figure out pretty quickly that you need to rotate the handlebars for the gear shifters to be in the right position,80,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,first off i was happy when i noticed the dual-boxed shipping that was done to help keep the bike from getting scratched then after pulling the bike out of the box i noticed some nice scrapes on the fork of the bike from where the handle bars were hanging when it was shipped also on further inspection i found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well also after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight i noticed that it was way off basically it wobbles fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if i understand correctly this should not have come like that in my opinion this may get shipped back to amazon at this rate also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears i appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on at least do it right,170,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,package came extremely fast bike was easy to put together the suspension is great it is a well made bike for the price,23,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,it is an amazing bike and i am pretty happy with the purchase would have given it 5 stars except that it requires allen keys and a spanner for assembly which took me over a week to get as i do not have a car so if you are planning to just get a bike and start riding try the nearest target store or if you want quality get this one little expensive but trusty bike frm mongoose letitsnow,83,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was very happy with my purchase the bike came in a double box and did not have a scratch on it i found it was easy to assemble and only needed a quick brake adjustment and air in the tires for me to be off and riding the aluminum frame makes the bike light and the shifting was smooth this is a great value for the price,68,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,if i can figure out how to put the thing together it would probably be nice,16,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,considering that my next-door bike shop was selling something similiar for over 350 i suppose this a great bargain if you are not a pro i think you will like the bike as well since it does exactly what it is supposed to assemblying was super easy and i was using the bike just 1/2 hour after receiving even if instructions are not provided anyway remember this is a cheap bike so you might consider having it checked at your local bike shop to get brakes and gears tuned up it usually takes 1 hour of labor-,94,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,this bike is kind of hard to put together instructions are not the best the ride quality is average it is good for just getting around town i would not go mountain biking with this bike good bike to buy on sale,42,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i purchased this bike a short time ago i have been trying to assemble it for 3 days now the pictures do not look anything like the bike after i finally assembled it on pure instinct the front brake was difficult to adjust but i managed the back brake is broken and needs to be replaced i think the shifting unit was not factory assembled properly i had to take the shifting unit apart as well as take the back tire off of the bike and re-assemble it for it to even function now that it is functioning i am trying to adjust it to shift properly i guess that was too much to ask because it is still not working properly however the bike looks awesome i can not wait to finally be able to ride it although it will probably be snowing by then,146,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,this bike is very poor quality and i would not recommend as an example the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way it was not worth the hassle to return for another as a relacement might have been worse and cost us more to get it tweaked by a professional after assembly than the bike cost I shall never buy another mongoose what a waste of money,88,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,well i loved the bike at first i was able to put it togehter easy enough and loved it for the first month i rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months the brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter the rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy i thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed so if you need a weekend warrior this is the bike for you amazon has always been the best internet shopping site please do not refer the rating of mongoose products to any afliates of amazon,142,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,bike is good for casual riding use it extensively on the weekends and it is great this is the first bike that i own and i was able to put it together and tune it up i do minor work on my car so that may help keep in mind that when you get the bike not everything will feel right out of the box you will need to use it for a week or two to tweak out the minor details seat position / height brakes gear shifter wheel alignment just keep your tools handy,93,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,this is the best bike i found in the low end price range i would suggest to anyone who purchases this bike to take it to a bicycle shop and have it professionally fine tuned and have them finish the assembly for you it really made a difference and for safety it is the best way to be sure the bike is operating at it is best the man at the bicycle repair shop i took the bike to agreed this is the best bike you can buy for the price i purchased this bike for my fourteen year old and he is very happy with it,106,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,seems to be a good bike although it is a bit heavier than others i have the seat is comfortable and the shocks are good and it looks sharp i did have trouble with the gear but mongoose reacted quickley and sent be a replacement the assembley is difficult and instructions are unclear but a good bike,57,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i did not like the handling of the bike itself the steering seemed a bit off the quality of the bike itself is just ok the price is the real attractor for buying it,33,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,very well made bike well worth the price too bad it did not have disk brakes because it would make it better otherwise it is an excellent bike,28,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,lightweight and unique beyond our expectations arrived in quick amount of time in good condition this bike was an excellent purchase and the price was extraordinary especially with free shipping and extra off i would purchase another if i can get the same deal as i did on this one we are very satisfied with this bike,58,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i bought it for my 12 years old daughter this mountian bike is much better than i expected vert strong and very light top quality my 12 years old daughter can carry it consider i only paid for less than 70 for this one similar bikes in our local stores are selling at 150 it is a real great deal for a top quality product my daughter liked it very much thanks amazon,73,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,got this during the holiday wish list promo really wanted an xbox 360 but got this for 30 so obviously I am thrilled as it was dirt cheap as far as the quality of the bike i have only used it ride in my neighborhood no mountain use the bike assembled pretty easy make sure you have got some allen wrenches had to get a new seat due to the fact I am 230lbs but I am happy with it the gears are kinda rough to shift so i mainly keep it in the same gear i think if you want it for light exercise then it is great otherwise you may want to spend more if you are looking for a real mountain bike,117,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i purchased this bike when it was on special the day of thanksgiving this bike is awesome especially for the price i paid,23,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,pretty easy to assemble sturdy and easy to ride for the price you can not beat it,16,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,this is a decent bike but is not heavy duty and needs some retuning after a good day on the trails the chain slipped a couple of times after steep climbs and the rims need to be trued i weigh about 165 lbs so ymmv,45,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i bought this bike for my son for christmas he loves it he says the suspension is great he is 14 and 64 tall so it has been a challenge to find something comfortable for him,36,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,fun for the 30 i paid for pedal broke off a small jump,13,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i would say it was bad decision although i got it under 100 that is why i give one more star the box was open when i got it the rear reflector was broken in addition the front gear never shifts to 3 i did not want to spend extra 25 to fix the problem so I am enjoying full 14 speeds now oh one more in my opinion the bike has bad seat cushion,74,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,the bikes seat post was too short other than that the bike is great,14,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i received this bike for christmas only two minor comlaints 1 the tires were not inflated completely this may be standard on bikes although I am not sure 2 the front brakes were not adjusted properly but it was an easy fix the manual was easy to read the gears were already assembled which is a huge plus,55,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,got this bike from amazons customer vote program it was easy to assemble the bike even when i did not read the manual at all the bike itself was very sturdy and easy to handle can not beat a good deal,41,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,the bike is good but it does not come with the tools that u need to assemble it i did not know that everything u buy online needs to be assembled i got the bike on discount during the cool deals and it costs almost the same if u assemble it at a bike shop quite inconvenient when you do not have time,60,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,for 30 i figured I had buy it and donate it to toys for tots i had nohow difficult it would be to get this thing assembled and adjusted and several hours later wish I had never bought it,39,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,this bike is impressive looking unfortunately unless you are an expert bicycle mechanic you probably should look elsewhere the components of the bike are fairly cheap and getting the bike to work out of the box will consume many many hours of time getting it operational the brakes used on the bike are of very low quality and should be replaced before operating in addition the gears that come with the bike are also of extremely low quality and will need major adjustments in order for basic use other than the brakes and the defailleurs the other components are of average quality and perform as expected bottom line is the frame and tires of this bike what you would expect for a bike in this price range unfortunately unless you are very experienced at adjusting and/or replacing brake mechanisms and derailleurs there are simpler higher quality choices available elsewhere,149,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,oh i feel very bad of buying this bike i bought this bike during the amazon thanksgiving deal for 60 the bike came in a very heavy box and i moved the box into the living room and started assembling damn there is no manual which says which part goes where the product description says requires only minimal assembling but even to do that you at least need a manual i unpacked it and had noon how to put things together got very upset so i put the things in the box again and moved it to a corner of my living room it has been sitting there for a while i saw lots of screws and small broken parts in the package i have nowhat all these totally wasted 60 so only if you have a complete bike assembling kit have patience to spend at least 3 hours and of course able to assemble it by youself without having any manual then go for it from the previous reviewers it seems that it is not a great / sturdy mountain bike so be careful before buying i am totally upset with this,194,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i purchased this bike for 60 from the amazon vote deal and am very pleased with the purchase i tried to put it together myself but failed miserably and ended up taking it to the local campus bike shop to get it put together and tuned up for only 15 best 15 i ever spent it only took them an hour and it took me over 2 hours just trying to figure out the directions the bike is very lightweight and rides smoothly i will only be using it to bike to / from campus so i am very pleased with the purchase i am a 53 105 lb female and it fits me fine great bike for college students,118,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,bought this bike during the big sale i have several bikes and am a pretty good bike tuner [ ] fortunately the bike was fine assembly went smothly unfortunately this bike has very poor quality parts brakes wheels shifters and more if you need to get a cool bike for around [ ] get one of these but make sure it comes from a store that can work with you on set up forget being able to adjust the brakes or gears yourself basically this is a childs bike made to look like an adults bike I am 5 foot 10 inches and this bike is way too small spending money on a bike like this is a waste of time [ ],118,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,this is probably the best i have ever owned great bike great price bike is well made and very durable,20,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,first off this is a good working bike there is a little noise when on higher gears but other than that the ride is smooth and stable amazon shipped the bike quickly and it arrived within three days after the order as mentioned in earlier reviews the handlebars wheel seat and pedals need to be assembled no big problems except for front brake adjustment they are cantilever brakes so just take them apart make sure you put the wheel in center squeeze and tighten it took me a while to adjust but if you have assembled bikes before it will take less than 30 min no complaints other than setup and that i have to carry it up and down two flights of stairs every day on my way to work -d,130,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,received my shinning new bike excitement opened the box assembled the parts inflated the tires checked the chain joy mounted it for my first ride emotion put my feet on the pedals fresh air good weather at 75f happiness started pedaling suddenly loud crack what the fuck something fell off pedals loosed the ride stopped now sadness anger rage damn what happened is that the rear derailleur sram 30 simply broke for no reason I am a 57 185 lbs non-athletic couch potato and there has no way i could have caused this breaking by just pedaling check the images i uploaded of the broken derailleur customers images this is definitively a case of bad quality plastic components used in an expensive product I have seen cheaper bikes at local retailers wmt tgt kmt with better shimano components now who i have to direct my complaints to amazon mongoose sram who has going to respond for it,151,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was surprised at how easy it was to put the bike together mostly everything is pre-assembled putting together the bike only took about 15 to 30 mins with the right tools it probably will take about 1 to 2 hours to tune the brakes pads and adjust the heights not a big deal for a nice bike,58,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i order this bike online from amazon and less than 5 days i have recieved the bike in the box 2 boxes the bike is a brand new and excellent condition nothing else is damaged which due to the shipment this bike is very light weight about 35 pound or less after completely assymble and it is very easy to do assymbly too,63,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,received bike ahead of schedule packing was great bike undamaged assembly was a snap no surprises no problems bike fit was ideal did minor adjustment to brake pads seat derailers and bars aired up tires to spec nothing unexpected bike rides great for the price more than i could have asked for great deal great service great product would recommend for anyone looking for a great all around bicycle love it,72,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,the bike came well packaged and was easy enough to put together i would recommend getting the bike fully tuned after putting it together or have a professional put it together unless you trust whoever partially assembled it before shipping the chain sticks sometimes when you are trying to shift gears but this has not given me too many problems and it is not like the chain falls off just if you are switching from 5 to 4 it does not switch right away sometimes overall very pleased for the price oh and get a comfortable seat,94,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,the only nice thing about this bike is it is dual suspension but you can have that with most bike manufacturers i believe that mongoose has gone downhill in regards to the quality of their cycles the brakes had to be fixed twice and the wheels replaced all in a period of two months,53,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,unfortunatly this bike came with two fist sized holes in it one had bent the rear shifter the other had slightly bent the front rim the bike itself is fantastic i am 5 foot 11 inches and it is just a tad small for me but it has a smooth ride my only complaint is that the gear ratios are heavily biased torward uphill biking which makes going around town a bit slower i am dissapointed with amazons shipping but the bike is great all around seems very durable a pleasure to ride i give it four stars because the shipping has made tuning this bike a very long and difficult process,111,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,it was easy to assemble even if i still have to fix gears and brakes that were mounted upside down i did not use it yet because it was way too cold here in new york city,34,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,i just finished assembling looks cool i am no expert with bikes but i feel that speed shift and duel suspension front / rear are working as expected it may be a little early to comment on durability but you can not expect a 500 bike for 140 my wife also felt comfortable riding it esp with the free bells gel fusion seat can you belive i paid only 170 for bike gear helmet 5 kryptonite lock and pump gel cushion shipping,82,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,this bike is horrible the front shocks do not even work and neither the rear shocks no wonder why it is so cheap for christmas i got a marin rift zone which is an amazing bike but it costs alot but the marin has manitou front shocks and fox rear shocks with great disk brakes if you are serious about mountainn biking like i am get a real full-suspension bike like a marin iron horse kona or santa cruz,73,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,4.0,positive,first this is a branded bike made by a firm called pacific cycle pacific cycle mass produces bikes and sells them under a variety of names including mongoose through variety of retailers that is not necessarily a bad thing it just depends on what you need this bike is perfect for riding around town it is light reasonably durable and comfortable I have owned it actually i own the walmart version which is virtually identical for nearly 3 years and have not had any serious problems or defects i primarily use it in an urban setting roads sidewalks curbs pot holesand occasionally take it through parks and bicycle trails the bike excels at these uses but i would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious off-road / trail bike it just is not made to withstand that kind of stress in short if you want a real off-road bike go to a bicycle shop and pay 400 dollars but if all you need is a bike to get around town then buy this one,171,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,i have had this bike for over a month now it seemed to be working well initially but i would not recommend it to anyone who is planning too ride the bike off-road th gears need to be tweaked one of the peddle broke literally split in two and i never dropped the bike or anything so can not say much about the quality it is also heavy so do not expect to be biking uphill in this but if you want a bike to ride in flat terrain for a mile or so every day then it is not bad,103,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,bike is terrible but looks cool amd came at a good price the seat is way too uncomfortable rear brakes have come undone 3 times so far bike gets loose at major points must tighten on a weekly basis handlebars seat postwould not but again in the future should get a refund or some kind of credit 11,64,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,i was going to give it 4 stars as i had to change the seat but that is my fault for buying a mans bike and I am a woman it is a very comfortable ride seat withstanding and was just what i was looking for nice and sturdy and very easy to put together,52,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,when i was a kid i was extremely angry at my father because he would not buy me a mongoose dirt bike i guess i still have a bit of a grudge because 20 years later i decided to finally get my mongoose while this is not a bike that i would choose to scale denali in let us be serious i am not going to scale denali on any bike it is a tremendous bike for the price it came double boxed and was in great shape i only had to do a few simple steps and i was riding i did have to adjust the brakes and gears a bit but i do not know much about bikes and it was really easy the bottom line is that this bike is easy to ride looks cool and does not cost much,140,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,the bike came double boxed with not a scratch on it had some difficulty with putting it together due to the fact i did not have any hex wrenches that big 8 mm and 11 mm are needed but a quick trip to wal-mart solved this problem oh the wrench set was 099 i pumped up the tires and was on my way the bike handles great and have no problems with the performance i will definately buy another one of these for my wife or give her this one so i can have the newer one,95,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,this is a nice pouch that i wanted to try for conceal carry it fits my taurus 709 and s w 642 the only thing i do not like is that it does not have a built in holster just a separate compartment and they use velcro to hold it closed which makes alot of noise when opening it i use this now and then when i do not want a fanny pack on i have no real complaints about it except the velcro i think it should of had a zipper one for each section that is why i gave it 4 stars and i would still recommend it to others,108,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,always looking for conceal carry options had one of these years ago and loved it found it again on amazon a must buy for conceal carry of sub-compact or 5-shot revolver highly recommend this piece of equipment,37,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,i have had this holster pouch for three years the other day while out shopping one of the plastic belt loops ripped off where the plastic attaches to to the pouch the pistol i was carrying was a colt mustang pocket lite the holster did not get snagged on anything that would of caused this defect for conceal carry i want and expect better quality than this this is an expensive holster for what you get i will not be purchasing another product from this company my sneaky petes work the best,93,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,works fine a little large than i expected,9,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,uncle mikes use to make a quality pouch holster I have had 3 of them over the years but this last one i bought failed after just over a years use when the rubber belt loop broke not recommended,37,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,after a very short use with a 135 oz ruger lcr in it one of the plastic belt loops broke right in the center of the loop these loops should be made of the same cordura material or leather these weak plastic loops make this an inferior product,48,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,after 6 months belt loop rubber splint in and broke and company did not get back with me aboutuncle mikes i thought was high rated company in customer service they are not would not recommend buying from them,39,6

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,cheap rubberlike belt loop broke the first time i wore it,11,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,at first it appeared to be just what i needed after no more than 20 minutes of use the belt loops broke i do not recumbent it at all very poorly made do not let the name uncle mikes fool you it is made in vietnam,43,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,poorly constructed the rubberized attachment on the back that is meant to slide your belt through is sewn on with a single thin little piece of thread which ripped the very first time i used it also the rubber piece cracked and ripped in half apparently because it is so dry like old rubber can get sometimes I am in the process of attempting to return it if i can,68,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,works well i carry my phone wallet and some other small stuff i use everyday i do not think the plastic belt loops on the back will hold up if they break i will make new loops from an old nylon dog leash and sew them myself i am working out of state so i have not tried my s and w air weight but it looks like it will fit fine,71,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,i do not like thisbecause it is to big,9,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,broke as soon as i put it on my belt,10,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,it is a simple if not elegant way to carry a gun comfortably concealed it looks like a fanny pack or camera bag and even has room for extras it is not fancy but it works,35,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,belt loops broke nice pouch poor belt loops hope they redesign belt loops the could be just a little above center two too help prevent sagging forward to bad i did like the pouch but poor quality loops make it almost useless,42,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,very good carry option requires a belt heavy enough to carry theput into the packit heavy and you need a heavy belt easy to open well made,31,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,big enough to hold my walther pps40 with extended mag also good for carrying lots of vacation accessories passports cameras cell phones,23,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,this pouch is very nice fits my pt145 snugly and has room in front for other items however all the good features are for naught as the belt loops are chintzy and tear loose easily thus rendering a otherwise very nice belt pouch into a clutch purse do not bother buying this to wear on your belt it will not last long,60,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,this is a neat design and just what i was looking for but after only a few days of wear wore it on weekends only one of the belt loops tore in half i am four days beyond when i can return / exchange it so i am stuck uncle mikes products are always top notch so i am surprised at having a critical part break which makes the pak useless,69,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,thisis pretty good i purchased it to carry a pt145 and it fits ok mine has a laser mounted on it so i am unable to close the velcro section that is made to hold your firearm all of the way with out a laser mounted i think that you could it is well made and unlike others it is not overlay large,64,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,1.0,negative,have had two of these pouches used to carry glasses phone and more first one lasted 2 months before belt loop broke after several emails phone calls a replacement arrived the belt loop broke on the first usage like theneeds design change,43,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,you have to remove your belt to put it on if it had snaps for quick removal it would be perfect,21,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,my handgun is a small ruger 380 and it fits in this pak it appears to be a fanny pack and i put my cell phone in the outer pocket i was not able to find anything like this in my area my gunshop or cabellas so it is perfect,50,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,2.0,negative,the straps on the case that you put your belt through are made of rubber and did not take much to break if they were leather it would be more durable,30,24

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,i have a ruger lcr 38 with hogue grip laser it fits very well in this uncle mikes bag it has a small separate pouch on the outside of the bag that nicely holds two 5 star firearms speedloaders in interior of the bag has two compartments one for storing your piece in a concealed compartment and another if you want to carry identification or something like a small camera the ruger lcr is a fine handgun and conceals well there are times it is more comfortable to carry the lcr in the uncle mikes or I am wearing attire where the handgun is not fully concealed there are also times i carry the bag and do not belt it it works well for that too if you have a ruger lcr and chl you can not go wrong with this bag,137,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,5.0,positive,nice fanny pack for your small revolver perfect size for a s w j frame outside pocket will hold a small mp3 player or cell phone not large enough for a smart phone the inside is devided into 2 compartments one with a velcro closier for the weapon the other for identification smart phone or any similar size items does not come with a belt the belt loops will support a belt as wide as 2 3/8 inches,73,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,i purchased the uncle mikes off-duty nylon pouch for my son for hunting purposes it performed very well for him it was easy to access and held all the essentials that he needed i would definately purchase another if the need arose,42,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009UXFR6,4.0,positive,i received thisbelt pouch holster as a birthday gift it fits my semiauto compact pistols like the taurus milpros pt140 pt145 taurus 24/7 c ds 9mm/40 sw/45 acp great however it is too small for the pistols with 4 barrels like the ruger sr9 and the taurus 24/7s full size it can hold one of my compacts in the back holster and still has plenty of room for 2 or 3 mags in the front without printing it might not be the best but i would say it works very well for ccing the compact pistols the good things are it does not look obvious as other cc pouches it is made of durable material and it is not too big on my belt fyi the dimensions of my taurus compact pistols are hxwxl 5125x125x6125 inches this pouch holster fits any one of them like a glove i do not think it will fit bigger pistols,154,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,soak these in water and place in the refrigerator until you are ready for them they work great for visiting theme parks and other outdoor activities when you are done rinse thoroughly to remove sweat and let them air dry it takes 2 to 3 days for them to dry completely then you can store them until needed again i would not put them in the washer and dryer,69,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,very disappointed there is some chemical on this product that gave me quite a bad reaction it caused insomnia hyperactivity and a skin eruption like i get when a chemical has me overloaded it is a greatbut since it is not washable to get this chemical off they will go to someone less sensitive than i,57,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i was placing a lot of hope in these bandanas helping me make it through the t-ball games there are cool to the touch but sweating did not seem to activate them it just was not cool enough to cool me down at all if you put them in the refrigerator it was much better but they did not stay that cold for long in my opinion they blocked the breeze when there was one,73,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,these things work great i put mine in a plastic cup withwater and wring it out just before my workout at the gym after one hour it still cools you down switch it to the other side and it gets even cooler kind of like turning your pillow over and it is cooler would definetely recommend,60,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,after dropping 40 on one of those sharper image personal cooling systems and finding out that i would have been just as well off putting my money directly in a trash can i stumbled upon these they work very well and stay cool for several hours and stay wet for days if it gets too warm just pop it in the fridge for 10 minutes and you are good for a few more hours glad i bought them,77,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,first of all these are not shaped like a typical bandana but they do puff up with water and stay wet for days be careful they do get stinky if you do not let them air out but do not expect them to get completely dry,44,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,i bought the 10 pack based on the reviews it definitely worked great the first time i used one it kept my head cool as i played tennis on a really hot day but the problem is it never completely dries i washed it and put it in dryer it never completely dries once the stuff inside soaks water / sweat you can never get rid of it and soon enough it starts to stink i had to painstakingly slit a small hole in each of the 10 take out the chemical particles and now i just use them as bandanas for sweat,101,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,very fast shipment greatreally helped keep the kids cool at band camp,14,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,i would recommend this product to others my son works in a factory it gets very hot this product has helped him get through the heat,26,8

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,these bandanas have been a huge help getting me through the record heat we have had in the midwest this summer simple to activate and long lasting cool they really do what they say they will my only suggestion is to activate them and let them hang dry at least once before using since they do fade a little neat product and awesome service i am a happy camper,69,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,product is cheap one of the 4 coolers did not have enough crystals to inflate neckcooler material bleeds all over your clothing does not stay cool after about 45 minutes design is bad when inflated cooler does not want to bend easily around your neck feels like you are wearing a tire do not waste your money i have purchased other neck coolers far superior to these that actually are comfortable and work well,73,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i was so excited to get these but how disappointing the cold did not last long and they are just useless,21,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,i bought these for my husband because he works outdoors here in the extreme heat of southernthey have been well worth the price i paid for them as they have helped to prevent him from having a heat stroke,41,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,i have used these before when i worked in a factory that would get to 100 degrees these things work very well to help keep you a little cooler secret is to rinse them out after use and resoak them for the next days wearing i purchased these for my son who works outside in the sun and heat he says they are definately worth the money,67,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,4.0,positive,seem to work fine and keep cool can not really complain although you can get made fun of because they are goofy looking around your neck,25,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,product arrived but i discovered that the product is not a triangular bandana as i assumed but a tube of cloth filled with a water obsorbing substance returned product for a refund and bought a chilly pad from frogg toggs instead,41,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,they do swell up in cold water but you definitely have to do it for at least an hour and it helps to keep them in the refrigerator during that time you also have to keep turning it to get the cool effect i will use it when gardening because it is a little messy for good clothes,57,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,5.0,positive,the evercool reusable cooling bandana lives up to it is name in arizona it has stood up to 112 degree heat while i work outside tending my flowers and yard or taking walks in my neighborhood it is second nature to take it out of the fridge after a good soak in water and tie it on and go outside and enjoy the day not having to worry about the extreme heat i sometimes forget i have it on at the end of the day it is still keeping me cool great product i would think it would be terrific for first responders and others who are subjected to extreme heat i see many landscapers and construction workers wearing them here in az another great use would be for summer sports camps or football teams who start practice in august great way to prevent heat induced injuries the colors they come in are great too,149,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,2.0,negative,a friend gave me a similarshe had purchased at a fair it was wonderful the beads inside were plentiful stayed plump and cool several hours after soakingable to wear it right away without clothing getting wet material was soft cotton that layed quite nicely when tied thinking these were the same i ordered 2 sets not nearly the quality that my friend had puchased not enough beads inside cloth was stiff unable to wear after wetting material it soaked my clothing,85,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i can not believe i fell for this a man in his elder years should know better but it gets hot on the arkansas river fishing in the summer and i was a little desperate fact is this thing did not do any cooling that i could tell after about 2 minutes i agree with the person who said that it did seem to block the wind making you hotter the crystals the seller talks about were all in one wad bunched up near one end of the little shoestring-like scarf so how could the crystals cool anything i sure do not have the answer what i do know however is that these things are purely and simply ripoffs amazon should not allow obvious fraudulent gimmicks to be sold on their site hopefully amazon has a system for checking out products that receive really negative feedback like this one and can outlaw future sales of those products i am probably dreaming however,160,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0009Y01J2,1.0,negative,i prepared the bandana per instruction i had them in the refrig over night for the next day that next morning i went to put the bandana on and some of the gel beads were sticking out of the materal i took those off and then put the bandana around my neck the coolnest only lasted maybe 20 minutes i was very disappointed i went back to my stand by which is a cold wash cloth that had been in the refrig and it lasts at least an hour i would never buy this product again,96,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,cover is pretty thin and tares easily also does not secure in anyway so it can blows off easily,19,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,the first time we used this cover it tore on the rear axle bolt it also did not fit the classic style bicycle we were placing this on very well but that was to be expected since it is a one-size-fits-all type of cover,43,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,after several months of storing a bicycle outdoors this cover has begun disintegrating the plastic has become brittle i suspect due to the sun i live in a temperate part of southern california this cover has become completely useless i will be looking for a cover which is more durable perhaps one made of the type of material you might find for a bbq cover avoid this product at all costs if you plan to store your bike outside,79,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,after a few rain storms this cover is all ripped up it is not that heavy,15,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,4.0,positive,thin but durable bike cover fits my large beach cruiser as pictured it also fits my standard bike but not my stretch cruiser overall this bike cover works well for my outside storage needs just do not let the dog near it because it shreds easily,45,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,4.0,positive,inexpensive and useful glad i have this and i can keep my bicycles out on the balcony at the condo without upsetting the management,24,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,very pleased with the bike covers they came faster than expected i would buy from this company again,18,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,it was difficult to figure out how to cover the bicycle with this cover as it did not seem to have any demarkations for installation it started coming apart after the first use a large about 1 foot long tear appeared i attempted to tape it withtape but it not only came apart again but ripped in several other places as well i would recommend that anyone needing a bicycle cover buy a better quality one than this you get what you pay for,86,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,the first time i used the bicycle cover one of two which i bought when i went to uncover it there was a foot-long split in the seam i taped it up and am using it but basically i feel it is a rather chintzy product also it is very hard to figure out how to orient the cover to fit on the bike but i suppose since it was inexpensive it would fit in the category of you get what you pay for,82,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,they fit over my bike with plenty of room to spare keeps hem dry and clean,16,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,1.0,negative,the product was advertised as durable plastic should have said very thin plastic when i took it out of the bag and opened it was torn the company responded and gave me a return number but now i would have to spend time and money to return in the end 16 wasted,51,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,5.0,positive,excellent value and fast shipping cover is lightweight but perfect for covering two bikes instead of one highly recommended,19,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000AO7GYO,2.0,negative,i realize the price being so low that i would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine i did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike it does not since it does not fit over both tires the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit i have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable my tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike very misleading very disappointed,137,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,these boots are great i use them on my 153 foundation qh with big hooves and they fit perfect these are the only I have tried a dozen different kinds bell boots i can turn him out in that do not rub him they tend to last about 2 - 4 months of constant wear daily turnout and riding in wisconsin winter / spring before the rubber starts giving out and needs to be replaced but for the price and overall quality that does not bother me too bad the only other thing I am not thrilled with is why the blue are more expensive than green / red I have purchased both and the material / quality is the same but the green look just fine with my tack as well so nothing tragic,122,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,these work really well a little tough to pull over but i did it on anbar and a wedge shoe but once they are on they work great and you really do not have to take them off just flip them up to groom the leg and even if wet no parts of the boot are touching hair so it does not hold any moisture in,65,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,exactly as advertised fit my 17hh tb perfectly thanks,9,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,excellent choice they have been on a pastured horse who overreaches all summer to prevent him pulling off his shoes they have held up well update they lasted the entire 4 months i had the horse the extra large fit perfectly on a 17 hand warmblood with big feet,49,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,iove theof green it does not match the grass so easy to spot they were very easy to get to get pulled on over my horses shoes and hooves i would love to give 5 stars but length of boot is to short considering size i purchased and there is still a high potential for my horse toon his shoe and rip it off,67,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,fit great but i wish they stood up to turnout better after a few weeks the bottoms were chewed up and i had to toss them out can not complain too much considering the cost,34,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,these are lighter than another brand i tried but stayed on for a remarkably long time and better than expected a bit easier to pull over the hoof than the heavier ones,32,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,worst boot ever on my horse for 2 days and they are shredded do not buy,16,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,it is true to it is fit but does not last very long my horse tore it within a week of them being put on,24,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,good boots for long term use i doubled up for my mare that had corrective shoes,16,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,my mare is out more often than not she has been wearing these boots 24/7 for 8 months and they are just now looking like it is time for new boots she has access to a pond and loves mud so these boots have been tested,44,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,love thebut not sturdy or durable at all he ruined them in 2 days very flimsy,19,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,these boots did not even last one week the first one was shredded in just one day there was not even enough of these boots left for me to return them buying these was just like throwing money away,38,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,i put them on my tb and it rubed so bad that i had to get some other bell boot for him,22,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,i was pretty disappointed with thisthey are listed as hunter green and while the picture is a little brighter than hunter the boots themselves were closer to lime green they fit pretty well and were easy to get on and off but the material is flimsy and had small tears before the first week the only pluses are they were fit and they were cheap but i guess you get what you pay for would not buy again,80,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,they were too small and the size i ordered,9,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,1.0,negative,lasted about a week do not recommend these for turnout they are a very thin rubber,14,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,super reasonable super tough using one pair in normal fashion over front hooves to protect his heels and another pair upside down on an older horse who tends to hit himself in his fetlocks with his front feet,37,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,used on my horse who steps on himself in the hind end to try to minimize damage to hoof / coronary band worked as hoped they lasted about 3 weeks and i wish the rubber was a little bit more sturdy for that reason they did not leave rub marks and were easy to put on and off I have used other brands since buying these and would probably go back to these if only because the rubber is malleable enough that i can actually pull them off if i needed to also a benefit is the blueis easy to see when he lost it in his large pen yes they trap a little mud but that is not unexpected and i did not have any significant problems with it word to the wise definitely buy from the amazon prime eligible seller as i initially went with the other seller and i cancelled that order because it was taking so long,157,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,protection is great the large covered heel and shoe perfectly on my 161 appendix gelding size 3 shoe but i have tried three pairs of these now all have ripped within a week even although it is hard to get on the really thick boots I am going back to those as they are the only type I have found to hold up to the stress of playtime in the pasture,70,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,4.0,positive,my gelding has to wear these s 24/7 because he over reaches and pulls off his shoes and they hold up pretty well we go through a pair about every other month because he rips them from stepping on them can not complain although they are priced well i do not want to buy expensive ones if they are going to get destroyed from 24/7 wear i have a few pairs stored away in my tack box i always keep a few pairs on hand,82,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,5.0,positive,love them have one pair on my horse now and they are doing great no rips on them yet and have had them on for a week so far so good,32,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000B9QAHW,2.0,negative,the large size is too small for a 15 hand horse,11,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,if you buy any trainer i would recommend this computer to train with it is easy to operate gives instant information not hard to setup and works well it is particularly useful if you track your workouts,35,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,for a device at this price i would not expect much just a consistent power reading for the effort i put in it does not even have to be correct or reflect short spikes in power to test this out i bought one and used it with my powertap the initial readings were pretty close but over the course of a one hour workout it drifted by about 30 watts for me as the fluid in the trainer heats up it gets easier and easier to spin while this is great for the ego it is not useful for training as the computer makes no adjustment for this even if the readings were wrong if they were consistently wrong it would still be a useful device as it is it is pretty useless i returned it,132,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,the directions are horrible I have hooked something like this up before and so i improvised it does not work i called customer service they responded quickly and tried to resolve problem they are sending me a new wire for it,40,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,goodpoorly designed the display is not appropriate for serious workouts the premise is that you can see your power output becuase the kinetic trainers are so accurate however while you are observing your power you can not see your cadence so you can not accurately maintain your rpm and power at the same time but both aspects are important when training i returned the product because it did not meet my needs,71,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,did not get far enough to see how this thing worked because installation was ridiculous with poor directions / instructions i consider myself pretty mechanically inclined but these directions were impossible to follow so rather than waste time and aggravate myself further I am returning this thing,43,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,this is the w model it does not do heart rate or altitude so no need for a chest strap like the wl model i bought it to use with my kinetics road machine and specialized hard rock bike it took a bit of time to figure out the placement for the sensors for speed and cadence but in the end it seems well laid out the manual is small and the pictures a bit hard to understand but the company was great and sent me a pdf version of the manual the most difficult to understand is the arrangement for the lap timers but those will not be of that much use for me just now and the rest of the functions seem to work well this unit was about the same price as the strada cc-rd300w wireless but has a larger display and includes cadance and power which i really wanted,151,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,this is not the easiest computer odometer to operate it functions well but is somewhat difficult to reset will need to spend more time with the operation manual,28,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,i was getting sporadic gaps with another manufacturers wireless model so i purchased this product to match the kinetic by kurt trainer plenty of included ties the install is pretty straight forward the wattage calculator is wonderful and there was plenty of cord slack for application on my cannondale hybrid solid product no complaints,54,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,i installed this unit and it works great the only after thought was if it would have came with the chest strap also it would have been 5 stars,29,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my son and he said that it worked as expected he was well satisfied with it,21,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,i concur with the reviews that describe this device as shoddy and poorly manufactured however i want to add that it is totally a misrepresentation to describe this as a power computer it does not really compute power what is does is take your speed and run it through a simple equation that derives your power as a function of your speed if you are expecting a device that does anything but give you a rough approximation of your power output by placing your speed into a quadratic equation with some regression coefficients derived from who-knows-where this is not it very deceptive product description good thing it is cheap,104,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,at first i would agree seemed like junk however everytime i called kurt kinetic they were extemely helpful and shipped me a new one mine kept shorting out and losing the display and info then might or might not come back on after i receive the 3rd replacement i saw that the use of an extention cord had been eliminated and a solid wire from computer to pickup was used instead that was it my computer works perfectly now for 50 bucks you can not go wrong it is extemely accurate and matches wattage with the other much more expensive offerings ie power tap and more great service from kk,108,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,very cheaply made readout is small buttons are loose wires are flimsy shocking contrast in quality when compared to the kinetic road machine trainer i bought it with should be included free with a 275 trainer in my opinion but it works just not worth 45 - 50 bucks be careful installing it as to not pull out the wires or crack the plastic tab that locks the computer on to the mount,71,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,this computer is a remarkable piece of junk everything on it is the cheapest possible grade the magnet broke in my hands when i tried to install it i used the magnet from an old cateye computer even the plastic zipties were dried and snapped the reset button on the computer itself sticks in the in position the mounting bracket does not hold the computer firm enough so when you press the display button the computer goes flying off the bike the battery only lasted 3 months the display turns rainbow colors at about 60 degree f but you get wattage and all other vital info for your workout so you need this thing my kurt kinetic rock-n-roll trainer is bomb proof i love it however this computer is the biggest hunk of junk I have ever used in my life everything about it is of the lowest quality but you need one so buy it kurt kinetic should tar and feather the guy who thought it would be a goodto put their name on this thing it is just shameful,179,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,these plugs do reduce the noise from shooting but i can not stand the pain after ten minutes,17,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,this was a four star product until it broke after one week of use I am a carpenter and wear banded hearing protection every day for the convenience factor i liked that the gel material the plugs were made of could be easily cleaned unlike yellow foam which gets nasty in a hurry if these lasted a month or two i might of considered buying them again but a week is unacceptable,71,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,congratulations to radians for an excellent product much superior to any other banded hearing protector on the current market [ forget those bogus foam-plug jokes that need replacing every other day ] these are light-weight easy to wear around the neck when not in use so always handy a bonus the ear-plugs are very comfortable and easy to insert and later clean I am very pleased with my purchase and have given extra sets to friends who appreciate silence without clunky ear-muff bother,80,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,broke in less than two days plastic not very flexible nor pliable for everyday use,16,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,a bit tight but that is probably because of my big head laughing out loud i do like the soft silicone ear pieces and the fact that you get an extra pair with the purchase arrive on time in about a week have not worn these for long periods yet so i do not know if the pressure is enough to because pain but it definitely works for a little spur of the moment plinking,70,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,as others have said it snapped in the middle of the band after using it a few weeks i did not abuse it only opening it up enough to put around my head they use cheap brittle plastic very annoyed,40,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,like others reported they are quite right good for an hour maximum,12,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,super convenient the gel stays clean while all the nasty stuff sticks to the foam pairs impossible to loose very important comfort is adequate relatively cheap however after a few months they do begin to split down the seam in back and break i bought 5 pairs last time and will likely buy them again however i am currently content with my 500pk of ear plugs,66,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,perfect all around tool for shooting working around loud noises or anything that would bother you by being to loud comfortable and fits great,24,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,probably not a fair evaluation seems like a great product but did not fit my ear canals,17,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,i bought these because the ear plug material is smooth and easy to clean however the material is also quite firm and causes pain in the ear canals after a while also the noise attenuation seems lower than other similar products with softer ear pieces,45,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,individual plugs fall / blow out on my motorcycle i have used similar ones ugly when mowing grass and grinding metal so i thought I had try these for riding they work great hang on the neck when going into a store and more and do not look industrial,44,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,did not like it returned it was way too tight,9,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,i had them at the range today for the first time after about 30 min my ear hurt a little i reached up to my ear and found that the red end part had come off in my ear and the metal part was in my ear and could have been dangerous,52,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,just i wanted non foam ear pods these do not get hard and or dirty at work very cool and comfortable,23,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,it fell apart the firs time i used it the red ear buds come off the plastic band easily i lost one of the ear buds becasue of this,29,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,comfortable but lost one plug first day otherwise it was a beautiful day in the woods this many words required,20,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,does not stop sound bought for a 10 year old with glasses and it is almost as bad as nothing i tried it on myself and could not get it to work properly either,32,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed in the radians red banded hearing protections i tried them at the gun range and had to use ear muffs because the ear plugs did not reduce the noise level enough so that i could shoot i can only recommend them for very low level noise not for shooting protection,54,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,these do not fit me well at all i realize it must be difficult to make a product that fits everyone but these are not even close plus they apply too much pressure and it causes discomfort,35,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,i regularly run a propane floor buffer and this is a great product the case they came in is reusable keeps them clean when not in use the design makes sure that they comfortably seal inside my ear after about 40 minutes usage my ears tend to get a bit sore minor issue a great product,56,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,bought these for the shooting range and have used them several times with no issues judging by other reviews maybe my head is smaller but the fit is not painfulat all after an hour of use the only reason not a 5 star is i wish the band fit behind my head without falling to my neck and being pushed by my shirt or jacket collar breaking the seal of the plug in my ear i deal with it for 5 - 6 compared to more expensive and heavy muffs or disposables a great value,93,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,you will need a small head like a kid to wear these otherwise it causes too much pressure basically the head band is too shallow it needs to be taller and wider,32,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,these are great vary durable and light weight our children used them on our trip to disney world they were good for the loud rides shows and fireworks when not being worn in the ears the can be worn like a necklace so far they have not worn out but when they do i will diffidently but them again,59,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,i can not hear a damn thing with these on is not that the point i use them for protecting my hearing while at the shooting range and also at home to drown out the wife,34,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,the gel plugs on these do not fit well in my ears and after having jammed them in hard enough to block sound they do not provide enough attenuation to suit my needs they also work loose and then i loose all attenuation it may be just my ear shape but i suspect the material they are made from transmits too much sound,63,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,maybe my head has a weird shape but i can not get the gels to fit into my ears well enough to block any sound,24,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,good price for the piece and only problem is the band is stiff and hard not flexible that can be easily fold,22,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,these just plain hurt my ears if i could endure the pain they might loosen up or maybe pulling them apart to stretch them out might help i gave up and went back to regular plugs and i am shopping for some of those cool over the ear filtering ear protectors,51,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,they worked good after i learned how they went in my ear they work better for me than the ear plugs with the strings,24,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,i got these for when I am on my motorcycle to cut down highway noisethey cut the noise down by about 60 they fit fine and i wear them for hours at a time i also shot my 357 and 9 mm while wearing these and they did finecrazy as it seems i think they are better for shooting than riding,59,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,they worked fine for short term wore them to an ipsc match and after a couple hours the band started hurting the sides of my ear the shaft from the band to the plug should be longer so the band does not impact the outer part of your ear i am going to switch to the howard leight earbands where have the longer shaft and keep the band off of your ear,73,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,4.0,positive,these work very well for me not too tight the only problem i have had with them is a plug came off the holder once and bounced like a rubber ball and wentunder my truck,34,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,this is the best hearing protection I have had I have never cared for the ear muff type protectors being banded keeps you from loosing them it is silly to pay 100 for any ear protection when you can get this outfit for a fraction of the price and work just as well,50,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5.0,positive,these earplugs offer excellent hearing protection while working construction the biggest benefit is that they easily clip around your neck when you are not wearing them making it easy to pop them in your ears just before you grab for the saw or the nail gun construction equipment is loud and running it without hearing protection damages your hearing and let us face it unless it takes about one second to locate and put on your hearing protection it is not going to happen some of the other reviewers mentioned durability i had a pair for a year before they broke and just bought two replacement pairs they are a few bucks and easy to replace also the gel ear inserts are comfortable and easy to clean highly recommended product,128,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2.0,negative,the plastic band can not be adjusted and the pressure forces the ear plugs deep into your ear canal i can only wear these for about 30 minutes then i have to pull them out and i can only wear them for about an hour a day they do seal tightly and block noise i got these for yard mowing because my outside-the-ear earmuff hearing protectors became hot and wet with sweat i have an older pair of ear plug protectors that have an adjustable stainless steel band and a blunt type of oil filled ear plug and they are more comfortable it would help if a blunt type of ear plug was offered these would be good for short time noise exposure the most comfortable hearing protection i have found are the cheap foam ear plugs that you compress by rolling between your fingers and then press into your ear canal,151,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1.0,negative,i do not know if it is because i have a large head or not but this was not comfortable at all the problem was not the material that goes into your ears it was that there was way too much pressure applied through the band,44,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,wow i just received this thigh toner and took it out of the box i thought it was broken but on second thought that is just how it comes cheap and flimsy it is basically a thick wire hangar covered in foam with a flimsy spring inside the center black plastic cover which pops off easily it does not have much tension and i do not recommend buying it even for the cheap price I had say it is worth around 199 at most I am sure there are sturdier and better designed products,91,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is really easy to use and it comes with an exercise photo guide and directions i started to notice a difference within the first 10 days and the best part is it only takes 90 seconds to do the recommended reps i love it,44,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like this product although i do not use it everyday because i have an awesome treadmill but when I am tired from work or just tired and do not want to use the treadmill for the day i can flop down on the bed turn on my favorite show and use it i saw a lot of reviews that it is uncomfortable so i was hesitant about getting it but i found that you just have to find the right position that is comfortable I shall work out laying on one side for about 10 minutes then flip to the other side of the bed and work out the other leg it is actually kept my theighs in shape a lot better than i thought it would,122,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,works well makes your thighs feel the burn would have given it 5 stars if it were made more heavy duty seems a bit flimsy and like it could break at any time but it has not i have used everyday for about 3 weeks and no problems at all and i can see a difference in my thighs already if your inner thighs need help this is a good product to use,74,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i enjoy this product my thighs are getting tighter and toner and my buns often ache and are feeling tighter,20,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this is not what i expected i read reviews and tooka chance anyways you get what you paid for it bends when closing i had my friend who weighed 120 pounds use it and it broke worthless,36,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i bought this for my friend she is 54 it does not fit her thigh length it is too awkward and unusable,21,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,just what i expected to use at home,8,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,arrived on time i use it while watching tv and i can feel the burn,15,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,seems to be cheap quality i am not a large person and it still feels too short and the cushion presses in easily and makes theuncomfortable to use i let my 20 year old daughter try it and she said the same thing not made well and hurts to use it not at all like the original thigh master,61,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it works well but sort of squeaks a little when using it,12,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,it was christmas in sept as i have missed thissooooo much i am so happy i can now do my exercises and keep it moving I am a senior so i must keep it moving thanks for all of your help,41,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this works really good it trims your thighs and hurts after use so you know if you feel the burn it working,22,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,product was a mess not as expected at all returned,9,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,theof it is good the hinge in the middle tries to buckle do not use it much,18,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this used only be used by a woman does not have the support i need as a man so for the ladies great for a man i would get one with a lot more resistance,35,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this product does not work you can sit there for hours and you will never feel the burn i have resorted in taking my dog on longer walks do not waste your time or money on this product so not worth it,41,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this was horible the original thighmaster from suzanne sommers is ten times better i would highly reccommend spending more money for a better product,24,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,well i tried it out for about two weeks and even looked up online how to use this contraption but no results came through plus it looks kind of awkward when you use it in the public,37,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i have to wonder what some of the reviewers have been doing to theirs becausehad mine since 2010 and it is still very new looking and I have used it a lot it is awesome and you actually feel the resistance with this little device,44,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,what a great gadget it has toned my thighs a great deal but you have to be diligent i am a very active person and workoutand if you want to have great thighs i recommend the bally thigh toning kit great investment i rated a 5,48,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i had one of these 20 years ago when suzanne came out with it and i sold it lost it or donated it so i thought I had get a new one i got this one for a great deal here on amazon and i was worried about the quality but it does the trick and i love it,58,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,simply did the job no hype or gimmicks i wanted to firm up my inner thighs and this did the trick at half the price of it is competition,28,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,the bally total fitness thigh toner works well and it comes with a workout sheet it it great for the price,21,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like it it does what it says and i am 57 and have had no problems using it as it is supposed to be used i just did not like that it said it was out of the pink one for the lesser price so i bought this one and ended up with the pink one,56,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it really works i used it 10 minutes a day 3 times a week i just wish they can make it little stronger the black middle part brakes easilymine broke after 4 month of usage,34,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i thought i would like this gadget and it would be easy to operate I am not sure of it is effectiveness because after trying it i realized it was not for me,30,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was a little disappointed because it was flimsier than i expected but i did not pay much so it is ok it does do what it is intended for it slips off my knees sometimes but I have learner to hold it a certain way if you want something better than spending more money is the way to go i got what i paid for so i can not complain or rate low super fast shipping,72,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i use this several times a week it took some time to notice a difference but I am starting to get that defining line down the inner thigh I am always mad at supermodels for having the padding is a bit lacking but i push the u-shaped part down past the bony part of my knee and it works great without discomfort i love it,64,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,cons flimsy plastic over the spring came apart first thing plastic part that goes over the end of the wire inside the foam also fell off first thing at only 5 my thighs are too short for the thigh toner to fit right to do the outer thigh exercise when working the inner thigh have to either hang on to it or readjust after every squeeze it is off balance and twists from out from between my legs resistance is too low pros works good for the tricep squeeze and chest but still needs more resistance inexpensive but you get what you pay for goodin theory,116,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,very flimsy and low quality money wasted i had my suspicions when i ordered it and voila do not even bother,21,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,the shipping was fast and efficient the product itself is cheap and really does not work well it does bend like it states but it slips out of place with every move i would recommend to purchase something else that costs a little more but would not be a garage sale,52,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i have only used it twice for the thighs so can not really give it an honest review but it is great to use while watching tv i did try it for the arms but prefer to use a workout that has weights as it is uncomfortable i did feel the burn after the second time i used it so my guess is it will work over time,67,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,for what i paid it was good came in the mail quickly a simple and easy to use exercise equipment for a busy working mom,25,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,usually i read all the reviews before purchasing something and i did not when i bought this i wish i would have complete waist of money super cheap construction i should have bought the thigh master thought i would save the money wish i would have spent it,48,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i never got thismyself i think it is lost or somenthing so i can hardly say anything about the product the shipment sucks,24,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,the price is amazing usually is less than 20 sometimes you can get it for free as a gift,20,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i thought after reading all the review that surely this product would not be as bad as everyone is saying but unfortunatly it is i am 5 ft 115lbs so i am pretty small and not that strong and i felt like i was going to break it i had to hold it in place to keep it from wobbling around or popping out of place i am going to keep it because it did come with the ankel bands that i really did like but if you really really need a thigh master the bally thigh toning kit would def let you down sorry bally this one was a bad choice for you guys to make,116,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this device is only useful for training your inner and outer thighs and really not even good for outer i bought it because my gym does not have an abductor / adductor machine so i wanted to add that at home it is great for using in front of the television but you need to do a lot of reps to get results and remember you can not spot tone this like all muscle training exercises will build muscle in the areas you are working it is still important as part of a total exercise program for women,91,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i like this toning kit and the band included is extra nice the only thing i do not like is that it does get a bit tender after extended use on the thigh sometimes i feel like I am gon na break it feels kind of wobbly and flimsy but all in all it is pretty useful use it long enough and it will wear you out,64,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,I have had and used this product for 5 months and it broke in half at the spring while i was using it this is a dangerous and very poorly made product,31,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this is essentially a foam covered wire hanger with a spring in the middle if you squeeze it between your knees it leaves bruises if you try to use it for pec exercises it flips out of your grasp because if has no balance you would be better off strapping a pair of cymbals to your knees and playing along with john phillip sousa marches to get your thighs into shape as you would be to try and tone your thighs with this piece of crap,86,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,1st strong strong strong rubber smell that goes on my pants and skin smell lasts a long time even after i washed my hands left it alone for months came back to it strong strong rubber smell still there 2nd this is very loose compare to other thigh shaper not tense enough to shape legs like a grandma wanabe thigh shaper 3nd i paid 11 bucks and my friend got a very good thigh shaper w no rubber smell at half of the price i paid do not buy this,90,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this is very cheaply made and not very sturdy I have used the original thigh master from suzanne summers and it is a lot better quality I am disappointed in my purchase i wish i would have gone with the real thing,38,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,very easy to use and you can pick it up and put it down whenever you want i use it sitting down due to my health problems of standing i use it for increased arm strength and also between my knees to strengthen these mussels too it is a great easy to use and yes i do recommend it as exercise equipment to use even when you just do not exercise,70,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,the thigh toner is really difficult to use and my legs are too short to be able to use it for my outer thighs by placing it behind my knees it is a cheap piece of equipment and the interior wires poke through the foam casing it is hard to keep the equipment in place to use it properly the bands are useful but you may as well buy them elsewhere instead of in this package note the bands are short and are made to wrap around your ankles they are not all-purpose resistance bands the water-squeezing belts are probably useless although i only used them once i mean really,108,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was pleased with the kit for the purchase price i especially enjoy the ankle bands and use those for thighs as well as therapy on my knee the thigh toner is a bit awkward when starting out but it definitely works,42,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this is a piece of garbage i just got this in the mail today i want to send it back but I shall have to pay more money just to return it and i will not be reimbursed the initial shipping fee this is the most cheap and does not work piece of garbage i ever ordered this thigh toner is flimsy and in no way can one excerise with this without having to make constant adjustment to hold it in place garbage this gets zero stars,84,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i really enjoy using this product and the results i am getting however quality of this brand left me disappointed the cushion around arms is not thick enough i can feel the wire so unless you wear thick leggings be prepared to get bruises also the spring system is ready to crack i have only had it less than a month and use it once a day having had same equipment before but different brand i can safely say try another brand,82,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is great for a quickie or if you are on the go i keep it in the car it can be kind of awkward sometimes but just reposition some and you should be fine,33,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i find this product to be hard to use it keeps shifting around and by the time you readjust it between each rep it gets frustrating the arm excercises are easier because you can keep control but the leg excercises are when it shifts constantly i would not recommend it to my friends,51,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this thing is cheaply / poorly made i wish i would of found a different one difficult to use without it alipping everywhere or flinging,23,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,if you look at the picture it appears that the loops almost completely come around close to the center with rounded edges this is not the case the loops are much shorter with the rod stopping about half-way to the hinge they are too too long for me and are very uncomfortable with the squared corners the padding is also insufficient and the hinge is fairly loose so does not provide nearly the difficulty it should to be beneficial overall a very disappointing product although it does work if you were quite new to exercise and needed little resistance and were at least about 58 it might work alright but you would soon exercise past it is usefulness and need something sturdier,121,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i think it works awesome the only thing is that for some reason the little rubber caps on the ends of the metal that keep the metal from tearing the foam keep falling off i love it although just a few minutes everyday for about a week now and i can already notice a slight difference on my way to my old jeans again,64,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,i am not happy with this purchase these are not well made and there is a fear that they will snap apart while in use this is not what i wanted and i doubt it will be used very disappointed,40,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,now first i will say that i do get a little bit of a burn from this but this device is constructed with extremely flimsy material the plastic in the middle that covers the spring gaps and pinches when you squeeze most annoying of all however is the fact that the interior wire does not go all the way around the loop if you look at the picture the interior support wire only goes about an inch down after it makes it is second turn the rest is just foam this means that pressure is not distributed evenly and you end up with one end digging into your thighs basically if i knew what i know now i would have bought some resistance bands instead this is not worth the money,128,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,the firm tension of the bally thigh toning kit is very good for people who are beyond the beginner stage of exercising who want to develop firm thigh muscles,29,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this thighmaster is pretty good for the price it seems like it could be a little bit stronger but overall i like it now if i can just use it,30,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this arrived fast and on time it works I have used it every day since I have received it but it is a little flimsy it sometimes moves a little twisty when I am using it but so far it is held up,39,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,sellers description of thiswas accurate up to a point not a bad seller just a bad product theis very poorly made and cheap mine broke within a week and is so cheap that it is not worth the trouble to return you get what you pay for spend a little more money and get a better product,60,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,the bally total fitness thigh toner is a great exercize product that works quite well i recommend it if you want something affordable to exercize with,26,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i have had mine for well over a decade and use it when i need to and it is great to use at the office since I am in a cubicle i love mine and recommend it for ease of use,40,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,this product is cheaply made so much so that it is impossible to use if it was not such a pain to get back into it is box i would have returned it bottom line save your money,37,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this thigh toner is just as everyone else has reviewed it cheaply made but with that said it gets the job done I have felt the burn while using it but only as long as my feet are together from the get-go also make sure that you hold it upright while using it it will be more comfortable it takes some fidgetting but i finally figured out the right spot where it did not hurt my inner thighs / knees,74,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,it is a bit uncomfortable at first to use but once you get the hang of it it is easy havnt had much actual thining in the thigh area yet but i have just started but i can feel the burn so i know it is starting to work,47,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i have actually used it for my thighs and arms long term use works,14,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,I have probably had it for a year it may be a cheaper version compared to other thigh masters but this gets the job done it is comfortable to me and does not bruise like some other review said i like it,39,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i was a little nervous about this purchase but i really love it it is not the best made and it can be a little awkward but when you get use to it it really works,35,67
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i really like this little thing it is not nearly as uncomfortable to use as i thought it would be after reading some other reviews i do not find it uncomfortable at all actually it is small so that really helps me because i have virtually no space at home i can even feel some of my muscles in my lower abs getting worked by the way i am 125lbs and 33 years old and have 4 children i am very active and have always exercised in different ways throughout my life i like the way the thigh toner works and am very happy with my purchase,105,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,i got this in a week ago and I am surprised that there are not a larger percentage of positive reviews it is holding up perfectly so far provided me the extra resistance i needed is comfortable to use and was definitely the right price the outer thigh exercise can be tricky to position but once you get it in the right spot it works perfectly i would recommend this to anyone wanting to add that little extra to their workout regimen,79,69
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,waste of money the original was much better very flimsy and unstable would cost more to return than it is worth,20,70

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,let us face it the quality of this thing is super cheap it feels flimsy and definitely not the quality of the original brand that being said it gets the job done and is inexpensive if i wanted quality i would have paid more i feel the burn and am sore after i use it so i do not really care that it feels cheap works very well,67,74

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i just received this product today and tried it out it is rather uncomfortable and the middle plactic thing fell apart imediately it still works but it is anoying to have plastic popping out also the outer thigh exercise was pretty impossible it is just too big for that exercise but then again i am 52,53,81
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for when you try it out it never stays in place it it difficult to find a comfortable position to use it when it will not even stay in place,34,82
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,this product was cheaply made and not enough resistance i had an original thighmaster for many years but it finally broke so i thought I had try this one i ended up sending it back even although the postage fees hardly made it worth the effort do not bother,47,83
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i found this product to be quite charming electric blue pads cute but flimsy i had trouble holding it in place while doing the thigh and arm workouts if you are looking for a good toner keep looking maybe if you are very petite and have short legs you might be able to work it but i was not i m 57 and have long legs it was just too awkward to do not a fan,74,84

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,i bought this because I am in shape overall but i have some trouble spots around my thighs this toner is super easy to use and i can definitely feel it working while i use it it is not a tool for weight loss but i do expect to see toning results in my thighs and legs,55,86

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,1.0,negative,bally total fitness thigh toner good price too good fast ship but very low quality the plastic case over the spring falls off with any use the foam padding is way too thin even for already toned legs it will bruise you very easily spend a little more this is just too cheap to be any good at all obviously an attempt to make a few bucks on the bally name we thought it might be decent from bally nope,79,90
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i would say this product is not good for small built ppl I am 410 and it is very uncomfortable to use it as thigh toner it does better job as tricepts toner so not what i expected also as others mentionned this exerciser is pretty cheaply made plastic parts are falling apart pretty easily so I am happy that i paid for this piece of junk just 10 bucks does not do any job in my case at all,75,91
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,4.0,positive,this really works great for arm exercises it does the job for thigh and butt it is just cheaply made and flimsy it does work although for the cheap price it is worth it,33,92

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,5.0,positive,this little thing is so great i have only had it a few days and it is great i was searching for something i can do while watching tv in the little spare time i have and this little wonder is great i can use it for my arms and my thighs it is worth it you can actually feel it working it was a little scary getting it out of the box but as long as you are careful and follow the directions on the box and open it up slowly it will not spring up at you,98,98
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000H4091O,2.0,negative,i have had a thigh toner before which i really liked i expected this one to be just as good it is too small and flimsy it needs to be repositioned after each rep the spring in the middle keeps becoming exposed it pinches it is not quite symmetric which makes it really awkward to use boo,57,99
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,the product is excellent holds firm and easily adjustable great for quick connect and disconnect of fenders better pictures of this product would be preferred when i purchased i did not know that there were 2 in each package friends at the marina liked them so much they took my extras,50,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,these straps are a goodbut absolutly do not last more than one year i put on 6 of them in late summer last year they were on my pontoon boat on a freshwater lake when i pit the boat in the water this spring they literally crumbled and broke they are not made to last but to be sold as a goodwithoit a quality product to back it up if you ow a pontoon get the plastic taylormade square clips that fit over the square rail,90,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1.0,negative,to thread the strap you do not need to be a rocket scientist but it helps longevity in the sun-zero we live in a community where you must remove the boat from the water except for seven day cycles total sun exposure was about 70 days the balance of the time the fenders and straps are in a box they shred like superman is pulling them apart almost lost four fenders absolute junk,72,2

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,i found that they tend to rot quickly,8,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,although i had to return thisi still give it 4 stars the only reason i did not give it 5 is because the description needs to be updated about minimum length it was too long for the purpose i was looking for,43,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,these work pretty well all although oddly can be a bit confusing to use and if the bumpers are heavy can pull the velcro loose so need to make sure secure correctly,32,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1.0,negative,lost 2 contour fenders off this product no way velcro way too flimsy,13,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,these are awesome and make it really easy to adjust your buoys,12,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,i really liked these for a few months however i left them attached to my boat as the primary connectors for my buoys when tied in our slip within a few months they had completely dried up the uv rays seemed to have broken down the material and they basically feel apart useless,53,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,easy installation works like a charm perfect easy to adjust love it,12,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,makes attaching bumpers a breeze as a new boater this has been a great option no need to learn all the knots right away these securely hold a bumper in place and various lengths,34,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,got these for my dad for xmas and he loves them good quality product and easy to use fast shipping,20,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,i did not find these very complicated except if you have to move them quickly mine did not last the season one basically tore off when the bumper hit thethey also twist easily and once twisted they become difficult to adjust i will not be replacing these with new ones,49,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,after our first season this year the product works pretty good i would not want to use it at a mooring where the boat rocks against ait is great for day boating,32,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,wish i could figure it out inx are useless,9,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,after 1 and 1/2 boating seasons that is about 6 months the sun got to the material in the straps the straps started disintegrating from the sun i about lost one of my fenders in the lake after the strap broke they are not uv resistant the manufacturer should use the black uv resistant strapping like they use on the bottom loop that attaches to the boat fender,67,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1.0,negative,it is to complicated if you ask someone to attach it works fine once attached,15,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,I have read reviews where folks said you need an engineering degree to figure them out well let us blame it on public schools now a days they actually make sense it is easy to see and figure out fair enough the instructions are crap on the package but when you think about and figure it these are really easy and make sense now i can not say the value to the long term use in a docking situation with the velcro but a temp hookup and/or river merge for a float these will work perfectly,90,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,i used these for awile and they were fine but ultimately decided on a product that clips on more easily,20,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,2.0,negative,I am not a dolt I have assembled many things worked on motors and things that require at least a small amount of aptitude in following directions but i just spent 30 minutes staring at my strap that just came in the mail and the little package picture on the front and then flipping it to the back to the directions then back again over and over again i really hope i can figure these things out because i do not like clutter and i like things to look neat the only way i am able to figure out how to use these things right now i could just do that with some spare line i have and save the money but i want to be able to attach these like it shows in the photo am hoping i can figure it out directions are very unclear and have no photos to follow,150,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,4.0,positive,i like the construction of these and the way they mount and hold my anchors if the price was a bit better i order order another set most of the marine stuff is overpriced it seems,36,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,pros sturdy good price long adjustment con velcro is slow to attach but i added a caribeaner clip for quickly connecting to cleat,23,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1.0,negative,easy to use works well unfortunately 2 of the ones i bought have ripped in only 4 months and the other 2 look like they are going to fail soon too all they do is hold up my white squishy boat thingers nothing fancy,43,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,1.0,negative,the velcro on these does not hold the weight of my hull huggers i hooked them up to each side of my tower with hull huggers at theand under 5 mins they had both fell off velco is a terrible choice of closure,45,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000I023RK,5.0,positive,purchased these straps at a great price and they are easy to use also give a great look to our boat instead of rope tied around the railing,28,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,i do not like the look feel or fit of these grips the size fits my hand a bit better than my hard rubber hogue grips but does not feel as comfortable and does not look as good also the fit on the gun is just a bit off enough to make it look a bit cheap,55,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,i purchased pachmayr grips for my ruger super blackhawk many years ago and they are great expecting the same qualitly i purchased the grips for my ruger redhawk and was very disappointed they do not fit good and the grip screw nut was loose in the grip and just turns round making it hard to get the screw out when i got the screw out the nut fell out in my hand the grips are loose very narrow and do not fit my hand at all now i know that no one set of grips can fit everyone is hand but these are very awkward and i am going to return them,109,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,i ordered pistol grips for my s w bodyguard model 49 and they sent me grips for a rugar redhawk 44 mag i have tried numerous times to contact the company to exchange for the proper gribs and they never got back to me i also attempted to call them but you only get an answering machine i left several messages and they never returned a call i would not recommend this company to anybody I am not trying to get my money back just the correcti ordered,88,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,these are the only choice for my ruger redhawk with high powered ammo the reduced recoil felt makes them the best choice for me shipping and service from leavitt enterprises the amazon supplier was exceptional,35,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,these grips are just sad they do not meet up properly along the seem and are so soft that the hammer pin works it is way free with only five pulls of the trigger if you have hand like brock lessner then they may fit your hand i have large hands and they are just to big and poorly designed bottom line is to save your mony and bye the houge tamer there just better in every way,76,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,grip has 1/2 inon front of frame,9,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,not very well made did not fit very well has gaps at the front part of the grip,18,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,only shot five rounds with the new grip and found it just super the initial shock was completely absorbed and i had just the regular kick back now i can not wait to really burn some powder with it,38,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,i like these better than the hogue grips i have both for the same 44 magnum shooting heavy 44 loads is tolerable now,23,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,perfect fit painless install and very comfortable grip,8,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,four stars for design but only rated two stars because of the poor quality of the product this grip fits my hand better than the hogue grip but the hogue quality is much better i like that this grip has a very thin cover of the back strap but when installed the front of the grip along the finger grooves does not meet this leaves athat runs the entire length of the grip,75,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,this pair of grips did not fit my redhawk correctly there was a pronouncedalong the front where the two halves meet,23,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,i bought three different grips before i found this one this is the one that takes the bite out of the recoil it has a thin layer that covers the metal strip on the back of the handle it is what is needed to keep it recoil shock from resignating through your arm makes the redhawk feel like a super redhawk,62,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,4.0,positive,i can not give firsthand advice about this my brother needed it and is very happy with the purchase i do not even really know what it is,26,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i recommend and sell this product to my nutritional clients they are quite pleased with their little hip-side coach thisalso scored well according to consumer reports,28,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i have been wearing a pedometer and counting my steps for over 4 years and this one is by far the most accurate i have had you do have to be careful not to hit the reset button accidentally but it is great to be able to glance down and check your progress without having to open it up,58,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i am a casual walker and found theeasy to use but both of the pedometers i bought mine and my husbands were lost within the first few weeks because the clip is not secure enough I am buying one more and this time I am going to use an extra safety strap,51,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,at first this pedometer seemed like a nice design with practical layout of controls and display but this is not the case i found three serious problems with this device 1 reset button placement and sensitivity result in frequent accidental resetting ofcount 2 the number display starting going after only three weeks with the single digit numerals gone in four weeks 3 plastic belt clip is very weak and broke in five weeks,75,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i have had four different pedometers sportline digiwalker omron and the freestyle tracer and the tracer was by far the worst the reset button noted by another reviewer has a hair-trigger response it resets way too easily and i have had the same problem with the pedometer resetting itself several times in a day i also wrote several times to the company to ask them about this and they never responded so all in all do not do business with freestyle how consumer reports rated this pedometer a best buy is beyond me the day the freestyle broke all i could think was good now i get to find a better one and in case you are wondering of the four the omron which was rated above freestyle but not a best buy has been a dream come true,139,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i could not be much more disappointed with thisthe reset button is ultra-sensitive and zeroizes several times daily so that i never get a chance to see exactly how far I have walked,33,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,this product did not hold up well i found that the numbers began to gradually disappear one little line at a time leaving it very difficult to read it is inexpensive but tracks all steps and did not discern between aerobic and non-aerobic walking like some of the newer pedometers do when it was working which it did for a few months it was moderatly accurate seeming to come within about 5 to 10 of actual steps taken it is inexpensive but i really would look at other brands models,91,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i bought the freestyle because consumer reports recommended this particular pedometer however i am ready to toss it out the window the reset button is much too large exposed and easy to use you hold it down for 3 seconds i have found that during my daily activities it gets reset without my knowledge this has happened more times than i can count and is very frustrating until the reset button is redesigned i would not purchase this product,79,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i have been using my pacer pro for years unfortunately i lost it and will be replacing it with another pacer pro small in size but big on perfomance will definitely buy again,33,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,this is the most accurate pedometer I have ever had i do have to be very careful when putting on my seatbelt and more so that i do not bump the button and clear all the info this has happened more than once and it ticks me off good product for the price,50,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,overall great product the belt clip cracked after a few days of use but still the pedometer is a greatand very accurate,24,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i did not like this pedometer it resets often so i never did get an accurate or even close count of my steps in a day or even in an hour i notified the company who i purchased it through on amazon and they admitted that this was a draw back and that i should try wearing it on my side instead of in front this may work i do not know i am using a different one the company i purchased the freestyle tracer blue pedometer from did ultimately through amazon offer to allow me to exchange the pedometer i do not want to go to that much trouble,108,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,this pedometer is advertised as having a sturdy belt hook it does not the hook broke after about 5 uses other than the flimsey hook it worked ok now it is useless,32,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,the freestyle pacer pro pedometer is great it is small lightweight and has a cover so that buttons are not accidentally pressed the display is easy to read it has several functions but i only use it for counting steps i have tried others but came back to this one,50,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i chose the freestyle tracer because of a best buy recommmendation by consumer reports i have not been disappointed the controls are easy to see and use I have had it for six weeks and have not had any problems with it great buy,41,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,freestyle tracer pedometer was rated quite highly by consumer reports they were pitted against many other pedometers in construction ease of use accuracy and longevity on each of these tracer received the highest ratings many of the other pedometers cost two or more times the cost of this pedometer and did not perform as well after reviewing many comments i purchased one myself i have not been even remotely disappointed in my tracker i find it to be spot on accurate the design and feel of wear is sound and with the price it was the absolute best i could have hoped for i wear it daily tracking my steps and calories and distance into my fitness program if you are looking for a top-notch pedometer buy this one,129,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,i noticed that my other pedometers were not catching all the steps that i made switching to this one greatly improved the accuracy of my day count the only disadvantage is that occassionally the pedometer will reset itself to zero this is due to the fact that the reset button is not covered by anything and may be pushed if i bend over or run into something,67,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i initially chose the freestyle tracer because of a very positive review from consumer reports it was in fact designated their best buy in the may 2007 roundup of pedometers the display is easy to read and the controls are very easy to use unfortunately the buttons are not protected with a covering so my counted steps were reset several times when a seat belt pressed the reset button for the required two seconds the belt clip is made of plastic and broke when i bumped the pedometer on a door frame I am afraid i can not recommend this product at all,101,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,4.0,positive,a close 2nd place for the best pedometer I have owned fairly easy to set up and very easy to use,20,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,1.0,negative,i ordered this because it had an excellent rating i must have gotten a lemon it was very inaccurate i am used to using a pedometer and was careful to fasten it properly to my belt but half the time it failed to register steps after a few months of use the labels on the various buttons were rubbed off,60,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,pedometer works safety leash broken asked for replacement never recieved reply,14,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i love my new freestyle tracerpedometer i read about in consumer reports and knew it was the right one for me i ordered it it came very quickly and programmed very easily some people hook it on their waistband or belt i wear mine in my sock i never realized how much walking i actually do doing the day this pedometer checks my steps miles calories burned and more it is super i highly recommend it cookie montgomery,79,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,i bought this pedometer so i could do the 10000 steps program i ordered it around christmas so i expected it to be late the invoice had the pedometer highlighted as well as the safety leash there was no safety leash trying to reach customer service at heart rate monitors was difficult i was holding on the phone at the same time i was holding for a rep online i must have wasted 30 minutes waiting it took them 3 weeks to send the leash customer service would get a 0 in my book the pedometer itself is very sensitive it is very easy to somehow reset the pedometer if you are going on a walk and want to know how far it is i suppose the pedometer would work fine but if you are doing the 10000 steps program and wearing it all day long during regular activities it will some how reset itself I am careful when i use the restroom that i do not touch the button i do not wear my purse on that side so it does not some into contact with the pedometer and the thing still resets itself very frustrating,193,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,5.0,positive,i like the size the screen is easy to read it is sturdy,13,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i simply bought these so i could easily detach my keys so when i drop my car off at the mechanic or go into the gym i think they are great-they came in a variety of colors and sizes i obviously do not think they will hold up if you were using them for more heavy duty purposes but for smaller things they are built well i am happy about my purchase,71,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,2.0,negative,cheap but get what you pay for somehow the clip came open and i lost what was on it would not recommend unless you use it to hold a piece of yarn,31,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,these are the worst mini-biners I have ever had the quality is less than what you might get at the dollar store the spring of one of them was broken when i got it the other one is so loose that you have to guide it closed,46,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,2.0,negative,seemed like a good deal until i got it and found that the small biners really are so small that they can not be used for anything i think one of them also broke quite quickly,35,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,if you purchase this you will receive only 2 of the smallest ones i contacted amazon and they are supposed to be working on the problem you do not receive what is described in the details,36,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i ordered this and got 1 pack of 2 the smallest size in this 5 set contacted amazon they responded quickly and were very nice and they said they shipped out another order supposedly this one with all 5 nope got the same 2 same size and all i thought ok maybe this is my fault i looked in the description no i was not wrong you are supposed to receive 5 biners in 3 different sizes so where are they I am not going to hold my breath,87,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i had the same experience as the reviewer m gianola 5 biners are clearly shown in the product picture and when my package arrived i had received a set of two small biners not sure why this happened but buyer beware,41,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,they work great as they are supposed to a variety of biners is always good to have in your vehicle or tool box,23,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,great little biners they arrived a day early and they are exactly what i expected i was not able to choose abut the two i got were a nice metallic cobalt blue,34,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,now i would not trust these to go rock climbing obviously but this is a great assortment of sizes for home or office use I have found them very handy in attaching some of my pets dishes or food bags to things without pockets,42,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,the biners are working out great to use to hold my keys and make a key tree to hold multi-sets of keys,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,i purchase this package expecting to receive 5 carabiners multipack as per the picture instead i received only two small 15 carabiners instead of 5 this is a ripoff,31,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i bought these to clip things on my backpack that i need handy access to they will not hold a lot of weight but they are pretty handy for light weight duty i also keep one of the tiny ones on my keychain to clip my keys to my purse strap belt loops and more,52,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,do what they are designed to do reasonable price for this may good selection of sizes obviously not for heavy use mostly for keys and more,25,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,cool little mini-biners are handy for about everything i keep them on my keys on my backpack and on my hennessy hammock they shipped fast i just wish i could pick the coler,33,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,1.0,negative,you only get two of them not the entire package the first one i used broke within 5 minutes just from being opened and closed,25,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,i used these carabiners to replace some other mini-carabiners they are good quality for the price they are notbearing,20,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,i was looking for a smaller option for keys these are definitely small if that is your goal these are for you the spring action is not as strong as i would like but that may be the trade-off for the size it works hopefully it holds up in the long-term,49,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,4.0,positive,goodbut the biners were red and not blue as in picture works great as a keychain to help seperate keys as needed,24,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NE085U,5.0,positive,i bought these carabiners to use while snow or sand camping to attach my deadman anchors to the normal tent stake postion as quick and easy as possible these are the perfect size and weight for my use and I am sure they would make a great key chain but beware they are very small so if you want something more robust you will have to spend teh money,67,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,1.0,negative,this thing is deeply misrepresented on here it is not the companies fault as i did not read the reviews prior to purchase to find out that this product is simply a bait and switch in the photos it looks like cast iron even in the description they say it is seasoned how do you season cheap pop metal seasoning is usually a sign of cast iron for the price you pay about 25 you should be receiving a cast iron lid given that most cast iron skillets this size are around 50 75 rip off,93,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,wish it was cast iron but it gets the job done and price is right,16,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,fits great on the bayou classic 20-inch cast-iron skillet,9,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,the matching skillet went back due to poor quality so the lid followed and went back to the seller shipping back cost about half of the lid price a solution for people who look for a huge lid like that will be to look for mexican stainless steel comal 50 mm will be 19685 inches,54,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,what has a pan skillet without a lid perfect,8,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,2 stars for the cheap knob that comes with the lid i barely tightened it and the threads stripped useless and the inner core is cheap plastic and will not tolerate heat i will purchase an all metal drawer knob that matches if i can find one i do not understand why they do not just go quality all the way i like the product and small thing like that gives me reason to question their quality,74,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,a perfect mate for the 18 iron skillet rounds things out and adds usefulness,14,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,1.0,negative,if i could I had give it no stars totally misrepresented by the picture looks like cast iron did not read the reviews I am a dummy not even worth the trouble to send it back paid 26 to learn a lesson do your research wanted a lid for my bayou classic 20 cast iron skillet which is great by the way did not think will not do that again,54,7

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,4.0,positive,the pan lid was great but the plastic knob fell off the top other than that it was great i just added a steel cabinet knob and it has been great for many years now a,36,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,5.0,positive,the lid works well and fits well it serves double duty at home the kids like to use it as a pretend shield i posted a video on you tube it is titled 20 lumberjack skillet,36,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000Q00PR2,2.0,negative,this lid is not cast iron it is made of a very light metal i bought it along with the 20 inch cast iron skillet when i found the skillet to be warped and sent it back i had to pay shipping to send this back so not only was it a cheapi had to pay to get rid of it next time i will be sure that myis from a different company and a better quality,81,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,i bought over 20 knives to examine and test for bug out bags we are building for survive doom google it the criteria we were looking for included price between 10 and 30 well balanced full tang high quality stainless steel blade that will hold anbetween 5 1/2 and 7 in blade length slightly trailing point for good game preparation and piercing qualities a medium hollow grind for good cutting and slicing qualities a riveted larger handle for a big hand and made of durable hardwood or laminated resin a good quality nylon or leather sheath this knife is a relatively hefty knife and for the price is adequate it is not one of the two knives we ended up choosing for our bug out bags but it is not bad it would do the job around the campsite,138,0

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,rolling on the floor laughing the 5 star reviews were obviously written by the seller mountain man eh any mountain man would rather hunt with a butterknife as it is likely not to fall apart my buddy purchased 3 of these for some boy scouts and this pos comes apart on it is own in the box comes warped and is fragile as peanut brittle just buy a mora,63,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,i like the knife the sheith was pretty cheap it tore very easy the wrap on it was not heavy enough needs to be stronger,25,19

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,piece of junk you will be embarased to show it to anyone reminds me of the fake pirate guns they used to sell in drug stores this would fit right in with those I have seen lawnmower blades that where cleaner this one looks like it was sharpened by micheal j fox on a bench grinder with a chip in the stone,60,22

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,thisis best described as a knife-shaped object it came quite dull and the steel is too soft to take a decenti would not try to cut anything with it a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one that said it suited my purposes as a stage prop very well and was about what i expected given the price the main reason I am deducting stars is because contrary to thedescription no sheath was included with the knife i received all i got was a small plastic cap for the point in summary this is a good option if you want something that looks like a knife but will not be used to cut anything if you want to actually cut things you should get something of better quality,133,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5.0,positive,this knife is awesome it is a 6 in blade with a wood and brass handle which is a good quality knife personally I am going to use it for hunting you can use it for whatever you want it is a great knife for a great price,44,28

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,bought 13 of these as gifts for the cast of a show i directed as they will mostly not be used for other than decorative purposes they were fine however at5 of the snap straps on the sheaths do not go around the handles snaps put on too far from the end which is annoying luckily i have enough leather working craft to fix them but still on at least three of the knives the pommel is loose and will turn almost 3/4 turn to tighten but will not go a full turn so these knives have loose handles / blades and feel sloppy / wobbly disappointing but they were cheap so there you go,111,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,i took this knife out on a over night trip and tried ti baton through a branch less than wrist sized and the blade rolled not thethe whole blade rolled to the side do not waste money on knives like these save up and get a decent knife of get a mora or a schrade if you are a cheapo,60,43

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5.0,positive,this was better than i expected it came sharp and the weight felt good in my hand fit well into holder,21,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,i buy expensive and a few inexpensive knives but i would not give 2 cents for this piece of crap the cheap wood handle does not align at any point with the guard or pommel looks like they used a wire brush and a rock to finish it the lacquer was stuck to the plastic the blade is misaligned with the guard the leather sheath is thin as paper and the stitching was do loose you can see an 1/8 inchoverall it was a complete waste of money in fact i will dig it out of the garbage and send it back whoever is selling this garbage should be ashamed,112,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,this knife while cheap is much cheaper than it is price not a good buy and i returned it no stars are really required,24,47

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,the overall construction seems very solid and considering the price it is a steal the handle is a tad bit misshaped but nothing major by any means could just be me being picky the gold parts on the ends of the wood were not in the best shape when i got it but the wood handle is beautiful and more than makes up for and blemish the sheath is lightweight and solid as well,73,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,5.0,positive,i was very pleased with this thank you so much also very fast shipping yes i for sure would recommend this to a friend,25,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,1.0,negative,paid almost 300 then shipping and that is what i got a 300 knife i really should not complain but really the pakis could have at least made the blade fit the handle properly did not expect it to be sharp it is not did not expect it to have anit do not,51,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,if you are looking at this knife and your thinking of purchasing it it means that you are focused on the price and not the quality i bought the knife thinking that it would be a decent quality because it has come from bud k i have bought several knives from bud k catalog this knife is the worst of all i have bought when you purchase or if you purchase this knife do not expect to get what you see in the picture provided blade is dull sheath is very poor quality and the handle is made of extremely poor quality wood only reason i did not give this blade one star is because it is the only blade of poor quality i have recieved from bud k all in all save your money and buy a decent blade bud kup your game,143,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,quality is good not a hunting knife but it will hold for those weekend trips blade needs sharpening but nothing too bad,22,54

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,i never said i do not like it for the price it is a good tool box knife evidently baboo bobott had a bad hangover at the factory that day and did not give a damn about making the wooden handle look nice the blade is decent and will cut stuff when i need it it is too bad a company sells a knife dirt cheap and then jacks up the shipping by 400 to make money off of a customer,86,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,not good rough handle bad workmanship barely aon it rough bad balance just what you would expect from a 10 blade save your,25,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for the knife has a very cheap leather sheath almost feels like thin cardboard but it works the handle on the knife had a big knot in it which made a void in it the price was less than 500 so well worth the price and a very good company to work with,58,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,worth the money sheath works but that is about it good feel and all in all a pretty good knife solid construction,21,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,this is a well made hunting knife for the price i think it is a great value it takes and holds anjust fine,25,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,i bought a bunch of these for under 10 again a decent piece of stainless on a child like grip with a pos sheath so what did i expect for 10 hey this was made by a 50 / day craftsman they could have spent a bit more on the handle or the sheath i was disappointed with several of these k exclusive brand knives,63,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,ok looking not sharp could at least put anonit but balance is nice definitley will have to sharpen the heck out of it but after all that said and done ship fast real fast ordered one day got two day later so that three day cool about all that thanks will order again and price are not bad either get some more knifes later yep,66,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,4.0,positive,when i received the product i was immediately dissapointed not only was it dull but the blade was bent to the left very noticeably throughout it is length the handle is very awkward to hold and the sheath is trashy i payed 11 dollars total for this knife mostly in shipping but that is far too expensive for the product i received if you can get free shipping and you really want this knife i can not stop you but i do not recommend this in any way update i sent the company a complaint telling them i was highly dissapointed in their product and in a couple weeks without any warning or notice a knew undamaged sharp knife arrived at my house free of charge great customer service,126,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,hey found this knife thought it would be ok because it was dirt cheap but if your looking for quality you want to pass on this jewel and admire it from a far the blade is cheap so save ur dollars and kick in some more that is worth getting,50,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,seeing all the negative reviews i was a little scared to buy this but i figured i would give it a try at this price i do not know what the other reviewers experiences were but my case came in one piece nicely packed in a box with multiple inflatable packaging around it the frame itself is great and just the right size for displaying a comic book i recently had signed it is made of very sturdy plastic i think i would have to work at it to break the front the back is a piece of black plastic that does not seem as strong and is probably the part that the other reviewers were claiming broke i can see how that could happen with neglect but it is definitely strong and sturdy enough to hang on the wall next time i need a comic book frame i will definitely be buying one of these,152,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,the part that allows you to hang it on the wall is poorly designed and broke the first time i mounted it on the wall plastic is high quality as the fall from 6 foot did not cause any further damage,40,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,great product and service always a pleasure doing business covers work great for modern age comic books makes it easy to hang them on the walls,26,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,the showcase is nice but it arrived broken i do not recommend his brand product this seems to be a consistent problem,24,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,I have ordered this product twice i am very pleased with the reasonable price and quality of the frame however both times i have ordered it it has come cracked save your time and spend a few extra dollars ordering from somewhere else,42,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,like others mine arrived with the clear front cover completely scuffed up and with a few small scratches to boot i was able to wipe away the scuff marks nothing i can do about the scratches not impressed overall it will do the job but certainly not for that price tag i would not pay more than 2 for this,59,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,these are great cheap easy pop in hang and display,10,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,was received cracked and it is not eligible for a return I had advise against ordering this one buyer beware,20,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1.0,negative,would return the product if i was allowed to,9,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4.0,positive,awesome way to proudly show off your comics my only problem was the display was a bit scuffed when i received it,22,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1.0,negative,should have listened to the other reviews it was completely scratched up totally ugly to look at no way am i hanging it up and of course returns are not accepted save your money everyone this might as well be a scam,41,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1.0,negative,it was broken when i got it very disappointed and it looks extremely cheap,14,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,great for showcasing off cool looking books not a preservation type case by any means but if you are like me and want to switch out a comic every month or two to hang on the wall this case is great,40,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4.0,positive,these hold the comics well and the blackmakes them stand out,13,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1.0,negative,do not buy this it got here quick but the box was all beat up before i even opened it i immediately noticed that the crystal clear cover was scuffed all over when i fully removed it from the box i saw the huge crack at the bottom wow I am returning it immediately and spending the extra money on a glass case,62,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,my comic book fan brother was delighted he had this to cover his newly autographed comic exactly what i needed,20,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4.0,positive,recieved the order very quickly but as i opened it it looks like the cover was scratched or more liked hazed light scratches luckily i was able to buff out,31,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,4.0,positive,had a few scratches but overall looks great,8,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2.0,negative,given the limited availability of an economical and yet sturdy comic book frame this frame is what you pay for it is cheaper price is reflected in the quality i received two of the three that i order broken the plastic clip on the bottom breaks easily even when packaged in a box with bubble wrap this frame does hold the comic books well for display but it comes with a caution of being very fragile,75,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,it is a giant plastic she shall made of two pieces so i can hang my comic on it is all i really needed,21,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5.0,positive,they came within the time that i was promised everything was intact,12,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,1.0,negative,arrived broken in 3 spots 2 on the black plastic 1 on the corner of the case thewas secured on one side with bubbles and box showed no obvious damage so I am not sure if it was shipped that way or what i should have read the other reviews,51,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this sleeping pad is not the one in the picture the pad is actually green and made of foam making it thin and cheap however the price is right so if you are only looking for level ground to sleep on this is fine if you want some cushion spend the extra,53,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,picture nor description matched what received in mail it was hard to obtain authorization to return as well,18,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,got this pad and it is nothing more than a piece of rolled up foam 3/8 thick there is not any cover or straps like the picture shows this product might be usefull to put under a real matt that you want to protect but an old cushion from a couch would work much better for the price it is a real rip-off,63,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i used this sleeping pad on a camping trip in the smokey mountains it was easy to use and kept my sleeping bag warm and dry it needs a little careful handling although as it is not fire retardant and scratches easily,41,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,received this inflated opened valve and air swooshed in and was shocked it was only 3/4 inch high when fully inflated thought oh great this is going to kill my 50ish year old back completely shocked when it is compact construction supported my frame on hard floor w / sleeping bag without making my sore perfect this is going with me on a 3-day 60 mile walking event in august great product,69,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great especially for the low price a great source of closed-cell foam,12,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,not at all what i was expecting the product is like insulation foam kinda crunchy not like the soft foam i was expecting this may work if you are doing a relaxed camping trip with your family but i was planning to use it on a backpacking trip the foam is quite stiff so i doubt you would be able to roll it up again and tightly pack it i was planning to return thebut the return shipping fee is almost the price of the product itself so now I am stuck with a sheet of insulation foam i do not know what to do with,107,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,ok so i read the reviews and ordered it anyway as i simply wanted to cut it up and use it as packing material for shipping my bicycle however it is not even up to the quality of what i expected for this purpose laughably bad,45,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,really cheap it is nothing but a thin sheet of light closed cell foam like you would get for packaging with no ties would not do much for comfort i use an air mattress for camping and this does suffice as a thermal insulator still i feel like i got 75 cents worth of packaging for the price would not buy again,60,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,cheap and slippery you get what you pay for,9,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great foam indeed lots of reviews state that this foam is horrible for camping and they are probably correct but this foam is perfect for larping the foam is sturdy enough to survive beatings and is soft enough to hit people with i have made 20 weapons and 1 suit of armor and the foam has never failed me yet it might not serve it is purpose for camping but for larping no foam exceeds it,75,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it is not an air bed for someone that needs a bit of cover on the ground it works just fine,20,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,good quality comfortable but not sure how durable it will be my daughter used it for camp sleeping in a sleeping bag on the ground seemed to work for her but do not think it would work well outside of a tent directly on the ground,45,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this was not at all as expected it is a thin white mat and does not help protect against the cold hard ground at all you need two of these at least to cushion you at all,37,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,way too thin to be worth the money do not purchase,11,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,the price is very good the only downside to this mat is there are no straps to keep it rolled and it is a bit difficult to roll this one tightly minor inconvenience to not have these things in order to pay a much cheaper price,46,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this is bubble wrap i am appalled that coleman put their name on this product,15,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i thought this was going to be similar to the old boy scout style pads which were truly foam but this is nothing more than packing material it almost seems like the outside layer is going to tear when rolled / folded i bought this for a child to use and it really is not sufficient padding / durability the ridgerest pads for a few bucks more are a much better choice for cheap kids pads,71,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,arrived just as promised all description true to form,9,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this pad iis just a sheet of packing material what a hilarious joke coleman is playing on the public,19,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i use this as an underlayment when hammock camping and it is great it does not seem very strong so I had waver before using on the ground but in a hammock it is great it provides a little stiffness but also deforms nicely to the shape of the hammock if you like your bedroll to flatten the hammock out this is not the pad for you it is also incredibly light weight i wish it rolled up a little tighter but that is a pretty minor quibble,81,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not really what i was expecting i feel like it is the same stuff they pack electronics in not very high quality i was thinking it would be a thicker foam but it is more like a bubble wrap,37,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this is the cheapest flimsiest mat possible it is the low quality type of plastic normally used for packing around tvs and such would not recommend or buy again,29,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,just go to the store and buy some foam basically that is all that is to this not worth it,18,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,my grandson used it twice already on his boy scout trips and loves it,14,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,cheap packing foam let me repeat cheap packing foam it was 9 bucks so I shall live with it i guess i would not be happy had i paid 15 for this junk coleman should be embarrassed,34,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,best deal around for foammaterial I have made many a winter-camping accessory from these pads,16,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it is literally a piece of foam wrap like you would use when moving dishes or other fragile items even at this low price it still annoyed me when i opened the box it will definitely be going back,39,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i was not expecting much but this is worse than the ozark 6 brand you can get at walmart i did not think you could get more basic than the ozark brand but i was very wrong,35,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,excellent for my purpose padding for the rifle ammo boxes cuts down on tip damage and rattling,17,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,great product does the job it is expected to do fast shipping as well,14,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,came a couple day ago but i will not be using until spring,13,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,thisis just great placed it on tufted coach and under a quilt it is has a very comfortable place for one to rest or sleep also great to change infant,32,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,simple synthetic mat easy to roll and kept us warm,10,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,it is not the old true blue closed cell it is more aqua and has a different texture and feel but it does the same thing i do not think that it is as good a heat retainer as the older closed cell but that is a feeling and i have no proof that this is the case,56,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,used this pad to make boffing swords it worked great and is withstanding a lot of usage,17,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,this is the best money I have spent camping i used these on my air mattress and we never got cold once i can not say anything bad about these I have been freezing cold before with out anything on the air mattress and after these i will not the best to stay worm if you have an air mattress i will never go camping with out these again well worth the money only one con is what to do with them when your done with them their not easily stored but that is not bad at all,94,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,unfortunately these mats are pretty low quality however are cheap so i guess you get what you pay for,19,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it is a piece of foam not sure what else there is to say i put this under the foyer of my tent when camping so when i kneel down my knees do not get wrecked by sticks rocks and such,39,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,very thin reminds me of packing cushion not very comfortable the worest is trying to store and travel with it does not come with anything to keep it rolled up,30,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,hard to believe that something is still made in the united states that being said i bought this with the forethought to cut it up for padding between my camera lenses while in storage containers for that purpose it worked great and i gave it 5 stars on the other hand i am big into the outdoors and if you want this for camping it is cheap and will not insulate you to any degree of comfort do not be cheap with your sleep get a good pad this is not it it would be ok as an added layer of foam but that is about it,103,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it is literally a piece of garbage i do not really know who uses this camp pad in camping a lot of better options at almost the same price,27,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i was a little disappointed in how budget this was when it arrived but i got to use it this past weekend for the first time and it did great stayed put in my hammock and if I had roll off it or scoot myself away from it i could notice the temp difference so this definitely did it is job I shall use it until it falls apart then upgrade to an inflatable,71,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,exactly what i needed foam to use as an insulator,10,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,very bulky cheap not worth taking on hike,8,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,we used this as padding for a knights armor worked perfectly,11,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,it is basically just thick packing foam it will do as far as getting you directly off the ground but you would probably be better off spending a little extra for one of the nicer pads they should probably post better photos,41,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,perfect for my sleeping bag when used with an inflatable protects the inflatable foam from rocks and more no chemical odor,20,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i would not buy again even although it was inexpensive to thin,12,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this mat is terrible it makes me ashamed for what the coleman brand has become it is basically a sheet of packing material no one would want to sleep on this,31,49
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,this is probably the cheapest of cheap sleeping pads there are as many have stated this is little more than a piece of foam shipping mat i purchased it to take for my dog to sleep on during a backpacking trip i bought it because it was cheap and light weight when i received it i could not believe how thin and stiff it was does not even compare to a thermarest or any other camp mat for that matter i cut it down to fit the dog and brought it along i felt terrible for the dog for making him sleep on it and it is never coming on a trip like that again spend the extra money this seems like something more suited for an arts and crafts project or use as packing material than a sleep support mat,138,50
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,it was fine just the size was big enough,9,51
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,the picture is a bit misleading the actual product is a large rectangle of what appears to be a packing foam of some sort while it really seems to take theoff anything hard underneath you i can not help but feel like i might have been better off with the stansport alternative which is slightly smaller and rolls up better with built-in straps,64,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,arrived as listed seems okay have not used it for sleeping while camping,12,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,not what i expected it is only a thin piece of foam no good for camping the ground at my camp site was not rocky but it was hard it hurt my hip bone to lay on my side,40,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,i do not use it for camping but it would make a good camping pad it is impervious to moisture light it is thin but that is the name of the game,28,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,completely different material than what was ordered too thin and flimsy would not order again i would not recommend this for anything as other companies make a sturdier thicker and more cushioned material this is more like packing peanuts in a sheet the product sent was also not the coleman brand but a cheaper brand,54,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this pad is much thinner and seems more temporary than what i expected i definitely have buyers remorse not worth 10,21,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,this worked perfect on the camping trip i took light weight and easily stowed would recommend for those going hiking or roughing,22,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,it was way thinner than i expected i am a wildland fire fighter and this is not meant for actual camping,21,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i wanted a thin pad to use for a product and I have used this sort of inexpensive sleeping bag pad in the past this is thinner and cheaper than i realized and i expected it to be thin and cheap i am amazed coleman will put there name on crap like this,52,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,it was just as i ordered and it is going to fit well in the sleeping bag it is the right size thank you,24,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,pros it is cheap in price yet feels solid and provide adequate cushion rolls up and fits on my pack cons it is bulky when rolled up and on the pack theis pretty weak unless baby blue is your thing but hey it was 9 bucks size this is sized to match the average sleeping bag I am 510 and 175 lbs and i fit on it nicely no overhang but not too much extra room on the sides it does however have about 3 - 5 inches of room at the end I am planning on shaving off to reduce the size,99,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not worth it unless you are on some really soft ground i was camping on hard clay and a thin layer of grass and these did close to nothing,29,63
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,good mat next time i am going to buy the thicker one the older i get the hard the ground gets,21,64
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,i got this pad to place underneath my more expensive camp pads to protect the foam it serves this purpose well,21,65
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,i just received one of these sleeping pads in the mail all they did was cut out a section of foam padding and stick it in a box it is not made by coleman and very poor quality i wish i would have read the reviews before hand,48,66
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,my grandsons really like these it seems to make the sleeping bags stay warmer it also makes the ground softer for grandpaw,22,67
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,not very comfortable only slightly better than laying directly on the hard ground if space is an issue during packing for a camping trip this will definitely be the 1st thing left behind does not provide enough comfort to justify the amount of space it will take up like other reviews state this is basically packing material the advertised photo makes it look like a higher quality pad than it actually is i only added it to my cart to get a 20 discount so it was not a loss for me however I had be upset if i actually spent 1499 on it should be sold for 5 just spend a few extra bucks and get something that is actually good quality,120,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i was hoping these were the same material as the classic blue sleeping pads just without the straps but they are not they are rather just like cheap packing foam they are firm as advertised perhaps even too firm but get damaged very easily,42,69
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,I am not a big camper so i did not really know what to look for but i have a bad back so i wanted some sort of padding if you just want something between you and the ground then this is good for you if you are looking for any kind of comfort this is not for you in the end my tent-mate had an air mattress so i do not know what this feels like to sleep on but i can say i was not looking forward to trying to sleep on it,91,70
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,i was very satisfy with theand the speedy delivery my son was very please and eager to use it,21,71
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,you know my husband has a coleman camping pad that we are really happy with and i wanted to get another one i usually love to shop at amazon but while i was researching if this is the same pad we already have it is not this is only 3/8 of an inch thick i saw it on the coleman site for 999 was surprised to find a lower price so while i do not have this pad i gave it 2 stars based on getting it cheaper somewhere else and believing that our pad which is nearly an inch thick is great and 3/8 of an inch must really leave something to be desired i guess if you are a hiker and are space-conscious it is better than nothing but if a few more inches when rolled up does not cause you inconvenience i would look for the thicker pad,147,72
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,if this pad had been a few inches longer it would have gotten 5 stars from me it is not super cushy so you need a flat and smooth place to lay it on but it does provide some cushioning against the hard ground we got this to use as an isolation mat not for it is cushioning and it does that job exceptionally well it is wide enough to easily fit a thick adult on it from shin to head i am 510 and keep the ground from sucking all the heat out of you the bottom side of me was the warmest side of me while laying on this mat and that was in 35 nights so i would guess that even at cooler temperatures it would do a good job of insulating your body from the cold ground for the price it can not be beat for it is insulating properties but if you are looking for a feather bed affect this is not the mat for you,165,73
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,this is essentially packing material that is being falsely advertised as a sleeping pad uncomfortable and made of very cheap material this pad is as good as sleeping on the rocks it is not worth even a dollar please do not waste your money buying this product,47,74
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,not the best pad i have ever slept on i used it on a recent hike to the smokies and it really did not help insulating body warmth but hey it is great for the price it is very light and could barely feel it on my hike if you happen to be on a budget like i was when i bought this then yes go for it if you are not and are willing to buy a better quality pad then go for it,82,75
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,i was a little dissapointed about how thin this product was it gives very little padding however it is travel friendly and gives slight padding,25,76
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,the picture is not what i recieved from the seller what i recieved is a simple 3/8 green closed cell foam mat that i passed up on at wal-mart the picture shows a quilted pad with ties attached sold by true value what a joke the seller didnot state any thing about equivalent substitutions in the ad so let it be known that true value is not a reputable seller and let the buyer beware,74,77
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i bought this tent at an army surplus store for a big game hunt have yet to use it for that but I have spent numerous nights in it outside I shall admitt it is a little tricky to use right out of the package but once aquainted with set up it is bliss to sleep in keeps rain bugs and uneven cold ground out of the equation you will need extra rope for the main supports string for the canopy support and you shall have to store all but the smaller gear underneath the hammok also a pillow not for your neck but for under your knees the curve of the hammok stresses them a little hope this helps,114,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,ok this hammock does require extra rope to even set up it may seem ungainly at first but if you are patient with it you will be rewarded i reccomend using a very sturdy rope to set up the wight bearing portion of the hammock i just use fishing line a spool of it would seem useful in a backpacking situation anyways to hold up the netting and top tarp it is sort of scary to get into but if set up properly and entered with care is actually pretty comfortable inside i think it is great for backpacking or camping where you need to be off the ground very light and takes very little space be smart and you will have no problems btw i weigh about 220 lbs and have no problems with it,133,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,we bought this hammock in march 2010 and did not even take it out of the box and use it until august i would give it 0 stars if i could after one use the seams of the straps that attach to the ropes began to pull apart from the body of the hammock making for a very dangerous situation if someone were not to inspect and notice it before climbing in the one person who used it that one time was far under the weight limit the manufacturer rates the hammock so that was not the issue this is an extremely dangerous product granted for the price you do not expect the quality to match the best on the market however that is entirely not the issue at any price you have the right to expect safety if used within the guidelines the manufacturer sets for the product if someone were to climb in and the straps were to snap a major back or other injury could result i notified amazon and they stated they have had complaints about thisi guess not everyone takes the time to write a review i can only hope they remove it from their inventory,201,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,i bought this hammock for local hiking trips and maybe an overnighter like the other person stated it is a pain in the neck to set up yes you will need extra line to set it up and it is not wide enough this thing is better suited to be set up as a ground based mosquito proof shelter why would you do that if that is the case then just buy a net and save on time money and the added extra weight of this junk i do not reccomend this cheap alternative to buying something better like a hennessy or other quality name brand hammock,106,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,pros not much it is cheap and has a mosquito net attached zippers seams and stress points are relativley sturdy although I have only used it twice so far less bulky than carrying a sleeping pad and tent cons there are no directions on how to set this hammock up normally it would seem like a no brainer as most hammocks come out of the box with the suspension ropes intertwined / braided into the actual hammock but this hammock does not you get the hammock the canvas net nylon and seperatley the rope and metal rings you need an additional 30 feet of rope to suspend the mosquito net and nylon roofing no way is this rain worthy as is you need to get an additional tarp plus another 20 feet of rope heavy especially with all the additonal rope and tarping pretty narrow on the inside especially with the net zipped up and inside a sleeping bag,152,4

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,theof this thing is actually better than how it works i took this on a three night trip in the mountains of west virginia it was pretty cold do you know why there are signs before bridges that say bridge freezes before road well that is because there is cold air going over and under the bridge thereby making the bridge colder same thing happens while sleeping in a hammock it is cold furthermore if you move in your sleep and i mean at all you will wake up constantly trying to reposition yourself one time i woke up and the entire hammock had shifted to where i was laying on the mosquito net portion of the hammock overall very cheap fabric and just not a practical solution to camping in the woods,134,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,seems to be great piece except u have to buy some extra pieces which they do mention,17,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,for the price i would recommend this you need a little patience and common sense to use it but it does work well tip when you string it up put all the weight / tension on the bottom ropes put hardly any weighton the mosquito netting because the straps will break and the hammock will suddenly drop until the main ropes pick up thewas well worth the entertainment factor for a boy scout who did not trust me,79,19

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this is very cumbersome to use getting in and out of it if you are anything over 5 - 9 it is too small,20,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,awesome tent a lot of people complained about not being able to close the zipper once you get inside you need to hang the netting using 1/8 bungee cord not rope this allows the tent netting and canopy to flex the only issue i had with this is that we camped at 11000 feet during a really cold and rainy week i brought a small tarp with me to cover the hammock that kept me dry but when the wind blew it got cold specially underneath it the answer to the problem was to use an emergency blanket to keep the wind from penetrating my sleeping bag the other issue was finding 4 trees spaced right to hang it tried using 2 connections and the hammock was not as stable once i connected it at 4 points it worked awesome,139,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,this is product is good in theory setting it up for the first time for summer camp was the only time it was used the mosquito netting tore very easily and the zipper pull fell off leaving the product zipped up there was no fixing it to make it useful and therefore other sleeping arrangements had to be made at the last minute,63,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,wonderfulit is a lot better then sleeping on the ground i am not sure if they make a two person one i would buy it in a heartbeat and would and have told everyone about this,39,27

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,my husband was very impressed with the quality and how easy it was to put up need to make sure the trees are far enough apart or it will sink to the ground,33,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this hammock was a bit more narrow than i expected laying on it as designed i found that my arms were prone to just fall over the sides unless i crossed my chest mummy-style with them the bag that it came with ripped on the first use and i was intentionally trying to take it easy on it the ropes that tie together on it seemed a bit iffy some fraying going on combined with the material which i knew before i purchased I had say this is nothing but maybe a bargain basement hammock,96,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,on my last 4 day kayak trip i wanted to have the hammock with mosquito netting but it flipped me out on the first night and the mosquito netting came undone the second night i would not recommend thisto anyone buy an eno or a hennessy they are worth the money in the long run,57,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,awful not stable at all you have to be a less than 150 to sleep on this if your any bigger it is not stable i threw it in the trash,33,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,this is a good hammock but it does not come with the necessary hanging equipment i had to buy that else where brings the cost to the same as my other hammock which i like better this hammock provides a better view of what has around you the other hammock kinda blocks your view of everything but the sky heres the link to the other hammock i bought as well as this one the skeeter beeter comes with everything you need and is harder to fall out of,89,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,very durable but kind of small good for it is uses although outdoor shelters are hard to find this one is well built just take a tarp with you if you are going into a high rain risk,37,36

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i have to admit this tent is a little complicated to set up until you get used to it but it is a great tent especially in the south where mosquitoes and insects are plentiful most of the year,39,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,i purchased this in thinking it would be more like a cot than a hammock and then to use as a tent was wrong about both we set it up hung and it did not come out looking nothing like the picture the bottom did not lay flat like the picture shows it was all bunched up and not very wide at all and when attempted to get in it it was very hard to do since the zipper is on theof the bottom and when i finally was able to get in it it flipped so we tried to set it up like a tent since it shows that you can do that to well it did set up kinda like a tent if you peg the bottom down to the ground tight like your suppose to forget getting in it that is for sure and then if you get it loose enough to get in you have to crawl on the ground to get in since as i said before the zipper is on the bottomneedless to say i sent it back also it does not come with hangers or pegs,195,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,my son went to sleep in it at scout camp and top part was not sewn correctly and ripped only had 10 mins use will have to send out and pay to have it fixed,35,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,got this for backpacking a little heavy for pack my husband packs it in his pack due to weight of it it does a good job in keeping out rain and bugs just be careful at bedtime not to move much or you will flip over so we staked each corner down with tent stakes seemed to fix problem yes i would recommend it anyone,65,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,slept in this hammock for a week at boy scout camp very comfortable easy to set up it could be a little wider and the fabric over the top could be a little heavier to better repel water but with three sides open essentially the whole thing is not water proof but this material is nearly a sieve for the price however can not beat it,65,45
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,back in the 50s i remember sleeping in jungle hammocks at girl scout camp i purchased this for my grand children and now want to order one for myself i received this in a matter of days,35,46
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,this was a gift for my nephew and it was put up in his room which is used all the time it is well made and durable i would recommend this hammock to a friend I shall probably buy another one for camping,41,47
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,this is nice and i feel better knowing nothing will be crawling on me but there are no directions and i can not find any to hang this model plus we do not have enough rope to hang the hammock and since the screen does not zip off all the way we can not use it without hanging the screen so we are looking for rope or bungis to attach the top of the screen if it were able to disconnect then we could use it with out the screen until we got the extra roping,96,48
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i absolutely love this thing a real life saver the only thing i would advise others to do is by some extra rope but other than that this is a awesome hammock,31,49

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,difficult to set up requires a lot of tweeking to get it right very narrow and hard to fit into it is okay for a child or smaller person but for a bigger guy with broad shoulders no way price was okay functionality was just overall bad,46,52
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,at first this looked to be a promising solution to a problem i was having whilst hiking after receiving this product and opening the box to examine it is contents i was eager to test this product when i was setting the hammock up the loops on each end of the hammock which bunch the ends to form the typical hammock upon hand testing the sag of the hammock i am not quite sure what the material actually is which supports the ends of the hammock however i am sure that this product would not stand up to even the most modestunfortunately I shall be returning this product as soon as possible,112,53
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,waste of money you will never get it to look as good as the picture shows cheap material extremely hard to set up,23,54
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,this is a very good hammock similar to one i used in viet nam these hammocks are designed for physically fit young soldiers not typical american heavyweights extra large people should stick to tents or motor homes for us that stay in good shape it is a great hammock happy camping,46,55
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,barely wide enought for an adult needs to at least be 1 1/2 times it is current size very dissapointed in this hammock,22,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this hammock looks great from the outside however it is very cheaply made when i set up the tent it was hard to get the right height and was very uncomfortable to get into pros it is cheap for what it is it is easy to carry around has a decent mosquito net cons does no tome with rainfly shown in some of the pictures the side netting tore little they do not come with ropes to set it up and the entire thing is just uncomfortable it is extremely narrow on the inside it is not fully water proof overall i would recommend steering away from this hammock and spend the money on a bigger better hammock,113,57
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,it is been sitting in my closet for 2 years still do not know how to set it up and do not want to spend that much energy trying i do not know about durability or waterproof but it feels like canvas,38,58
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,i just got it and so far it appears to be rugged material not cheep stuff i was surprised at the quality compared to the price I had get another one as far as walkin in the deep woods and needing a place to take a nap there is no better way than off the ground in a mosquito net i saw a review saying it was cheep he was not honest i know cheep and hate it i will say there is not the canvas that is in the picture and no extra rope to tie it to a tree it also says there is no directions if you can not figure how to tie a not to a tree stay at home but it looks like it is well worth buying,130,59
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,received this product and the construction was poor strings were loose everywhere and the zipper kept snagging it was also quite small and I am 55 135 lbs which is hard to do avoid this and get something of better quality and larger size,43,60
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,was poorly packaged and would not want to get caught in a thunder storm with it very light material and cheaply made texsport wilderness hammock with mosquito netting,29,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,as long as your under 6 foot and 250 pounds this mosquito hammock is fine when used with a rainfly over the top yes it takes a few hangs before you get it right remember to tie it up high but straight across use the roof only to block sun a rainfly is needed as with all the topend hammocks out there it is a must have you have a canvas bottom which means less chance of a mosquito bite from below as compared to a nylon hammock a bit heavier but still packable not very wide but for the normal size person you can lay flat or on your side with no problems a pad and a sleeping bag makes this a winner works pretty good on the ground as well with cot or bottom cloth it does everything the big boy hammocks do at a much cheaper price ofcourse you can not brag you spent 30000 on your hammock but do you really want to video available [ ],167,62
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,esta rede funciona bem para ambientes tropicais somente no dei 5 estrelas por que ela vem sem o cordame necessrio para a sua montagem mas nada que no se consiga comprar bem barato em casas de material de construo e o preo muito bom,44,63

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,unless you intend to give thise to a child with the expectation of it being lost or destroyed i would not purchase this the belt was a cheap cotton material and the eyelets tore out easily the ones that remained started to rust after a light rain the pouch is almost the same material the canteen itself is very thin cheap tin with some sort of cheap parkerizing on it it scratches off easily and dent readily if dropped mine fell off a shelf and dented on a tree branch 2 below it this is were the parkerized was scratched thisis not durable does not seem like it would last a very long time and i forsee the belt tearing apart the only good thing about it was i was able to give it to my friends son for when he plays army this saves my friends good canteens from being lost or destroyed due to youth,159,6

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,great product I am using it primarily as a costume prop but the canteen is very spacious and I shall certainly be using it as it is intended to hold water the only negative thing i can say is that the canteen metal is thin and may dent easily i do not think it is aluminum but it may be thin steel,58,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,4.0,positive,the produce is not as robust as real military issue especially the belt but it is adequate the canteen and cover are quite good,24,11

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,5.0,positive,i would save your money and go to a military surplus store both the belt and the canteen are not of the quality that was expected from the description and photo i suppose it would make a cool toy for a child to play with in the back yard the belt could be described more as a plush fabric accessory rather than a pistol belt it certainly will not be the belt to hold my pistol off to the surplus store to get something functional at least it was delivered quickly i have enough time before going to alaska to purchase something that will work with a large caliber handgun,109,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001CWCISM,1.0,negative,the canteen is a cloth covered thin aluminum canteen on a thin web belt with a soft metal slip clip should cost 5 with free shipping at the most okay for indoor use but would not take it camping the canteen halves appeared to be pressed together instead of welded i own several canteens built for real world camping so i know a piece of cheapo junk when i see one,70,14

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1.0,negative,i bought these under the pretense that they were cheap and i could install them in a few seconds before my trips to the woods worst decision i ever made with 15 not only are they flimbsy terribly made but not a single gun out of my collection will fit in these things the diameter of the hooks is only about 1 1/2 icnhes wide no shotgun or any ar or carbine style rifle will fit only my rem 700 would fit but the scope rubbed on the roof and it would not fit in the bottom so it was out of the question as well only a pellet gun also the bottom hooks are so close to the top hooks that not even a pellet gun will fit inside i only recommend if you wanted to spend a solid hour dremel in hand as i did increasing the diameter and cutting an inch of the bottom hooks other than that do not buy go with the roof rack or a seat hanging bag just as long as you do not go with these,181,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5.0,positive,i have a rv travel trailer with a full pass thru with a door on each side inside the space on one side the panel is braced with 1x1 boards on the top and bottom these fit right into those grooves no drilling no glue or any sticky attachments intalled in minutes protects my fishing rods from bouncing around or getting damaged by other items in the cargo area during transport i recommend for added protection you use a velcro strap around each end for added stability to make sure the rod stays put and just prevents the rod from bouncing out of the rack this product is made in the united states and that is why i bought it,118,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5.0,positive,the easiest rack ever no need for tools no damage to vehicle installs so easy it can be installed removed and reinstalled again at anytime umbrellas canes fishing poles or guns just a great rack,35,4

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5.0,positive,i changed out the hardware that came with it other than that these are perfect and hold a lot of weight,21,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2.0,negative,i got these to put in the back window of my pickup they are pretty flimsy and it seemed like no matter what i did i could not get them to stay in place i wanted to be able to set my m1a in these but the hooks were not wide enough for her i know that an m1a is a bit bigger of a rifle than most a mans gun if you will but these hooks were a solid 3/4 too narrow i may end up drilling and tapping the metal near the window and running a screw through these i might also just not worry about it and just mount these in the workshop to keep the guns I am working on off of the desk if you are just going to put small rifles or ones that you will not mind falling then these are decent if not i would recommend getting some more serious gun racks,154,14

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1.0,negative,they work ok but no matter how much you push and make them tight they will still move around the will tilt as you hang items on them some times when placing a gun on it one may completely come out also the adjustment is only to the distance from the top holder to the roof so you can not adjust the distance from the bottom nor can you adjust between the j holders foget about using the bottom holders if your seats have any type of head rest too they maybe ok if your using it for an 80s truck or older or maybe on the back side glass of a suburban,112,89

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4.0,positive,it took several tries before i realized the ends really needed to be pushed hard behind the back glass trim i am not sure i would even have tried to push them that hard if i had a new truck but in the old work truck i was willing to risk it i should also say that i use these for carrying plans and a 4 level both of which are lighter than a rifle or shotgun but i would hazard the guess that it sould support a firearm with no problem,92,95

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,4.0,positive,a lot of people do not like the new chromatically organized colors i find that it definitely helps with choosing colors but slows you down a little when looking for a specificnumber there is an index in the back that helps you look up colors it tells you which page to look on this adds a little time to finding theyou need but not too much my only complaint is that the paper is very thin i feel like i am going to rip the paper ever time i use the book i know i will have to break out the scotch tape in the near future,110,5

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,after using pantones for the last 10 years this is by far the worst product i have ever bought the stock is light and will not stand a commercial environment for any length of time we use these books to work with the numbers of reference make no sense at all most people use numbers to reference in a consecutive manner pantone was on acid when they designed this as it is just a jumbled mess with no rationale at all if this is this company moving forward with a new product their days are numbered and i will certainly not be buying another product from them ridiculous simon,114,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,the paper quality of the stock is terrible i borrowed an older version from a friend and the quality was much better the new one is thinner and softer making it difficult to slide open and compare colors this is too flimsy not worth the price,46,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,2.0,negative,i am so upset about the newly organized pantone plus series forumula guides the colors are no longer in numerical order but are organized byso anyone familiar with pantone colors will be pretty frustrated there is an index in the back with the colors listed in numerical order with page numbers but the page numbers are located on the lower left corner of the book which makes finding the right page way more difficult than it should be the page numbers have always been on the lower left but in 25 years of using pantone books i can not say I have ever noticed or needed to use the page numbers i can see where organizing bywould be more user friendly for new users but for the majority of us it is a huge pain it would be nice if they would offer an option with the colors organized in numerical order in the meantime i may take out the screw post and re-order the pages of my guides that should be a fun weekend activity,177,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,1590651669,1.0,negative,if you are used to the old pantone books you will absolutely hate the new books the stock is literally paper thin it is so flimsy I am afraid to look for abecause I am afraid I am going to tear the book the order is new and if your used to the old way you will not like it either my number one reason to not get it is the stock i called pantone today because they came out with a new book called designer field guide i thought maybe they listened and made thicker stock nope same stock i told him i refuse to buy a new book until they change the stock,113,14

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,5.0,positive,earlier this year my husband and i painted the outside of our house we were a bit nervous because we have a significant amount of trim on the house this made it much easier to paint the trim a darkerthan the main part of the house without bleeding the dark paint onto the light paint naturally we needed to wipe the paint off the trip guard when moving it from one place to another but that was not a big deal just have some rags handy for that and this little gem will make your painting job a lot easier,101,2

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,2.0,negative,works best for quick small applications you need to wipe it off frequently before the paint dries and after use if you intend to use it again simply a small piece of flexible plastic that is way overpriced,38,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00004YNLA,2.0,negative,i did not really get the results i wanted from this product it easily allowed paint to go underneath and made the painting process messy and longer than it should have been I have had much better results with tape,38,21

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,I have had this exact set for about 2 years now and it comes in so handy I have used the screwdriver several times with no trouble it has all the bits you could ever use unlike some other sets it is very easy to put the parts back in the spot they belong yet the case is compact and stores easily I am going to buy another,64,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,it was broken in the box the screwdriver only operates in one direction which is fine unless you want to use it my second bad experience with allied do me wrong once shame on you do me wrong twice shame on me will not be a third time,47,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,over the years i have had many tool sets especially socket sets there has a reason for that sockets easily fall out of the case when you open them and it is hard to keep things organized not so with this set each tool is secure in it is own place no falling out and getting lost in addition the quality of the tools seems excellent with both sae and metric sizes this is a really nice set and the price is right,84,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i decided to purchase a real socket wrench set after i knocked my 15 year old cheep-o set on the floor one too many times and got tired of putting everything back in the case first let me say that this case is designed so that when you knock this set on the ground all the sockets stay in place second this set is very well made and thought out for instance the metric and standard allen wrenches are different colors so you can tell them apart at a glance these wrenches fit the hand just right and are a pleasure to use i highly recommend them,109,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i learned that with tools you can buy something on the cheap and it gets the job done the first time but if you ever need to use it again and again it will end up being very inconvenient or simply quickly breaking on you and you will find yourself spending money again this set falls into that category I have been using these at work for some minor jobs here and there and even for that they have proven insufficient first the case is very cheaply made and it is almost impossible to remove / return pieces back into the molds you pretty much have to hammer the dies in / pry the taps with a screwdriver second there has something not right about the tightening mechanism of the tap handle which makes the taps loosen after a couple of turns and thereforeto the side during a cut third and most importantly the dies are brittle we have 3 or 4 pieces with missing / snapped teeth a good tool not only gets the job done it is also a pleasure to use this tap and die set is neither,182,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the pliers are super cheap junk and the case is really bulky for throwing in my jeep,17,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,my review is for the tap and die set man i hate giving products one star reviews but i really wanted to on this one in this case you get what you pay for at best i suppose the taps are ok but the handles are just garbage the smaller one can not really be tightened down enough to actually hold the tap the larger one is not much better the pieces do not fit into the slots in the box very well i do not use this set very often but i dread when i do have to use it echoing some of the other comments light duty only for those not really needing to tap things very often,117,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i was throughly disappointed with this kit it is a piece of crap and I am looking for a kit that will work I am afraid to buy and buy until i get a decent kit to use,36,12

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,have not had much use for this tap and die set so far my dad was kinda scared to use it since it said tap and die I am like no dad if you tap it you will not die i said it is called a tap and die now tap it dad and you die hopefully we will use it soon not sure how and when maybe i can throw and tupper tap and die set party with some electrical contractors and ya know who knows,84,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,case is cheap and sockets are only secured by gravity but that seems to be the norm for these types of tool sets,23,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the second time i finally used the ratchet it broke the second time i used it trash product,18,17

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,received thisand it was missing the tap wrench i opened it at the time i needed to use so it is basically useless to me,27,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the tools are a bit cheap but useable and i knew that in the cost the problem is that the case is complete junk it barely holds anything in place and each time i close it i have to put all the tools back into their place,47,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,do not buy this product unless you want to just throw your money away i have broken 2 taps that should not have broken now i have to drill these out can not return because i did not start my project until return window had closed buy quality taps let me be your lesson learned crap crap crap,57,21

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,great tool for general tap and die work around the house remember that you usually get what you pay for this is an inexpensive set that does the job for me around my backyard machine shop the box makes it handy to store it gets the same review as the tekton 7559 metric set,54,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,no cutting teeth hard to even tap plastic pipe,9,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is of such poor quality that you will be frustrated when using it the holders do not properly hold the bits and the bits are of poor grade you get what you pay for and i would not recommend this kit unfortunately it me a few months to figure out how bad it is to use,57,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,it has all the tools i need for my jeep but very cheaply made i wish i actually spend money on a craftsmen but if you are low on money and want to buy something that you want to put in your jeep or your car for emergency repairs then this is the tool set you want but i recommended buying a tool bag from walmart to put the tools in because the box is cheaply made i would not used this and a mechanic tools set it probably strip bolts and nuts but for a one time fix yes,100,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,unbelievably terrific set of tools for a great price,9,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,works great on plastic aluminum and for cleaning / straightening the threads on steel but do not try to thread drilled out steel i snapped one of the taps in half doing that after the 4th or 5th one still at this price I shall replace the broken ones as needed with higher quality ones from the hardware store having a starter kit is nice,61,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,socket wrench was broke upon delivery junk pass,8,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,so bad you can not even use it once before you have tot send it back,15,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i was thinking that this might not be the highest quality pieces at this price but it is basically unusable my first project was to tap mild steel with the 4 - 40 tap probably the most difficult test i could not even get the tap started it was terrible i thought my tap hole was mis-sized but it was not i used the 41 drill which is for 50 thread depth larger than the 75 thread depth option i went to the hardware store to buy a 4 - 40 tap and that one worked without any issues my guess is the rest of the pieces are equally low quality if you are tapping non-metal items then maybe it might be ok for you otherwise forget it,123,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,ok for the price but the small tap wrench is useless,11,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,good basic set everything you would need to do basic repairs,10,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,really poor quality material was delivered to me broken tap handle would not screw together at least two of the dies did not have any teeth at all I am guessing the poor quality material did not hold up to manufacturing and there was apparently no quality assurance,44,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it is a decent set for the price the taps are not that sharp although and the tap handle is weak i used the 1/2 - 20 tap on some 3/4 mild steel and it was pretty hard to tap the handle broke on me and i had to finish tapping with a wrench the tap did not seem as sharp as others i have used in the past would be an excellent set for aluminum,71,44

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,good product but quality was not up to united states standards still a useful product,14,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,good set of tools in a nice organized box,9,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,nothing is machined correctly on this set the holders are not square they hold the taps at an angle it looks like the taps are made incorrectly the 8/32 tap would not even start in ss very cheap set why do not i learn my lesson you get what you pay for in this case you even get less maybe it will tap wood,63,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the wrenches either will not stay in their slots or once removed from their slots are impossible to get back in very frustrating i returned this set,26,55

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,works well for occasional use homeowner i doubt it would hold up to serious mechanics needs,16,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,have not used my set yet but it does have a large assortment of retread attachments,16,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i know you can not expect much for the price but these are very cheaply made and not good quality at all even with much care and cutting oil I have broken the taps with little effort the handles to hold these are a total joke and a serious pain to use it does not securely hold the taps or dies securely and makes it tough to properly align or start them into the piece you are trying to thread the dies are thin and have fewer cutting threads which means that it is much harder and easier to break when trying to thread anything harder than aluminum,106,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,useless cheap metal the teeth on the dies and presumably other parts are certainly not hardened not even close soft metal i should have known i did not even use it to cut metal but plastic ridiculous,36,64
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,it works great on the bolts and screws i have used it on i use it almost every day,19,65
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,the reviews are for different products I am sure some of the products are good but i will tell you right now that i got the allied tools 49035 41-piece sae tap and die tool set that is the 41 piece set nothing else and it was very poorly made the 41 piece set sucks do not get the 41 pc set but I am sure some of the other sets are very nice,71,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,very varied is complete for that have no tools i recommend it,12,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,junk set tried re-tapping one single hole on a motorcycle fender and followed their directions for pre-drilling size to a t and the tap snapped off in the hole this was a monumental problem as the steel is hardened well beyond that of any drill bit making it essentially impossible to drill it out i ended up having to grind out the entire nut that was welded in there and welding a new nut on which had the lovely side effect of burning the paint on the other side unless you absolutely positively do not care about theyou are tapping do not use these i understand that it is a cheap set but I had except it to at least work once without breaking the cost savings is not worth the potential hassle,129,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,great starter set arrived in great shape knocked a star off since the sockets donot stick into the case opened up the case to a total cluster and mess,30,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is an ok set for keeping in your trunk or if you only do light jobs good value for the price but not for heavy work i keep this in the trunk for emergencies,35,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,cheap tools but they get the job done,8,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i used this kit for 2 years to do all the maintenance i can on my motorcycles the kit comes with quite a few of sockets which were very handy all 6pt socket not the crap 12pt anyway everything is ok quality no sockets broke or slipped the screw driver magnet broke in the first few uses crescent wrench is useless spark plug sockets came in handy but then i remembered that the bike came with a spark plug tool which worked better but one of them was used to remove the front wheel from a 2005 r6 with a pair of vice grips to hold in place finally after 2 years of service the ratchet gave out which means i need to get a new one I shall most likely get a new craftsman set from sears since their warranty is excellent good for the occasional use and the case is easy to store and carry around for 50 it is not too bad just do not expect snapon nor craftsman quality for this money,173,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i never had a full set before it is great to finally have a complete tool collection,17,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,I am used to better quality had to return it I shall have to look around and find something more to my liking they might be okay for some hobbies that do not work with the tougher metals but i would think twice before trying to cut threads in quality steel or stainless just my opinion,53,74

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i do not have any experience with taps or dies but this set does not seem too bad for casual / occasional use the case makes it slightly difficult to remove what you want but overall not too bad,35,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it worked for what i needed it to do but i see why others have complaints the handle for the taps does not secure onto the taps very well i only needed it for plastic so i had no issues for the price i can not complain,45,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this 1/2 inch drive ratchet socket set is exactly what it states but as a mechanic it is a useful set and delivers quality grip and sustains a beating ironically it is hard to scratch this set well with most sets when you use them they get all scratched up bent and truly useless but this set is tough and really delivers,62,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,everything works great and the price is great but the 13 mm socket was not punched all the way through i would give it 5 stars but this is the only thing holding me back the company will replace it for free as there is a lifetime guarantee but i find it easier just to go to the hardware store based on other reviews you may get some shoddy craftsmanship or you may not,72,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this is so handy and a def must have i never imagined that this would be so wonderful I am so glad that i got it and i would recommend it to everyone,32,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this was the cheapest tap and die set i could find i had the spout for a clawfoot bathtub strip this set worked perfectly to fix the threads saving me about 100 instead of replacing the fawcett if you only need this set once or twice a year for small jobs then it is worth the money if you need a set that you are going to use every day buy something else with more quality and higher price,78,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,very cheaply made case would look elsewhere for better quality the case broke as soon as i opened it for the first time,23,82

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i would give this tool set a 5 but very few tools get a 5 from me it is a complete set which works in the situations where i have used it so far the crank handle did not hold up to use so i replaced it with one from a local vendor,53,84

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is nothing but junk the taps have no starter tooth on them i used a 5/16 - 20 tap on a piece of cold roll steel first time using this tap the tap not only had trouble starting with in the first 1/4 of depth the teeth on the tap look like some of the taps that we have thrown away they were shot same with the dies not only are they of a poor quality the teeth are barely there there are no starter teeth on them avoid this set spend a little extra and get a set with some quality i own a machine shop so i am not new to this,115,100

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the taps are fine but i can not seem to get the dies to cut a thread on metal or wood all they do is just eat the wood or metal upon closer examination i do not see any or little difference on either side of the die thread so i am thinking that it just is not grabbing the metal or wood no matter what i do to try and cut the threads,71,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i lost the set i inherited in the flooding of 2006 i bought a small set from a big box retailer but it did not have the sizes i needed you never know what you need until you need it when i saw this i had to have it and i am not disappointed it has all the common sizes and i will find it useful,65,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,wanted tools for the car trunk for just-in-case needs on the road or in the driveway the case folds openon all sides and top took a a couple practices to get it right a couple of nuisance pieces fell out of place if not secured when snapping case together have not needed to use tools yet,55,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,the price was low and so was the quality with taps and dies if the quality is low they are almost unusable as is the case with these pay a pro to do it for you or buy quality expense tools if you have enough work to justify them anything else is a waste of money,56,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is a low quality set the taps are barely functional poorly finished and have burrs the dies do not work at all on mild steel maybe they are just intended for aluminum,33,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,purchased thisseveral months ago but failed to check to make sure all was exactly proper with the items i just now needed to use the 1/4 nc tap discovered that the seller included 2 of 1/4 nf i am dumb out of luck on this one beyond the return or adjustment date who would have thought just my luck to get my stuff from the early monday or late friday shift other than that good product for the price,79,108

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i looked to thread some smaller washers and used this set to accomplish the threading but results did not really work as expected and the thread quality was poor,28,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i have tried to turn a brand new bolt through every die in this case and they would not even think about starting and if you plan on tapping anything other than plastic do not bother I have used better tools out of my sons toy box just remembered something else the first time i used the tap wrench it rolled around the tap and stripped rendering it useless,66,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the product was missing pieces and damaged the outer case was ripped really bad was disappointed was suppose to be a fathers days gift and ended up in the trash,30,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i needed a 1/2 tap to complete a project for the the kids buying the tap alone would have cost me what i paid for the set a great buy,30,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i bought this product because I have had much success with them in the past problem was they kept getting loose in the case and i was starting to lose pieces thru a previous review i decided to purchase this set because the person wrote that this one holds the pieces snuggly in the box well he was right the pieces fit snuggly in the case although it is plastic but overall it is a great product i would consider this one again if i had to replace the one i have now,89,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i got this to have on my boat just is case of a minor issue product looks to be well built for that purpose with a good supply of bits this is great for minor repairs around the house in the car ect,43,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,recently we broke down in my wifes car she did not have so much as a screwdriver in the car if we had this tool kit we could have been going in a matter of minutes instead of the 1 - 1/2 hours we spent waiting on help for a loose battery cable is it a professional quality tool set no is the case perfect no however it does contain enough tools of sufficient quality to get you going in case of a breakdown also it contains electrical tape and connectors as well as jumper cables that is the reason i bought it and it fills that bill perfectly,105,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this set is most likely made by a toy company in china dies are covered in burrs and unusable taps are not made to spec and bolts will painfully grind into tapped threads if you can manage to tap them tap holder is made out of a material similar toin hardness and sheared the first time i tried to use it box can not even hold itself closed as it was also not built to spec being a useless waste of 22 dollars i give this 1/5 stars because 0/5 is not an option,95,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i use this set to clean up thread on lawn and garden tractors that i restore it is a low cost set so do not expect it to perform like a heavy duty one but for work that i do it works just fine i have drilled and tapped mower arbors and have not broken any of the taps i gave this five stars because for the money it is a great set and as usual amazon shipped fast and provided a good value,82,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,for the price you can not beat it the plastic box leaves some to be desired as some of the taps will not stay in their spots the screw driver included in this package is a joke they should have left it out all together but the taps and dies seem to be of reasonable quality I have only used one but it worked perfectly this set obviously would not be a viable option for a professional metal worker but for do-it-yourself occasional use these are perfect would recommend,85,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,if you need a cheap set of taps and dies go to autozone they have a set for 24 bucks with a 90 day in store warranty and a 1 year manufacture warranty this set is a complete ruin i had a 4 - 40 tap break off inside my part and guess what part ruined none of the turrets are calibrated for any of the dies so do not even bother using anything else except the t-wrench if you do buy this poor excuse of a tool set,87,120
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this for my brother for christmas he is very into his truck and this was a great addition to his toolbox now he always has the tools he needs when he is out and about,37,121
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i had thought about ordering one before the holidays as it was in stock i was short on money and had to wait until the new year when i did it was out of stock with a 1 - 2 month delivery i ordered anyway and received it within a few weeks it arrived as described would recommend my only complain is some of the pieces do not fit into the clamshell very well and are difficult to get out and put back into their places they are marring the case so it will eventually have a hole i do not know if this is a complaint or normal with these types of tools because this is my first but the tap wrench becomes loose and must be tightened several times during a tapping event one handle tightens one way and the other in reverse so as you tighten one the other loosens i fixed this by putting threadlock on the one that is supposed to be stationary,164,122
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,boght this as a started tool set for my sons best friend my bonus son wonderful set for a vehicle,20,123
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,just what you need when you do not need to spend a lot for a higher quality kit i have not broken any yet and i think that is what separates higher quality taps from lower strength and quality of thread this will work for yourprojects i would even use this on important thread jobs just very carefully,57,124
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,got this for my kitchen drawer when I am too lazy to go out to the garage and get the nicer tools and it works fine the elastic holders in the case are nice because i can replace certain tools with others better suited for miscellaneous household needs i would buy it again,52,125
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,we purchased this tool kit for our son he will be going off to college next fall and wanted a tool for his car this kit covers just about everything he will need to fix a minor problem it will last him for many years,45,126
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,these arrived with a broken tap wrench the screw handle in the tap wrench would not thread into the clamp which is ironic being that it is a tap / die set that epitomizes the quality you should expect from this set someone at their factory knowingly put a useless tap wrench into the set and the dies had threads that had thin pieces of metal hanging off of them which indicates cheap metal and poor machining i sent the product back with no problems from amazon it looks like i am going to have to pony up and pay for a real set,101,127
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i take this set with me everywhere these tools a very professional high quality you can not go wrong with this set,21,128
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i bought this set for theading 12/24 unc the end of a sizing stud i turned on the lathe thee stud was to be used with a lee case trimmer for 222 rem magnum cases this is not directly available from lee in the picture it looked like a cheap but not bad quality set but when i examined it it was just crap there were hardened steel burrs in almost all dies they did not cut cleanly rather teased the metal if you want to make a quick and dirty job and quality of threading is not an issue you may go for it otherwise better spend once your bucks and go directly for a decent quality and higher price one,122,129
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it arrived quickly and while not the most expensive it certainly seems to handle the occasional need for a tap be sure to useand cutting oil,28,130
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,it works this is was a part i wanted to use on my ar 15 to tap and screw a spring in place,23,131

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought this tap die set for small projects when it got here it was packed well shipped in pretty good time product for the money was in good shape i figure the taps and dies will recondition threads pretty easy i do not think the set will cut new threads well tho i also wish allied would put a tap and die drill chart in the box it would make things easier for we the rookies of the machine shop,79,133
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i concurr completely with the comments about the tap wrench i recieved my set today and upon prying the tap wrench from it is location in the box the sliding blocks that should grab the square shank of a tap fell out after spending an hour trying to thread the parts back together it was readily apparent that they were totally incompatible and could never function I shall purchase a replacement wrench at my local ace hardware store and hope that the taps and dies are ok for limited house hold chores also had to pry the little thread gage from it is moulded in position in the box with a screwdriver it required so much force to remove that it bent do not waste your money on this set,127,134
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought these 4 years ago i was very excited to have my first tool box I have used it many times to replace parts on my car and they have saved me a lot of money I have always just left it in my car for emergencies it is good for it is price if you want lasting tools you will have to pay more the box does not really close properly now there are a lot of missing pieces from over the years and a few of tools have rust around them and what not i did not really take care of the tools but whatever they did their job i was expecting everything to last longer but for that you will have to pay more if you just keep these in your garage and use it from time to time and store it properly and take care of it i am sure that these will last a long time but my was always in my car so everytime i opened it up there would be pieces everywhere and then it would take me forever to put them back in place which is very annoying,188,135
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is a quality product and came on time and as published i could not have gotten this for twicw the price at a local hardware store,27,136
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i returned this tap and die set after attempting to thread just one rod the dies are missing a starting chamfer they may work for cleaning off an existing thread but are lousy for starting a new thread on a rod overall the metal seems cheap the handles feel like they would break under not much pressure i should have paid more up front for something like a craftsman set thought i would save money you do get what you pay for,82,137
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,lo recomiendo 100 articulo muy funcional,49,138
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,good selection of tools many to choose from i can always find the right one however 2nd day of using one of my bits broke i did not apply a lot of torque it just snapped structurally I am not that strong of a build myself so anyone who fancies themselves athletic may need to heed thisi do not trust this tool set at all if you want a good selection of tools with the highest quality and build purchase something better than this and spend the extra cash i was going to give this two stars but now I shall give it one,103,139
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i was surprised at how easy this product worked on the project i was doing then again i was working with steel and not plastic or acrylic like some of the reviews here nice set for light metal projects at a great price,43,140
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,bought this for my niece for her new car so she will have some tools with her great little kit good price received promply with amazon prime,27,141
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,for the price you expect a fairly decent kit of tool in a decent portable case to use in your vehicle in case of emergency the thing that struck me was the horrible quality of the case the top latches pop off in your hands and do not go back on easily when you try the tools are held in by plastic retaining clips that were broken or mis-formed all the tools were everywhere and 8 or 10 would not go back in their retainers this makes for a nice rattle sound as you are driving good fun most of the parts are small clips retainers screw tips and more you would be be better off getting a few decent tools from home depot or craftsman and a small tool box my biggest concern with the set is that it is for emergency and in an emergency i would hate to rely on this quality,152,142
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,the metal they use is not quality or hardended correctly there tools brake and because injury this leaves lots of liability sure if it is for home use you hurt yourself and you obviously do not care about yourself anyway because you bought allied junk but think about those others who use them you do not want to kill your loved ones because you saved a nickel on hand tools,67,143
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this set has almost everything you need for an emergency tool kit bought 3 for our limo fleet awesome for the price,22,144
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this as a very occasional use kit to take with me so i would not have to wait for someone else to get around to fixing a stripped bolt hole i did not want to spend much money as this will not get used much and if it will not do the job the mechanic who has the really good snap on set can come and fix it for it is intended purpose it is great i have fixed a couple of small stripped holes with the taps and ran it down the threads of a bolt it has held up in mild steel just fine it is a very good value for the amount of kit you get for the money it is cheap but does the job i would not think about this at all if you plan on using them daily buy a good set for that,147,145
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,this is a good quality tap and die set for occasional use I have only used a couple of the taps but they are sharp and work well just what i needed and at a great price,36,146
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this set seems well suited for home / semi-pro use solid metal taps and dies case is a bit tight but overall for the occasional job it should pay for itself some mechanics might actually be upgrading,35,147
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,I am confused how this would get anything above one star i attempted to thread a piece of music wire with the 4 - 40 die the threads on the die were deformed almost immediately later i purchased a die made by irwin it threaded the same piece of steel with good results i returned the set to amazon,56,148
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i had a similar problem as one of the other reviewers within a couple months of mild use the ball bearing that holds the bit in place fell out losing that ball bearing essentially makes the tool useless because the bits fall out so easily that i can not use the tool in any angle other than by holding the tool completely upright it is just not practical stay away and find a tool with better quality,75,149
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,ths is the worst kit I have ever used i should have known not to buy one for 20 bucks you could not thread hot butter with this it did not come with any guides or instructions and the dies are not the size they say they are most of the threads were cut wrong into the tool even with a guide it will start to bite then slip off and eat what ever it is your trying to thread it would cost me more money to send the thing back than i paid for it if you are looking for a paper weight or just want to throw 20 bucks in the trash then buy this,112,150
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i bought this tool set hoping for a medium quality tool set for a great price and it came in way below my expectations first of all it is not actually a 235 piece set unless you count all the screws and connectors that were so graciously included the needle-nose pliers were bent in the set i received and overall the tool set is constructed poorly the case makes the tools hard to get in and out of their positions and some of the tools fall out when you carry the case gently i would look elsewhere for a tool kit because this one is not worth the money,107,151
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i bought this because every now and then i need a tap or die around the house for yard / garden equipment and more for the price i did not expect much but this is good quality material in less than a week after i got it i was working on my truck and broke a bolt off after i got it out i had to re-tap the hole this worked great and saved me a lot of headaches and time again when you do not think you need something that is then you need it most at least that is what i tell my wife when i buy new tools laughing out loud,106,152
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,had to use this for working on some standardized floor electrical boxes did the job well held the screws tight to the piece once the tap was done before securing the scrwes in highly recommend this you never know when you need to tap into new holes or chase threads on damaged bolts,53,153
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,nice set for the price I have seen better quality taps but these are perfect for chasing damged threads and cutting new threads on softer materials probably not good for harder materials although use lots of cutting fluid,37,154
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is quite possibly the poorest quality toolset i have ever seen i can not even see how it is worth more than 20 let alone 5999 the case is very cheap and looks like it will fall apart and there are not even close to 235 tools i suppose they count each wire terminal as a tool,56,155
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,i went out on a limb and bought this tap and die set because of the great price i am shocked at how well this set works the tap handle is a little different than what i am used to and took a second to figure out that only one side is meant to screw in to tighten the tap into the t handle after i got that right the tap worked flawlessly today i tapped an exhaust manifold with the nf 7/16 - 20 tap and it continues to impress me no complaints with this set if handled properly this set will do what any high end set will do,109,156
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,my son works on his mustang often and besides his regular tool set wanted a tool kit that could provide the wide variety of tools he needed to complete the specialized tasks this kit has the electrical crimpers and other small tools typically used for radio or lighting installation as well as your standard ratchet and other small hand tools used when working in confined areas or for specialized installation it rounds out his regular set of tools well and keeps everyting in one easy to store container the tools are decent quality and should last for many years,99,157
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,it looks good does not it even comes with a little thread gauge unfortunately when i tried to tap a 4 - 40 thread into a 1/8 piece of acrylic the handle on the tapping wrench came off it was being held in by one and a half threads on left-hand threaded end this ones going right back to amazon,57,158
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,tools are decent quality for the price comes with jumper cables case is terrible opened up the first time and case would not close properly not a big deal it still goes together fine just does not fit exactly right shipped in 2 days,43,159
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,handy portable tool kit wide variey of tools handle most tasks case is a little chintzy have to used with care to keep tools from falling loose i stuffed the void in the middle to help hold the tools in their respective spots quality of the tools is adequate for the intended mission i bought two,55,160
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,these are great tools but when you open and close the set it causes the tools to fall out and get lost and mixed up so if you buy this you might want to buy a separate slide out tool chest but i definitely recommended this,46,161
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i am an antique restorer and i bought this for occasional use it worked out fine for me,18,162
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,you do not buy this expecting to get quality tools it is a good buy to keep in a vehicle,19,163
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,I have been a moldmaker for 30 years have used a lot of taps and dies even the pricey ones brake this price is unreal just ten years ago the handles and tool are worth the price along nice range of sizes 4 - 40 to 1/2 - 20 zoom on picture to see for yourself great for home use beats paying 11900 for a craftman set,62,164
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,it does the job i would not stress it more than a couple of use per week,17,165
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,i got this product as a gift but returned it for the metrinch set i had seen on tv this allied set is not a terrible product and it is cheaper and has a few more tools but they really can not be compared as the metrinch is a truly high end product and is actually a much better value as it is really 2 full sets of tools in one metric and standard,71,166

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,I shall admit that i expect alot from my tools but this product was not even in the ballpark i suppose if one had a rare need this tap and die set might suffice but for frequent use or for use with hardened metals it does not hold up well,48,169
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,this is a great product i gave it to my fiance as a gift and his only complaint is that the driver heads are not magnetic other than that it is easy to use and works well for a variety of projects,42,170
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,for the price a perfect combination of tools put this in the trunk of my car as the only tools carried truck is full of tools butprices make the little car very attractive and this tool kit has been handy instead of sure i have one but it is in the truck,54,171

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,5.0,positive,is great for around the house jobs that require a socket set not sure why people give thisa bad review,23,173
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,i purchased this as a christmas gift and recently found out that some tools were missing how embarrassing they probably thought i gave a used gift,26,174
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,the tools are top notched but that is only half of it the case is well organized and easy to snap the sockets in-and-out,24,175
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,4.0,positive,i buy it from venezuela it is an excellent set very useful and helpful I am very conformed with it,18,176
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,1.0,negative,this is a real piece of crap i think it was 20 bucks when i ordered it well after a few jobs it decided to finally give out the ball that keeps the bits secured to the screwdriver came out so i can no longer use any bits and hope that they stay put also just as a flaw of design the lock to keep the head in the various swiveled angles comes loose with about 2 turns of the screwdriver it becomes very annoying to have to re-tighten it over and over again while tightening one screw do yourself a favor do not look for bargains on tools at the least do not look for bargain tools that have too many moving parts,122,177
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,junk soft steel only good for tapping plastic i twisted apart the largest tap on the first use in soft aluminum,21,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,was a bit smaller than i expected but an overall good product for the price,15,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,a little smaller than i needed but that is my fault looks to be a handy set just go slow measure twice act once this is for really small work,29,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,my husband loves this set he is using it for his guitars,12,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,i had purchased this to thread holes for a project i was working on i used a bit holder to help grip the taps because they are tiny the job worked well the first time well worth the effort and price,41,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,it is a small life saver you must realize this tap set is for very soft materials such as wood aluminum brass copper and more you must go very very slow and not force the work piece it is not made to be used for cutting new threads unless it is plastic or very thin and soft materials i would never use on hard steel unless your just lightly chasing threads a must have in your tool box for small specialty work,78,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,the dies are a pain to use and it looks like it is made of soft steel may be it is just a matter of getting used to it have it tried the taps yet,33,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,tap and die set is good handy tool it is pretty small although I am afraid I shall break it when using it am careful with it when i do use it,30,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,2.0,negative,received first set and it was missing taps received second set and it was missing taps with the two sets i was able to get a full set very low quality,31,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,good product very pleased would buy from this seller again,10,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,i would put zero or minus stars on that product but there is no option like that the manufacture quality is below any standard which make this product useless is waist of time money and creating anger,41,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,it does the job for the soft metals these are very fragile to use and they brake very easily be careful but as said it does the job,28,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,it is quite hard to find tap and die sets at least ones that are not prohibitively expensive for casual and occasional project work so i am glad i found this set this set has allowed me to manufacture damaged and missing proprietary watch pins there is a vague stamp on the taps with a number but it is too hard to read or know what it means so i matched the taps with dies by simply screwing one into the other the packet it came is was different there was a decent pvc pouch for the die tool but the taps came in a separate disposable bag without compartments that was not resealable so i will need to find a suitable pocket miniature container to hold them safely in it is possibly not enough for a professional but i would not know for amateurs and beginners i think it does a great job and i recommend it,159,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,2.0,negative,i did not expect much but anyway this is a usable set for very soft metals if you want to keep using it,22,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,great product for those little jobs as a gunsmith i use this product quite a bit to help customize guns for owners that are wanting to mount a scope or upgrade their weapons with modern add ons such as laser sights or flashlights,43,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,4.0,positive,good set but not what i had in mind not what i wanted to work on guns had to send back,22,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,2.0,negative,pretty shabby tools may come in handy if needed but not what i expected in terms of quality but i guess for the price can not expect too much,28,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,5.0,positive,my husband likes the tap and die set it works great for working on guns we are gunsmiths and it works really great highly recommended,24,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0001LCMS6,1.0,negative,do not buy this not good for anything this product has no directions how to use it and i tried to cut some threads and the reamer broke off inside worthless,30,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,i had a large nut holding my basin faucet and this was the only tool i found that could lock it down it is pretty loose on the hinge although so you might have to use two hands to secure it to the nut and turn but bottom line is it worked-and the shipping time was very good also,59,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2.0,negative,i needed this large size basin wrench to remove an old kitchen faucet unfortunately when it arrived there was no spring which makes it very difficult to use in tight spaces the end of the wrench just flops around so it is hard to get it to grip the nut if you can get both your hands up there then it might work but with one hand it is nearly impossible the only positive of this wrench is that it is quite large so it can work for nuts that are 2 and larger other wrenches I have tried were much too small for a 2 nut,104,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1.0,negative,the manufacturer failed to install a spring in the large jaw making the tool useless i returned 1st tool for replacement i included explaination for returning the tool and talked with a service representative the replacement tool arrived within two days excellent response unfortunately it had the same defect no spring in the large jaw i again contacted the customer service desk and advised them of the problem the service representative said she would have the product pulled from the the availability list i solved my need for the wrench i was pleased with the response from amazon lasco 13 - 2029 metal 16-inch basin wrench large jaw for faucet installation,112,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5.0,positive,it is hard to find a basin wrench that is big enough to turn that big nut that holds the single handle faucet to the sink this one does it and is inexpensive too,34,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,every once in a while you are confronted with a 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 nut holding a sink faucet this is usually tucked up behind the sink well and the only way to get at it is a with a basin wrench or some very tricky maneuvers with a set of adjustable pliers this large-jaw basin wrench solves the problem nicely more typical basin wrenches will work up to about 1 1/2 after that you have got to improvise the extended upper jaw on this unit allows you to work with nuts up to 3 in width which covers the majority of 1 1/2 to 2 sanitary pipe fittings you do not need it everyday unless you are a plumber but when you do need it it is nice to have,127,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,pro build to last and can fit up to 4 nut con needs a spring for the jaw but did not need it for a 3 nut that i was tightening,30,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1.0,negative,the only thing good about this purchase is the stellar customer support from amazon the tool has no spring as every other basin wrench does so you have to try and hold it closed with the free hand reaching up behind the sink which defeats the purpose of the 16 inch handle the seller does not return emails but amazon stepped up and refunded the purchase price,66,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5.0,positive,single-handle faucets usually attach to the sink via a single large nut we had a loose faucet for a couple years and nothing i tried would get around the large nut in such a small place i was able to tighten it up in just a few minutes using this,50,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1.0,negative,the jaw on mine did not bend 90deg even with a lot of force it just seam stuck whoever made this did not test it before packing it I am returning mine and wasted time with this order,35,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2.0,negative,i got this to remove a rusted on single hole kitchen sink nut that a standard jaw size basin wrench was too small for it did not work i tried liquid wrench i tapped on it and more i put vice grips on the shaft to increase the torque as the t handle is rather small in the end i just cut the nut off with a dremmel i should have done that in the beginning the 1 3/8 nut i used it on seemed to be at the small end of it is grip do not get this tool instead of a regular jaw size basin wrench the jaw is not spring loaded to help it grip the nut like my regular basin wrench is new kitchen sink fixtures do not seem to need a tool like this for installation,136,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2.0,negative,the wrench is very loose it does not hold tight when you try to turn it needs better crip to support the turn,23,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5.0,positive,this is great for any size nut but if you only need to use it once you may just want to take some pvc cut slots in it for the nut if it has wings and use that i will use this on many projects and have no need for a small one now this does it all,58,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,if you are home owner and do not foresee using this type of tool often this will get the job done the lack of spring did not really make it that much more difficult as i could reach my hand up to the nut but in certain circumstances if you can not get your hand near the nut without the spring you may be in trouble is saving another 15 bucks off a higher quality wrench worth it hard to say how often will you need to use it I am confident even without the spring you will figure out a way to make it work once it grips it is super easy to tighten the nut my kitchen faucet no longer moves thus I am super happy,121,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,it was too small for the door handle opening but we got it to work it is very sturdy and much better than the original and the flimsy replacement we bought at home depot sorry hd we put something in theto keep the bugs out it will work until we get one that is the right size and just as sturdy,61,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,i installed this in february and the metal on the inside handle support sheared a couple of months later only a 30 day return window of course not recommended at all,31,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,did not fit my door the interior part was much too large for the hole in my door plus it was very dated looking which i should have seen when purchasing i returned thethankfully,34,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,we ordered it fast delivery good product easy install the spacing for the holes are 3 - 15/16 this should help you with ordering it,23,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,i ordered this door handle and believe me my expectations were very lowhowever after receiving it and installing it i am totally pleased with this door handlei have seen similar door handles at home depot for between 30 and 70 this is a great buy and it has made my life much easier and the price is fantastic,58,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,bought two of these one works fine for now the other broke the second day it was installed the handle popped right off update the one that worked fine broke within a month the lock on that one broke so these clearly have multiple defects,45,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,exactly what i needed and a great price,8,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,unhelpful instructions wish i had read the reviews saying the needed to file down the latch for it to fit i tried to force mine and it broke,29,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,when ours broke we needed another one quick this one came within a couple days and we put it on with no problems since also has the same wood handle our old one had so looks great,37,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,this product is made very cheap i have used it less than a month and it is already torn up thank goodness i had my old one which takes a bit to get it to work as it is worn out after years of use at lease the old one lasted several years,53,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,it broke the first week after it was installed looked nice but it was flimsy,15,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,it fit exactly like the old one but i love the design of this one better if for some reason i ever need another one i will buy this exact one again,32,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,very satisfied overall package did not come with a keeper sold separately apparently,12,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,installs easy looks great make sure you take apart your old stuff first and make sure everything matches before you buy my original outside pull was offset and used different holes than the outside pull in this kit which lines up straight so i could not use the new outside pull,50,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,very nice handle fits on an old sliding glass door lock moves smoothly,13,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,finally went through 3 from lowes by far the best one using it on a houseboat doorwall beauty,16,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,1.0,negative,the photo of thisis very inaccurate compared to the actual product i ordered a door handle with a dark walnut handle and a chrome / aluminum base in reality the handle is a much lighter beigeand the base is a matte gray check out the photo in my review theis not even close to the photo on it is own packaging i was hoping to find a handle that would match our darker wood floors so I shall be returning this handle,83,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,better than home depots selection I have been through a handful of those and the break easily,16,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,this handle was perfect just what i was looking for good quality shipping was fast,15,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,4.0,positive,although i did not end up using this handle because it did not have the proper mounting screws i bought it used from amazon warehouse deals i can see this is a nice replacement sliding door handle / lock it has a solid wood handle and the construction appears strong and well made just not as heavy / thick metal as my original i thought of getting screws for this but then thought i can reorder another one i did actually i got prime-line products c 1095 sliding door handle set with wood handle black diecast because i realized my door has 3 hole spacing where this c-1018 is for 3 - 15/16 hole spacing overall i believe any of these prime-line sliding door handles are well made and a good replacement,126,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FKDDVS,5.0,positive,great replacement for older sliding class door had hard time finding one locally so glad to have found this one on amazon,22,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,works like a charm let us see how the plastic holds up to a year of sunshine and bad weather,19,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,tabs were thinner than expected and felt like it could break very easily,13,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,very thin 0016 torn one after installed original one was twice as thick 0032,14,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1.0,negative,these tabs are small and weak they do not attach well and simply sit in the track so they pull out easily if much force is applied if you have large screens or they are tight to fit look for something else,42,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1.0,negative,warning this one does not fit the screentight screen frames you will buy from homedepot or lower,16,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,the product is fine but it took a long time to receive the items,14,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,i used these tabs when i replaced some screens that had been in place for 20 years the screening material was easy to find at the local home depot but the tabs where nowhere to be found these have worked well with the charcoal colored screens that i used I am not particularly handy withstuff but these were easy enough to use it just took a bit of work to figure out which side of the screen to place them opposite the side where the spline is located and you need to work it a bit as it does make inserting the spline a tighter fit i used a 0140 spline with a standard screen the tabs make the insertion and removal of the screen much easier and so far they held very securely time will tell if they will get brittle as they age the one negative is that since they are a solid blackthey are noticeable my previous tabs were clear but then they got brittle over time and just broke when i tried to remove the screen,183,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,very thin when you use the tabs to remove the screen they pop off the ones i used from lowes did not do this,24,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4.0,positive,these tabs are the dimension i need with a 1/4 inch projection into the spline channel these tabs are like the originals on my screens so they do the job and hopefully will last several years also a good price and quick delivery i wish however that somebody could come up with a better design that would be sturdier and easier to pull,63,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,i bought this to replace old more than a decade and broken pull tabs on my window screens these are much flimsier than my old pull tabs but they do their job does not break off when pulled up to lift window screen,43,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,these work well easy to use when replacing my window screens,11,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4.0,positive,my old screen frames had none or missing / broke off these did the trick it is a standard spline held pull tab nothing fancy would have been nice if the box came in an even number of tabs although kinda stuck with 1 extra that i can not do nothing with fast shipping time was greatveddy veddy gooooood laughing out loud,52,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,we take our window screens out each year for the winter we have been doing that for 10 years i got a 25-pack to replace tabs that occasionally snap off and these tabs break much much more often than the tabs that came on the original windows we have had the most problems with tab breakage in screens that have a lot of sun exposure so it may just be a uv thing just to be clear they are not pulling out due to installationissues these tabs split into two pieces the long part of the tab shears off and the remainder of the tab stays under the vinyl spline shopping for a better solution,116,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,my local hardware store did not have these and i was replacing screens they work just fine for me but may not hold up as long as the oem,28,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,seem to be decent quality especially for the price have not used them a whole lot yet but the several that i have tried are holding up just fine the stand seems to be cheaply made but does the job of holding the tools just fine,45,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,if you do shop work and have to drill holes transfer punches are a must allows one to accurately locate where to drill,23,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i got them and they looked good when i went to use them the one i needed was to soft to use the point went flat so i checked them all on the rock well and found 11 to soft to use i payed for the better ones and got this junk not happy i do not think they were fowler,61,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,these transfer punches are absoloute garbage i broke the tip off of one during it is first use I shall be sending this product back,23,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,the box that the punches came in is labeled made in china i do not think they are talking about the box i called fowler and they told me this is not their product the punches came covered in grit and one punch was a little bent but i cleaned the set and was able to straighten out the punch well enough for my use i only intend on using these punches for woodworking so i think they will be ok so i gave it 4-stars,86,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i was wandering through the amazon tool section and ran across this product what a greati put it into our christmas wish list and my wife ordered it i opened the present this morning the punches look good the rack that holds them is another story the rack was twisted one screw was loose another had the nut laying in the bottom of the box i took the punches out to fix the loose screws and discovered the rack had been twisted so far out of alignment that one of the punch holes had been torn the final discovery was when i tried to put the loose nut onto it is screw it would not stay so i decided to replace it i pulled the screw out and discovered it was not threaded apparently whoever assembled the rack was more interested in getting it shipped then quality control I am sending it back for an exchange hopefully the next one has all the screws threaded,163,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,4.0,positive,i purchased this from the price pros reseller it arrived the next day i was concerned about the possibility of getting a non-genuine product based on an earlier review but amazons return policy would allow a quick and easy resolution what a received was a blue box with no mention of the name fowler anywhere only the part number 72 - 482 - 028 - 0 was listed on mine the metal carrier is not very well aligned the middle support shelf is not welded exactly parallel but the top and bottoms are the size of each punch is stamped or etched on the top which is nice this set is made in china concerned that this may be a cheap imitation i contacted the fowler corporation and was told that this is indeed a fowler product i made a few punches into cherry stock and the tip showed no sign of wear the punches themselves look well made for the price i would give the benefit of the doubt that they will hold out and propose a 4-star rating for the obvious hasty manufacturing i could never give a higher rating regardless of price,189,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,these transfer punches are excellent quality and the delivery time for the product was far better than expected very pleased,20,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,2.0,negative,i ordered this set a few days ago because it was an excellent price for a fowler transfer punch set [ ] but when i received the shipment i discovered that it is not a fowler set but a cheap chinese knockoff the box was dented in several places and the inside had several stains from machine oil that had dripped off the punches i was very upset the part number on the box was the same as the true fowler part number in an apparent effort to fool prospective buyers do not be fooled if you want a cheap set there are less expensive sets available at amazon if you want a true fowler set look elsewhere,116,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,as soon i opened the box it literally came falling out of the box the carrier was complete garbage if that is the kind of quality that it has when it is first opened I am not even going to try the punches so i will be returning this,46,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,1.0,negative,this is not a high quality fowler tool this is a chinese clone at best although the part number matches the fowler product they do not import and resell chinese tools clearly deceptive advertising,34,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000IHWCOW,5.0,positive,I am using these punches for rivet and grommet setting great set came really oiled i guess they are worried about rust the stand is pretty floppy but if you keep them in the original box it will last great variety of sizes,40,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,i did not expect the water pressure to increase from this water filter showers are now so much more refreshing than they used to be you actually feel cleaner from the increased pressure and the cleaner water an excellent purchase in my opinion,42,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,i have been using this product for almost a year now initially everything looked perfect however the hand held shower unit is made of a poor quality plastic so is the tubing after 3 months of use the tubing ruptured because the metal framing around it had a sharp end which was not fixed properly and over time it cut the rubber i had to buy a new hose to replace the old one along with a new shower head after a while the connector between the shower head and the filter broke since it was plastic now i just have the filter from the original package but have a beautiful new shower head and hand held combo attached to the filter with a new metal connector hope the filter does not brake with the new shower set,138,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,where to start first issue my order was forgotten about and never shipped to me i will say that after i contacted the seller via email they did respond promptly and ship myout including a free water filter second issue the bath ball filters handle broke w / n the first use third issue the shower filter was not even on for a week before the tubing w / n it burst please do not purchase either of these items,77,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,this is the best hand-held shower head i have head so far the filter is great my skin is smoother and my hair much much softer whenever i take a shower at the gym now with unfiltered water i feel the difference the chrome is beautiful no more chlorine smell and now with the hand-held i can wash my hair without getting in the bathtub nice,66,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,i grew up in new york and absolutely never gave a second thought to the quality of our water my hair was always soft manageable and shiny then i moved to the midwest where i found the hardest water in the united states it clanks as it comes out of the tap you have to use a chisel to remove the residue from your counters it leaves my hair dirty-looking stringy dull and flat water softeners do not do a thing to help even moving to a neighborhood with so-called city water is no improvement i tried every type of shampoo and conditioner tried rinsing my hair in rainwater i collected in a barrel that worked a bit although it can be quite a shock in the winter and concocted a vinegar rinse finally i purchased the crystal quest with it is super-duper filter not only is my hair soft and manageable again but my skin feels much better too it was easy to install and works great if you live in an area with hard water treat yourself and get one of these handheld showers,183,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,this is a good product the advantage is it leaves your skin feeling smooth and moist i actually feel clean when i get out of the shower city water tends to irritate my skin even while i am showering the extension on it allows for easy clean up of your shower and makes washing your pets 100 easier it also has an off switch on the shower head which helps when your trying to lather your dog without turning the water competely off the only disadvantage is changing the direction of the filter every couple of weeks i would like to have a shower head filter that i can install and leave of course i would still have to change the filter either way you decide to take is up to you all filters need maintenance overall this is a good product for the price you pay,147,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,my hair is softer is it the new shampoo i used or the filtered water my hair is so soft that i can not help playing with it my husband has extreme dry skin he put cream over all in the morning by evening he has suffering from the itchy dry skin again so bad that i wish he could put cream on during the day now he does not need to put extra cream in the evening,76,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,my hair is better now that i started using this it was really gross feeling before i know that is vague but i always felt like i had gunk in it before,31,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,not only does it filter the bad stuff from your shower water but the design gives you a nice steady well dispersed stream of water,25,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,water comes out slow and it faster to wash yourself in the sink do not buy thisit is the bad,22,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,there was no way to make this shower head stop leaking and leaking badly it had a funny looking head and it had little water pressure i replaced it with one that was cheaper and easier to install and has never leaked i also find the company and it is associates to be disreputable they promised me my return shipping because they did not origionally send what i had ordered but after having fun at my expense and doing what i could to resolve the situation i was left with them owing me money i do not recommend this product or this company,101,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,bought this and was working well for a few months about the 4th month started toand could tell the filter was not working properly due to smelling chlorine again in shower called crystal quest directly they said they would send me out a new unit that was over 2 months ago tried to work with this seller said they would get back with me the next day it is been over a week and still have not heard anything back from the seller or crystal quest this was really the worst customer service I have experienced next time would buy a different brand just to ensure proper customer service,108,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,kind of disappointed with the quality of the all plastic unit will go out and purchase different shower head later the hose still will not behave itself need more flexible supply hose filter works great living in the nw whenever we get our torrential rains the water services pump up the chlorine and being somewhat allergic to it the filter takes care of the smell and irritation,66,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,i bought this product a year and a half ago i have had to get new parts for it several different times already now it keeps breaking because it is made of cheap plastic a type of styrene which is toxic btw after 1 year they would not send me replacement parts so now i am stuck with a broken showerhead that i can either keep buying parts for from crystal quest or i can find another showerhead that does not break all the time anyone have any showerhead filter recommendations i am so dissapointed in this showerhead such a waste of money and it is been a hassel having to write to crystal quest every 5 or so months it seems to get something replaced not at all environmentally friendly either i do not know why they can not just make it of metal i would certainly buy it if it was metal it would not be breaking all the time and would not have the plastic / styrene concern either did not like the customer service from crystal quest either,172,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,i live in chicago where the city water is hard i purchased this showerhead with some reservations because of the previous reviews so far i am very pleased with the product the showerhead does give you increased water pressure resulting in a more powerful and cleaner shower experience less residue my skin scalp and hair is less dryer than before the installation process was easy and quick no dripping or leaks the filter seems to work great you do have to reverse the filter on occasion this product is mostly affordable due to the long filter life up to one year one negative the showerhead only has 3 or 4 water settings most have 5 settings in this price range,120,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,worth the easy to install frnkly it not any harder installing one of these compared to a garden hose outside your house,23,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,this is a pretty good sprayer but the plastic button soon leaks needs washer kits often so be prepared to buy them in quantity if you have like me several sprayers the positive is the excellent lifetime warranty and service by kohler customer service i wish they made one with less plastic and better designed button i have had to replace 2 with buttons leaking or coming off and was sent prompt replacement,73,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,first of all in case you are wondering the spray head is plastic with a brass coating the photo and info is vague on this the hose from the spray head is unwieldy for the spray head and causes the spray head to have problems when trying to seat i put a weight on it under the sink outside of that it does the job and is better than the one i replaced,72,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,this spray is pretty good quality for a replacement kitchen spray it looks good is a decent weight and was fairly easy to install my only complaint is that it did not come with a weight to keep the hose tucked neatly underneath the sink without that weigh the hose can sometimes be a little tricky to put back under the sink but it is not too big a deal overall i am happy with the product,76,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,only one star from me first the quality of construction is no different from generic home store quality so forget the kohler quality equation looks substantial but it is only looks just chromed plastic second the force of the spray is weak suspect this is either the number of holes with too much volume per hole either reduce the number or make them smaller and yes it is the sprayer because the previous unit worked fine maybe mine was a fluke on the strength of stream so suggest buy locally and install before the return window is gone just in case,101,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,i ordered this because it was kohler well I am very disappointed the only well made part was the hose the handle and piece connected to the hose are plastic very cheaply made would definantely not recommend,36,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,mediocre quality fitting on sprayer handle loosened after a few months and started leaking under the sink tightened it up and thestopped for now,26,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,i just bought two of these spray heads unfortunately why two because since this spray head was installed only two years ago it is already broken twice parts springing out no fixing it while it is out of commission so is our sink because it diverts the water from the faucet therefore i bought two assuming it will only be a matter of months before it breaks again and it is a big deal not to be able to use the kitchen sink when this happens very disappointed in kohler and have already told the design / build firm that redesigned our kitchen to never use this sprayer tried to replace with another brand but the sizing was such we had to replace with this one sigh,121,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,i bought this to repair a pedicure chair and it worked great,12,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,nice sprayer but wished it was not made of plastic expected something a little better from kohler,16,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,i purchased this to replace the original sprayer on my kohler kitchen faucet pros looks good installs easily better connection than the previous design it replaces old version had tendency towhere the hose met the handle cons the only thing i do not like better than the previous model is that the water pressure is not quite as strong through the sprayer,62,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,i bought two of these the first lasted a year before the handle shot off and water sprayed all over my kitchen ceiling i ordered a replacement a few weeks ago and after installing it today found that it leaks now i need to return it and find another option,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,i ordered this sprayer because it was the only one in thei needed i was not positive of thebut ordered it anyway yes it is the muted gold tone / brushed brass or whatever you want to call it but it matches my faucet perfectly I am not crazy about the push button in the front of the sprayer because I have never had one before and it is taking a little getting used to but at least it is the rightand it works fine my husband said it installed perfectly easily,92,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,excellent product works better than expected should be double the cost so was quite surprised my spouse likes it is looks and the way it operates much better than the original that came with the sink,35,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,this kohler sidespray is a total piece of junk it may look like it is made out of metal but it is chrome-plated plastic so it will not last and will easily break the spray button has a very soft spring and is poorly located so when you grab it to use you often get a random spray you do not want finally the way the sprayer attaches to the hose is very stupid it is constantly coming unscrewed and leaking water ugh,81,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,bought it in may by december the hose kinked where the spray is attached can not use standard hose have to throw it away junk,24,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,ili likedtthe retro design but it leaked we installed it and water continuosly dripped from the sprayer head the base felt like cheap plastic disapointing,25,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,my last sidespray had the button fall off and searching for a replacement was harder then i thought i would be it did not seem like any of the large hardware stores had the sprayer by itself this one was the same brand as my sink / faucet and complimented the faucet perfectly in fact i like the look of this one a lot more then the one that originally went with the faucet and it works great,75,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,i looks good and installs easy but like someone else mentioned the pressure is miserable i would not recommend this to anyone,21,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,this is a nice looking sidespray it matches my brushed stainless steel sink the nozzle pivots where it meets the hose which i like as it feels a little more maneuverable than the cheaper fixed nozzle-hose connections,37,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,thank god i could find this to replace the broken one apparently shiny brass is outlawed at home product stores the cost was reasonable considering my other choices would not have matched this old house,35,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i purchased one of these from amazoncom as an experiment to see how these lightbulbs performed i was fore-warned from other reviews that the bulbs were very blue and pretty dim and that they were i could tell a night-and-day difference between this bulb and an ordinary incandescent it is very noticeably dimmer than the energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs i have around my house so why do i like them well an ordinary incandescent bulb might use 60 watts of power and this thing uses 3 even 60-watt replacement compact fluorescent bulbs use about 17 watts of power so these bulbs even make other energy saving bulbs look like power hogs by comparison the key consideration before buying is where you think relatively dim bulbs might make sense for your needs for me i have a porch light and two lights on either side of my garage that run all night the light is enough to illuminate that outdoor area well enough and since the lights run all night using these light bulbs saves quite a bit of juice my recommendation would be to use these bulbs as dim porch lights or maybe hallways but use compact florescent bulbs indoors if you need more lighting,204,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,fair chance this bulb will last forever as in ones life time if you do not keep it on 24/7 not supossed to be very subseptible to failure via repeated on / off cycles the phosphor that provides the white light may well degrade with time although principle problem is output you will not be able to use this for anything but going to the bathroom in the middle of the night perhaps some minimal outdoor lighting if push comes to shove you can read with it funky bluish,86,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,the light from this bulb is so blue that it seems like one of those bluish fluorescent lightbulbs that are used for fish tanks or raising certain plants indoors i mean it it is blue on the good side it does seem durable the spread of light is wide and even just like an incandescent bulb and it is output is similar to a 15w bulb if they would just replace the leds inside with warm white leds this would be a good product,83,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i bought the westinghouse nanolux led bulb and the cc vivid 36 led bulb at the same time to see which would work better as a low-power porch light even although both are rated at 3 watts the cc vivid is noticeably brighter although still not much and has a 60000 hour expected life-span instead of 50000 for the nanolux however it has a sharper cut-off due to the design of it is base and is significantly more expensive than the nanolux since i have both the cc vivid wins as the porch light while the nanolux might make adequate accent lighting,101,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,had not real high hopes based on current reviews but figured these might work in multiple lamp applications and close lighting naaahhh headboard reading light about 2 from page too dim to read multiple lamp application in ceiling fan night light only sorrrry back they go suitable for mood lighting only and at our age mood for what,57,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i bought this bulb on 2/3/2009 to use as a safety light inside the house in an air conditioned and heated area and have had it turned on almost continuously since february 2009 this march 2011 the bulb stopped producing light after only 19000 hours of continuous burn the bulb is currently advertised for 50000 hours so I am due another 31000 hours i checked the bulb in other working sockets and the bulb still did not work i installed another brand of light bulb in the socket used by this bulb and the other bulb worked so the problem was not the socket the problem was the bulb i should have returned the bulb but it took me a while to figure out when i had ordered the bulb by the time i figured out amazons new reports feature it was too late i had hacked open the bulb looking for a loose connection lesson keep an led light bulb diary and separate led warranty file therefore this bulb deserves a poor review,172,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,bought these to replace the bulbs in our exit lights and they work great hope they last 4 years like advertised good company to do business with,27,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,a much better 3 watt led light is the ever a19 3 watt e26 the ever a19 has a beautiful white light and is brighter also,26,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,ok so they have a small lag time when you flip the switch and are not as bright as other led lights but come on their 3 freaking watts what do you expect i am running these in areas where there are 2 to 3 bulbs like my ceiling fan and more works great and puts off soft light i have bought more than 5 and expect i will purchase more love them and they are great running off my solar back up,80,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,the westinghouse nanolux light bulb is superb and meets my need for great area lighting and low energy consumption westinghouse 03466 nanolux 3-watt g19 led bulb white,29,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,this is a very small bulb it is the equivalent of a 20 watt incandescent we are using it as a nightlight in a living room this is a good light that is non-polluting no mercuryit is a long lasting bulb about 50000 hours,46,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,fyi do not buy this bulb i bought it to try the new technology and this model is worthless not enough light to do anything even three in the bathroom fixture could not light the small bathroom maybe in a couple of years they will get this right stay with cfl for now,51,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,purchased to place in hood over stove even with light yellow metal of hood underside as well as shiny mesh vent screen it did not give off enuff light to even cook by so into alamp on lamp of three to see how it would reflect off cream walls / white ceiling okay to leave on for when darkness sets in and one enters that room otherwise it can be a very expensive purchase when there are other energy saving solutions out there maxxima mln-10 led night light with sensor pack of 4 these will light ur way into a room and when left in 24/7 go off when sunlight or lamps are turned on a much better investment than a single bulb that is dimmer than these,136,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i have many led head lamps and they are all brighter than this bulb why is it that we can not seem to find an led bulb that puts out any light for a good price and low watts frustrated,39,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these are soooo blue they barely illuminate at all bummer is not blue enough to use as holiday lights and the base is so wide i could not get them in walkway lights about the only thing they are barely useable for bottom line a waste of material mine are being returned i have others that are white so i am an led fan,64,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,well since stores do not carry these items yet in my area for all to see actual examples i ordered a few to try and i have to say that i am disappointed these bulbs are not that great at all and barely light a space enough to see they produce a very blue glow that seems like you are looking through night vision goggles only blue inand not white i wish manufacturers would understand the difference between thespectrum and correctly advertise the product so i think i will be returning them all for a full refund do not waste your money i have heard that there is a particular brand of led bulb coming to home depot that will actually fool most people so i am hoping to give it a try when i recieve a refund,142,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i bought this bulb to try out as a replacement for my 15w cfl reading light unfortunately i did not read some of the other comments closely enough and found out too late that this is an incredibly dim lightbulb do not buy this bulb unless you have a very specific low-lumens use in mind it is not adequate for much more than mild accent lighting comparable to a night light or less really,73,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i had hoped to replace some 25 watt light bulbs with these but they are much to dim and the lightis a distinct blue even with all five bulbs in place in the bathroom fixture the bathroom was dark and blue a definite no i have placed these in outside fixtures out back to provide a guide to the door they are not bright enough for much else not a 25 watt bulb replacement maybe a 10 - 15 watt equivalent and then there is the distinct blueof the light summary i do not like it,97,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,literally pennies on the dollar for where ever you need just enough light to walk or for a reading lamp that is very close to your head as long as you do not mind blue light i do not i actually find leds much better for reading in general although i have these particular bulbs in hallway and porch light if you are an energy minimalist you can not possibly beat the quality of this almost unbreakable indoor / outdoor bulb for the price yes i dropped one from a ladder unbreakable but I shall be more excited when true 60w white light replacements are available for under 10 because there are really only a very few places in the house where this makes any sense at all in fact i bought three and wonder what to do with the third since the other two will practically never need to be replaced best use in outside fixtures and walkways that are on all night all to help slow your meter down and get under baseline not to mention never need to climb the ladder there again they are rated to burn for almost 58 years,189,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,trying to go green but these light bulbs are way too dim great for kids room nightlights,17,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,this is a great bulb for accent lighting or using in multiples for a lighting fixture,16,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,when selecting an led bulb it is important to check the wattage of the bulb and compare that to how you intend to use the bulb most led incandescent replacement bulbs are in two wattages 3 watt which is about equivalent to a 20 watt incandescent bulb 7 watt which is about equivalent to a 50 watt incandescent bulb if you are familiar with compact fluorescent bulbs then you may notice the wattage equivalence is not the same there is a difference in light output between a 7 watt fluorescent and a 7 watt led on the whole you will need many led bulbs to replace incandescent or fluorescent bulbs in the same lighting situation a typical light in a living room for instance may use a 150 watt incandescent bulb in order to get somewhere near the same amount of light that living room need three led bulbs to replace the incandescent bulb finally the type of led bulb needs to be chosen carefully unless you are ok with a very blue cast to the light rather than the light orange cast of incandescents or soft white of the more popular brands of compact fluorescents,196,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this led light bulb preformed below expectations this bulb uses 3 watts of electricity but puts out less luminosity than 13 watt led light bulbs costing about one third the price i would not recommend buying this led light bulb lesson learned not all led light bulbs are created equal,50,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,I am not sure what the other reviewers are talking about this light is bright i have a breezeway between the garage and house where themajority of people enter i wanted a light i could keep on all the time for guests and myself trying to put your key in the hole in total darkness really sucks so for 3 watts i figured i could keep it on 24/7 without much impact i wanted something fairly dim that would just allow me to see the door and lock this light is almost too bright and illuminates all of the breezeway and some of the driveway i would not use it for task lighting too dim or a night light too bright but as an entryway light it is superb,128,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i like this bulb as a bright night-light i think it is good if that is what you want and you are fine with the white bluish colored light if you are expecting greater light output or warm white light then you will be disappointed pros the spread / distribution of the light is better more omni-directional than typical for led bulbs indoor or outdoor other easily noticeable blueishbrightness seems just a bit brighter than a 4 watt incandescent night-light bulb i also found a nice use for them in my fridge they are not as bright as a 40w appliance bulb and are bluish but they sure do generate a lot less heat,116,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this bulb is clearly not a 3watts bulb as i have an led bulb from another manufacturer that is rated at the same 3watts that is so much brighter,29,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,this bulb is dimmer than a 15 watt incandescent bulb i did not see any tv interference although the box says it could happen however this bulb is just too weak for any place i might use it the bulb comes in a nicely printed box this is unusual as most led bulbs purchased through the internet have plain white boxes with very little writing on them the price of this bulb seems to have varied widely from time to time and place to place in the last 2 months up to june 8 2010,95,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,the light works in and outdoors it puts out the light of a nightlight i put it in the garage which is always dark now i do not need to turn on the big lights every time i go in the gargag do not use it for a porch light or anything where you want real light,55,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these bulbs have a good build quality but they are not acceptable incandescent or fluorescent replacements,16,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i purchase two of these bulbs one is much brighter than the other and flickers both bulbs are dimmer than advertised and have a very very strong bluethese bulbs are about as bright as a 4 watt incandescent bulb but with a bluethe only application that this might work for is an inaccessible location that it is very hard to change the bulb and you want a very dim blue colored light otherwise do not buy to save energy the compact fluorescents are a much better choice but with a 3 - 4 watt bulb the old night light bulbs i use mine with an adaptor to fit in standard fixture does great and still uses so little energy after this purchase i realized i was being penny wise and pound foolish they are going back to amazon,139,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,they were too dim and i returned them they need to have a standard that let us the consumer know what the led light output is equivalent to in old wattage bulbs a simple 299 ge one led night light is better than these bulbs that would be okay as a night light but pricey when compared to a simple one led nightlight for 299 i tried to find out how bright these were and as i recall i did not see a equivalent too incandescent rating,85,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,i should have listened to the reviews very dim and blue you best have a flashlight near by if you need to read anything they indicate by the picture to use outside it is not as bright as they show in the picture try 50 times dimmer,46,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,i bought one for my garage door opener it is dim but enough light for me to get out of my vehicle and in the house safely my cat likes to chase mice in the garage at night and leaving a dim bulb on hopefully gives her an advantage so far it has been a winner all the way low watt just enough light and hopefully out lasts the short lived regular bulbs my garage has 4 100 watt bulbs in the regular lighting system for when i need to see like unloading groceries over six months now and it has made me happy all the way if it lasts a few years and saves me a couple trips up and down aladder then it will fully deserve 5 stars only time will tell,136,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,be warned this light bulb provides light with a decidedly bluish cast and is not suitable not by a longshot as a replacement for a 60w incandescent light the light is dim enough so that from ten feet three meters or so i can not really distinguish colors of things however the bulb may actually be a bit too bright as a nightlight if your nightlight is close to your bed this is the good part this bulb is cool and easy to use if you need a nightlight and suspect you may forget to turn it off then this is the perfect light for you at only 3w it will not run up your electric bill there has no glass in this bulb at least as far as i can tell the bulb is plastic specially designed to disperse the light uniformly this bulb is not a spotlight,145,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,as other reviewers have noted this bulb is dim i was wanting to use it to light a closet where a dimmer bulb would be fine but after installing it the bulb turned out to be too dim for the closet i now use it in a lamp that is used like a night light,55,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,the bulb is great for a 3w bulb i have a stairway with a single socket lamp that used to get hot with a 60w bulb in it i replaced it with this 3w bulb and it is bright enough to use the stairs at night i can comfortably leave it on all night without using too much power and it stays cool,62,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,it is amazing that the quality of led bulbs have not developed farther along i have been experimenting with the various bulbs for a few years now and sadden to say that no major company has steeped forward to develop an led bulb that puts out a normal light which is useful i have led flashlights that will blind you and will spot you something at 75 feet why can not they do the same for househould led bulbs i just ordered 4 more which may have promise one set uses the luxtron led which is what they use in the flashlights I am keeping my fingers crossed,106,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,not a replacement for a flourescent bulb the advertised savings are not really there with these bulbs i bought some and was disappointed when they did not give the same amount of light as a 99 nite light i can not even read by their light these bulbs are so dim i love theof these things and I shall have to see what products are out there which can outlast flourescent bulbs,70,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,we bought a light for our daughters room as a night light the light was a perfect brightness for this but after 6 months a flicker developed after 9 months the light was occasionally going completely dark an led light bulb should last for multiple years not 6 months,49,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i bought two of these for our kenmore refrigerator that friends warned about having issues with the light switch breaking they ended melting the interior and nearly burning their fridge when the light switch broke and the two 60-watt bulbs stayed on for hours these led bulbs fit well into the fixture inside the fridge and even although at first they looked pretty dim compared to the overly bright 120 watt total of the factory bulbs now i really do not notice it i think putting two 60-watt incandescent bulbs into the fridge is insane and kenmore should be ashamed what happened to the 25 watt appliance lights i wish the price of these led lights was more affordable but considering they last so long i think it is worth it as long as you do not expect them to provide bright illumination that you get from old styles bulbs or cfl i think you will be happy with them,158,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product the light output is awful if you are expecting to use this bulb to replace a 20 watt or higher bulb please understand it is not suitable,33,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,very disappointing night lights are brighter than this puppy maybe they will get it right with the next design do not buy this,21,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,bought this to put in a swing arm lamp for reading at night about seven months ago works very well for this purpose light is cool white against the much more yellow incandescent light bulbs makes a little soft noise while warming up,43,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,has good dispersal of light and can be used in place of an incandescent bulb,15,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,understand when you buy this it gives about the light output of a 15 w incandescent bulb that being said i used it to replace a 15 w bulb as my front porch light and have been pleased with the results i previously had the 15 w bulb on a photoresist switch mount such that the light was only on when it was dark outside this led bulb was not happy with that switch flickers on / off rapidly so i removed the switch mount and the led bulb is on 24/7 [ that is still lower total power usage so no problem ] the bulb works well even in sub-zero temps it gives enough light to find the key hole on the door but not so bright as to attract swarms of bugs in the summer exactly the right mix for a porch light it is bluish-white compared to the deep yellow of it is predecessor but i do not mind that,158,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,this bulb makes the perfect night lite and for only 15 to 20 watts energy useage what more could i ask for,22,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,yes they save energy but at the cost of producing light so it kind of makes sense that they save energy all i can do is echo what most people here have already said these are very dim and very blue there are few applications these lamps are suited to other than slightly illuminating a dark hallway with a somber frigid glow look elsewhere if things like lumens and warmth matter to you,72,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,i recently ordered three of these bulbs and was pleasantly surprised by them they appear to be the equivalent of standard 20 watt bulb not a 20 watt cfl now i must say of the three bulbs i ordered one of them cast a greenish-yellow light the other two bulbs are bright white i wrote a letter to westinghouse and they promptly shipped out a replacement bulb with no hassle great customer service i would like to clearly state that this is no replacement for a 60 - 75 watt cfl but i have sensitive eyes so the dimmer light is preferable to me you can read with this bulb if you have a goose-neck reading lamp or a lamp that would accept multiple bulbs,122,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,these bulbs are quite dim conclusion wait until leds improve or try another brand we have a pair of porch lamps after replacing one 13w cfl with this led bulb my wife said is it on comparing them side by side the cfl has about 4x the visible light output and about 4x the wattage so the led seems to have equal eyeball efficiency to the cfl if you are only concerned about getting your key in the door this is probably acceptable but for any kind of security move on i am trying to envision an indoor application because i bought 5 but can not unless you are living off the grid and concerned with every watt pass,118,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,if you are expecting this to be a bright light get a higher wattage bulb i use it in my backyard where it stays on from sundown to sunup and it is perfect for that just to give some light without being too bright and I am doing my part to reduce energy waste leaving this on for 10 hours is the same as leaving a 60 watt bulb on for 30 minutes,70,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,like has been said before this is roughly equivalent to 20 - 25w incandescent it is great in the fridge i do not feel the heat when i reach for stuff on the top shelf like i do with an incandescent and somewhat useful as a bedside light the one downside for use in a fridge is that the bulb is rather large about 25 diameter it is a tight squeeze for the fitting in my fridge,72,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,we have recessed lighting along our stairwell and these lights end up staying on 24/7 currently there are 5w cfls installed and i thought this would be an ideal application for led lighting the cfls are about half again too bright for what we need so i figured the leds might have a chance not even close at most they cast about a 2 - 3 halo of light and dim light at that beyond that radius not much help at all as a rough figure of merit i do not believe they cast as much light as a candle they are also a very blue light-but are so dim it really does not matter i expected some compromises with led lighting but these are just ridiculous i assume that leds that cost 10x as much as these might be useful but at current electric rates the payback is about 25 years i am hard pressed to come with an application where these might make sense given the duty cycle of a refrigerator light the payback is probably 25 years as well they might make a nice nightlight-except for the bulb base being a standard size i do not think thelends itself to mood lighting either,204,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,5.0,positive,when we starting putting these 3-watt bulbs lamps and other mood or supplementary lighting these bulbs cost 25 a piece even at that price they were a bargain they use less than 1/10 of a 40 watt bulb and we have seen a marked decline in electric bills i certainly hope amazon will find and sell more led bulbs at the 5 and 6 watt range because these bulbs are a greatand make a significant dent in energy consumption,81,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,for close low light situations this lamp is pretty good a desk lamp especially with a downward facing shade a range hood that uses 2 bulbs 1 led light may or may not be enough the light is white not the warm yellow of incandescent bulbs but i like the white light this can also be used in a table lamp that would be used as a bright night light that illuminates most of a dark 10x12 room or for low level mood lighting not bright enough for me to read by but my preference is for a bright reading light recommend and will buy again,106,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,yes i read the reviews before i bought this but i decided to buy it anyway this light is so dim and so blue that it is not practical it is equal to about a 15 watt bulb not 40 if you want to try an led bulb then buy a brighter one based on the lumen rating after searching I have found a 13 watt led bulb with 900 lumen but it is 70 subtract wasted money from this and it is really only 60 edited 1 - 17 - 09 this light is dimmer than the 3 watt mini maglite mag lite,95,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,2.0,negative,westinghouse 03466 nanolux 3-watt g19 led bulb white bought the bulb for back lighting behind my tv currently using a 40 watt incandescent which is a little too bright did not mind the super white bluejust not enough light here the haunted house description is very accurate no way could i read anything with this light in the room,63,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,if you like a good night lite that saves energy than this is your product otherwise they now sell xmas lights as leds alot cheaper than this or if you do not care living in a room that is like an solar eclipse far out man,45,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,he leido quejas de este producto respecto a la poca luminosidad pero por 3w que esperaban lo compre para mi lampara del buro u mesa de cama y es muy util pues no deslumbra como para despertar a mi esposa y da suficiente luz para leer o relizar actividades sin caerse o tropezar se puden colocar en lamparas con dos focos para mejorar la luminosidad buen producto instructivo y advertencias en espaol,72,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,the luxes level are very very low in order to save energy i recommend better fluorescent compact bulbs juan,19,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,I am not real familiar with led bulbs but this one was 12 bucks and said it was one of the brightest out there i put in in my lamp and to my dissapointment it was very very dim almost like a 15 watt refrigerator bulb in a living room lamp it isreminded us of haunted house lighting being as this was a shipment i have decided to donate it the last thing i want to do is spend more money returning it to amazon,85,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,4.0,positive,i got this to put in the hallway since my daughter leaves the light on all the time at 3 watts i will not complain about the light being on any more the cons they are a bit pricey but i waited for a sale theis very blue but it does not bother me the pros only 3 watts and 50000 hour bulb life no mercury like in cfls cool to the touch these are very good bulbs if you know what to expect up front i intend to buy more,91,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,the sad fact is this white led is the cheapest to manufacture that is why we see all of these blue white lights instead of the very nice warm leds that exist did you notice all the led christmas lights last year all very cold looking not what you want to see on a cold winter night but they are the cheapest so that is what they produce i would easily pay 30 for a warm white than 20 for cold white also it is way to pricey for the lumen output you can get warmer brighter led bulbs for much less,98,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,5.0,positive,thisworks great but a word to the wise you get four caps that was not apparent in the product description so i ordered four of theand wound up with sixteen caps when i only neded four take care,41,0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,one thing is for sure these cups are in fact magic sliders but non-skid cups they are not the product itself arrived on time and as expected but the cups are by no means non-skid i purchased these cups to keep our love seat from sliding around on the hardwood in the living room but honestly the love seat still slides as much [ if not better than ] before I shall be shopping around for cups that are actually non-skid not improved-skid,78,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,these cups are in fact not nonskid cups they are actually hard plastic cups that are super smooth and actualy ficilitate sliding easier than not using them they in no way stopped my couch from sliding when placed between the legs and the hard floor and slid around just as easily as the legs did although seemingly at random they would stick to the floor and the couch legs would slide off the cup i would recommend for nothing except for perhaps use as shotglass coasters,86,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,this product is a cheap plastic imitation of the rubber originals the casters do not stay on furniture feet because of the flat slick plastic and are therefore useless when trying to slide,33,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,4.0,positive,it is definitely does the job and the price is right also very speedy delivery it blends in well with my furniture so i would definitely recommend,26,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,2.0,negative,the furniture slid out of the sliders each time i tried to move the table the inside cup of the slider is too slippery,22,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,this product does not stay under the legs at all one tiny move and it slips right out there is no moving the furniture at all with these or they are left behind the product is difficult to place under the feet and when placed they do not stay so do not bother,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,5.0,positive,as expected they work just like they stated keeps the couch from scratching the floor and were the right price,20,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,5.0,positive,i purchased these because our bed kept sliding into the middle of the room and my pillows would fall off the bed i wanted to stop the bed from traveling all night these work fantastic no more taking trips in the middle of the night and having to find my pillows,51,13

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UVMOBW,1.0,negative,yes the fine print in thedescription says walnut brown but the photo is clearly black i made the mistake of ordering them because i wanted black slider cups these are useless to me oh well,37,16

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,horrible cheap never worked hate it only came with about 10 staples and i could not get it to work yuk,20,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,4.0,positive,i purchased this staple gun to attach paper targets to cardboard backing for use at the firing range it is compact lightweight and uses standard staples i would not use it for any heavy duty application but as a light duty staple gun it works well I have been using it successfully for a couple of months now with no issues and would recommend this,64,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,4.0,positive,thisworks well an was a bargain theeven is right and bright easily found in box or pouch,21,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,2.0,negative,i bought thisto attach blackout fabric forprojector screen to a fram made of 2x4s at first thiswas working fantastic until one of the staples shot thru the plastic at the bottom after that the remaining staples would not go completly into the wood and i have to drive them in the rest of the way with a hammer fir the price i paid i will not be returning thisi completed the task i needed it for and if i need another i will spend a lil more money and buy a metal heavier duty stapler,103,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,5.0,positive,because of the price i had my doubts that this would work however it is absolutely great i used it on my cornices which are attached to a board and it worked perfectly used my ordinary stanley stapler last time and it was a disaster these staples work perfectly on wood and the stapler is easy to use,58,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,5.0,positive,good standard staple gun i use it in my classroom to hang up heavier projects,15,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,4.0,positive,mine was blue-that is not really life or death quick delivery and so far this gun successfully staples through wood that made me happy clearly it does not take much to please me i have not had to put too much hard work into getting the thing to staple either easy grip easy handling,50,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,i purchased this a while back to havevon hand and just recently opened it to use and to my supprise the back piece that locks staples in did not come with it therefore i could not use it i was very disappointed,42,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,4.0,positive,i bought this product for my craft projects and it work just fine without complications i received as advertise with no surprises no problems with delivery will order from them again,31,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,2.0,negative,worked the 3 times i used it to staple targets up to plywood but like others stated the staples started coming through the bottom of the gun for 3 more dollars you can buy a arrow metal universal staple gun from lowes now going to have to buy another one,49,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,this stapler is marked in millimeters 4 - 8 mm tall and 07 mm in width the staples that amazon states that are most commonly purchased are 4375 in and 1111 mm in width without doing the math converting to and from metric to inches i purchased this with the extra staples they are to long i did use the stapler until i ran out of the staples that came with it and it did jam but was not hard to clear the jam i gave this product a one because after doing all the math it is extremely hard to find staples that will fit i have not found the exact size staples that go with it i am even trying to find a staple gun that the extra staples i purchased will fit,130,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,5.0,positive,i originally bought this for re-upholstering my kitchen chairs but it has helped with a lot of random crafts around the house and i could not be happier with it cheap but a great product,34,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000YZ1PW8,1.0,negative,pass on this one it is very flimsy and jams up a lot you can get a good metal one at walmart for cheaper if you ignore this advice then do not do the add-on staples in the larger size they do not fit this stapler,44,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i had need to mill some light aluminum for an experimental airplane once bolted to my drill press thewas solid and easy to line up with the bit i am very happy with the vice and the outcome on the pieces i needed to make,47,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,thisis completely different that the harbor freight cross slideor any of the other cheap ones it has adjustable gibs on both slides so you can take any play out of both of the cross slides the micrometer indicators are kind of hard to read but it is easy enough to set up an indicator with a magnetic base to read the distance i took mine apart before using it and filed / sanded all the surfaces that touch some of the ways were a little rough so I am sure this helped some of the liquid coating that covers that casting dripped onto the ways so i scrapped that off before sanding and filing i then coated it with regular synthetic oil same lube i use on my mini lathe and put it back together there is no play at all in either direction for 38 this blows the 50 harbor freightout of the water they are not even in the same category,164,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,very nicefor the cost i could not find anything else even close for the same cost the slide adjusters are accurate enough to use for basic milling i milling to a precision of 01 inches the vice is a little loose so you have to take shallow cuts each time i was able to achieve the required accuracy i needed of 01 inches this is the first milling project I have ever done and the milling was done with a drill press not a mill i had guidance from an experienced machinist in my set up and measuring thehas also been immensely useful for drilling so i do not have to constantly reclamp the work piece to move it,121,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it 's very nice for big machines but not for my little drill press even so it 's worth every penny i paid very very convenient,21,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not a precision milling table but it is fine for eye-balling the right x-y position and hold it there that is what i wanted that is what it does good job i have it mounted on a big delta floor press the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of amazons description i do not love cast iron hardware from china,65,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,clean it up when it arrives and it works perfect shipped quick as advertised will use this vendor again,19,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,bit snapped about 15 into soft aluminum made in china do not waste your money and yes that rust came with it,21,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,arrived missing several components spent 2 hours at hardware store buying replacement parts do not eve consider ordering this piece of crap,21,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,as a lazy and cheap retired machinist i expected more quality but was saddened when i got a good look at it poor quality and poorer engineering but like another reviewer I shall spend some time on it to try to bring it up to speed i would not purchase this again you pay your money and you take your chances that is the way it is,65,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,oh brother i probably would have kept it if it would have worked at all the thing is the parts did not all fit or match the lower threaded adjusting rod did not go all the way to the end like it was made for a smaller sizealso i am surprised all of the parts arrived at my home the heavyhad busted through the flimsy cardboard box and the inadequate styrofoam packing was broken in pieces fortunately i was able to return it at their cost,89,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very cheaply made not precise at all does it work yes does it work good no extremely hard to adjust,20,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i knew that this was a low qualitybut it arrived with pieces barely attached bolts literally hanging out about 1/2 and one part was left disassembled because the threads were messed up and it could not be assembled this is far beyond any possible notion of acceptability mywas knowingly shipped in a defective state I have since re cut the threads and certainly appreciate manufacturers who provide lower cost tools that can be fine tuned by the customer but this manufacturer has lost any respect i could have had for them,93,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,the slide is rough and jumpy apend rhe extra money and get a good one,15,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,device worked well solid and sturdy calibration dials were rudimentary but functional worth the money,15,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,i followed the advice of other reviewers on here and immediately cleaned filed sanded and greased the contact areas when i received it now it works well enough for what i need as received 2 stars after a little work 4 stars update actually used it and it is very loose and not smooth anymore i ended up having to tighten it down to the point it was nearly impossible to turn and it still slipped final review 2 stars,79,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,ok it is cheap but i do not need to do any super-precision work and i figured that for something made out of metal i could get this thing dialed in I am an engineer well it is actually pretty solid and would have potential except for one very critical component the lower axis screw threads through and drives a small loosely mounted threaded block made out of plastic this interface has an incredible amount of play which can not be adjusted and if the plastic wears out which it will the play will get worse and when it breaks you no longer can move that axis strangely the upper axis threads through cast metal and is reasonably solid,117,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,the lag screw that moves the table goes through a plastic block this block cracked in half during the second use rendering this vice inoperable i should add i was using it gently,33,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,first vice was cheap and had a plastic broken piece company contacted me and immediately sent a replacement the new one was much better quality and the plastic piece that moved the vice had been replaced with a steel piece that worked much better,44,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works good little to big for my drill press need a larger drill press,15,18

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,husband made a ak kit he said it did the job,11,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i did not expect much for the price i paid this made for a nice surprise to find that with just a little normal adjusting the vice is just what i needed if you do not work with tight tolerances 010 or so this vice should serve you well,48,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,like others stated low manufacturing tolerances leaves room for parts to wiggle take it apart lube appropriately and reassemble tightening nuts bolts and screws and the looseness goes away not bad for hobby work high precision or repetitive manufacturing will likely need something significantly more expensive,46,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i have nott had time to install it and use it yet due to illness but it looks good for my uses as far as i can tell will update later if it does not work or works better than i expect,40,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,works great built very solid i am using it on my drill press for more more accurate work you can not go wrong with thisand at a great price point i also received it in a few days ahead of the delivery time,44,24

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i surmise that amazon did not like my first review I shall make this one shorter i should have researched this tool better before i ordered it i wasted my money it is too rough to be used for milling but it does work as an oversized vice although it might be more useful as an anchor but i do not have a boat the vice came with a broken-off crank handle not from shipping the package was fine the postage to return it is not worth the benefit of a refund live and learn,89,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this is a good quality x-y directionali use it with a drill press to do precise work good quality and a fair price,25,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works fine it is not a highly precise milling machine but it gets the job done for non-precise applications,18,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,four stars as a 40as everybody else said this is aproject if you are expecting a ready to use product out of the box then thiswill get another one star review i read all of the reviews and knew what was coming so thanks to all that took the time to write those descriptive reviews i spent an hour disassembling and cleaning theright out of the box btw the brand name on the box is stark then i spent better part of two hours filing sanding and stoning the machined surfaces see pics at the end of all that i have athat is still only better than noat all what i had before buying this one,129,30

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,it needed some tuning and engineering to take out the slop it works great now great price super glue the crank handles and tighten,24,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the money you can not go wrong one issue you will need to deal with to make it function better and that is to clean it,25,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,easy to use has a very fine adjustment great product base could be reworked to fit other products,18,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,super fantastic works great on my drill press,8,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it has a little more slop in it than i was expecting other than that it worked great,18,38

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not the best but it is good for the money gil,11,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,the ways are rough on this thing after a complete rebuild and light lapping they are still rough but might be able to fix it with more work the backlash is also pretty wicked the price was right and it serves my needs and will stay on my drill press i have a mill for real work although,57,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,this feels like cheap assembly / construction unfortunately this is the only crossof it is kind that i need i have seen for sale on amazon lowes hd and meeks this thing needs a wd40 bath or drop in a bucket of lube the thing is really stiff to rotate back-forth / left-right,50,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,all i have to say is that yodaddy and big hoss are so right this is athat when you get it you take it apart you clean it up put it back together and it works just fine do not be afraid to take it apart it is easy all large pieces that go back together in a snap and it does not take more than a few minutes thanks for the review yodaddy and big hoss your reviews were on the money,81,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,greatfor a small drill press when you need to work on small things that require precision easy to set up and take down,25,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,i have never used this it just collects dust covered in thick oil and slides still barely move do not waste your money buy a good one,26,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,very loose and jumpy only works for soft material wood plastic,11,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,great for what my son needed it for,8,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,product as advertised good x-y feed for a drill press not for precision work,15,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works great a little stiff at first but may need to be lubed or just need some use now that i know how it works i am thinking of many more jobs it may be useful for it is a little large for my drill press so there is not as much room to mount it in different directions it may be better to buy a 3 one for a 15 drill press but i bought a larger commercial 20 drill press at an estate sale and it fits it better i will know better how it is after some use i am not a machinist so it will using it for many types of jobs jeweling the bolt on a rifle will be the first task,128,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is what it is a cheap cross slide vice cleaned it up and it works fine,16,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,a little on the sloppy side for doing precision milling however considering i was using a drill press when i made allowances for the lack of tight tollerances on the slide movement i was able to do a pretty decent job on my ar-15 lower receiver other than that the quality of the device for the price is excellent,59,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,poor workmanship platform unstable cannot perform precise cuts poorly made do not waste your money,12,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,not a tight precise machine ok for holding it to drill holes forget about milling,15,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the price it is hard to beat it took a little tweaking to get run out dialed in but after that held tolerance well enough for my purpose,28,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,returned for a full refund thiscan not be used for anything precision,14,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,while this probably is not made for a production shop it sure works nice in my garage on my drill press i took it apart and cleaned it up like some other reviewers said to do and it is working pretty darn good,41,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,first of all this is the 2nd time amazon has asked me to rate this they would not post it i guess they did not like my last review because i wrote that the product was junk and i would not recommend it to anyone i do not believe they will post this one either second the package was delivered to my neighbor not me i stand by my reviews period,67,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i bought this to help me mill a lower receiver for an ar15 the project turned out great for the cost of this vice i have no complaints,29,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,than this vice a two access vice that it a x and y acess in english that means two directions right to left and forward to back there are two hand wheels that allow you to move with ease if you are milling or drilling or any other process the requires moving to another location without removing the project from the vice,62,64
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,should have paid more attention to reviews saw a better one with better response at harbor freight this one does not line up with my drill press oh well lesson learnd,30,65
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i just finished doing the task i bought the thing for here are a few observations using an end mill with this slide table is problematic pretty much drill bit only chatter is death to an end mill and the work you are trying to complete that said you can easily rough the work and use the end mill for plunge finishing pockets which was just as effective if not as fast as just using the end mill to mill out a pocket super drill pressif you spend time setting it up 80 receivers can be finished with patience but you are not buying a bench top mill here if you combine the price of a drill press plus this slide table you can get a hobby mill that would be much better suited if you already have a drill press this is worthy of purchase,147,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,mounted this on a grizzly drill press and it works great i almost bought the higher priced one but glad i did not this is what i needed,27,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very poor way too much slack in cross feed i would send it back but it would be to much i will just write it off dw,27,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is a basicno extra bells and whistlesdoes what is supposed to do you could spend more money on a flashier one but not necessary,27,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,it looks like a nice thing but no handles in box were hay extras wood just like to no if it was over looked thank you,26,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,the price on this thing was unbeatable but the workmanship suffers however once assembled it does work quite fine for what I am going to use it for i think it will be perfect but true machinist types would not be happy with this,42,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i use thisand it has held up really well just a few tips for the buyer re-grease using really good grease i wired brushed mine on all moving surfaces re-greased and the motion is slick as glass the seller was very helpful with a shipping mishap the seller was prompt and concerned that it met my needs,59,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,as others have indicated it is a roughly manufactured vice the acme threads on the three screws vice closure x and y axis are very sloppy i was able to completely disassemble clean and lube it it smoothed out the operation considerably nothing can be done about the slop between the male / female threads but you can adjust the tension on the gibs using the set screws to have a reasonable piece of equipment i have it mounted on a 5/8 drill press and it performs well well worth the money considering it ships free and weighs about 30,98,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,anyone who gave this less than 4 stars must not realize exactly how the world works listen you are not going to mill parts for a swiss watch or anything with this thing but it works exactly how you would expect athis price would for any person that repairs stuff around the house or small shop that needs decent quality work this is fine if you are not happy with the quality at the price then fork over the 200 300 for one that is intended for that,86,74
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,thiswas shipped quickly and the quality of the unit is great not sure where these other people got theirs but i have had no problems with mine right out of the box very smooth operation on both x and y axis,43,75
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,would not buy for ato come broken just says it all made very cheap spend more and get a goodi wanted it for one project and i could not even do that they took it back with no problem although so that was good,47,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,expecting precise repeatability and high quality at this price point is for fools this is something that at best should be expected to be a compromise and never more than good enough in my case i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of thethe out-of-the-box performance and the quality of machining although the excellent machining may have been a fluke i have been impressed with thisfor the price my only real complaints are the handles are a joke they are floppy flimsy and appear to be bakelite and the paint job is laughable theappears to have been dipped in a mixture of recycled enamels baked and then finish-machined there are even brass and steel chips cured / baked into the multi-colored paint on mine,127,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,if your going to do something do it right i personally thought it was a sloppy piece of junk and sent it back your results may vary,27,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,horribledoes not like the picture does not function do not buy it this a total ripoff made in china can not say enough about this,23,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,both axis drift 060 rails not cut square took it apart cleaned it tried to square up without success do not try to use for quality work oh yea the x axis has z travel as well as stated earlier pos,40,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,thisis fine for very limited use where precision is not needed the parts are machined barely to proper fit / function tolerances meaning it works but is clunky,28,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it only took a few minutes to adjust the tension on theways to get a reasonably tight and linear travel good quality for a reasonable price,28,82
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,there are expensive mill vises out there but i was on a budget and this works well does require some lube for smooth movement and some adjustment to remove slack but then it is ready to go,36,83
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,total waste of my money the machining on this sand-cast import cross slideis very rough and inaccurate on my copy the upper dovetails are not parallel so it is sloppy loose on one end of the travel and jamming tight on the other to use it i have to be continually adjusting the three tension screws along the side of the dovetail furthermore the lower and upper dovetails are not exactly 90 degrees so i had to make a set of special tapered jaws for it to correct for the run-out i did not expect machine-shop mill quality at this price but i can not even cut a decent slot in thin aluminum with it it is ok for positioning a piece to drill a hole but useless for any milling or slotting,132,84
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,this is not a quality product but for casual shop work it is a good value i took it completely apart upon arrival cleaned off the shipping grease and added some metal shims to eliminate some of the excess play mounted it on my drill press and it performs very well allows me to drill very accurately and repeat as necessary has really improved the fit on items i make in steel,72,85
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,this is not a very well made or stablebut i puchased it simply to avoid having to clamp unclamp reclampit is loose and needs constant adjustment but because of the price i knew that going in so i gave it 4 stars simply because it did exactly what i expected it to do and it should last you can not beat the price,66,86
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,this thing is garbage the thing is so wobbly and shaky the screw thread clamps are not even close to quality they hardly turn with normal handles as shown in the photo the base is large and you will have a hard time trying to clamp it onto a drill press plate i would give this 0 stars and send it back if it was not too late and i saved the crappy corrugated box it is also terrible with plastic straps,80,87
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i expected that i would need to clean and adjust but this thing is barely functional the bottom screw for the slide does not extend to the outside of the vice casting so it wobbles around and gets stuck the vice portion has a catch in the middle because the flat sliding surface does not appear to be parallel with the shaft that the jaw rides upon to adjust i will need to drill out a pin very poor quality i will stick with hf in the future,87,88
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i am used to dealing with cheap tooling with a bit a babying or cleanup you can quite often get a good deal this however is just awful all slides wiggle side to side you can clamp down the screws a bit and this helps a bit but then it does not slide well the killer however is the lower pin that mates with the lower gear drive it is not round and is so undersized that the entire lower stage has 1/8 of slop if you were to try and drill anything tougher than thin plastic it will shake and either make an oval hole damage the bit or both avoid,111,89
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,works fine for the money i paid for it it is a great value decent enough quality works fine for my use no complain it can be more precise finer adjustment longer range tighter machine works those are available on the market just not at this price be prepare for to pay several times over,54,90
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,at first i was not too happy with my purchase but he shall i get what i pay for if you are looking to get within 05 this is not the product you are looking for it is misaligned and only has decent travel for about 2 inches works great on very small cuts also make no attempt to try and zero this out for a vertical mill because that will only piss you off,73,91
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i had to tear this thing down and rework all the ways and clean it up just to get poor results harbor freight has one for 5 more and it seems a lot better out of the box all of it is cheap chinese junk but you would expect it to at least function when delivered this one did not spend more for a qualityyou will not be disappointed update dropped theon the floor and the base cracked it is not like it fell 10 feet but i would think it would survive a 3 foot fall with little damage,102,92
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i would say this is a good buy for the money there are some rough edges but overall it is a very serviceable,23,93
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not high precision but it works for my needs and for the price it is a great value,20,94
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,for the price thewas a excellent buy delivery was good this was a very good deal for my use and saved me time and further cost,28,95
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for and that is what i got given those parameters i recommend it they said i need more words so here they are,27,96
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,this vice was very poorly made and a waste of my money the gibs are not very well designed for smoothing out the action returning it was too much of a hassle this time so i will use it as a paper weight in my shop,46,97
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,it is a cheap rough casting take it apart stone the ways put it back together with a little polishing compund and run it back and forth take it apart again clean thoroughly use a heavy oil reassemble and set the tension on the ways so that it is a firm smooth motion you are not going to machine to minute tolerances but I am happy with it,66,98
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,product i recieved was not as pictured mine has 2 tension screws not 3 the handles are low grade and the set screws that hold them on are worthless i had to replace them i also had to modify the retainer for the sliding jaw so it would not bind up you get what you pay for here,59,99
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,the vice is everything i expected and the quality is great tzseller deserves at least a ten rating for selling such a quality tool,24,100
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,yes this is a really cheapbut it does do what it is supposed to do i knew what i was buying when i shelled out only 30 bucks for this x / ythisunlike others has a nice low profile my big disappointment was that the rotation handles were not like those shown in the photo of the product i made this choice partly because of the handles i plan to voice my disappointment with the company selling these for a device like this the handles are important it does seem to track strait i am not seeing lots of wobble it has smooth face jaws so marring of the work will not be a problem you may want to take theapart if only to understand all the parts and how they work together,139,101
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before ordering so i knew what to expect and the top few reviews were dead on theis rough at best but after a using a file for remove major burrs some emery cloth to polish the slide surfaces and a little time and elbow grease I had say i have a damn goodfor under 40 yeah it is not top grade but will suit me as the weekend garage project monkey please do not buy thisif you do not plan to do some work on it because all you will do is post a negative review you have been warned,109,102
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,i purchased this to use on a bench top craftsman drill press to be used as a milling machine for many projects that i do as a gunsmith i do a lot of research before i buy just about anything I am glad i did for this crossit comes as others have stated covered in varnish / cosmoline / grease it needs to be removed i took the entireapart used a rotary tool to polish the sliding surfaces and then cleaned everything in my parts washer it cleaned up well i then treated it as a gun and oiled everything as needed added grease to certain areas and put it back together tightening everything i did not have to replace anything as once it was put back together it is almost like a 150 200 crossi say almost as there is a bit of loss in it is precision but for what i needed it for no issue overall once you do the work keep in mind you really are saving a lot of money over other models that come to you almost in the same unusable condition it is well worth every dollar of money and time,191,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this vice is a great addition to my bench top drill press i have had it for a while now and have been using it on almost a daily basis not just for milling work but it also works well as a bench top vice to i use this vice more than my standard bench top this cross slide is a great buy for the money you can not get a better cross slide vice i have used it to mill 6061 t6511 aluminum and various types of steel as well as other materials with no hangi did have to polish the surfaces that the vice slides on not required but i am picky and it was sliding a little gritty feeling at first but after i got it polished up it works awesome now,129,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,it is not the smoothest operation of gears in the world and it seems universal in the sense I am not sure what platform it is designed for but i have a small drill press and i bought some bolts large washers and wing nuts and mounted it to the drill plate and it works for my purposes,56,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,like many others here i found the bolts loose and movement very stiff took it apart cleaned all the shipping gunk off polished and lubricated it theis now a solid smooth piece of equipment if you want an inexpensivethis is the one to get just remember you will have to clean polish and lubricated it before you use it,63,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,screws must be tightened past ehere wheels can be turned with the handle other than that thisworks fine I am milling delrin plastic which is just a bit easier than aluminum my drill press table will not lock anymore probably because of all the plastic shavings but theworks perfectly,53,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,pleasantly surprised the ways on thisare adjustable so you can make it nice and tight the handles have some play in them so i used some loc-tite green for cylindrical bonding to stiffen them up a few minutes to adjust all the points of the slides and properly lubricate it and it is a decentfor under 30 bucks for all the little drill press projects i am going to do,75,108
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for in my case i just wanted to hold a piece to drill and tap not great accuracy but it does the trick i like the little vice i have a machine shop so i can make things to tweek this product for example if you want the vice in the middle of the table you will have to have an extension bar to move your y axis because the handle will hit the table it works and if that is all you want then enjoy if you want precision go to kurt,95,109
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,this vice is not quite that pictured in the sale image the one i received is quite stiff and trundles up and down when being adjusted on the other hand it is very stable and the top slide can be used separately sooo it is worth the money it was delivered quickly and on time,57,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i was hoping to get one of these simply to increase the accuracy of spotting holes on pieces using a center drill in my drill press i went to local tool supply store to check thisout and it was simply a very cheap piece of chinese junk far worse than i expected of course the price raised that flag so i put it back in the box and did not buy it would rather spend two or three times the asking price for something a bit more solid and accurate like others have said you get what you pay for,101,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,even although the pic shows a black unit i received a blue unit my handles are solid billet while the ones on the black vice look plastic a few minor differences but the thing worked well and had good grip,40,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,they sell these all over the place ebay amazon harbor freight none of them are worth a hoot all they will do is make you miserable and as far as fixing them good luck maybe if you have some professional machinists tools you can do something with them otherwise boat anchor and not a good one because it ll get stuck on something and you will never be able to pull it up again z,66,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,there is considerable play in the ways in both axes the crank on one axis interferes with the slide limiting travel to a very small amount it is not remotely square there are several loose fasteners and fasteners that are not straight i was expecting better even for anat this price,52,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,those of you complaining about the quality of the product are probably not happy with anything ever you need to consider that you can not even buy a standard benchfor 30 dollars let alone awith an x and y axis movement those of you with realistic expectations will be thoroughly satisfied those of you who want professional machinist quality results will need to she shall out 100 dollars or more you get what you pay for i am totally happy with thebecause i had 30 dollar expectations for a 30 dollar product,96,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,i expected this unit to be somewhat sloppy due to the very low price i was prepared to disassemble and polish all the mating surfaces the paint blobs pressed into the surfaces and crude machine work should be expected for such a cheap unit what i did not expect were key ways that were milled off by 10 degrees the mating surfaces only contact at their edges which were pitted and irregular there is no way to get a reasonable amount of slop out of it without it binding in places across it is travel it is not worth returning it due to the cost for shipping a heavyI shall use it as a fixedforget milling with it,118,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,2.0,negative,quality lacking but price cheap translation you get what you pay for wish i had spent more and purchased better quality,21,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,beware the price is cheap and you get what you pay for the machining was so poor that there would be no way to get any accurate milling i returned thealthough the shipping was almost as expensive as the product kudos to the seller for refunding theand their shipping bottom line heavy junk might work as a boat anchor,64,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,very poor quality the ways were machined poorly very rough and uneven machining with lots of chatter and the adjusting screws were cheap i was unable to get the excessive play out of the ways even after much tinkering there is also a lot of end play in thescrews especially the bottom axis the bottom axis on myslides back and forth about 1/8 without turning thescrew this makes it almost impossible to position anything in thereliably after taking theapart i noticed that one of the adjustment shims was drilled completely through so the adjustment screw was not pushing on the shim but directly on the way itself i was going to bring the whole thing to my relatives machine shop to re-mill the entirebut i think it would be easier to build a whole newfrom scratch instead of fixing this one do not waste your money no matter how low the price,164,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4.0,positive,there has about 18 inch depth in the clamping area they open to about 3 effective bite spring strength is about right for laminating get a bunch of them these clamps are stamped from sheet metal they look kinda cheap but work as good or better than the american 2 - 4 hardware store variety they are far superior to the curvy plastic kind that cost around the same price,67,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,as described arrived quickly very happy great price,9,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4.0,positive,these are pretty strong clamps i have not used mine for much yet but they appear sturdy and strong,18,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1.0,negative,very little spring pressure i have some that look just like this and will hurt you if you clamp it on your finger these look the same but are not the spring pressure is harder the further you open them but if you are clamping thin piece of metal or wood it does not have enough pressure to adequately hold the piece down i do not recommend these it is back to lowes where they are more expensive but i guess you get what you pay for,85,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4.0,positive,these are good clamps the cool orange padded insulation covers slip right off the first time you use them squirt the orange pads full of form a gasket and slide them back on then you are gtg,37,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1.0,negative,these are not at all like the photo in the picture the grips look like they were painted on not thick at all like the photo the clamps do not open very wide so i could not use them for the intended woodworking purchase unfortunately the cost to ship them back is more than what i paid so i guess i just lost out on my money maybe i can use them for something at work think they will hold stacks of paper together,86,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,great simple clamps i like the red handles it makes them easier to see i will probably buy more since i use them all the time and this size works with virtually anything if i need to secure / hold larger objects i would use larger bar clamps but that goes without saying use the right tool for the job the only thing i had to change was i glued the rubber tips and handles to the metal so they would not slide off,81,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,good enough quality for my project delivery was fine and on time,12,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1.0,negative,these clamps look nothing like the picture these clamps have a straight profile whereas the clamps pictured have an arched profile this means that the clamps open to only 2 and 1/4 inches if you are clamping two small boards together they will do the job if you are looking for 2 and 3/4 to 3 inch jaw openings look elsewhere i have given the 1 star rating due to the fact that the pictured clamps and what i received are totally different update well i am glad that they changed the picture to what the clamps really look like all of the plastic coverings have come off the clamps at the time of this update i really did not expect a lot from the clamps and my rating would have been around three stars but with the picture being wrong and the jaw opening size being incorrectly stated at the time of my original purchase 0ne star is about the right rating,163,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4.0,positive,i use these clamps when it comes to the bigger jobs they work great and hold items very well i even have attached then to shelving to hold up screens and dividers,32,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,this is just what i ordered this is just what i wanted and i was lucky and happy to find it available from amazon at a good price and brought right to my door,34,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,i bought these to hold our pet food bags closed i know it sounds a little weird but we were trying to use cloths pins and they were just too small we have multiple cats a big dog and about 200 humming birds to feed so we buy in bulk to get the bags to stay closed you need some serious holding power and these clamps do the trick,69,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1.0,negative,they are 2 inch clamps the deals is not as cool you are better off going to home depot and buying better quality clamps for 99 cents or so,28,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5.0,positive,they are heavy duty and the springs are strong they seem to hold as well as expected I shall use them all the time,23,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4.0,positive,they do what they need too i had purchased another set of pretty much the exact same things 6 in heavy spring clamps from another manufacturer and they had a much stronger clamping grip but these do the job really good for gluing or joining parts together,46,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,reading other reviews i thought these lights would be quality they were not they are all plastic except for the stake but that is cheap metal very disappointed sent them back immediately but to add insult to injury i had to pay over 800 in shipping out of my own pocket for this piece of junk buyer beware,58,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,it was nice reeived the package intact the lights are easy to assemble they look nice in our front yard,20,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i bought both moonrays 91398 balletto style solar powered hanging plastic path light and this one and i think this one is much better than the moonray light the only problem of the product is the battery without good batteries the lights are just pieces of junk can only last for around 2 hours at night but after replacing the batteries the effect is so good that I am thinking buying more btw i bought sanyo eneloop batteries and they works great for these 2 weeks,85,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these two solar candles were a perfect accent for the patio they really look like real candles and light up all night,22,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i bought four of these solar lights to replace four similar lanterns i had had for seven or eight years unfortunately the ones i had were no longer being made or i would have bought those but these were the closest i could come but when i received them they were not even close the quality of the stakes was poor and two of them bent immediately trying to put them in to the same holes i had before the lanterns themselves were flimsy / cheap not made in heartland america at least the heartland america i know the lanterns may have worked a whole few weeks and then they died never to return i should have sent this junk back but i did not i live in south-central new mexico and we have sunshine lots of sunshine more than enough to charge these lights the lights still stand well two as a reminder to myself to not buy junk like this again if i can not find quality setups do not waste any more money i would suggest to others they do not waste their money either at least not on these,183,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,would have been great if they were not all smashed to pieces in the box too cheaply made to withstand shipping returned,22,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i love these little solar lights they have a wonderful flickering effect that mimics a candle,16,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these solar lights are extremely dim they are barely even visible along the pathway i purchased them to help light the pathway to the door at night I have had to purchase others because these did not do the job i would not purchase these again,44,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,amazon said this light is heartland of america but they shipped me the light by lily home i bought this product from heartland of america before and they are good but this one from lily home is a strip down model they are the same price of 3000 for two lily home light use only one battery instead of two it has 2 battery compartment but one is not wired up so the light is very dim and almost could not see that is on even the candle itself is very small not like the one heartland of america which is big did amazon do a switch on me because it said the light is by heartland of america the product detail is lily home did amazon advertised one thing and sell the other may be heartland of america product is sold out so they sub the lily home instead do not buy lily home product and it is not good at all construction is poor light is very dim and use one battery instead of two lily home product is bad,182,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,the lamps are very poor quality being made of very thin plastic the lamps i ordered had scratches on the pastic and appeared they would fall apart with the first good wind i would not recommend this product the lamps really look nice on-line but not in person i returned thethe day i received good news is amazon stands behind the products they sell,66,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,no the lights are not yellow are white and the quality of the batteries is very poor,17,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this purchase i ordered two pairs and from the 4 i received i had to take parts from all four to create two functional candles pieces were broken upon arrival batteries were old and not working wires were not connected and the metal posts from which the candles hang were not complete,57,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,very cheap for a reason do not expect it to last very long we did not even bother to get them after we used them after the wedding,26,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,total junk had to return them save your money,9,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,only three flickered then two died replaced with others purchased elsewhere not what i expected,15,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love the flickering i use them all year round but they look especially nice with winter decorations,17,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these months ago and they have proven the test of time against the florida rainy season they are beautiful in planters and i always get compliments,28,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i received a defective set one lantern arrived with the dawn / dusk sensor ripped off and the other had a deformed battery cover the glow is surprisingly minimal given the size of the candle and i even used my own fully charged battery to test it very disappointing,47,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these for my mom and she just loves them heed the warnings about the inferior batteries that come with these solar lights although and get yourself some 2300 mah energizer power plus nimh aa rechargeable ones instead,39,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,beautiful lights they make my front porch look so neat,10,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i just love these putting them along the bushes of a walkway in front of my home the soft flicker looking like a candle in the night the charge does not last as long as i would like but it stays on about four to five hours and for the price these are also hard to find as an fyi and having owned similar solar lights before i took these apart and put caulking around the inside of the solar panel holder which tends toand allow rainwater into the electronics and of course you will want to bring these in during the high point of winter to give the panels longer life out of the elements which seem to be in all these kinds of units the first part that goes,133,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,I am not the pickiest person and will settle over most things whew i have to say these poor things are really cheap flimsy and unattractive the company that makes these hired a good photographer for the product images the lights inside of the candles only illuminate the side of one wall and i can see shadows of the wires the lanterns might make it through one season if i do not expose them to the rain they are so ugly i stuck them on the side of the house I had say you get what you pay for but I have bought cheaper candles from a dollar store that look better than these,110,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look beautiful in the photo i wanted lights just like these and loved the look the package arrived and they are made of cheap plastic i broke off one of the stems that place them in the ground and it was soft ground after it just had rained they are not sturdy i live in a windy area in the mountains the light they emit is very dim not what i had imagined would tell other to steer away from making my same mistake,85,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,candles work great get a lot of comments on how they look only use in the summer only thing would recommend better batteries for longer life,26,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i purchased two pairs of these lanterns and am very happy with the 3 that worked one was defective which is why i gave the product only 4 stars i used these lanterns to replace the battery powered lanterns i used previously these are much easier because they can be left on constantly and they recharge every day they looked very pretty hanging in my perennial beds all summer i added split rings to the top of these lanterns so that they would fit on the sturdier shepherds hooks already installed instead of the flimsier hangers that came with them i did use one of the included hangers to hold a different garden ornament,114,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,one of candle did not work already i try to switch reset and figure it out outside but i do not know what is worng,26,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,the lights arrived not too long after i ordered them i am very satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the lights themselves they are like glowing candles in the dark after soaking enough solar power,38,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,since heartland america will not post let me post an unhappy review on their site I shall post it here do not buy this set it was embarrassing i bought this as a gift for someone and they have not been able to get it to hardly work she told me all kinds of damage was done to the products and some trouble was went through to get these lights to work a little i contacted ha and they said since she had to work with it to get it to turn on somewhat they considered it being tampered with and would not assist in any customer service you have been warned,108,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,love the natural glow and flickering of the candlelight the only reason i did not give the product 5 stars was because the original batteries that came with it were cheap and had to be replaced,36,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,after only a few days only one lights up i am very disappointed with this product this product is very cheap,21,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these look like they might be pretty high quality but do not be fooled they are super thin black plastic and easily damaged during shipping amazon sells some great products but these are not part of that set,36,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i purchased this set for the cemetery at my parents graves i liked the concept of a candle flickering in the night unfortunately when i received thenumerous key pieces were missing a solar battery a battery cover screws for the rod to put together i had to invest more money to correct all the problems would not reccomend anyone buying this too bad i like the look of the light but not the people that distribute it,79,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,given the price of these lights i was expecting a better quality product first off do not be surprised if you are missing the screw lags that connect the 3 piece poles together as i found mine rolling around in the bottom of the box the lights themselves appear to made of very cheap plastic with large gaps between individual pieces i do not expect these to hold up to the elements for long the top of both ground stakes broke as i gently pressed them into the fresh dirt around my patio stones which is another example of the cheap quality i have lots of solar ground lights at my property and these are by far the worst stakes I have every seen so be very careful when you put them in the ground i plan on replacing the batteries as per other reviews experience but time will tell how these lights hold up to the weather,156,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,this product is not amber when received they are white if you are ordering them for the specificit shows you will be disappointed,25,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these came in and i put them right back in the box and sent them back each one had 1 out of 2 battery doors broken they would not stay locked on their own 1 of the batteries was out as well upon arrival i could not imagine having to use tape for an outside lantern just to keep the battery in so it would work correctly each one also had 1 out of the 4 locking mechanisms broken off and missing 1 lantern had a big glob of glue or something on the top as well that looked really crappy they are all plastic and you can tell they just look kind of cheap and well plastic the stakes that come with them are in 3 pieces which i thought odd you have to screw them together and never looked exactly straight to me they are not 100 horrible although and can serve a purpose maybe i was just unlucky and somebody else would get them in a better condition I am just not taking a chance again,176,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are very cheaply made do not waste your money they are also white and not amber as pictured,20,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these are delightful providing a wonderful hint of lit candles as they hang in our living room one reviewer was correct place new batteries in from the start and they last forever,32,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,merchandise was constructed very poorly fell apart very easily when handling very poor performance only stayed lit for two hours at the most daily have ordered similar product from another seller and they work just great stay on all night,40,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love these lights for the ambiance they work great the light submitted is low but i love the amber affect,20,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,I have had these lights for a couple of years now and enjoy watching them when I am sitting outside i especially like seeing them sway in the breeze they have a soft glow and flicker randomly much like real candles in fact shortly after i moved them to a different corner of the house my neighbor called worried that something was burning in the back yard these lights are decorative they are not bright enough to light a walkway they have withstood plenty of wind and rain they do need a lot of sun to charge I have had the best luck with them on the south side of the house but you can remove the batteries and charge them if you have a nicd battery charger the batteries that came with them stopped charging after less than two years i put the lights in storage during the winter i do not know if that contributed to their demise after replacing the batteries they are working fine again,163,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,thiscame with a missing part that the other lantern could not be as tall as the other one it was returned and the customer service did not follow up thewas cheaply made not like the photo,40,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,contents arrived with pieces broken off inside the light housing original seller / manufacturer did not use packing materials disappointing because it is difficult to find amber solar lights rather than the white lights that almost look blue,35,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i purchased these for a christmas present and returned them immediately they looked very cheap and not what i expected at all,22,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i really liked this but the batteries corrode regardless of the type they light are great for pretty and not functional because they do not put off much light we got about 1 summer out of them before they went to crap not really worth it,45,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love love love these solar lights they work great and look fantastic i will probably be buying more would highly recommend buying these,23,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i had to send them back because they were obvioulsy used they had scratches on them and only one of them worked i was very bummed because i loved the looks of them if they could assure me that i would get brand new ones then i would definately order them again i can not find these anywhere else so very disappointed,61,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,a very good purchase no problems i enjoy watching them at night would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying this set,24,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,what you see is not what you get can not tell by the picture what you are actually getting it is all plastic and very flimsy not worth the money get better ones in home improvement stores for same price,37,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are not what they claim to be they were fine for the first week since then i have not gotten them to burn anymore either of them do not waste your money,32,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i was so excited to put these on either side of one of my garden statues and they looked terrific the first night and they have not come on since i like some other reviewers also broke the flimsy shepherds hook just trying to put it into very soft ground so i used a couple of my big lots hooks luckily they fit through the top ring of the lantern i did see the review regarding bad batteries and may try that because they really did look like candles flickering for the first couple of hours however i would not buy again not worth the hassel of returning,106,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,these are way cool unfortunately the hanger part broke on one of them right away it is still useable just can not hang it up,23,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these are attractive when viewed close-up unfortunately one of my two stopped working i tried new batteries and even charged them in my home charger at first it came on if i tapped it but then it stopped entirely i do not recommend them,44,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i have 10 of these and might get more if i want to hook up these lights to a solar array it panel can be done easily breaks if not handled real carefully but the shipper replaces them without fail and covers the shipping cost so no pain for me the cheap plastic top when you fist go to turn on the battery would break easily as you then try to lock it in place i learned through this breakage that thisbattery while cheap the wires can be hooked re-connected to a solar panel to get all night lighting you can find a good panel at any store which you can find woks allnight for thirty bucks which comes with their own lights i have which i plan to hook up in far future but for now it lasts about 4 - 5 hours in full sun and shade and 55 to 6 hours in full direct sun i added pics,161,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look very nice but unfortunately are very poor quality i broke one just trying to get it open to turn it on the price makes it cost prohibitive to send it back i will spend more to get better quality the next time,44,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these look great on my walkway on the way to the patio they look just like lit candles very romantic looking and pretty durable so far i have a few large dogs and they have bumped into and knocked them over quite a few times and they continue to work just fine very pleased with these solar lights,58,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i love thisand feel i received a good bargain i have put these two lights in the front by a walking path and they have really improved the look and curb appeal of the yard not just at night when they are flickering but also during the day even although the lantern part is plastic it is hard to tell it is plastic and they have withstood a couple of pretty severe hailstorms without any damage at all i am very pleased,83,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i love the look of these lights but they are not amber they are white i bought them because i thought they were amber also the plastic holder the stake goes in broke immediately on several of the lights very cheap the lights worked okay for two nights and then they stopped working completely when they did work the lights did not stay on for very long what i found out after only a few days of use is that the top plastic part have several sections that are glued together and the glue stopped holding and the top part of the lights started coming apart which caused the wiring to pull apart after trying to fix this i was so aggravated at how cheaply they were made and how they kept falling apart that i threw three of the four lights i bought out a complete waste of money i see now that for something like this it is important to see and inspect them for quality before purchasing,171,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,they look so nice but how fall are they I am looking for some like this but tall like 6 maybe,20,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i have never written a negative review but i have to warn people these are complete junk i buy from amazon all the time but these were a complete waste of money i literally broke these in just ten minutes and have thrown them away cheap quality and the plastic tops of the lamps broke just untwitsting to turn them on the metal stakes do not align so i could not use those either this is my personal opinion but the worst purchase i ever made on amazon save your money folks,91,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,easiest thing i have ever setup press and hold time while pressing hour and more does not get any easier i got this for turning on / off a lamp place in bottom outlet and you can still use the top one great design i have not had it long so i hope it holds up for my 5 stars,55,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the timer works as advertised i recommend it to anyone who wants a multiple setting timer,16,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,problem amazon write-up on it when i purchased it indicted that it would handle 15-amp loads but when i got it i found that it will handle just a bit over one-half of that advantages electric motor timers power draw is actually enormous overall since that little motor in them is running 24/7/365 and you can feel the heat generated by them and they lose their timing schedule with a power outage this timer is all electronic and has a back-up battery thus taking almost no power to operate and keeps it is timing cycle after power outages after replacing 3 electric timers with these a measurable drop in kwh was noted making it a good green device other once you get used to the programming and over-ride sequences required it is easy to use,136,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the turn on / off is a lot quieter then the mechanical relay types the manual bypass is also a good feature lite on lcd panel would have been helpful,28,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,i normally like woods products but what a disappointment this one arrived dead as can be the display would not operate it would not power up so i must join the chorus of unsatisfied customers here whose timers simply did not work woods needs better quality control,47,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,thisjust does not work i would not recommend it i returned it despite multiple efforts this timer did not work maybe i received a defective one but based on other reviews it seems unlikely,33,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,i had two of these and neither could hold it is programming for more than a few hours I had come home find the light still on and the screen in the timer blank i would not recommend this even although it claims to use less energy than a mechanical timer,48,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,the first timer i bought lost it is programming and time / date within one week of use thinking it was just a defectivei requested a replacement which amazon sent within two days to me however the second timer also lost it is programming within a couple of days i thought that maybe i needed to charge it for awhile before putting it into use so i charged it for a day same thing happened I have had to reprogram it about 5 or 6 times in less than 2 weeks and it consistently is losing the programming i was hoping it would work because it has 20 on / off settings but with it not keeping it is programmed settings it is just a worthless piece of plastic I am sending it back to amazon for a refund and will be buying a timer from a brick / mortar store that has 6 on / off settings i need something that i can depend on and this timer does not fit the bill,161,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,bought two and each repeatedly lost the programming i painstakingly entered received two replacements and they do the same thing,20,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i have had this hooked up for over a year and it turns the lights on and off as programmed simple to set up a great product,27,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,very nice when i received it worked fine very easy to program but it just stopped working after 10 days,20,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i like that you have so many options for it to activate i set mine to turn on the bedroom light monday thru friday i was really glad it did not have only a choice for every day i do not want the light to come on at six am on saturday,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,my old mechanical light timer drove me nuts with it is constant grinding noise as the wheel turned and the big clicks when the lights came on and off this is silent which is what i wanted it is also been totally reliable out of sight and out of mind and working reliably I am glad i picked this one,57,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,the user interface is quite standard and works reliably it is a bit slow to rotate through 60 minutes it would be nice if there was a way to decrement the minutes / hours,32,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,we have tried other timers but they often cost a lot more and have less features like most products mass produced in 3rd world countries there will be a couple out of 100 that are not perfect good luck trying to find an alternate product that has a built-in rechargeable battery backup so you do not loose the programming in case of a power failure 20 program on-offs daily weekly m-w-f mtwtf sat-sun easy to program easy to read and no dip switchs to loose for the money you can not get a better timer it works great with our redytemp whole house no-wait hot water optimizer,103,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,bought two of these timers both were broken one never turned on and the other the time could not be changed maybe the off chance one is defective but two product stinks would have given a 0 star if given the opportunity,42,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,this auto-switch works as advertised it lost a star because i thought it could have been a bit easier to program it was not that hard or anything just could have been easier,32,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,it could have gotten 5 stars but the directions were a little confusing it works fine and the time invested in figuring out the directions was worth it not expensive and works great,33,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i have three of these that have been in use for several years and i like them much better than the analog timers that they replace they seem to keep their time more accurately and the fact that you can set them to the exact time instead of approximating as with analog timers is a plus resetting the time is not as easy as it could be but if you follow the instructions it is not too bad my only comment is that mine look nothing like the photo that amazon has posted and i know that the part number is correct i got it off the back of the unit,110,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,pros i was excited when this timer arrived to discover that it actually handled 20 on / off times when the product description said it only had six the unit was easy to program and operate cons within 3 days the unit malfunctioned and reset itself losing the time / date and all programming this unit was controlling my cat feeder so I am glad we were not on vacation when this happened the next day the screen went blank and i had to hit the reset button to bring it back to life I am returning the unit for a replacement and will update this review if the replacement turns out to be more reliable,109,19

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,after several attempts to find an old-fashioned timer that would last more than a week this has been happily cranking along keeping our fish well lit the directions say to charge before setting the timer but i had to use the reset button while it was plugged in to get to the setup screen the override settings are a bit odd but once you get used to it it provides a wealth of configuration options i will probably never need the backup battery is a nice feature and seems to work fine tested with an intentional outage,97,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,i purchased three of these about a week ago am very happy thus far great price great functionality one appeared to be dead on arrival but i just pushed the recessed reset button and it sprang to life what i received is slightly different in appearance to the internet ad less asthetically pleasing but has even more flexibility 20 settings / day you can easily configure it for all seven days of the week at once if so desired which would normally be the case packaging is clearly marked indoor use yet i am currently trialing one outdoors i have always used the old-fashioned mechanical timers this seems far superior,109,22
