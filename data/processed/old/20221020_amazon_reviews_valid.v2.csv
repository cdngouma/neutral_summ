All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,the 17fl oz that is claimed on bottle is actually fraudent the bottle has less than 01 fl oz the whole quantity of the cream fits in that little middle bottle that is fitted inside the huge long bottle which is not 17fl oz by far that is why the diptube is that short see images the product owners lie about the quantity and for sure they are lying about the quality of their product give the positive reviews a second thought,81,18

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this is a great product shipped 2 weeks early and looks real i got them to feel like i have piercings and to trick my friends because I am not allowed to have piercings yet anyways this is a great product that looks real the only problem i have with the product is getting them on they are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place they are so small you have to practically rip you lip off but when on they are secure and feel great also if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials this is for you i am very sensitive to certain materials and this i was having a reaction to so be careful but the product is great and looks real and theis fantastic i got 5 rose gold colored rings they are beautiful i can not blame the small size to get on your lip although because it makes the product more secure when on so overall i am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars,185,20
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i absolutely love them came 7 days early and even although u can not pick the colors i received two red two pink and one purple sense i do not fancy pink i just used nail polish and painh the pink ones black and held them till they were dry enough to set down and then when dry i put a clear coat on and they look like they came black i also altered purple to silver and then to blue i just used nail polish remover and then changed theso super simple and i totally recommend them do not threat if u do not get the right,108,21
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i just got these in today I have had multiple piercings in the past and my skin always rejected them so this is a great alternative for me it came with 1 black 1 green 1 pink and 2 red rings they are comfortable and easy to use and look like the real things great to use as a nose ring lip ring or septum ring,65,22

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i originaly thought they would come in assorted colors but they all came in this really nice light purpleso I am not that upset as for wearing the actual product itself it feels a little painful when you wear it for long periods of time i wore it as a lip piercing and it felt a little weird after an hour or twoi could talk just fine but i could not drink with a straw because it would shift around uncomfortably but the feelings easy to ignore if you distract yourself from it,95,33

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these are awesome they look very real and I have been convincing everyone i meet the only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you do not feel it after a while i also did not get muchvariety i only received 3gold and 2 black rings which is completely fine with me i can not complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they are great i also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected,81,44
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i bought some of these and they do not hurt and they did not put a hole on you no matter where you put them i wore them all day long on my lip because that is where the original piercing is and ther was no hole left by these fake ones the reason i wore this was because i was taking a break from my real piercings i was quite comfortable with these and i will buy them again,78,45

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i bought two different colors of these i am that girl that hates wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day these are great i use a small lip brush to apply that i bought cheap from cvs make sure your lips are mosturized before using apply it slowly covering lips and do not close your mouth and let lips touch until dry it will look funny but do not worry i let it dry for about 5 - 10 minutes then peel off it looks great i sometimes put chapstick over top of it if i want that shiny gloss look after about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone i love these for nights out or events where i do not want to keep reapplying lipstick plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and i can eat and drink with no problem last pic i posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch cherry red was applied that day i recommend to all the lazy girls that still want to look great,187,11

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is impossible to get a clean line the container was approximately 25 full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked it deserves no stars,57,19

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product it was super new the shipping was way faster than i had thought it would be the product got here in perfect shape overall the lip colored stayed on all day i would recommend you to buy this,45,39
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,applying lipsticks would not be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo,11,40
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,this is a terrific little addition to the make-up case it is a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great first you should use a cotton swab to apply it this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does it takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you will have a mess on your hands cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva not attractive but effective you can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process however the longer it stays on the better the results interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal on average thelasts around 8 - 10 hours with eating drinking and smoking I have recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more,165,41
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,terrible it feels like chalk on your lips,9,42
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,just received mine was very excited I am not allergic to anything put this product on my lips it is was burning and made my lips swollen will never try this product again,31,43
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love it i ordered the cherry red it is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying it came super early and in great condition it is a little smaller than i thought but it is worth it the application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous,57,44
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,seems like it would work really well but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency,19,45
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect,12,46
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,too thick to put on properly was hard to get out of the bottle the top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out which comes out in a giant messy blob it popped off and stained my nails and hands worst mess i ever paid for and if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off it stains your lips but it is a dry mess also do not use with your favorite lip gloss it will put theall over your wand,95,47
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,this product is alright it does drain the lips however it goes on clumpy and sticky and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips it takes forever to dry and it does not peel off like it is supposed to i would not recommend it also if you have cuts on your lips it may burn use with caution,63,48
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I am pretty satisfied with this product it is a bit tricky to apply because it is gooey so you have to apply in a quick swift motion i watched a tutorial on an application suggestion and that helped i left it on for 10 min and it dried with awesome results it delivered a nice deep cherry red it even stayed on even after eating dinner i would buy this again,71,49
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it works really well easy to apply if you just take your time and lasts a long time it also came earlier than expected,24,50
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it looks like i drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red it is nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade it is super splotchy plus you can not stay in the lines of your lips well at all and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry definitely not an on the go lipyou need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry not impressed at all,74,51
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,overall thelasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off which is a mess it just looks like I have had a glass of red kool-aid,45,52
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,highly recommended it is not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil aloe natural fruit essence and also with vitamin e i have very sensitive lips so i choose the lipstick that i am using jeny,39,53
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is thick and messyimpossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain there are much better choices i would not buy it again,27,54
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product i got it in cherry red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick and it is a pretty good sized tube I have only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all and it feels like you have nothing on my only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides of the top but it did not drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it was not a big deal I have been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding and this is definitely at the top of the list,115,55
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,very bad product tathurt my lips and blood came when i remove,12,56
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i got the cherry red i really like it isthe longer you have it on the darker it gets i really like it a lot,26,57
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,i think mine came defective the gloss came out of the tube extremely thick almost like old glue it was virtually impossible to apply theis pretty in the end but the mess is not worth it,38,58
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,so although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful,29,59
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,zero stars i was not happy with it at all i first seen it on facebook and it looked like something i would like but no i was safly wrong came late hard to put on dries way to fast and it does not taste very good,45,60
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it provides long lastingand safety on my lips every time i use it,15,61
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like this lipstick the only bad thing it is that is not very easy to apply the smell is delicious i would recommended if would be easier to apply and if it would not dry fast,35,62

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,a great value and a terrificpayoff to be honest the only issue i had was waiting for the product because it did arrive a month late which does not surprise me since it only cost 3,37,66
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i received it today and tried it on and live it perfectit looks great,16,67
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,pros works really really well i applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain did not bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips and no transfer on my pillow either cons it tastes really bad like there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you do not get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste but i mean it is not meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault would i buy it again absolutely shipping was decent i ordered it the 26th of december and got it on the 4th of january,135,68
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,excellent receive the product in a perfect condition,8,69
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,as soon as i tried squeezing the product out applicator popped off and all of the product came out plus someone previously opened it because the safety seal was broken,30,70
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,super disappointed with this goes on the inside of my mouth when that is obviously not where I am placing it super icky and the stains i try to clean off from inside of my mouth causes the entire stain to be removed,41,71
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,went on thick and gloppy ugh not easy to apply at all very disappointed i do not recommend it,19,72
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,theis lighter than expected and does not stay longer,11,73
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,feels like glue and i do not know if it is toxic my teeth are pink s,15,74
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,nice kinda hard to rub an lips but it so awsome love the resolts,14,75
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like the fact that this lip tint gives you a vibrant natural rid lip tint it smells good but taste horrible I am glade i bought it it works with every skin tone including women ofladies i recommend this product,42,76
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,could not stand the feel of it while it was drying it grossed me out,15,77
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist my sister gave me some and i thought it was lip gloss got some out of the lines as it were and yes it definitely lasts my hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now if you can get it where you want it I am sure it would be a lasting and lovely lipbut you really need to get it on perfect the first time or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon,108,78
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it is a really cool concept the application however is a mess i would recommend using a qtip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube the stain does not turn out that red once it is peeled off it honestly looks like you just ate a popsicle so if you are into that look this product is for you overall it requires too much time to put on i have used it twice in the year that i have had it,83,79
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material does not seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,worst product i have ever purchased in my life not only is this a sloppy mess that does not really work but it burns to put on,26,81
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,it glides on easily and is waterproof which is a very good thing but most are lighter than i thought they would be but yet happy with the lipstick,29,0
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,nice for the price some of the colors are pretty much the same so I am giving a few away as a gift to a friend feels good on lips not too glossy and not too heavy some do have a shimmer which i do not prefer but can deal with they did come early in mail but still took 3 1/2 wks to arrive overall I am happy with purchase,68,1
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,I am not really pleased with it my lipsticks were smashed and the entire caps were smeared with lipstick all the colors look the same also this product smells very weird,30,2
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,i received my order way sooner than i expected to this was def worth the buy i am a caramel african american and all of the colors showed up great on me the texture of these lipsticks apply very smooth and the colors lasted longer throughout the day than i expected def will be ordering these in different colors i absolutely adore my set,64,3

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,okay so i was excited to receive these and then i swatch them and they are all almost the samethe orange and red are almost the same and ll the pinks are similar i do not know which is which oh and i received two 08s they did not come too clean like the caps had a bit of lipstick residue on them they are really small they are not drying although they are creamy i just hope none of them break when applying however I am not too pleased,87,21
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,love the colors they glide on and feel very expensive,10,22
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,the colors are very pigmented and easy to apply but may have to apply more throughout the day because they are not long lasting other than that the lipstick containers are very cute and came quick,36,23
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,waited for a long time but it was nice packages love the purple one,14,24
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,horrible smell and construction is very cheapwhat you pay is what you get,13,25
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,i like the variety of colors although you do have to be careful because they do break easily but thestays on great worth the money,27,26
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,my order still says that the earliest it will arrive is feb 26th but here it is on the 25th which is nice the lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy they were all pretty colors but i guess because I am dark they do not transfer so well but whatever I am happy to have them either way they are not super pigmented when applied but that might be because of my skin the colors i wore were 10 first pic and 13 second pic edit I have concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others also known as the light pinks,104,27
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,these lipsticks were very cheap i used one once and it broke right off and the other have been very hard and do not apply very well i would not recommend this product at all,33,28
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,this is a complete waste of money they break easily and does not look well in dark skin women,18,29
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,this purchase was horrible seven of the lipsticks were damaged,10,30
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,they shades of the lipstick is for caucasian women and the wring shades for african americans i can not use them,20,31

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,very hard dries lips out and does not go on easily,10,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this product works well when you follow the instructions but it takes some patience i accidentally oversanded the area i was repairing which could have made the leather look worse but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it i was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair and i think this repair will not be noticeable as the damage is lower on a chair leg take the time to mix theto match the leather do the repairs in daylight and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying and it works pretty well,110,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,my dogs finally put a 1 inch cut / hole in my 4000 leather couch i followed the instructions for the kit mixed a near perfect match with the colors provided deep wine / maroonand applied approximately 3 separate coats to the damaged area allowing for complete drying in between coatings i was very pleased with the result the couch is sealed and can not tear further and the patch is very discreet i would recommend this product and for those who seem to have problems with it my guess is that care was not taken with the instructions,96,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,if you have a rip of any size in your leather i would not recomend this the product says it repairs smaller rips i had a quarter inch rip in my couch and followed the instructions provided and only accomplished one thing making sure everyone knows about the rip now i would recomend looking for a professional to repair any expensive piece of leather,64,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this stuff is just stupid look up do-it-yourself leather repair and you have it i got leather magics deluxe kit and found out it is exactly like do it yourself they have the leather magic cleaner think a simple soap and water solution they have sanding paper they have leather prep think rubbing alcohol they have a leather compound in a tiny tiny container you supposed to apply several times uhhh how can you apply something so tiny several times then they have acrylic paint so in the end you have your beautiful leather couch covered in paint looks good until you sit on it so i say stupid,104,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,too many steps 4 pages of directions could not matchto couch,12,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,what a rip off only colors not found in nature and not qualified for a return so disappointed,18,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i was disappointed in this product i purchased the kit to repair a tear in my beloved leather couch the sub-patch and leather patch were barely large enough for my repair would it have been that difficult to make them a decent size the special leather adhesive was dried out and unusable i used wood glue 7 of the 9 leather filler colors were also old and almost solid fortunately i was able to use brown on my couch but had no way tomatch i rated 2 stars since i was able to make the repair but clearly this kit had been sitting on the shelf for many years,112,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,two of the colors had congealed making it impossible to make a match,13,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this thing is amazing i have not had to use it on any big cuts or anything but i have used it several times already on my new leather couch our dear cat satan has ran through it a couple times and used it as a scratch post about three times so there were plenty of punctures all covered nicely and blended perfectly only thing is you can tell when the light hits it a certain way but that is expected still worked really well,83,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have a bicast leather couch and based on a youtube video i was looking for leather studio clear paint to fix a rip and a peeling spot the leather studio product was discontinued so i gave this a shot i did not use the patch that came with the kit instead i applied this in layers just as the video showed with the leather studio it is not perfect but you can not tell without looking for it and having the ability to mix ato match the leather is also a plus it is only been a week but i have had dogs and kids jumping on the couch and no issues yet,113,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i used this kit to repair a 2-inch irregular tear in a dark-blue leather couch cushion the kit performed as advertised and the repair seems solid however the repair required considerable dexterity and care and even after long trial-and-error i never could get thecorrect so the repair is obvious the kit could also benefit from additional backing material patches only one is included in the kit and this effectively makes the kit suitable for one use only but it was worth the price,86,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,oh my god i was desprate to fix a spot on our favorite chair someone left a bottle of bleach out eating a hole along with some horrible looking discolorations a bit tricky to get just the right shade of deep wine after blending i took my finger and would add the smallest bit ofto a test spot bottom of the chair mix quickly you will be amazed mine took three cover / blending now you can not tell at all perfect for small jobs,82,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,covered my rips and holes nicely for about a week of normal use the gel dries nicely and looks great after a couple of hours but will lose all of it is flexibility after a week or two the repair gel begins to crack itself completely nullifying the whole reason you applied it in the first place junk product unless you are trying to patch and area that sees zero tension and/or wear like the back of your couch,77,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,works like magic you can not find the mark unless you are really really looking for it company comes over to visit and can not tell it has been repaired,28,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,the package i received appeared yellowed and old like it has been sitting on a shelf for some time it also provides only what appears to be the barest amount of materials to utilize no real margin for error i have not yet had opportunity to actually try fixing my problem but the quality of the kit is rather poor,59,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,great product unless you knew you would never know my leather bench had tears in it this product is worth every penny and could easily sell for hundreds of dollars,30,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this works well i would prefer to have more white to mix with colors,14,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,very happy with the results would buy again,8,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,seems too all purpose use to me was ok but really not invisible to see the mend in terms of surface texture,22,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the kit does not provide enough dye paste to do large leather repairs i was forced to purchase the kit twice to complete a section of my ottoman,28,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,amazing product i had to use a lot more heat than recommended i tested it to be sure it would not affect the surrounding leather ended up saving my thousand dollar couch,32,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,ruined my couch we now have to cover up the repaired area with a throw blanket i wasted so much money trying tomatch and more the entire kit was terrible it looks worse than before i used it,39,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have not used it yet but by reading the directions i think it will be great,17,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,more fabric and leather should have been included in the kit,11,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,not recommended for jeep vinyl seats it flaked off leaving a spongey stretchy melted layer underneath ended up recovering my seats with real leather instead haha do not use it on your jeep seat jeep seats are not leather and maybe not vinyl either which is what this is made for,49,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for this product is mediocre at best for what i needed basically had some cat scratches on the arms of a bicast leather couch small amount ofcompound to work with and the shade that i ended up with was slightly off yeah it covered the scratches but the process actually made the rest of the couch worse off than when it started i am now trying the more expensive products from leather touchup dyecom,79,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,absolutely love this product it is pretty darn close to perfect in fixing leather although it would be nice to be able to dull it up a bit as it leaves a fairly shiny finish I have also used it for fixing plastic rubber and more it dries like a latex finish and can be peeled off carefully if you mess up using a paintbrush to apply it in small spots works well too the only complaint i have is that i believe the kit should have twice as much black as the other colors because it gets used up too fast otherwise it is a great product,106,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not really help repair our leather couch it really just made it worse,13,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,saved my leather couch easy to mix colors you can not tell where my couch was damaged i would recommend this product to anyone before giving up something that you really loved give it a try first,34,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product i repaired a minor scratch in the leather on my couch and it now looks well janky it has nothing to do withmatching either it is quite easy to mix the colors to match whatever theof the leather is the problem is that it does not have the right texture it is incredibly easy to tell where the repaired section is because it is so smooth not a fan,75,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,have yet to use it but will be handy on my leather purses that get pen marks or peeling,19,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,would be nice to have measurement guides so you could recreate the identical formula,14,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,does not adhere well to some surfaces when there is incidental friction,12,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,it was very easy to use i bought this because i damage my leather massage chair during the move very easy to use and fixed the problem and my new place has laminate floor i noticed that there were few chips on few floor boards i was looking for laminate floor repair kit but actually i was able to use this to fix that issue also,66,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,way too complicated not an easy application as claimed,9,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i am disappointed with this product it does not do a good job of repairing leather i would not recommend this product,22,35

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,used this product to repair my vinal seat in my car product was fairly easy to apply and seems to stand up to the stress of getting in and out of the vehiclewas no problem with me because the brown that came in the kit was the same as what i needed otherwise i think matching thecould be a challenge,64,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product was less than satisfactory product was completely dried out and unusable i would not recommend this product to anyone,21,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it is marginal if you follow the directions carefully and it is a minor fix you will probably be ok but most of the time someone will want to repair a more extensively damaged article and it does not handle big rips very well in my own case it was a torn leather jacket i followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough part of the problem is it is nearly impossible to get thematched seal to look good if the repair is large plus the fix is kind of flimsy after a couple weeks it started to fall apart i came away wishing i had just done a patch,117,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,all the colors other than black and brown were dry and hard rendering the kit useless,16,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,I had like to give this product five stars but when i went to repair my car seat the adhesive was solid it had not been opened by me but since i did not have any adhesive i could not fix my seat poor packing if adhesive dries up before use,48,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,useless the prep flluid ruined the leather and most of the colored fillers were dried up absolute crap do not buy it,20,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it does what it says but does not really furnish enough to fix more than one or two cracks would not order again,23,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,worked just fine but these things only last so long and there is enough for touch up now and then,20,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,definitely exceeded what i thought it would do excellent product,10,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i repaired my wingback recliner got it to match pretty good but if you are picky i suggest you use a professional my husband had gouged a few small holes in the arm keeping his pocket knife in his cargo pants you can tell how old we are the chair is about 15 years old or older it looks much better than the holes did but if you inspect it you can see the repaired places however no one looks at my stuff that closely had to send another kit back i ordered by another maker their repair stuff was dried up appears all of this kit was good there is no stress on the place i repaired so i imagine it will last as long as the chair i have a small split in my lexus seat also 15 years old and I am afraid to try that bc it puts stress on it every time i get in the car afraid i will make it worse,167,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,pain to get right and a pain to put on but so far it is lasted you can see the repair but it is holding and it is not getting worse,28,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the adhesive was extremely difficult tomatch which is probably a ploy to sell tospecific set after an hour of mixing and testing i ended up with athat dried as a splotchy dark tan but frankly i did not care about theas long as it repaired the damage it did not i put on about 5 layers and let it dry for 36 hours within an hour after sitting in the drivers seat the adhesive cracked and came apart this was a complete waste of money for me,93,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have repaired several pieces of furniture with these kits for myself and friends the bond and the patching is easy enough the tricky part is thematching if you follow themixing guidelines and make small tests allow them to dry for 24hrs to really get a sense of how thewill finish you should be able to make a really great patch,67,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not help fix the cracking on my car seat just made a bigger mess,14,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this kit does work it takes some time to mix the colors just right but once you get the right tone it looks great it just does not last the patch just peels off after while not a good product it also does not include that much product for a larger application i had to reapply a few times since it came off after a month or two,66,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it does not have the composite most of the secondary colors were dried and left with very small usable quantity this may be suitable for leather jackets but definitely not for sofas,32,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,have not used it yet but it was exactly what i expected,12,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,after six months the glue fails and matching theis almost impossible will not buy again,17,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,did an outstanding job on my leather coach,8,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,once you get theright it really is magic application takes several coats so you get multiple tries to match the,23,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i could not get theto match after half a day since it dries differently than when wet which is understandable it makes it even more difficult and the repair keeps peeling,32,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,total bs the stuff peels off do not bother with it,10,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,had to send it back i already had one,9,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,looks like crap does not work more like a toy think do it yourself window tint trust me you will not get this to look good,28,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i might have scored this product higher but some of the patch materials were dried out a condition the instuctions warn will because failrue of the repair the package appeared to be sealed and tight but the cheap plastic poys containing the colored patch material had loose-fitting lids that allowed the contents to dry this is indeed what we have experienced peeling of the surface i can not recommend this product,72,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,this product did not work for me first of all the glue did not stick no matter how hard i tried i tried putting more glue but in the end i just gave up i would not recommend this product my sofa still has the tear that looks so horrible and i am at a loss as to what to do to repair it,64,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i purchased thisto repair the claw marks on my dinning room chairs thanks mr kitty this product worked great and came with everything i needed to repair these unsightly imperfections i was really worried about getting theright since my dinning room chairs are a teali mixed the green leather paint with a touch of black and thecame out perfect if your leather furniture is damaged this is the answer to your problem,80,65
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this seems like it is going to work pretty well overall I am upset although because they do not tell you the glue is instant i mean as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied it bonds and there is no repositioning it so i have puckered edges to my tear now puckered under so it is not like i can trim off the edges hopefully i can make it look better with the repair compound but if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant this should have made a great repair but because of the glues properties it now looks pretty bad,108,66
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,it is great it is strong enough to stabilize the tear in a very used part of the leather cushion on our couch the colors allowed me to mix the green brown and a tiny dab of black to get the exactof green i required for the task,50,67
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it kept leather from tearing more and was good size to begin with however had hard time matching and keeping it small like tear like said it dries fast and takes some skill it did work well just i did not do as good as i like,43,68
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the repair is not completely invisible since i know where to look but no one has said anything if you have a large tear i would suggest ordering extra of the colors that you need,35,69
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i had a few cracks in somewhat faded black leather and the kit easily patched those the problem was getting thematch right and it was really hard to get the right gray,34,70
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this product was delivered on time and preformed as advertised it took me about an hour to make the repair it was not perfect but it did look pretty good and keeps the seat from tearing more,36,71
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,we bought new leather furniture on liquidation sale and got an extra discount because there was an inch long cut on the side of the love seat we bought this kit to patch it I am not a very handy person and definitely not crafty decorative artsy or anything else you think you might should be to repair brand-new furniture but thanks to this kit my couch was fixed in under 20 minutes it comes with an empty container to mix your colors in and a mixing guide they are so easy to mix to get a goodmatch the instructions are easy to follow and work perfectly if you do i covered the cut let it dry overnight covered it once more and cleaned the area after it dried i did notice that the leather cleaner seemed to slightly dry out the area i used it on but i rubbed a bit of coconut oil on it which fixed it back up I had definitely recommend this kit,167,72
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it looked good at first but now after several weeks it is starting to peel up i do not know if it is operator error or the product,27,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,my german shepherd had punctured a few holes in our leather couches this mended them up and prevented further damage take your time matching the colors as they seem to dry a little darker,34,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i received the product and it was all dried out i attempted to use a thinner to see if would fix it and it did not threw it away i will never buy this product again and i do not recommend it I had give it zero stars if i could,48,75
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this leather repair kit was a true miracle you need to be precise when cutting the leather to fit your hole otherwise you will be sanding forever other than that i have no complaints and would definitely order it again if i need more,43,76
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,while i would have rated the product a five i actually have to wait and see how long the repair will last other than that the product really worked even better than advertised as long as you follow the instructions will recommend product thank you,44,77
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,be sure to mix thelighter than theyou desire it darkened up quite a bit my repair was a four inch rip on a leather sofa i followed the directions and watched others perform repairs online the repair looks good 8 out of 10 mymatching was not so good i mixed it a little dark the product performed perfectly thank you,66,78
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,looks horrible on any leather not easy to use does not do the trick do not waste your money not recommended,20,79
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i bought this for my husband when he replaced the leather seats in his car he poked a whole where he should not have even although the whole was not in a very obvious place this kit helped to save the day the whole was patched and was not noticable afterward good buy,53,80
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,well it looked absolutely beautiful when i applied it thestarted out much lighter which i expected then dried to match perfectly blended right in however it does not seem to be holding up i do not know if it is my leather which could be some kind of synthetic stuff not sure I shall try again and use more coats let us see if that works,65,81
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,did not work on our car seat the ripped leather about 2 - 3 inches would tear out again after a few days,21,82
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it worked good for about a month then the patch dried / broke and the hole is back i do not recommend buying this to use on something that gets a lot of wear and tear like a sofa or a chair like i did,42,83
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,product is too hard to use and kept rubbing offmatching was impossible for me and the product did not dry well,23,84
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have not had the time to use it yet hope it works very well on my truck seat thank you,21,85
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it is a tad complicated to mix the stuff to the right consistencybut once you do that it works great,23,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,certainly would do the job difficulty in mixing paints to match theis the greatest challenge but not the fault of the manufacturer this kit contains what one would need to make any minor leather repairs,37,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the kit includes base colors that are to be mixed to get amatching the leather good luck with that this is nearly impossible add a little of this then add a little of that it is never right,40,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed had cut in arm of leather sofa did not work i would not recommend the product to anyone,22,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i could never get a decentmatch and the repaired spot sticks out like a sore thumb i sorry i bought this,23,90
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i bought the carpet / upholstery kit i cut a piece of fabric and sent it in for them to match thein the kit is way off mine is like burgundy-brown they sent like burgundy-grey i emailed and got no response i called and asked for a refund they said i could send it back to re-tint i said I had have to pay to ship it and since they could not get it right the first time I had rather just get my money back i was told i have to pay to ship it back anyway so i said then I shall ship it back for a re-tint i suppose they will want another material sample she said just send it back and we will refund because it does not sound like we will be able to please you i said oh i send a sample you guys do not match it and I am the problem so i disputed the charge with my credit card company my suggestion it to find someone else,166,91
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,we used the product on an old leather couch and it worked quite well the hardest part was mixing theand decided that making it lighter was the best thing to do as it dried darker,37,92
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,not sure i was going to be able to match theetc it was actually a snap and kind of fun even i did it over two days put the patch in place and let it dry and then came back the next day and blended it in with theyou would have to know it was there to even realize it was patched nearly impossible to tell thumbs up,72,93
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the description was a bit misleading to me i tried using it but had no way of making it happen i ended up disposing of it,26,94
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,works exactly as described no complaints except that there was not as much paint / putty as I had have liked but still did what it described well only as good as you apply it do a good job and it looks great get sloppy and it will show,44,95
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,seam was ripped on good quality office chairs i bought cheaply from sale at work since it is a seam repair i did not expect it to hold up but it is seen daily use including from a 7-year-old monkey boy who has to climb all over it while sitting for a couple months now and stil looks holding up not the prettiest repair but since it is black no one will be looking that closely,73,96
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i bought about 7 different leather repair kits black leather spfa was damaged / worn in several places and got super confused with the reviews so just bought one of each of the different types this one was by far the easiest to use and gave the best results all i used was the black so no mixing of colors s o really can not comment on how easy that is but simply applying a thin layer of the black stuff to one of the very worn patches on my sofa really helped make it look better it is not fabulous if your really close up but that is probably more cos my hand was not very steady but from a few steps away looks pretty good wish identification bought more of this one and not all the others ah well,139,97
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i used it to repair my brown leather sofa and it looked completely new when the repair kit was used i can not even notice where the scratch / rip was,28,98
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i followed the instructions but could not get theor the texture right the instructions said to make thelighter as it would darken as it dried it actually gets lighter as it dries the texture turned out like plastic sheeting it would have been better and less permanent to slap a piece oftape on the leather,60,99
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the instructions for this product were hard to understand and trying to mix the righta pain in the i would not recommend this product to anyone,27,100
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was repairing a hole in sleeve of school varsity jacket for my first time using a product like this it worked good i spent considerable amt of time getting theto match but finally got an exact match yellow / gold / brown,41,101
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this product works well in repairing ripped or damaged leather we used it on our ivoryleather couch and also a black leather jacket the only thing is that it already comes with glue so no need to buy a separate liquid leather stitch,44,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product cracked where my leather had cracked and now is peeling so i am left with cracked leather and now a peeling product that looks even worse than what i started with do not buy,35,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it took a long time to finally get theto match but finally got it close enough i had a 1 square damaged area on a chair that was ultra leather fake leather just the outside skin was pulled off i filled it with this paint and now it is hardly noticeably,53,104
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i used this kit and did not like it at all had to mix different things to try and matchdried ok but the smell was like burnt plastic and lasted for days this kit is ok for a cheap repair but the area i repaired actually looks worse,50,105
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,if you take your time to get theright prep the area and do several light coats it can turn out pretty nice i do not think it is possible to get it where you can not tell there was a repair but it is much better than a gaping hole,48,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i bought this kit because i got a small tear in an expensive designer jacket the trick to this stuff works to the best ability is a a spot that can be blended b on non textured leather c a reasonable repair do not expect miracles my jacket is black calfskin and very soft very smooth very fragile i repaired it and you can not notice a problem unless i tell you about it the jacket was a 2000 john varvatos and i trust this stuff on it it will do just fine,91,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,easy to use did not need to apply heat clear directions for applying paste i applied three layers 2 are recommended there was enough paste for three layers madscientist52,28,108
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have an inexpensive dark vinyl couch that had several tears and i purchased this to repair them mixing the colors to match my couch was pretty easy but applying the product was a little difficult to get the texture to blend in the end the product did a decent job of patching the holes and the repair is hardly noticable in most light i believe if my couch was any lighter init would not have blended well all in all it did what i expected it to do however if i had a more expensive couch or the leather was anything lighter than my espressoi would probably call a professional for the repair,118,109
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,you know what i was skeptical but we got it anyway we tried it on a very obvious 1 tear on the front visible portion of our dark brown leather couch thanks alot kids and you can barely see it now pretty easy to get the righteasy to do just follow the directions can you see where the problem is yes if you are really looking for it but it is way better than a rip or a piece oftape and for way cheaper than a professional repair worth the risk i say,97,110
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,if you are getting this to repair a 5000 genuine leather couch then just keep walking get a professional but if you have just an average-priced or bicast couch this product is perfect if you can get your colors right you will be pretty pleased i spent some time mixing colors and everyone has been impressed with the results most have to really search and feel around to find the tear it was originally about a 1 1/2 inch tear in a bicast leather couch and it was growing daily if you have a rip in a bicast couch you need to stop it as soon as possible because it will keep ripping also i put on about 4 - 5 layers of the goo over a 3 day period and it is held amazingly strong it might even be stronger than it was before great product a little pricey but it is better than a nasty tear as a side note if you can send in a sample of your leather to leather magic they will magic thefor you,173,111
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this is the second time using this product to repair a tear in a leather sofa works pretty much as advertised will repair small tears it does take some time several light layers to make a good repair but the end result is good toughest thing ismatching but the includedguide is helpful the first repair i did same spot held up for 2 - 3 years sitting directly on it daily I am hoping i did a better job this time and it will hold up for a few years a lot cheaper than the alternative new sofa,99,112
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not like it at all just used it once on my leather couch after using it the leather got harder and started ripping more i will never recommend this product,30,113
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have a crack on my white leather car seats however i was not brave enough to try the colors on my seats theset has white but it does not match my seatsand it was really hard to tell whichi should mix to match the seat this package is not expensive the glue does the work it fixed the crack but left some darkmarks on it,72,114
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i used thisto repair a worn lay-z-boy chair armrest i did not get a perfect match onmy choice and i did not do a perfect job but it is very adequate and serviceable,34,115
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i somehow ripped my nice black leather coat an l-shaped tear about 1 both vertically and horizontally in a spot that is over my pants right rear pocket i took it to a leather shop here in la and they quoted me 75 to repair it mostly labor no doubt on the advice of a co-worker i figured I had give this kit a try before popping for that much the tears location was another big factor in my decision give this kit a try since it is only visible to people behind me who look down which i would question anyway i received the kit followed the simple instructions and 30 minutes later voila no more tear it is not invisible by any means but since my jacket is black with a slightly faded appearance / finish the kits black coloring blended in perfectly with the leathers appearance andand although the kit includes several colors and instructions how to blend them to achieve the desiredi was fortunate that i only had to tone down the black coloring to account for the faded look of the leather if the user needs aother than black then your mileage may vary,200,116
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i bought this kit from magic mender website 1st problem it does not match thethen when you left your car under the sun wow it is so sticky it will look nice as long you do not use and seat on it one more thing it does not last in other words it is a useless thing,57,117
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,better than nothing but not much had about an inch and a half tear in a leather chair head rest followed the instructions and it turned out very visible and more like a rubbery patch than soft leather i think it will keep the tear from getting bigger but it looks terrible,52,118
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the product works very well to fix a hole or tear in leather mine was a couch the only problem i had was the cleanser took the shine out of the leather so if you have a shine to the leather make sure you use the cleanser sparingly only on the area you intend to directly fix otherwise i was able to match thealmost 100 very good product my work looked a little sloppy so you have to be very careful and do it in stages i will use this again if i have another rip,98,119
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i got my couch fixed and it looks great it was so easy to match the colors and repair it myself great product quick service thanks,26,120
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i had my leather surface peel off to a expensive camel leather couch i have and this worked great you have to add the darker little by little and test theon the area before putting it on to see if thehad to be adjusted but worked great can not even tell it peeled just remember thedries darker when dried highly recommend,66,121
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,we have a 6 year old leather couch that had worn on one cushion and a 3 x3 hole had formed it really needs to be reupholstered but i do not have the funds for that right now i bought this kit instead for a fix i was super worried about using it because I am not aperson and had never done a repair like this but the instructions were so simple and the patch looks good I am not going to lie and say it is not noticeable but compared to the hole that was there before this is a dream,100,122
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,arrived in a timely manner matched our lariat leather seat just test in area not visable just follow the instructions and you will not go wrong sincerely eddie g,28,123
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,the rip is hardly noticeable should get another 10 years of use the rip is completely closed andmatches perfectly thank you,22,124
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,had an l shaped tear on seat cushion of my couch maybe 4 long figured i would need a kit that was better than average given the size and shape of the tear theis as described including more than enough fill to do multiple jobs it could use more underlayment but seems like you could use almost any cloth as such for future repairs my couch is dark brown somatching was quite simple the most challenging aspect is prepping the tear getting the tear to line up and then holding it long enough for the glue to dry kit includes one rubbing alcohol swab not nearly enough for the whole job considering you clean the surface before applying the fill and can use it to smooth the fill between coats and as posted by another multiple coats are the way to go i did not use the 2 sq patch included,155,125
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,great product that actually works just need a bit of practice with applying the compound in a smooth manner all necessary supplies are provided to make your fix look great i used it to repair a big rip in my leather car seat and it worked beautifully highly recommend,49,126
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the patch itself was pretty easy and seems strong gives about a 2 x 2 patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath you use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole needing at least 1/2 overlap in each direction you cut the leather to fit the hole and thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth i have not tried tho the hardest part is mixing the paint to match they have instructions for basic colors ex tan but to get it to be theyou want is not for the faint of heart they might say mix orange yellow white and brown add more brown if this add more yellow if this i sort of wish they would show shades and give ratios to mix,142,127
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was a little scared by the multiple steps and having to mix my own matchingbut it worked out great you can still tell it is a repair if you look but it is not noticeable at all themix directions are easy enough the tricky part was cutting / shaping and installing the sub-patch tip with the light sanding stay within 1/4 to 1/2 from the tear any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather overall great product,95,128
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,please bear in mind this review has nothing against the seller it is against the manufacturer do not waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it that is what i have and this was a waste of money i would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch bigger than what i have the patching pieces sub-material and the leather were just too big to fit into the holes i have so now I am just using the glue to see if i can glue the rips shut unfortunately i really thought this would be a better product based on the price compared to other similar products,122,129
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this was a total ripoff i needed to cover up some cat claw prick marks on my leather barstools they are black so i did not have to worry aboutmixing the first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried it was very shiny like patent leather so my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots the second thing to go wrong was when i cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework using a normal soft dishcloth wet and well wrong out no cleaning product on it at all just plain water i lightly wiped off my barstools and there went my new shiny polkadots all the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic the best thing i can say is that the claw marks are still there and i am right back where i started the worst thing i can say is i wasted my money on this product i definitely would not recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture,174,130
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i think success depends on your ability to match your ownbut i was ultimately really surprised at how good it looked they do not give you much although so after very good success with the 1st kit i had to buy two more for enough to patch up my sofa,51,131
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,wish i could say that this product was great but when i opened the paint colors they were all rubbery and would not mix or spread easily,27,132
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,repaired a tear and touched up a few nicks saved me from buying a new sofa i wish i would have matched thea little better that was my fault although i was too impatient and used up all the white so i could not lighten themore also touched up my black leather car seats black is easy no mixing,62,133
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,the manufacturer makes it clear that this kit is not intended for use with suede i bought it anyway figuring what the heck it is worth a try when the alternative was to throw away my torn suede jacket or pay a lot for a professional repair and maybe I shall need it for something else down the road well i just tried and am absolutely delighted with the results it was really easy to use and no one is going to notice the repair,83,134
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,the past reviewer was correct if you have a large rip do not use this product unless you want everybody to know where the rip is as it show up even worse would not recommend this product at all,39,135
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i followed the directions to the t in a few days the split started showing on top of the dried so called paint please save your money,27,136
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product was an absolute disaster i had a huge hole in my leather couch which this product describes how to put a subpatch and glue the pieces together except that the glue was old and putty-like it would not hold anything together secondly although it claims to tell you how to combine the basic colors to get anyin the world it is a very basic description like tan is a combination of yellow orange white and brown this resulted in a salmon colored liquid when i tried to make tan anyhow in desperation to get my couch not to continue to rip i took out a needle and thread and sewed it together also now have salmon colored streaks on that cushion which is not pretty i returned the product for a full refund,137,137
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i havint used it yet but you can tell from looking at the kit that it is going to be the right choice i know it will not be 100 but it is going to prolong and save a 1000 replacement corvette car seat for a few more years I have been shopping along time and am happy to have found this,60,138
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i bought this product to try to fix and conceal several small holes in my cars leather seating it really did a pretty poor job the holes are still pretty noticable i was able to get a goodmatch i also tried the product on some minor scratches on a leather chair that application worked much better overall the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips and make sure to go light on your colors because you do not have much white to play around with to lighten your mixture up you will also need many more alcohol wipes than are provided in the kit,109,139
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,do not bother with this kit you get one tiny piece of backing and one small piece of leather i opened the glue and could not figure out why it would not squeeze out finally pried off the top to find that the entire bottle had already dried up and i had just opened it for the first time definitely not worth it,62,140
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i recently bought used leather couches there was a cut in the leather and this product helped make it disappear the couch cost over 1450 new i got it for 170 plus this product looks great,36,141
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this product is fantastik i bought it with no much hopes to repair my husbands reclinable arm chair he use the chair to sleep because he has health problems this leather chair was damage in various areas i am amazed how easy were the instructions and all the process the final result a reclinable arm chair like new i recommend it without reserve,63,142
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,it is junk did not work at all had to throw it away complete waste of money,15,143
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the glue works well on leather it is bendable and seems to hold well because i am not a professional thedoes not exactly match it is very hard to get it to match completely as a result it looks a bit unevenly colored and unevenly textured after i spent lots of time trying you can still tell there was a problem in the car seat but the cut is held together so the problem is fixed but it does not look great,79,144
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was a bit skeptical at first but i have to say this product delivered i had vintage style aged leather that had become a bit worn in some areas and had cracks that began to open in others and was able to repair them with this product the repairs are not invisible but they are satisfactory by far for the price of this kit,65,145
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,ok i was allready to go with this stuff then i tried to use the adhesive it got jammed as i was squeezing it out so i popped off the little nozzle and applied through the larger hole in the jug then the whole jug of adhesive got hard there goes the adhesive so i used some of my own adhesive right now i am letting the leather patch dry but i am not hopeful waste of 3000 use that money for somebody to fix it for real,88,146
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i spent a lot of time looking for the perfect patch kit then gave up and decided to start cheap this one it worked perfectly yes you can tell there was once a hole if you look very carefully but nobody is going to casually notice it my couch is black so thematching was not a problem i imagine light colored leather such as beige or brown would be quite difficult to match with this kit edit about 6 months later the patch came off I am not sure it was the fault of the kit although because i did not have enough room to fit a properly-sized patch,108,147
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,I am reviewing this product as what it is a product for do-it-yourself non-professional types i would not expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable using that standard I have given this five stars positives the instructions are excellent particularly the very detailedmixing instructions plenty of colors of compound are provided ensuring that the correctcan be mixed also i will be able to use this kit again if necessary although I shall need to provide my own patch next time the materials are easy to work with if directions are followed now this does not look perfect on my leather chair we had a large rip about 4 inches i can see where the rip is but our chair is a burgundy textured leather neither thenor the texture is uniform so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather but it looks pretty good certainly way better than a rip it is not immediately noticeable if you are not looking for it for the price i paid about 25 this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home I have uploaded some photos of the repair,197,148
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the instructions were a bit confusing but i still managed an invisible repair on quite a large tear i definitely saved me from having to buy a new sofa for awhile I had recomend it but do read all the instructions through to be sure you use the product correctly,49,149
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,these products are difficult to use especially if you have little to no experience my results were awful the product may yield a good result but you absolutely have to know what you are doing this is not a good system for the novice,44,150
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,do not buy this product state of the art materials include a scrap of fabric that is not the shape of the hole some rubbing alcohol a piece of 220 sandpaper and not enough filling compound to complete the project with a beige sofa you need plenty of white but that container was half empty when i got it save your money and your time leather magic leather repair kit,70,151
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,product was too dried out to be usable received refund from amazon thank you,14,152

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,does not go on as easy as it states also not enough white material to fit in 2 holes 1inch but 5 inch colors do not mix to match the chart shown,30,154
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,adhesive and vinyl compounds were already hardened and unusable could not use the product,14,155
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,very cheep looking i guess since it was inexpensive i get what i paid for,16,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,I have lost count as to how many buttons I have thrown in a drawer in hopes to get to it and fix the garments that had lost them after a long period of procrastination i broke down and bought this to remedy the growing collection of items that were not being worn due to this issue below are the pros and cons pros compact and clever folding box lots of colors to choose from plenty of needles and other accessories cons kind of cheap quality ie the mini scissors barely work the rest is not bad the compact cute box i spoke of came slightly broken one of the hinges was broken but that could be due to usps being careless and throwing things around the box still folds fine just when it is open kind of goes off line all in all for 10 bucks you can not complain,145,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,i was looking for a small sewing box for the small amount of simple sewing that i do and this fit my needs perfectly it is well-organized and compact,28,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,is a bit small but you get what you payed for,11,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i thought i was getting a seriousat a good price but no this is about the size of a square box of kleenex the spools are tiny and the rest is just cheap junk my fault it was absolutely too good to be true,46,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,save your money i was very disappointed with this product the threads are the cheap ones you would get with a travel sewing kit the scissors would not cut even the inferior thread if they had to i opened it once and then the case pretty much fell apart there is no part of this product that is even mediocre if i could i would have given it no stars at all especially for the money this product is not up to the typical amazon sellers quality i am returning for refund today,92,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,this kit had nothing to do with sewing machines wanted to get a cheap starter kit to go with a sewing machine purchase it arrived in good condition but the contents are almost useless the scissors can not cut thread once again the title of this product is misleading it has nothing to do with sewing machines at all,58,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,i gave this to my granddaughter that was starting college she was so happy with it very compact but has a lot in it great sewing kit for where space is limited,32,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,this is such a small box really thought it would be bigger box,13,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,cheap poor thread like you would expect in a travel kit but too big to be used as a travel kit,21,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,the worst it fell apart in my hands so small it should stay together it is made of the cheapest brittle thin plastic they counted each straight pin and the measuring tape is made of paper so you will know what a real one looks like i did not expect much but i thought at least it would come in a case i could refill was i wrong the box is the best part,73,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,I have been looking for a compact sewing box kit to have around the house i can not count how many times I have needed to sew on a button or fix a piece of clothing only to find that I have misplaced the string or the needles this set is perfect because everything you might need in a clothing emergency you will find in this set it comes with 24 different colors of thread 30 needles and a bunch of buttons safety pins and little tools i love that the box folds out the way it does it makes it easy to open up the little compartments or choose which spool of thread to use i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review in my opinion this is a great kit to have around the house i will definitely be buying one for my mom,150,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,this little compact foldaway is so cute it is compact but not super small it has everything you need for simple repairs and stitching garments i love using this sewing box it has all the normal colors that would be needed for just about everything has a few different types of needles and has other pieces to fix buttons latches and more i received this product for my honest review the price is extremely worth the product i recommend this to anyone and everyone it should be a necessity for everyone is home,92,13

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,love wverything it came with perfect if you need an emergency kit for your car or office perfect just to have next to the machine as well very handy,29,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,the smartec compact foldaway sewing box kit is a cute little kit that contains the essentials to do minor repairs like sew a button back on or replace a snap but the sewing scissors that came with it are more a childs size than useful the small spools of thread that came with it break easily the plastic case seems brittle and would probably break if bumped or dropped and the sliding plastic closures are difficult to close once you have opened it i could not call this a serious sewing kit the size and brittle nature of the it is plastic construction would make it a poor choice as a travel kit and i would be very leery of giving this to any child due to the number of small easily swallowed accessories it contains if you need to buy agift for someone then this will work for you the rest of us might want to continue shopping aroundprovided at discount for my honest evaluation no obligations my review is based upon my examination evaluation and actual experience in using the product,186,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,i should have closely read the dimensions of this box it is great if you are looking for a small sewing kit,20,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,great product for the money I am a young adult and this is great for the occasional fix has everything you will need fast shipping,23,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,this is what i expected it is cheap good for travel or beginner font drop it,16,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i had a box that was this same design back in the 70s and 80s it finally broke down due to old age and much use so when i saw this one i was excited to be able to replace it this is not the same it just looks the same it is a scaled down child size version of the real thing the outside slot in this one will barely hold a slim note pad in the original the outside slot was big enough to hold 1 or 2 full sized sewing patterns the spools of thread in this one are teensy toy spools just enough thread on each one to sew on a couple of buttons the original held full sized spools of sewing thread if you want a stocking stuffer for a child fine but anyone who has any sewing acumen will scoff at this ridiculous gimcrack being called a sewing kit,155,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,this is a cheap sewing kit but that is exactly what i wanted i love how there are so many different colored spools the scissors are not that sharp but either use them or use your own pair i love how it folds up for easy storing however when you go to close it and lock it by sliding the little tabs be gentle i accidentally slid mine right off and had to fight with it to pop the tab back on i adore all the cute little compartments for organizing perfect for every once in a while sewing i would not recommend getting this if you are a high end sewing person or like to sew a lot however i would recommend getting this if you need to sew on buttons or holes every once in a while I am happy with my cheap little sewing kit,147,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,it was purchased as a gift for a young girl that is learning to sew she loved it all kinds of different things in a small fold up container,29,22

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,to small to store anything else then what comes in it,11,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,when i closed the box for the first time the plastic hinge snapped immediately i could not believe how this sewing box is so poorly made and constructed i believe it is such a waste of time to create a box that holds usable products but breaks instantaneously sewing is a work of art and it requires a duty box to hold the threads and sewing supplies truly i was very disappointed,72,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,it is really small and feels cheap it has a ton of different stuff a sewer may need but they are all tiny and break easily this might be good for a teenager or younger but even if you are a beginner this is not something you should spend money on you will need to replace everything in there for bigger and better things in about 1 week just save and buy everything separately or a better kit,75,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,I am glad i ordered this set over a smaller one i was contemplating this kit has just about everythread you would need,23,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,the case is really tiny the thread is poor quality the tiny scissors broke on the 1st use the snap buttons do not snap together yes i was using them correctly waste of,33,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,very poorly made falls apart on first use even although it is inexpensive it is a waste of your money,20,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,this is a joke i could have put together a kit at the dollar store with twice the supplies for half the price this is smaller than a ham sandwich do not buy,33,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,this is a unique little sewing kit that is good for a beginner it has various colored thread and articles needed for sewing made out of plastic so not very sturdy,31,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,i wish i had read the reviews before buying looks bigger in the picture very small truly get what you pay for in this wanted it for a gift too cheap looking,32,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,i was not expecting it to be as small and have nothing but little spools of thread but other than that it was not a badand very helpful for small items by hand,33,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,i bought this and one of the small smartek mini sewing machines and this little kit is awesome it has everything you need in it and i love the little case,31,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,this is my first sewing kit and i love how compact it is the only thing i do not like is that you can not put your own things in it because it is already full i can not wait to get sewing perfect starter kit,43,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,i received the sewing machine a month and a half ago and i just had the time to use it but it does not work the motor sounds but it does not sew could you please help me if it works it will be a perfect tool for my home tasks thank you,51,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,I am certainly not a seamstress nor a serious sewer i just needed something that my boys and i could use to fix buttons hems split seams and more and this does it it is got all the items one will need to keep on top of those little emergencies it is got safety pins thread scissors they are very poor scissors but they cut the thread as needed snaps hooks and eyes needles and more all in a compact little box if you are looking for something serious look elsewhere but for the rest of us this has it all,94,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,i purchased thisfor my 10 year old niece who has just recently shown an interest in learning to sew i was not with her when she opened it but was told that she screamed hugged it and began to explore it is contents immediately i feel like this kit was a perfect starter kit although after it arrived i was a little surprised by the size when checking it out on line i thought it was much bigger overall very pleased with the purchase,85,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,the threads that come in this are the only type that fit in this and are the small kind the small white side pannels are decent for storing very small amounts of tiny things like bra clasps or button snaps i took these off and purchased a large briefcase and some normal sized craft boxes and thread cases and placed the small white sides in my kit to hold small button snaps thiswill not fit a normal size seam ripper or tiny pair of scissors there is a piece of plastic that is raised in the storage compartment that makes it too snug to even fit a circular pack of hand sewing needles this is not something i would recommend to someone who is serious about sewing or even a beginner i am miffed i spent over 200 for thisbecause i have seen better containers at the dollar store,153,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,really cute and will go well with my granddaughters christmas sewing machine i like it for her would not be much use to me,23,43

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,I have searched for a while for a mini sewing kit to have on hand to fix things and came across this the sewing kits accessories are in-fact sturdy it is not a cheapat all i have absolutely no issues with it and i handle it just as rough as i would a lerge sewing kit there are various colors to use and the thread is strong and the needles are all durable and different sized I have hemmed several pairs of slacks adjusted belts and even fixed a few of my daughters outfits with this sewing kit i am very satisfied with my purchase and the tiny plastic scissors work just fine just use the tips of your fingers,120,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,theis very small about one quarter the size i had expected with little timy spools of thread that have enough thread to make one minor repair i was really shocked by th size of the box although it is made rather well i just was not expecting a doll size sewing kit it would make a nice sewing kit in a barbie doll house,66,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,pretty good for the price a few of the sewing needles were rusty and one side of the kit broke after the first time that i used it the kit has all of the tools to get the job done so overall it is a good deal for the price,50,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,I am a bargain shopper and thought i was getting a good deal the product arrived as described however the quality was horrible the eyes of the needles are barely big enough to fit the thread the threader broke right away and the quality of thread was poor i give it up for the entrepreneur who can source product from china but can not give a good review if the product does not meet the bar,73,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,i was sent the wrong product it took them ten days to refund my money and then they told me to order it again instead of just offering to resend me the correct product why would i want to order it again when they will just send the wrong product again it does not make sense,55,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,due to the very low quality plastic construction the case arrived in several pieces but the contents made the case seem well made by comparison it is a childs toy sewing kit especially the scissors i had a pair just like them in my kindergarten crayon box really the whole thing is a useless joke i took one look at it and set up a return through amazon you will not like or find this product remotely useful unless you are five years old and want to pretend you are sewing,87,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,thisis very cheaply made when i opened it the threads fell out everywhere one of the lids was broke trying to close it was a nightmare i do not recommend buying this,35,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,will never buy this again it smallest and the scissor not even cut it feel like plastic it waste money,21,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,flimsy smaller than it looks would not buy it again amazon allowed return hey amazon you rock,18,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,i was looking for a sewing kit that had all the necessities such as needles pins varied thread buttons scissors and measuring tape as well as a good variety of notions there is a great variety of notions which i frequently need but hate to buy a large package for one or two uses this fills the bill i have gone to it numerous time for some smalland it has not failed me yet that said i should point out that the case is not very well made it is fine to sit on the shelf and use at home but do not travel with it as i expect it would fall apart also when you do use it open it carefully as it may come apart none-the-less i would buy it again just for the large variety of items it contains,142,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,4.0,positive,it is made from cheap materials and is not high quality string or anything but it meets my expectations for the price,20,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,disclaimer i did not buy this on amazon i bought it through one of those websites that offer a daily deal I have learned to check amazon to see if amazon sells it for same price many times amazon does and to read the reviews reading the negative reviews would have saved me frustration this is awkward to open awkward to close the small thread spools fall off as you open the stand-up for sided case i just used it and one of the sides just fell off i was able to fit it back on but i expect the hard plastic lever pins will break off and then I shall have to throw the whole thing away save yourself the 12 cost here and go to your nearest dollar store for needles thread pins and a plastic lidded box and you can save 8 and have bigger sized needles thread pins,150,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this very very small and cheap a person would be better off to wait for a sale and create there own i gave this as a gift to my 8 year old niece and it is not impressive i should have known i thought maybe the case would at least be bigger,57,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this thing is the size of a quarter you are better off buying the larger roll which is for some reason cheaper,22,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it never peeled off not even the openon top some tapes the topdoes not stick but I have never had that problem with this tape it sticks and stays tight,32,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,my granddaughter ordered this for hertape crafts and she absolutely loves this the colors are awesome and it is exactly what she wanted,24,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love these rolls of minitape the width 3/4 is great for crafting and small fixes around the house or on-the-go perhaps use it like you might use washi tape and get creative it comes in basic black and silver plus some colors / patterns there is not quite the same selection of patterns as the originaltape line yet but perhaps after being on the market for a while they will expand the options available i recently made my dad an emergency car kit for christmas and i made sure to include one of these rolls as a mini version of a very useful tool,106,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this is going to be more expensive than regulartape per square foot but if you do not want to split tape or want a thinner width for a project these are great the tape is good quality and sticks well with burnishing rubbing down firmly and the width makes it perfect for trims or small fixes the finish is the same as regular blacktape glossy water-resistant and thick enough to be strong plus i just love the size of these rolls they are incredibly cute the inner core is printed it does not have the logo like the full size rolls do but it is clearly a mini roll oftape it is also labeled as made in the united states,121,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it works well and stays glowing for a long time but if you put it on some thing that your hands are going to be on such as a controller or a door nob then it wears down really fast,40,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,I am not sure how this ended up being mislabeled as 15 yards when it is actually on 72 inches 2 yards i contacted amazon to let them know of the mistake and to return thebut seeing as how it still says 15 yards i figured I had put this out there for anyone else who might end up ordering this and getting a much smaller roll of tape than expected the tape itself does glow but i never took it out of the package since i returned it so i can not say much else about it otherbrand tape I have used has been great i imagine this would be the same i would have kept it if it did not cost so much for such a tiny roll,128,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,make sure you understand the length / width of this product before purchasing it is a very small roll despite the picture looking like a normal sized roll the tape does function well however glows bright and adhesive holds well,38,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this does actually glow pretty good i did not read the description very well although and was surprised how small it was,21,8

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,tape was easy to cut off the roll but i used it on light switches in the hallway to be able to see them to click on to be able to see down the hallway you could see the piece if you stood right in front of it not any longer and just did not work,56,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i obviously misread the size see picture so far i have not seen it glow at all I have had it on the floor with lights on for days and when the lights are out there is no green luminousfrom the tape very disappointed in this,46,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,used on my flashlight in my basement that i have placed near my breaker box if the power goes out I shall be able to find it going to put some on the front of breaker box too it glows well in dark too,43,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,this is extremely tiny i thought it was going to be a big roll oftape from the pic and name but admit i should have studied the measurements more closely it also does not glow very brightly,38,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love this tape it does the job of what i purchased it for it is just too small not only do i recommend it i suggest you buy 2,29,17

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is my own lack of reading up on the product but when i purchased i did not realized it was going to be so tiny it is smaller than a normal roll of scotch tape i thought it was going to be as large as a regular roll oftape i feel that i could have read more into it but the way the pictures made the product look were a bit misleading because you can not tell how small it actually is,81,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,be aware that this is smaller than a roll of electrical tape,12,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,glow in the dark tape it is good tape and it glows,11,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,even with the comments about how small this is i was surprised when i received it,16,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i read the reviews so i knew this is a small roll of tape no surprises it is the size of a fifty cent piece that was perfect for the project i needed it for and i did not have to pay for a large roll i did not need i found that it glows seven to eight hours you do not necessarily have to put it under light to get it to glow i found that the tv in a dark room also works i am very satisfied with this product,89,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,why is that tape so small it should be 25 cents,11,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,ok ha ha you got me my bad you have to put it in the sun or light,18,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,if i was in the movie downsizing it would be perfect as the whole roll is not much bigger than a quarter haha thank goodness i have a great sense of humor because i was very amused and like miniature things but do not buy it if you think y ou are getting a standard roll they should tell you it is miniature,64,27

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,should have looked at the size more closely if they could title this mini tape or something that would help a lot it is tiny it glows okay not great,30,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love these minitapes i put one in each of my grandsons stockings they can put them in their glove compartments for an emergency fix i may order more so i can have one for myself handy littlethat will not take up much room i may be over 75 years old but i have learned in these years that you can fix a lot withtape it was a go to for my deceased husband and i use to kid him about it i thought it was a man thing until he died and i began using it for small fixes outside and in laughing out loud,109,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,do not know how else to say this but it is tape that glows in the dark i have charged the tape with a black light and seen it hold a charge for a minimum of 4 hours works as expected,40,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,absolutely useless it looks like a roll oftape but it is the size of a roll of electrical tape the dimensions are clearly readable in the picture so it is my own fault i guess but i had noduct tape came in such a small useless size,49,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,adhesive did not stick at all ducks products usually sticks quite well but this was not even as sticky as masking tape lasted less than a day,25,36

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,kinda tiny but it works used it along the side of stairs so we do not trip at night the roll is very small although,24,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,pay careful attention to the dimensions this is a ridiculously small roll of tape that as other reviewers have noted is virtually useless,23,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,thistape is microscopic it roughly 1 tenth the size of a real roll oftape see picture attached,21,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is not small it tiny do not think this is a regular size roll oftape only shorter because it is not this is tiny a little large than a quarter in diameter and only 3/4 of an inch wide never saw a roll this small before,47,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i will never buy it again it does not glow in the dark as advertised wasted my money,18,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,poor quality and not worth the price in my opinion these rolls are truly mini sized the roll i received seems to have been stored in an extremely hot environment because the tape adhesive is so melted that it is very difficult to pull the tape off the roll to even use it do not bother purchasing thisgo to your nearest craft store or walmart and get a full roll of patternedtape for the same price quite disappointed with this purchase,83,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this it is a goodtape to use for safety it is only 6 feet and only one little roll and only 3/4 wide but it will glow when the lights go out it lasts only a short while depends on how much and how long of light it gets to charge it so times very for how long it glows,61,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,very small amount of tape and barely glowed,8,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,yes i can read 3/4x72 but it is still shocking to see how tiny this room of tape is a roll of frogtape would be something like 45 if sold at a similar price per foot at this price you should be able to see it glowing from space,48,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,it glows it istape but the photo is decpetive because never in my life have i seen a roll oftape that is not the size of a roll oftape,33,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i was expecting a typical size never would i imagine something this small i guess the camera really does give it a bigger look,24,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,i thought i ordered a lip gloss by mistake it is tiny but i just used it on my tiny remote control so i can find it it seems fine i really did not notice any glow in the dark,38,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,just a 1 inch thing of tape what a ripoff i knew i should have read the reviews,18,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the pictures did not depict that this was a very small role of tape i was extremely disappointed with the size and wish this detail was amplified a little more,30,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,okay yes it is small other reviewers who gave it a poor review based on that need to read product descriptions more carefully that being said this is great tape bonds to itself well and seems to be extremely tough it has a rough cloth-like surface as opposed to a more traditionaltape plasticy-ness and it is rather thick it glows a bright strong green and does so for a long time it will not shine super bright for very long if you hold it up to a light but it does have a low glow that lasts for an hour or more which is totally perceptible in the dark would highly recommend they also sell a regular sized version if that is what you need,123,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,did not like the glow feature of the tape because the glow was not that strong did not bother to return the product since s / h was pricey,27,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i did not read the full details was blown away when i saw how small this was not much bigger than a quarter so if you want tiny to maybe put on your phone then it is for you i was just shocked i guess i should have read all the reviews my bad but not worth the money I shall go to walmart next time for this product normally i am a big fan of amazon i get all my sewing and quilting from amazon with no problems hope this helps someone,90,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,good tape just watch out for the size of the roll it is smaller than you think it is about the size of a roll of washi tape,26,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the photo makes this look as although it is regular sizetape when it arrived it was tiny smaller than scotch tape but about 1/4 do not recommend if you are going to sell a product why put a deceptive photo up put an actual photo up and let people judge if they want to spend money on your product as it actually is,65,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,tape did not glow as expected was a bit disappointed not sure why either the light was dim and not bright,20,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,very small in size i would not reorder for the price,11,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,as many people mentioned in reviews this is a very small roll of tape almost comical in size but it is just what i was looking for i needed to put a tiny bit of glow in the dark tape on a light switch just inside the rv to know which to turn on for the inside lights i literally cut a piece about 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch for this purpose it does glow in the dark as advertised the tape has almost the feel of that white bandage tape that comes in a first aid kit not the feel of slick regulartape if that matters to anyone,109,65
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,pay attention to the size this is a very tiny roll of tape works great,15,66
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i am so happy with this tape my 1 use for this genius invention i use it to mark the corners of tables in my screened-in porch i do not always want to turn on my patio light but i like to sit outside after dark just a couple little strips that you can barely see in the daylight and no more stumbling into things the uses are endless that is just my own quirky fave,73,67

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,worked very well for me for marking camping gear and outdoors on my property the pic is from a peace i put on my she had two years ago it is been in direct sun / wind / rain / snow for both years it is a bit dirty but still glowing,43,76

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the glow-in-the-darktape glows for a while then stop not worth buying,13,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,look at product description very small picture makes it look large tape needs extensive time in light for very little time of glowing,23,87
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this tape is sooooo tiny it looks big in the pic but it is not,14,88
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,itsy bitsy it defense of the listing it does say the size on defense of the consumer we most likely would not look because who has ever seen such a smalltap i automatically assumed it looked the same as every other sizetape especially at this price,48,89
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i did not know thattape made these micro rolls glows in the dark well but this roll cost almost as much as the full size glow in the darktape at lowes wish i had read the reviews,41,90
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,do not waste your money if you read it is only 72 inches by 3/4 wide too pricey for so little roll is barely bigger than a half dollar in size buy paint instead,32,91
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this comes on a tiny little roll but it does exactly what it claims to do it glows in the dark expose this to some light and it will glow like crazy and it adheres like crazy too i bought some glow in the dark paint at the same time i bought this and i bought the best glow in the dark paint there was based on ratings thistape glows just as brightly as does the paint so for whatever reason you may need this do not hesitate because it really does work but this is a very small roll about the size of a half dollar but you can buy bigger sized rolls,115,92
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i should have read the reviews this roll of tape is tiny,12,93
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the one time i do not read the reviews,8,94

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this stuff is great i use it on all my remotes so i could find it easily in the dark a little smaller than expected make sure you pay attention to the dimensions that are listed on the page other than that it is a great product I shall probably be looking to buy more because it runs out quick,58,102
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this product is inferior it does not glow in the dark and it is a waste of money,18,103
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,very very tiny roll maybe 15 feet of the stuff in a 1/4inch wide section does not glow very well would not buy again,23,104
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,tiniest tape roll ever and was damaged will be returning,10,105
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,works great it is just as sticky as othertape and it is small width makes it good for precision fixes i used it to fix a broken bike pedal and it fit through each crack nicely and blended in seamlessly with the surrounding colors i rode for the next week through rain and over speed bumps and it held together through all of it,64,106
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i put this alongside a light switch to help find it in low light situations without my glasses it pretty much is useless ambient daylight is not enough to charge this tape you really need some sustained bright light to make this work there might be situations where it is useful but mine was not one of them i ended up putting in a new illuminated switch which was about the same price as this stuff,73,107
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,the picture of the product makes it seem like it is a decent size roll this roll is tiny and i would not have paid this much money for such a tiny roll i also ordered 3 other rolls oftape and the pictures all appear to be the same size,52,108
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,how disappointing shame on me for now reading details this roll oftape is slightly larger than a quarter,20,109
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,probably my own fault for not looking more closely at the dimensions but this is not a full size roll oftape it is literally the size of a silver dollar terribly disappointed in the small quantity for a relatively high price over 5 / roll,45,110
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,picture for this product is very misleading this is a tiny overpriced roll oftape while the description does clearly specify the dimensions the photo is misleading,28,111
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,check the size i can not believe i paid this much for such a tiny roll of tape absolutely ridiculous,19,112
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it does exactly what it says it will do glow in the dark and stick to stuff,17,113
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,thistape is very small and perfect for camping and hiking it fits nicely in any space and is also glow in the dark I am happy thanks,28,114
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this stuff really sticks especially to your fingers and itself as for anything else maybe-maybe not the most frustrating thing about this brand is that it does not tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll this is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this you are far better off with something like 3 m of some other generic at the hardware stores this junk is just not worth the frustration,80,115
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,read description carefully this is a tiny roll oftape i misread the description,16,116
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,if you have miniature / petite ducks this is the tape you are looking for i have a full team of ducks that used to wander where they pleased now they stay where i put them can you hear them clarice the quaking of the ducks,44,117
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,got a great deal kids are loving this just smaller than i realized,13,118
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,too narrow and short to be of much use it is a nice toy nothing more,15,119
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this is a very small roll of tape this product is not what i expected,14,120
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this was perfect for repairing the cording on a vinyl / pleather love seat,12,121
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,good tape has the size of electrical tape,8,122
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this was a smaller roll than i expected i should have more carefully read the description it is about the size of a scotch tape refill,26,123
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,thought it was the regular sized ones not the value i thought i was getting,15,124
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,colorful tape it could be stickier but it gets the job done,12,125
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,used it to make hula hoops it is bright and cute easy to use,13,126
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,not reallytape at all it is more like masking tape that does not stick when it gets wet it does glow nicely tho,23,127
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,4.0,positive,use it under a tonneau cover to keep items from sliding forward and needing to open cover to retrieve items for the money this is a good value it is medium duty and not suitable for heavy items easy to fit remove and secure attractive and looks good in an open bed easy to hang bungies and rope,57,0
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5.0,positive,if you use your bed for groceries this is a must have i keep mine near the tail gate and i can put groceries in without having to worry about them sliding everywhere thumbs up,35,1
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1.0,negative,we purchased numerous loading zone cargo gates they have a limited lifetime warranty we do not have a warranty issue i am glad because they do not return e-mails or phone messages if you buy one be aware you will not be able to get parts it is a shame because they make a good gate buyer beware is all we will say,63,2
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5.0,positive,first one came damaged and no questions asked they shipped me a new one advanced replacement this was a gift for my dad and the second one came within a few days after christmas during the busy return season,39,3
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2.0,negative,we are returning we have wanted to like it and tried every way possible to make it work in our silverado but the things we are trying to block no extreme weight by any means-plastic totes with small parts in them keep pushing it loose and slide all over in the back of the truck,54,4
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1.0,negative,the cargo gate would be fine for very light weight loads but just a simple 5can ofwill because the bottom to push in towards the cab if you try an secure youragainst the tail gate it works fine until you tap your breaks then the bottom of the gate will swing towards the front of your truck,63,5
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5.0,positive,product is amazing as expected and meets standards and product description i am very happy with it is use no complaints a must have for truck owners and the price amazing,30,6
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1.0,negative,horrible if any weight at all hits the bottom it comes off the truck,14,7
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1.0,negative,does not stay in place i use it to keep baseball equipment near the end close to my tailgate and i find that it frequently can not withstand the pressure from 2 baseball bags filled with baseball gloves and 2 bats each,41,8
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2.0,negative,i have a chev 2500 hd with an undercover flex cover on the bed the gate will not work inside the bed as it runs out of adjustment it is made to utilize on the rails in my case the rails are not accessible due to bed cover the only way to make it work inside the bed is to use wood blocks for shims,65,9
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1.0,negative,the clamp lever that cam locks the gate by pushing rubber pads against the bed are made of plastic if you pick the wrong hole in which to insert the pin that fits the top of the gate the width to your specific truck will break the plastic cam lever rendering the entire device worthless you will only find this a problem once you push the lever down and it breaks which is too late i will defer to a net type,82,10
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2.0,negative,if you use the rubber at the bottom to prevent sliding it will not work not only that it will raise the whole thing about 3 inches and the cover will not work if you remove the rubber stuff will start sliding as if nothing there,45,11
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,2.0,negative,did not fit under my bakflip bed cover,8,12
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5.0,positive,best device i have ever seen for helping you secure your cargo in the truck bed,16,13
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,5.0,positive,very well designed and built fits under my soft tonneau rails,11,14
Automotive,B0000WZLPM,4.0,positive,okay my first review was hasty i was at the end of a very long and hot day when i first attempted to install this in the bed of my truck i cut my thumb and hand in the process and just was not a happy camper now that a calmer head has prevailed the cargo gate went right in as described i anticipate that it will hold my travel bags and dog travel supplies close to the tailgate on an impending road trip i would not depend on it to hold a very large and heavy object in place but if you want ordinary things like groceries luggage and more to stay within reach I am confident this is the perfect solution,120,15
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,after talking with the manufacturer in canada i purchased this kit so to mount my rack that i had on a 2005 silverado because the beds are a little different i was able to use the older rack by changing the mounting hardware very easy to do and the kit includes the plates that sit on the rail as well as the channeled bracket that the actual rack sits in took about 45 minutes with the help of my wife who threaded on the nut to the pocket bolt so to secure it enough to snug every thing down,99,0
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,i ordered this thinking it is a safety back-rack like the description says but it is not it is a additional part i guess to make the rack complete look as hard as i may i can not see anywhere on the picture this bolt-on addition i thought the price was a little low but reasoned it was an introduction price to get it on the market a complete waste of time and money this is the third time i have ordered from amazon and i was sent something different from what was pictured or advertised,94,1
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and just as described thank you,8,2
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,just wish these kits were not so damn expensive,8,3
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,needed some modifications to work had to drill 2 new holes to mount back rack,15,4
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,the backrack 30119 safety rack kit served it is purpose except that for a 2015 silverado the rail plates and pocket bolt are not needed if you have an inside rail tonneau cover installed so you need to purchase the tonneau cover adapter kit plus the exposed rail pocket mount bolt could have been better thought out update almost 2 years in use now no regrets at all,66,5
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,very nice and fit excellent but why can not the bolts be black to match the rest of the system,19,6
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,4.0,positive,the kit was high-quality and easy to install,8,7
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,the mount was totally rong for my 2012 f150 i went on youtube after i received my mount and found out the model number to order so research before ordering to find what works best on your truck,38,8
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,5.0,positive,exactly what i was looking for perfect fit,8,9
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,1.0,negative,i have been ordering from amazon for years and never had a problem until today i purchased thisthinking i would get all that the description detailed i did not brackets came and nothing else after talking with representatives of amazon it came down to they did not support what they advertise and will not stand by their website offers i am very disappointed and will certainly be very cautious if ever buying from amazon again dissatisfied customer,79,10
Automotive,B001BDJ2Q8,2.0,negative,this kit has to be bought to fasten the backrack to the truck box however the image included two runners with the rack kit even showing the whole rack kit the rack kit includes only two bolts and washers another one of those sales tricks by backrack,47,11
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i tried this once used it for 15 months it broke got another used it for two months same problem got a third use dif for a couple months anther problem thankfully amazon refunded my money and i opted for another brand i am usually a fan of dorman products bunt not this one buy it only if you want to have that pit in your stomach wondering where you will be when you window just rolls itself down and will not go back up am i bitter you could say that,91,0
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,installed two weeks ago saved 6000 over dealer price so far so good I shall have to see how it holds up of course it is made in china,27,1
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,junk i purchased this switch dorman 901 - 002 in april to replace the failed window master switch 3 months later the driver window down stopped working,25,2
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,very affordable easy to install and now all my power windows work again great product delivered and works as stated online,21,3
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i purchased the dorman switch after a few month it started to not work properly i contacted amazon and was told it was out of there warranty and they told me to contact dorman i asked for contact information on dorman they told be they did not have any contact information i was told to google dorman to get the information i find it hard to believe the have no contact information on one of there vendors thanks amazon for sub-standard service,82,4
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,the worst part was figuring out how not to damage the cover and remove the old switch after that it was simple i saved at least a hundred dollars not too difficult,33,5
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,yeh this was the right one i ordered and now we have working windows in our car thanks for being able to designate the parts to the originals of my car,31,6
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,had bought one for my buick from an online auto place about 18 months ago the drivers down switch failed dorman has a lifetime guarantee returned the bad one got a refund and bought this for 30 less on amazon perfectamundo,41,7
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,it looks and works just like the original for a fraction of the price and it is easy to install,20,8
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,the switch did not work i had to go to the dealer and get a switch very frustrated it appears to be an after market,26,9
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,this thing lasted 3 weeks super disappointing quality now i have to buy another replacement do not buy this part you will regret it,22,10
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,arrived quickly but was never usedwas as advertised but problem was found elsewhere it was returned for credit with no issues,24,11
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,jus bought this dorman 901 - 002 window switch march 302012 and it has stop workin sept 162012 not a good look,21,12
Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i have had this switch for just a bit over a year and it has been not working 100 right for several months the buttons simply work when they want and one failed to the point of me unplugging the power connector to the window motor to keep from getting stuck with it down very frustrating two of the four switches are junk in less than a year cmon i paid 36 38 ish something for it much less than a dealer for sure but i just replaced it with another that i got delivered for 2299 off e-bay much cheaper price probably about the same quality buyer be warned read the other reviews and as for trying to warranty a piece of crap my philosophy is this if the first one is not good why in the world would i want the same aggravation again even for free under warranty I shall take my chances on another imported brand,156,13
Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,first the warranty dorman limited lifetime warranty at dorman we take pride in the quality of our products and your satisfaction with their performance thus dorman warrants it is products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service as your exclusive remedy dorman will replace free of charge any dorman product that in dormans reasonable determination does not comply with the foregoing warranty this warranty is voided by non-recommended use improper installation or physical damage in addition dorman will not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages and your exclusive remedy shall be replacement of the product that did not comply with this limited warranty i replaced both the regulator / motor and this switch on my 1997 buick century the switch is working properly but i just put it in the form factor was exact and i had no installation or fit problems if there is a problem i will addendum this review,158,14
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,took me awhile to get these on the frame rails for the half doors they fit very snug and a little tip is to make sure you unzip the window 2001 wrangler,32,0
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,got these 48 hours after ordering really easy to install nice fit a really good cheap alternative to buying complete upper doors,22,1
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,rampage sent my door skins before the promised date had instructions on how to cut old skin off and install new one everything went as predicted new skin looks as good as oem and performs much better,40,2
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,i bought the door skin replacement for someone in our family it fit very snuggly and needed to be in the warm garage to be install the warmer the skin the easier the install she loved it and was happy to have her jeep door fixed,46,3
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,good fitment get them warm first before trying to install,10,4
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,be careful you get what you pay for these are cheap quality look good after installing but next time i will spend the extra money and get a better set of door uppers no instructions included either which was disappointing but youtube has a couple of helpful videos thank goodness,49,5
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,i particularly wanted rampage door skins to match my rampage top unfortunately the door skins were too small to fit on my 1999 upper door frames even although i followed the instructions and left them to bake and stretch for several hours in the florida summer heat and sun despite multiple attempts i was not able to get more than one of the four corners to fit on the frame at the same time i finally gave up and took advantage of amazons excellent return policy and returned these i subsequently purchased the smittybilt door skins and they fit easily on the upper door frames,104,6
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,as others have said after the actual struggle to get them on they are great,14,7
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,very good product fits really well i read a lot of reviews on these and a lot of people had problems with install but they went right on and fit great i did not have any problems,36,8
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,spend the extra money and go with bestop i had to make a slight tear at the bottom corners to install they still are not fully around the frame,29,9
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,they did not fit i heated them and stretched them they even ripped and they still do not fit properly on the stock door frame they are not nearly as high quality as the original jeep skins and windows but they are adequate for the price and i would have given them 5 stars if they actually fit the frames,60,10
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,ok so here is my say on these it is a great looking product but i feel it can be manufactured way better to not rip in certain areas hands down quick but painfull assembly buy them pre fabricated on the frames and save yourself the anger and hassle,49,11
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,incredibly difficult to install it ripped after a few tugs to get it over the frame,16,12
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,they did not fit at all and i have been waiting two weeks for the new set,16,13
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,wish i read reviews before ordering both doors we set out in july louisiana heat for hours and as it helped some at first both still tore and are no good blamed the first door that tore on myself why i do not know but just did so we laid the other door out for an extra 6 hours in straight sun and the same thing happened again so nope it was not us heat or any other bs i see some people have been given to why this happened to them it is just a bad product since we have has jeeps for almost 40 years we thought we would just buy the skins this time because we wanted to save and already have several sets of frames because we normally buy them with the frames nope they do not go on heat only helps somewhat but can not work miracles and both of mine are worth nothing also known as trashed now with that said just spend the extra money people and have your new skins come on the frames for ya or just throw your money away,185,14
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,these are great for the price the window is flexible and clear the cloth is great quality and matched the top that i purchased at the same time the only thing that i wish that they would have included is the velcro like the oem windows had it helps when you need to put the windows up while you are driving,61,15
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,like others that have posted i had one heck of a time getting this to go on the metal frame i actually pulled the skin off the end of three of my fingers after about an hour of heating with the oven and a blow dryer i gave up and went to plan b i got the three corners on bottom two corners and the rear corner on the top and then lubricated the metal frame at the front / top with wesson oil i then used two adjustable wrenches to pry and lift the final corner over the metal frame i used small adjustable wrenches and used the bottom of the wrench where it is flat and round and smooth so there was no concern about poking a hole in the fabric i put one wrench bottom over the top of the frame and the other over the side of the frame inserted them into the fabric and slowly lifted and pulled the corner fabric over the frame it went on the first try not sure if it is because i had heated and stretched it already or not but it worked I am going to wait until next weekend to do the other side,203,16
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,did not fit would love to sell did not fit the radius around doorstill have stored if anyone can use them reduced priceblack,27,17
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,good quality product really tough material only complaint is that they were extremely hard to put on but look great once you put them on wish they had tinted ones tho,31,18
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,i bought these to replace a set of smittybilt windows that was a bit faded and had been cut broken in to on one side it surprised me that the smittybilt windows were a higher quality product than the rampage pros the fit is pretty good and installation was not too hard zippers do not jingle like the smittybilt due to the zipper pulls being cord and not metal cons the windows are wavy at the top which distorts your view out the sides i do not see any reason that they have to be wavy one zipper has broken on each window in only 3 months luckily there are two zippers so i can still close and open the window I am not very happy with this purchase and will likely go with a different brand in the future,141,19
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,recieved them in the mailtried to put them on yoo cold so i waited for a 100 degree dayvery tight fitting ripped both doors on the insides where they should be reinforcedwindows are very thini took smittybilt uppers off and replaced them with rampagebig mistakesmittybilt are much better qualityi also bought the rampage framless top and have issues with it tooand rampage customer service sucksthe do not return emails or phone callsi will never purchase another rampage product ever,78,20
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,the materials of the doors are exactly what i expected for a replacement and the pictures the only real message i wanted people to know was that the velcrow that is used to keep the door together and tight is a real pain if you are looking for a snug tight fit be ready to find an alternative way to keep the material from slipping over time,67,21
Automotive,B002HSD19A,5.0,positive,these windows looked great fit great and were shipped fast easy to install and would make anyone a great replacement,20,22
Automotive,B002HSD19A,1.0,negative,if you are looking for some well priced door skins that are easy to install keep looking these are awful both doors ripped installing i have a 98 wrangler and of course once torn they can not be returned awful product will not order from rampage again or recommend,49,23
Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,for the price these door skins are ok they were very difficult to get onto the frames and i ever tore part of the left window skin also the weather stripping does not fit well in the door frames and sticks out you get what you pay for,47,24
Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,first i must say that the phone support folks at rampage are great patient with all of my questions always inviting me to call back if i had any more issues when you first unpack these skins and hold them up to the frames you will say no way i almost gave up and sent them back a couple of times finally i heated them with a hair dryer as i was stretching them over the frames and they finally slipped into place note get a partner to hold the hair dryer while your stretch it is much easier the gentleman at rampage explained why they are so tight it seems jeep made two sizes of door frames those years 97 - 99 i think so the skins were made so they could fit the larger frame yet not be too large for the smaller frame not sure if that is the case but it sounds logical to me otherwise great quality and service,162,25
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,this is an excellent book i danced in college and competed at the open bronze level but my husband had never danced and this book gave us both the skills to become better dancers everything is covered in this book timing body flight technique styling and figures this is a must have book for anyone who really wants to know how to ballroom dance so many books are just lists of steps with no attention to styling and technique but not this one anybody can learn footwork patterns but that does not make you a dancer this book has all the information you need to really dance i just want jeff allen to write a sequel,115,0
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,jeff allen has really outdone himself with this one the complete idiots guide to ballroom dancing is so comprehensive but so simple that even an absolute beginner will feel comfortable on the dance floor in no time at all wayne,42,1
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,not only did the book come to me without the cd which was supposed to be included but the information provided was in no way intended to be understood by the novice ballroom dance idiot i do not consider myself to be an idiot but did not find the information in this book helpful to me and there was no promised cd included,63,2
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,extremely disappointed for not only getting the kindle version did not include cd contents which of course makes the book useless but also instruction guide cards attached to the front cover were missing,33,3
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,it is another useful entry in the series that will help you learn the dances an experienced partner is an excellent addition,22,4
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,the book was well written with interesting facts and background information it also had plain simple dancebyiillustrations,20,5
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,good information in the book but i did not find any value in the dvd i would have found the book much harder to interpret if i had not had previous dance lessons,31,6
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,it was no help at all no diagrams not a lot of instrutional info and i would not recommend it,20,7
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,for a friend that really loves ball room dancing has has been able to take several classes in the past,20,8
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,the book was all i thought it would be in a good condition for used the dvd plays well and easy to use all in all it was a great buy and a huge saving,37,9
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,i have found that reading about a subject is of little value you must perform the subject matter and repeat it many times over a dvd that demonstrates the actual foot moves is by far more helpful i have found the vicki regan dvds to bet the best because they show you the steps many times over with and without music trust me i am a pure amatuer on the dance floor but watching vicki and her partner show every move in stages i can duplicate them I am still no fred astaire but i guarantee you that watching the regan dvds will put you on the dance floor i have fox trot waltz rhumba swing and niteclub dvds I am still not brave enough to venture into tango mambo or any of the extreme latin dances yet,135,10
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,a good choice for beginners who want to get started in a wide variety of dances only a fewpatterns are given for each dance but these are well explained the dvd was helpful when visualizing the steps for those interested primarily in waltz fox trot and tango got to ballroom is a better choice,55,11
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,I am just starting lessons and thought this book which i found in the library would be a great reinforcement i think I am a bit premature but that is not the books fault the problem is that there seem to be many variants of the basicand the book does not always do what my instructor did i expect that as i get more practice this will be a non-problem the book is very wordy but that is because the chapters are each very complete i think it is not to hard to skip forwardc and then go back for the finer details however the library copy came with a cd with nice music the edition amazon sent has a dvd which seems pretty useless each topic seems to be about 6 second long and they slide into each other it is not easy to watch two people dancing for six seconds and pick up the footwork especially when the segments are not labelled on the screen as they come up and have of them are a bit blurry which may be to indicate speed or to give the scene a dreamy look a better dvd would have been helpful but the book stands on it is own,205,12
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,if you want to merely shuffle your feet and do the bunny-hop this is not the book for you get something else if you want to learn how to really dance this is the best book there is allen is true to his craft and does not compromise on his instruction to learn you have to read the appropriate chapter of his book watch the appropriate section of the dvd and practice again and again nobody can take something that is inherently complex and difficult and spoon feed it to you in five minutes but everything you need is right there jeff allen takes his craft seriously,106,13
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,i normally love the idiot books I have used them for years and love the straight forward approach i was very dissapointed in this book the writting is convoluted even with careful reading sometimes as many as 10 times i am not sure what he is describing or what i should do i suspect people that are decent dancers may find useful information here if you are learning to dance skip this one you do not get to any of the dance steps until almost halfway through the book and are very poorly described he refers constantly to the dvd that comes with it he should have just made a video maybe then we could have figured out what he meant,118,14
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,if you are able learn by reading through pages ofbyinstructions then this is great however if you are a visual learner like myself this book will be painful the dvd is not helpful it does have a lof of helpful information but this complete idiot just could not get into this book going to take it back,59,15
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,the text is way way too wordy it could have been edited to a tenth of it is length without any loss of content the actual instruction is far too detailed to follow in any meaningful way and the accompanying dvd is poorly organized the video clips are far too brief and the blurry fade-ins are very distracting as you can tell i was not happy with this purchase,68,16
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,this book uses a lot of words but fails to make clear how to master a dancedisappointing it makes a good coffee table book one leg was shorter than the rest,33,17
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,this book will take you through the basic patterns of popular social dances and does a fairly adept job of doing so this is purely a footwork book as there is little mention of styling but for the absolute novice it will get you out on the dance floor i particularly enjoyed the section on rhythm and the emphasis that dancing is about doing the same motion the exact same way every time so you do not really have to have rhythm to dance you just need to perform the same motion the same way consistently i have a friend struggling with this same issue in his dancing and recommended this book to him with the practice exercises included to help him improve all in all a well written book for the novice dancer and one i recommend,137,18
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,if you are taking lessons and are serious about putting some hard work into learning how to dance then this book is a great resource as a 50-ish beginner i loved the background information but did skip ahead to the lessons only to come back later and see how important the background and foundations were like anything else there are no shortcuts if you want a quality result you are not going to pick this book up and be dancing in a week any more than you could learn to paint a landscape or play the piano in a week dancing is music art and body control idiots it takes practice one suggestion i would like to have seen some footwork diagrams as many idiots like myself need a visual diagram in addition to photos and the lengthydescriptions,140,19
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,to bo honest i have not read much of the book i started dance classes ballroom and latin about 2months ago and i am able to pick up the moves pretty fast because i love it so i focussed more on the cd here which i was very impressed with it was more than i expected to find covering a few basics two or three patterns per dance having a little knowledge of dance already it was a nice review and practise however to thos of you that are interested in the book you will find explanations for both the man and womans steps and also pictures as guidelines covering waltz foxtrot tango viennese waltz rumba merengue samba cha-cha mambo east coast swing that is a good spread for your money of course the cd is necessary to also help explain,137,20
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,it really is a helpful guide I am all for the idiots,12,21
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,i am fortunate to have the author jeff allen an my dance instructor jeffs book is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to master the art of ballroom dancing he meticulously breaks down every movement andin order to allow his reader to quickly become familiar with the various dances there is no other book on ballroom dancing that i have read which even comes close to what this book has to offer the dvd that is included is also an excellent visual tool,85,22
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,this book was different from what i was led to believe it is a detailed sophisticated and comprehensive not idiots guide to ballroom dancing i am enjoying the book but the history and background and then the technical foundation the book lays in finally getting to the actual dance steps are more for the serious student who is not an idiot this is clearly a serious book written by a serious dance teacher for serious students who are not idiots,81,23
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,I have had this book for 3 years now and at the same time I have been taking weekly ballroom dance classes i thought that as i got more hands-on instruction i would feel more comfortable with the instructional part of the book i never did now that i am far more advanced than what is taught in the book i still feel a bit confused trying to figure out what the author trying to teach ok some maybe I am an idiot but if i am then this book should be geared to me if there were an accompanying dvd then i think it would be much better,106,24
Books,0028643453,4.0,positive,i really ordered the book to get some ideas to help some friends learn to dance i took dancing in college but am afraid we cheated on some of the movements i think this book will help me crips up some of my movements positions and give me a refresher on some of the dances i love to do latin but my husband does not with this book i believe we may become the next fred and ginger,77,25
Books,0028643453,2.0,negative,this book has some great material and it is history bits are good but if you just want some hints on learning to dance there is way too much stuff you have to wade through before you get to anything about dancing you are half way through the book before you get to the actual dance steps and too much stuff you have to wade through around each dance if you want lots of history and detail this is the book for you if you want to get down to dancing it has some good info in it but it takes a lot of work to find it,109,26
Books,0028643453,5.0,positive,i wanted a book that i can grow with the complete idiots guide to ballroom dancing fits the bill the first sentence of each and every dance pattern start with simple phrases likeforward with your left footto the side with your right foot close your left foot to your right foot certainly anyone can follow thesedescriptions then if you want to grow with more techniques it is all there right in front of you if your taking lessons this book has to be the best reference guide anywhere you can practice your basics without forgetting what you did in class allen has produced a terrific preconceived notebook for all level of dancers buy it you will love it and the book will grow with you,129,27
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,what i wanted were easybylessons but what i found were verbose and complex explanations the dvd was the only redeeming feature as it provided a good beat for the dances unfortunately being an incomplete idiot i had no steps to do,45,28
Books,0028643453,1.0,negative,the professionals who have been reviewing this may love it but the book is definitely not for beginners it devotes pages and pages to posture breathing technique history and other such topics but precious little on the basics of what steps to dance when after 14 chapters he finally starts teaching you how to dance it is almost incomprehensible this guy does not know how to give simple instructions that most people will understand if you are new to ballroom dancing do not buy this book it will be of little help,90,29
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,sorry but i kind of hated this the story was so rambling lurching off into different directions it was aimless and largely boring i do not know what the point is supposed to be no closure no moral no beautiful prose indeed much of it was like slogging through knee-deep mud and just about as much fun do not waste your time,61,0
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,the story is about a young child who is left to die in mud by her mother a young man passes by and finds her and hauls her out the remainder is ta story of her childhood and adulthood in a flashback pattern with her psychological challenges coming and going throughout the narrative this is a hard book to review because at times i was involved and at other places i had to skip pages something i rarely do because it was so disturbing it had been a while since i read a joyce carol oates book but i remembered her dark side the story is psychologically violent and the sexual stuff is very minor but reading about psychological disturbance is not myof a fun read,128,1
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,once i got into this book i was engrossed what was real and what is in mudwomans imagination you can not really tell sometimes but you can not stop trying,28,2
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,some reviewers complained that the narrative structure of this book is hard to follow it is true that the use of flashbacks and dream sequences makes it more complex than a conventional linear-time story but i found that the shifts in perspective were very artfully used providing a contrasting perspective that forced me to reinterpret events at key junctures it certainly is a dark story but i felt the characters were compellingly drawn showing how the same person will function differently in different times and different places in the course of life,92,3
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i found the story disjointed hard to follow and confusing written in such a way that the reader is left with no resolution or explanation will not be recommending to friends,31,4
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i trudged through this book hoping i would at least like the ending i did not the description said the story was taut it was not i gave it 2 stars because i did enjoy when the story went back to mrs childhood and when she visited home as an adult in my opinion mr neukirchen was the only truly likeable character i had enjoyed the gravediggers daughter by ms oates so this book was a big disappointment,76,5
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,psychological stories can be hard to read highly intelligent meredith a university president is having a mental breakdown i felt a lot of sympathy for her thrown away by her mentally I shall mother at age three fostered in a house with seven other children adopted by a loving couple who had lost a child years earlier she gets a scholarship from cornell goes on to harvard earning a doctoral degree she obtains the presidency of a university and starts having dreams nightmares times when neither the reader not meredith is sure of what is real oates is a wonderful writer and even although i was not sure at times if i wanted to finish the book i am glad that i did i wanted to know what happened to meredith see if i could discover what was real and what was only in her mind i recommend it to those who want more than a cozy story,156,6

Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i usually love joyce carol oates but was sadly disappointed in this book the plot was weak and anticlimatic and it had entire chapters of pointless rambling i was only able to finish the book by glossing over 3/4 of it,41,8

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,author seems to believe in baffling with male bovine feces she demonstrates an extensive vocabulary while dragging the reader through a labyrinth of insanity beginning with murder and ending with attempted murder my advice to others is do not waste your time reading it,43,11

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,excellent novel about female university professor affected later in life by early childhood trauma / neglect interesting voice memory tricks / devices well-written and suspenseful combines literary suspense with serious literary fiction succeeding on both levels joyce carol oates fans will probably love this as one of her better ones although she is so prolific there have been many,55,16

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,a wll written engaging novel about an abused child who becomes very successful but because of her demons can not really continue to function as responsible adult joyce carol oates writes with great imagery but i felt that the book was unnecessarily long idid find it a worthwhile read,48,19

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,hard to readi skimmed a lot of it especially all the politics it was hard to tell what was reallyhappening and what was hallucination worst of all ther was no satisfying ending it just stopped i wanted to know why she took her sisters name perhaps she was already so damaged by the abuse that she could not remember which girl she was or perhaps it was survivors guilt,70,21
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,one of the worst books i have ever read truly strange,11,22

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,true excellence a book with this level of depth can be challenging and fascinating provided some actual thinking is not repugnant to the reader,24,24
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i was greatly disappointed i have enjoyed may oates books but i did not enjoy this it seemed to me disjointed weird and at times using high-blown language unnecessarily i could find almost nothing redeeming in it sorry i would not recommend it,43,25
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,having written so many volumes over the decades developing a personal style with recurring themes and not repeating oneself for an author as prolific as oates is close to impossible how far can she take her singular agitated anxious young woman from a small town and another lived through media tragedy this time is always the question oates is back with an entrapment by drowning or burial of a young girl which becomes a sensational news story what is the girls connection to a very successful woman the first female president of an ivy league university struggling with her obligations including the ethical politics of fundraising and an on campus attack of a student who is a right wing political activist and as in most novels there is the adulterous affair the married lover and a complication straight from the stories of alfred hitchcock which will have you wondering long after you put the book down what happens sends professor meredith neukirchen known as m r to her peers back to the place of her birth I have been hooked by oates through most of her novels and she has never disappointed me,191,26

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,2 stars i did not like it definitely not my preferred read i regret i bought it now having said all that i did finish the book with never one thought of not doing so hmmm not sure what that says yes i wanted to see how it was all resolved which it never was i was yearning for so many more in-depth details which never came the most satisfying section was feeling mr finally bond with her father as an adult it is not that I am looking for fairy tale endings and sugar plum characters but i do enjoy a good story i might characterize it as unsatisfying,114,29
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,what a strange and haunting book one that i thought about for a very long time after reading,18,30
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,this is one of the worst books i have ever completed her literary style to start the main character in early childhood then go to the prime of her career and then jump back to points in her childhood that were not relevant to the story and then to end without a point i do not recommend this book to anyone overall she writes well but there is no story here it is about a woman who overcame adversity in her early life and became successful about 1/3 of the way through the reader starts wondering if there has a story embedded here 2/3 of the way through the reader is wondering will this ever end at the end of the book the reader will ask themself are you kidding me it was a waste of time,135,31

Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,for how many years have i been not reading her novels too many she is nuts her mind goes places where minds should not go especially mine for decades i have done the same thing with this writer after i read black water i swore off her she had just gone too far no more reading joyce carol oates after a few years i gave in to good reviews and i read niagara oh no why never again no more and then i read the review of this creepy book and i do mean creepy what kind of twisted mind even thinks these thoughts much less strings them together into sentences that make up a novel do not buy this book if you do buy it put it on the shelf and do not read it unless you want to be sucked into her vortex you will not be able to put it down it is a compelling read and then you will not sleep for a few nights sleep is kind of over rated yes,176,34
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i started this book for a book club i am in i like the way it started and was very interested when the story when to the present time it became too involved with too much information i could not follow and got bored with i got half way through and closed the book it has been years since i have done this when i find a book that is hard to read i normally keep going because it will smooth out around the middle of the story this did not i was very disappointed as the book club which i had just joined had read another of her books the month before and they liked it very much perhaps it was just this character in the story and not carols writing style i hope so as i would like to try one of her books again jo,147,35
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this one of joyce carol oates best carries punch after punch after punch it calls us all to look at where we have come from and how that effects our life forever the book goes back and forth in and out from the present to the past to the future and back again at times it is hard to tell reality from dream as both intersect again and again and again wonderful,73,36

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,very good writing about a very superior person who pulls herself out of a painful past the only trouble is that in some parts i could not tell if events were real or imagined that is probably my fault i thought the book was very good,44,40
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,mudwoman calls the survivor in us strewn out to the mud flats like an inanimate object mudwoman must survive after being saved from death and go forward with her life haunted forever she struggles painfully and successfully,37,41
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is an amazing book that looks at several issues in depth one is the damage done to a person in childhood that follows her throughout her life in spite of being a success in societal terms another is the stressors upon women who manage to climb the ladders of success and how their viewpoints are disparaged and how they are held to a higher standard another is the issue of what it means to be a liberal or progressive person politically and how to juggle ones own beliefs in managing a high powered career this book to me exemplifies the best of joyce carol oates as she takes on some of the toughest issues of our times in a capturing and readable novel,124,42
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,title indicates the stylel which becomes heavy and depressing about an academic leader and how she came from poor and humble beginnings thoroughly boring,24,43
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i am normally not a joyce carol oates fan due to her extensive descriptions which meander on and one however this novel about the president of a university was wonderful her fully developed characters and the psychological tension was superbly executed i highly recommend this book,46,44
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,we dove into the psyche of a women having a breakdown following her demise was a nail biter but the end was a bit of a let-down I have read many other books by jco but this one was not one of my favorites,43,45
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i know that the books description told me that it was about a womans break down due to a stressful job and a dark past but what was going on i could not follow the plot and the dream / delusions were out there do not bother buying this book,46,46
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,at the beginning of the book i had nowhat it was about as it continued to develop i found it most disturbing and interesting at the same time even when you have the feeling you know what is going to happen after a while you still wish to see how oates ties it all together for people who like serious books,63,47
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,one would almost think the author was high while penning this wordy nonsensical novel i kept thinking it has to get better alas by the time i was half way through i knew that i had wasted too much time and money i have nohow this book evolved or ended and actually have no desire to know i rue the time i spent struggling to interpret the first half i would be reluctant to purchase any of her writings in the future,84,48

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i am quite willing to go down the rabbit hole following a good character down a strange but solid story unfortunately in this book the tangents go nowhere and add little to enlighten the story great premise but the main character could have been more fully developed had the story not taken so much time with seemingly unnecessary tangents and episodes that leave both her and the reader wondering did this really happen by the end i just felt like telling her enough already stop your and,87,51
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i am only halfway through this book and am forcing myself to read slowly and savor every magnificent word this is more than a book it is a major experience this is great literature as are almost all of ms oates books it is not my intent to insult other readers however i have two theories as to why anyone is not loving this book ms oates is obviously a genius and it may take more than average intelligence to appreciate the books splendor readers who need whiz-bang action cinderella romance or three bears type plot will not find it here 199 on kindle the best bargain you will find in your lifetime i will add to this review when i have sadly finished this masterpiece,127,52
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,fans of joyce carol oates know that she writes dark and dreary novels this is one of them at times i was very confused as to what was reality and what was a product of meridiths demented mind it still haunts me,42,53

Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,the review for this book sounded so good i anticipated it is delivery and dove right into it when it arrived however i could not force myself to continue much beyond the third chapter the writing was tedious i do not give up on many books but i did on this one,49,56
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i stuck with it because i do not like to start a book and then not finish it this book was so bad for me it was painful whatever the author was trying to get at was not clear to me in the end when it looked like she was going to resolve something she simply ended it with no ending i think she was disgusted with it too,69,57
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i did not even finish reading this book it made no sense and did not hold my interest long enough to finish,20,58

Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,a few pages in the story grabs you and draws the reader into the very convoluted world of the mudwoman it is a wild ride that makes you question what is real and what is imagination,36,63
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,kept me involved through the whole book plenty of tension hard to put down i would recommend it highly but not to everybody,24,64

Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,unless your psyche is made of steel do not read this book it will just bring you down do not we have enough real live events in the world to do that i choose not to spend my precious little expendable discetionary time on a book that is so depressing had there been a better resolution i would have applauded and felt happy that even through trials and tribulations the resilence of individuals will prevail i do not want to put any spoilers in but i did not put this book down at the end of it feeling that way do not waste your money do not waste your time do not expose your psyche to this,110,67
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,extremely well written but so distressing to read the skill in the writing worked against the readability the feeling of impending disintegration made me need to stop reading often just to regain enough emotional balance to be able to pursue the story but however uncomfortable i could not leave it alone perhaps the story was not the point,58,68
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,even if you are not already a fan you will love this book it is intense but that and fine writing is the beauty of ms oates,25,69
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,i was unable to stop reading this once started disturbing yes disappointing no i do not understand how readers can be disappointed by an ending this is the way jco intended it is the same as criticizing a painting because it does not follow conventional beauty i was and continue to be confused about certains aspects of the novel but this mirrors my own mind blurred lines between the real and imagined memories as seen through anothers life and mind i read it in one taut marathon sitting reading through the night a darkened house with all the night noises scaring the heck out of me and ghosts behind every door,110,70
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this novel was post-modern and had much stream of consciousness writing the beginning is the best part and the reader has to absorb every moment of initial story because it all comes back to haunt,35,71
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,never read anything by oates and this was an awakening excellent read that i could not put down highly recommend,20,72
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,not a fan of this author i struggled to follow is this author schizophrenic herself i never put down a book before i finish however in this case i was left with a headache everytime i committed myself to reading i quit halfway through and have no regrets hated it,50,73
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,in the usual way joyce carol oates provided an interesting although somewhat disturbing read i will continue to read her books,21,74
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,found her writing difficult to follow have not read any of her other books think this was not a wise choice too start with,22,75
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,can you believe this character goes from subtle observer wanting to be invisible in a very visible environment trying to alleviate chaos and lack of compassion and maybe just a big lie turns into psycho dismemberment machine do not even think it may have been revenge subtext in patricide,49,76
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i rarely leave reviews and especially do not comment negatively on things i usually just let my money speak for me however i felt that i needed to comment on this book i read this for book club and had to continue to force myself to finish this book as it turns out many members of the club just quit reading it because they did not like it there is no real point or plot to this novel there is an outline and a plot line but the story is never developed in any way that makes any sense at all you want this to develop into an interesting story of a woman who has overcome such a terrible start to life or some meaningful point but it is just a bunch of bits of pieces of events that are never really tied together unfortunately because of my experience with this book i will not likely ever read another book by this author i hate to say that because i love reading,170,77
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is a fascinating story told magnificently by jco the main characters struggle to balance her two extremely different woirlds is heart stopping in all of jcos many tales there is always a golden truth this one in order to prevail in life we need to have experienced a great love,51,78
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i have not read this author before this was an audio book and i listened to the first 5 of 16 discs and found it to be very annoying jumped around with no follow through i finally listened to last disc and returned it to the library i do not think I shall read any more works by this author definitely not my type of book i read for relaxation and enjoyment mudwoman not relaxing and not at all enjoyable give me daniel silva spencer quinn michael connelly baldacci child and more,87,79
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,although i am a big reader i have not read any jco books before it took me nearly seven weeks to finish this book and what a waste of time i kept thinking it would surely get better but no i had to see how it ended and now that I am finished i still do not know skip this book and go on to something else,64,80
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,this book was very confusing and i did not know what was going on half the time the ending was out of the blue nowhat it was all about,30,81
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i have read many of joyce carol oates books and this one is among my top three it is simply brilliant,21,82
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i did not like this book at all to be fair i have not read the author before and it is her style of writing that i did not like i am sure the story is quite ok,35,83
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,while this story opened with an intensity that prompted me to keep reading things just went downhill i have read joyce carol oates and enjoyed her writing which prompted me to read this what an arduous task would not let it get the better of me just knew there must be something at the end to pull it all together wrong,61,84
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,just not my cup of tea i really like all types of books but could not get into this at all too deep for my tastes i did read it all the way through hoping it would grab me but it never did a friend really raved about it i found a few parts of it very good but overall it left me dissatisfied and unfulfilled at the end i read for enjoyment and did not enjoy this trip,77,85
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is among the best books that i read all year the plot is intriguing and all the characterizations are mesmerizing you can identify even more if you have experienced academia or high levels of administration,36,86
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,this is a psychological novel about a woman who is decending into madness the reader is drawn into the novel through the mind of a woman who has gone through a devastating experience the reader must figure out what is reality and what is not just as the woman in the novel must grip with this this book makes you realize there is a thin line between sane and insane it is not an easy read but it is one you will not put down until it is finished someone i respect told me about this book so i knew before hand it would be an unusual read,106,87
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this is a complex story that keeps you thinking every sentence it takes more twists and turns than an old country dirt road while still staying on point,28,88
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,i like descriptive books but this author filled a full page to describe a single feeling she did this by rephrasing a sentence over and over again the flash backs boarded on psychotic ramblings maybe this was her way to convey the ranting of someone mentally I shall i found it too disjointed to appreciate,54,89
Books,0062095633,1.0,negative,i found this book to be very difficult to read it skipped back and forth too often and it was very confusing i was never really sure if mr was actually living something dreaming or hallucinating the writing left a lot to be desired with many awkward or fragmented sentences it just did not flow easily even although i found the book hard to get through i did finish it only to be somewhat disappointed with the ending,78,90
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,like all of joyce carol oates novels this one is very well written it is thought-provoking and the plot moves at a quick and exciting pace but it is also sad and often disturbing,34,91
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this story is told from inside the tangled mind of a brilliant woman when she is lost in the cobwebs of her mind i got lost as well I am sure that is just what ms oates intended when it is all deciphered we have the story of an abandoned baby adopted grown into successful academician and confused adult who seeks answers about her origins very well told I am mystified at how joyce carol oates can tell such dark twisted stories and yet retain her grip but this most deservedly esteemed writer does time and time again i gave it four stars instead of five because i felt i was never quite able to unravel the whole story,117,92
Books,0062095633,4.0,positive,this was an interesting concept sometimes a little hard to follow but overall it was true to the subject and had some interesting twists i was expecting more about the climb to the position she held but it had enough to give the reader an experience of the feelings behind the climb i reccommend this to all,57,93
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,if a book is supposed to communicate something to the audience there seems to have been a violation of purpose in this case the main message for the reader is to wonder what better way they could have spent their time i expected more from such an esteemed author to a point i appreciate her way of presenting the dark interior life of someone as a jumble of memories and perceptions that are not clearly real or not real but the reader might like to know once in a while there are many examples of themes and plot lines left hanging in the breeze such as a gruesome murder that occurs in the middle of the book that is never mentioned again the ending is on par with the rest of the book completely baffling so do not read on hoping for a sensible denouement i hope the author will remember her readers in the future because we are real,159,94
Books,0062095633,5.0,positive,i always enjoy jcos books this one takes me back to her earlier writing and i am very fond of it she is one of the best writers living today i only hope she continues to write books like this one with fully developed and interesting characters,46,95
Books,0062095633,2.0,negative,was excited to see a new work by this author i am a fan of her work this book has a lot of boring parts and is really tough going much of the time very confusing because you do not know whether what you are reading is really happening a dream a psychotic break or just an old memory i would not recommend mudwoman it seemed totally unfinished what about the boyfriend the father the job,75,96
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,i had the service up and running within 5 minutes did not need any installation other than plug and play i was making international calls to the united kingdom within the hour at 3 cents a minute very impressive i set it up so that it rings my cell as well as the home number so friends can find me with just one call i gave it 4 stars only because i could not get a local area code number topeka ks and set up a 1 - 888 number for local friends to call in on,95,0
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,works well linksys is the best product in the market today period,12,1
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,we paid a little extra for this router for the integrated vonage phone jacks included in the package boy were we disappointed we stopped using the vonage service within a couple weeks because voice packets were dropped when multitasking with web-related activities refresh a webpage dropped voice packets check for email dropped voice packets do not buy this router for vonage services if you care about quality phone service and you are online throughout the day do not use vonage,81,2
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,it was exactly what was promised a router to connect a couple of pcs and a regular phone to the internet cable easy set-up no surprises decent price,28,3
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,customer service is horrible 3 hours on hold 2 hours on with a technician that speaks english as well as my dog and they could not figure out why i had no internet connectivity the only saving grace is that i was allowed to return it i had to stop payment on the credit card before they would allow a refund beware,61,4
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,awesome product for phone service and wireless all in one great buy for the money excellent price many options for added security and/or gaming features,25,5
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,i got this router from best buy when i decided to move my phone to vonage i have had nothing but trouble from day one first the phone service even sucked but some constant tweaking of the settings over a couple of weeks straightened that out now it works great except for the wireless the wireless connection sucks it constantly drops out resets the connections and runs very slow i have to unplug the router at least twice per day just to use the wireless connection finally i managed to fix it and get it working right i bought a new wireless router and turned off the linksys wireless for good so if you want a hardwired router with a crappy wireless addition buy this,125,6
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,worked as advertised wireless reaches my bedroom from the basement ethernet side was working within minutes vonage phone service was simple set up also although still waiting to have my exsiting phone number transfered to vonage service,37,7
Electronics,B00064C54O,5.0,positive,i purchased the linksys wrt54gp2 to set up a wireless network at home for 2 desktops and 1 laptop in addition i wanted to use the phone ports with vonage service the router was very easy to set up with the instructions provided even setting up the wireless security options was easy I have had my system up and running for 4 weeks now the new internet phone service and network operation is working great,74,8
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,low sound quality difficult to reach customer support and frequent service outages even although my cable internet connection is very good the vonage service is mediocre at best in 3 months of using the service i have had at least 5 days of no vonage service and many have reported that when they call me they can not get through,59,9
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,postings on other sites have reported noise problems with this unit noise is white noise sounds like a hiss i talked to a vonage customer svc rep a capable one on 3/25/05 about this and he said the problem was caused by a faulty capacitor which as batch of these routers were built with this batch is no longer in production and is not being distributed anymore also if you have another non-vonage linksys router that you are replacing this unit with the ac power adapters for vonage routers are 12v but for non-vonage are 5v i was too lazy to swap adapters and was powering my vonage router w the 5v adapter the router-part worked fine except the phone-part would never register with vonage linksys should report this on their configuration page,130,10
Electronics,B00064C54O,4.0,positive,this section is reviewing vonage not this product so i thought I had chime in great is the word for it easy to set up good reception minimal problems goodbye sbc finally i really recommend it,35,11
Electronics,B00064C54O,1.0,negative,do not switch to vonage beside poor sound quality they have no customer service whatsoever i have been trying to contact them for over a week and nothing they do not respond to your emails and tech support does not answer the phone the only people you can get to answer is sales and they will not help you with problems this is the worst company I have ever run across do yourself a favor and stick with your normal phone company or pick another voip provider vonage is bad news,88,12
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I have never been more disappointed i was excited to get these earbuds after i read the other reviews and the minute i stepped outside and sped up they flew right out of my ears after a song and a half i could not stand it anymore and had to carry my mp3 player the rest of the way without listening to it,61,0
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,after trying several different kinds of earbuds i decided to go ahead and give these a shot they are noticeably better than any other earbuds i have tried sennheiser koss and panasonic they have good bass and excellent clarity i use these at the gym and they fit very comfortably and do not move they also work really well for running i would recommend these to any mp3 owner,68,1
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I have had sonys mdr-ex51lp and mdr-ex71sl fontopia headphones and this are decisively better the 52lps at around 27 are still the best option for someone on a budget but I am very happy with the extra ten i paid for these the sound quality is very similar to what you get from the 71sls which is lower bass than the 51s but much more clarity but the earhook design of these 81lps overcomes a major design flaw of it is forebearers I have had a huge problem with the earbud coverings flying off into oblivion when the plug was pulled out on the othermodels rending the unit unuseable until i found the extra buds infuriating when they are in another state the earhooks on this one ensure that will not be a problem and are thus infinitely better for use at the gym and elsewhere of course the sound quality and clarity on all of these is excellent and although you will not get any directional audio the plug design locks out surrounding sound like a champ fuctioning just as well or better than any noise-cancelling headphones in this price range,185,2
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i have very small ears and have a hard time finding headphones that stay in my ears so i thought with the wrap-around that it would stay in place but the section that goes from the earbud to the wrap-around is way too long and the wrap-around part was sticking way above my ear and instantly fell off i would not recommend these if you have small ears,68,3
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,there are two good reasons not to buy these headphones 1 they may very well fail without because as two pairs I have own have failed and 2 sony is so contemptuous of their customers that they offer to replace your defective 30 headphones with a ' reconditioned pair for 25 what a deal do yourself a favor before buying consider my experience with sony repair i mailed in my bum buds the second pair that failed but i objected to sonys pricing surely they have a better deal to offer nope sony shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap oh and they invited me to get back to them it would be our pleasure to accept a major credit card i bet 25 for used headphones with no cut to the retail middleman this is sony standing behind it is product you are on your own sucker,152,4
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have owned two pairs of these earbuds one in white one in black in each pair the left earbud has stopped working in less than a year it is closer to nine months that is almost 80 dollars I have spent on these headphones the sound quality is acceptable and they stay in your ears nicely when working out but watch out they will inevitably break i can not recommend these headphones unless you are ready to buy a new pair every year,78,5
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these headphones sound great when they are in your ear but if you are doing any thing other than sitting perfectly still they just fall out the only good thing about the hook shape is they do not fall off you head completely i personally find my self just wasting money on ear bud style headphones just to find they will not stay in my ear i have about 8 different sets i think it is time to go old school,78,6
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i like the quality of sound but the earphones do not stay in your ears well for andesigned to stay in your ears sony really missed on these,30,7
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,waste of money did not fir my ear very well and not that great o sound,15,8
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earphones have perfect sound quality and most importantly they stay in your ear while you run i have tried other headphones but these are easily worth the cost since my personal purchase i have bought them twice as a gift i will warn you to make sure you are careful with them the earbud will unclip from the wiring,59,9
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i bought a similar one year ago but the left phone was just broken i found this one is the only one on sale on amazoncom it is actually improved for it is mobility since a clip added on phone i hope it will last for more than one year i use ear phone every day,55,10
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality is subpar at best the volume and clarity of sound is about 50 of those from the original ipod packaging therefore totally worthless and waste of money in addition the wrap around feature is not adjustable and does not conform to the ear making it very difficult to keep them on unless you sit still,58,11
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,this was my third pair of sony earbud style earphones in less than three years and they quit like the two before after about 9 months one or both ears just stop working i had a pair of sony mdr-ex71 fontopia headphones whithout the over-the-ear thing and after they quit out of brand loyalty i bought another pair same thing this time i bought the mdr-ex81 and they broke a few months ago I am generally careful with my things and three times is not a coincidence so i must conclude that these earphones suck,93,12
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,it is a good headphone which fits around the ear easily and produces good sound but i actually liked the black fontopia without the thing going around the ear i gifted this to my sis and she is enjoying using it it is a good product by sony,46,13
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have been purchasing from amazon for years but this is my first review after reading all of the other reviews on this product i decided they would be the solution for running with my ipod as the stock apple earbuds just fall out well these do not adjust in any way so you would better hope your ears are the same shape and size as they would designed these for they are very uncomfortable and keep slipping plus the sound sucks other reviewers said the bass response was great bologna sounds like crap you have to shove these way way into your ear canal to get the bass but they do not stay put there and again more discomfort i hate em waste of money,121,14
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i hate ear buds not because of the sound but they absolutely wipe out my ears meaning they hurt like he shall over the years with my many ipods come the supplied ear buds that not only sound like excrement they hurt my ears after several minutes i have tried others and they are equally painful my son has a pair of the above earphones i could not believe how comfortable so quickly went the 33 route cheap at half the price they stay in sound fine and most important of all after an hour or so i am still not aware of their presence i also have sony street phones which i enjoy but these are far more compact and unobtrusive i am junking all those earphones that are in-between that are anchored by the ears some very time consuming to put on i am hard put to recommend any other product as a value for the bucks spent as i would this one,161,15
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,best headphone of all that i have tried good sounding and stay in place even during rigurous workouts,18,16
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,do not buy these they worked fine for 3 weeks and the fit was great then the volume in the right ear all but disappeared the left ear remained fine for two more weeks then it became irratic sometimes ok but most of the time soft enough that i had to sit still to hear it since i use it when i exercise this was useless now it is over 30 days from purchase date and i no longer have the original packaging so this was a total loss,88,17
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,out of 3 other types of athletic headphones I have tired these one are simply in a league of their own i can wear them forever and they feel great whereas the others hurt my ears after 5 - 10 minutes or do not even fit these never fall out they sound amazing the only downside after a year or two of hard use the rubber has ripped in two areas exposing the wires that run to the earbuds the grey part that actually goes in your ear can fall off about once a week and is often hard to find and they are impossible to find anywhere for sale does anyone know where you can buy replacement inner-ear caps or whatever they are called I had love to stock up on them so i do not have to bother spending 10 minutes searching the floor,139,18
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,bought this earphone so that i can wear it just hanging out or going to the gym it was important that the earphone looks decent and in the gym will not slipoff my ears while running this worked out really well for me i do not care that much about sound quality so i can not give an opinion about it i usually do not care to and do not notice a difference,68,19
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,earphones have earhooks that allow the unit to remain in ear during work this is what caused me to purchase the unit,22,20
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I have got no complaints with the sound versus the price after 3 months of use and use in the gym the rubber cord melted off the copper cables perhaps the sweat degrades the cable coating or something these are decent earphones as long as you do not plan to work out in them or expose them to moisture,57,21
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I am a runner and was looking for a pair of earphones that would stay put during my workouts while sony took into account ear canal size by providing different sized buds they did not put much thought into the piece that goes around the ear I am a 510 female with what i consider normal ears the loops do not even come close to hooking around my ear no amount of adjustment will make them work a few minutes into my run and the earphones pop out since they do provide decent sound quality I have resorted to using them for plane rides and sedentary endeavors,102,22
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earbuds are very comfortable and have great sound i love the changeable tips because otherwise they would be to big for my ear canal the only thing i would maybe change is that the case is a bit bulky but i can live with that,46,23
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these headphones are awesome the sound quality is amazing i definitely recommend these,13,24
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,am using them to jog with old ones fell out of my ears no complaints,15,25
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,bought 2 pair as ipod gifts based on positive experience with this model both quickly turned defective imbalance of sound one side significantly weaker than other device is not because amazon replaced 1st pair slow service after aggravating phone call to non-united states call center language skills and phone call noise objectionable now waiting several weeks for amazon to credit return on 2nd pair a shame that quality control has slipped on thisused to be good note there are refurbs of this product available at clearance spots good luck getting a good pair bottom line 2 pair earphones defective customer service poor amazon and sony need to do better,111,26
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i purchased thisfor a friend of mine in dominican republic and he loves it he mentioned me that the audio quality is superior,25,27
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these sound great but are too big for my ears I am an above-average sized adult male i do not think i have small ears and yet these do not stay on my ears because the loops are too tall i honestly can not imagine these fitting more than 5 of human ears ridiculous,51,28
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have nothing but good things to say about this buy it you will not be disappointed if you are looking for over the ear earphones with crystal clear sound,30,29
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,well they certainly work they deliver a crisp clear sound and are well worth the price they are also far more comfortable than the stock ipod head phones especially for someone with small ears plus they stay in your ears when working out or running my only complaint is that they go so far into your skull that you can hear your own breathing heartbeat and more and as a former hearing aid technician i would not recommend prolonged or high volume usage,81,30
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,simply put these seem like a great set of earphones just like the in ear model 71s but they did not fit over the top of my ear my thought was that these would be great for sports so as you ran along they would stay on the post between the plastic ear band and the earphone is too long i can only imagine how big ears have to be for these to fit on properly they are great for sticking in your ear and cutting out backround noise and they sound great they just do not fit and that is on many people,102,31
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i am no audiophile but i found the sound quality to be the same as my sony mdr-ex71s and better than the stock ipod set however i bought these because i thought they would stay on and in my ears better when working out running and snowboarding no such luck the rubber ear cups work fine but the ear loop that is supposed to keep the earphones on my head are too big and are not adjustable so they just fall off like my other set that is why i gave these a low score poor design ruined these for me,101,32
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,good for sony i think is 1 of my best purchase last year first class product whit and excelent price powerfull bass clear treable very confort design comes whit a case for care,33,33
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,well i bought these mostly because i like sony products they are more comfortable then the ear plugs that came with my ipod that is for sure they work good around evryday things but on the airline forget it i did not know they have noice canceling head sets for that soooo i bought a sony headset around 5000 they work a little better but i guess ubless you buy something really expensive maybe like bose the same thing will happen,79,34
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these earphones are so light you forget you are wearing them i am very happy with my purchase e field,20,35
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was looking for a nice in-ear headphone for the gym to listen to audio books and found these sony fontopia headphones with great reviews i picked this mdr-ex81lp white over other fontopia models due to it is sport style I am a woman with normal ears but these headphones did not stay in my ears even when i was sitting still it was falling out all the time and very annoying especially when i was on the elliptical machine or lifting weights so if your intention is to use at the gym or workout i will not recommend,95,36
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones i could not get them to stay in / on my ears the loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome these may fit men with bigger ears better but i would not recommend them for females,52,37
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I have never heard clarity and range of highs and lows in any earbud headphones like these sony mdr-ex81lps and it is wrap-around-the-ear design means it never falls out including during my most aggressive work-outs at the gym and is not it great to block out at least 80 of the ambient sound in that gym so although i have not listened to every ear-bud out there i think you would be hard-pressed to find a better sound in such a small package especially at this price,80,38
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,my son specifically asked for these head phones i received them in a timely manner for his birthday,18,39
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these earphones to replace the set i got with my sandisk sansa m240 mp3 player as for the sound they are a little high on the treble ends to he point of being tinny just not enough bass could be the player as i have not yet tried them with anything else the fit is excellent in the ear canal but over the ear well it could be better maybe i just have big ears overall good sound and decent fit,83,40
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i like theand sonys technology of the earphone itself but the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless when i put the earphone in the ears the hanger part is just hanging in the air not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady because of that the earphones easily pop out of your ear,61,41
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the sound is great they fit snugly in my ear do not fit around my ears well do not care for the one wire longer than the other wish wires had adjustable piece to make it fit tighter,36,42
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,sony has an ultra-short 90 day warranty on these headphones mine broke after the warranty expired I had expect that from a cheap set of earbuds but not from an expensive set made by a name like sony I shall try a different brand next time,44,43
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I am on my 2nd pair of the headsets the sound is far better than the standard-issue ipod headsets and they are priced right plus the earplugs do block out a lot of ambient noise the problem i wear them almost daily at the gym after several months wear the volume diminishes sweat and whatever else seem to block up a pin-hole in each earplug that has not kept me from buying 2 pairs obviously but i wish there were a way to clean them,82,44
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,unlike other reviewers this earphones fit my ears perfectly i used it for indoor exercising 3 times a week it sounded great too unfortunately after 4 months one of the earphone stopped working and of course it is just out of the warranty time i did not expect such a poor quality from sony so i rate it 2 stars,58,45
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,my cord melted away after a month or so of use the soft rubber covering the wires to the earphones are easily damaged and once you get a tear it will continue to strip leaving the cord exposed good sound but you will look horrible with exposed copper wires hanging from your ears pass on thisuntil they figure out how to build it better,66,46
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,if you are the kind of user who can always carry the included carrying case then my comment will be irrelevant enjoy the earphones as they are as good as ex71 however i usually keep my earphones wrapped around my ipod and unless you are super careful the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles the same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle also the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while i use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses it is doable but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears finally the whitegoes well with the white ipod models but after a few months they tend to show the grime all too well my advice i do not think that any claimed audio improvement over ex-71 is worth the extra hassle if your heart is set on this model get the black one,150,47
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,these earbuds are absolutely terrible first the wires constantly tangle i bought these f-ing things so that i could stay motivated while exercising but it is a real morale killer to spend about 3 or 4 minutes getting them untangled before ever getting a chance to use them but this is assuming they are products you want to use in the past i had used these earbuds while lifting weights under such circumstances the experience is awful not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement but since the wire is meant to hang around your head and thus behind your back good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything awful for the first time tonight i decided to run with my mp3 player every few minutes i had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears no one should have to endure this bs from a product that is meant to enhance their listening experience enough is enough I am getting new earbuds do not buy these,181,48
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,since my daughters every waking day begins and ends with music these replacements get a great work out she uses these earphones so much that she has not used her backup units also purchased from amazon,36,49
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i guess i have small ears the loop that goes around the ear goes way over my ear i admit that the earbuds themselves are great but the loop only works if your earsize is bigger than average i called sony and they were no help with the problem so i returned the headphones,54,50
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,good ear buds the sound is great but a little bit difficult to set them in the right position they tend to come off easely i used them in the office so i can not tell you if they are good for running or other sport activity too nevertheless the sound is great,53,51
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,true there are other headphones out there however they will be more pricey these are the best results i have had with earbud style headphones the loop and different sized rubber pieces helped me to achieve the perfect fit I am so happy i can finally get them to stay on oh and by the way the sound is good also I am very satisfied with the product because i feel that i have gotten my moneys worth,75,52
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these earphones for my mp3 player i just have one question where has the bass the bass is pretty much nonexistent the crummy earphones that came with my mp3 were a lot better than these awesome design but without the sound it is just an expensive paperweight not recommended at all,51,53
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i just got back from the doctor because the earphone cover on this sony mdr plugs came off and was lodged in my ear canal for the last 3 days i have never written an online review in my life but for the sake of your health do not use these headphones the plugs work by literally being placed fairly deep into your ear canal with enough perspiration this rubber cover can come off unfortunately when i removed the earphones the rubber cover did not come with it and the gray cover stayed in my ear it not only impaired my hearing but caused a good deal of pain and headaches for a few days until i just got my physician to pry it out even as i write this I am laughing a bit since it is somewhat humorous that something so absurd can happen but I am only able to laugh because it is out of my f and ing ear you have been warned they are snug but could be hazardous to your health thank god it came out I am going to stay away from plugs in general especially when i used for running nothing should be placed deep into your ear to work just not worth the risk,201,54
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,at first i did not like these headphones much because they seemed to be very weak when it came to bass they sound was distant and tinny then i tried the medium size earbuds which allowed me to push the headphones a little farther into my ears i had been using the large size earbuds at first and it made all the difference in the world now they sound fantastic with the three sizes of earbuds included you should be able to find a size that fits your ears make sure you try all three sizes and place the earbuds as far into your ears as possible before you decide if you like the sound on these headphones,117,55
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,these fit in my ears and sound great but the loops go completely over my ear when i go running they constantly fall out I shall post a photo shortly,29,56
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,my white mdr-ex81 has now disintegrated where the rubber wire coating has rips in many places and very gummy and sticky it is as if it is melting away bad chemistry it is easily tangled and irritating to undo it also due to sticky coating this product has been discontinued by sony do not buy this product,57,57
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these are great they are comfortable and sound great using then in the gym is a great relief since they do not fall out when you get a bit sweaty,29,58
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these for 30 at the same time i bought some koss sport clip phones ksc75 for around 13 and the koss sound much better than these i can not even listen to music with the sony earphones it is so tinny they can only be used for talk radio and then they are marginal so beware,55,59
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,I am very dissapointed on regard this headphones for the price brand and aspect i expected a great sound none of the above the sound is bright in excess an you will not hear any bass is unpleasant i tried different ways to insert them in my ears and no change changed the plastic cups and nothig readed and search in the instructions which are just a few lines and nothing looked at te web and no more info conclusion if there is no info there is no answer i wasted my time and my money you know it now is your call,101,60
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i love them they have good bass sound and they do not hurt my ears like other ear bud earphones do,20,61
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,it has been stated over and over again these headphones are great for the first couple months this accounts for the great reviews but the rubber around the wire will start to come off right after your 3 month warranty runs out it is strange but true once again rubber disintegrates after 3 months read the reviews it happens on both white and black i have the black the rubber is broke in 6 different spots and sticky unfortunately sony is not putting out a support alert on this product because they have not received enough calls on it from owners that have had this fail within the 3 month warranty period,110,62
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these are very convenient headphones you can wear them for long durations without discomfort some of the headphones that I have owned in the past have been really uncomfortable when used for long durations but not these the sound quality is good and the range of frequencies it handles is great i got very natural sounding lows mids and highs when i tested them with some mp3s that i have they do eliminate ambient noise quite a bit due to the snug fit soft ear plugs the loop around the ear stops them from comming off when exercising i would certainly recommend these,102,63
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,like the ex71 these earphones from sony are an embarrassment to the name sony used to produce a quality product not any more the sound is flat there is absolutely no bass I am also surprised that amazon when you return a product makes you pay for shipping both ways i do not plan to purchase things i have not tried anymore from amazon,62,64
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i gave mine away these do not fit smaller ears note all the raves are from men if you can stick the buds into your ear as they are meant to be like the ex51/71sls the wraparounds stick up and look silly suspended over your my ears rendering the ear pieces superfulous they are not the easiest things to put on either and you must take care if you wear earrings i recommend the ex51sl or ex71sls which you just plug in and be on your way,86,65
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,sony is trying to be unique in this design but i have a problem with the fitting and the rubber around the wire started to unravel after couple months of usage i am disatisfied with this product,37,66
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,great sound and a great case the carrying case i got with mine is a white oval hard case that fits the earphones great and also contains one pair each of small medium and large earbuds after wearing them for over an hour they get a little uncomfortable i have no comment on the longevity but after 2 months of light use mine are still like new,67,67
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,very good earbuds considering the small price sounds excellent in everything except rock a guitar sounds really loud and scratchy i consider the case that comes with these to be useless overall a very good product,36,68
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i bought these earphones from amazon and used them religiously with an ipod shuffle while bicycling for exactly seven months the sound quality was more than acceptable and the earphones were very comfortable however they are no longer usable because the white coating on the wires has become sticky and has started to disintegrate exposing the wires underneath these earphones come only with a 90 day warranty from sony sony will replace them with a refurbished pair for about the price of a new pair 2900 previous reviewers have noted the same problem and suggested that sony respond to this they have they have discontinued the product,108,69
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i loved this headphones they were the excellent ipod headphones replacements they have got fabulous reviews but just do a google search typing ear buds hear all serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones unlike headphones that go around the ear these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you are projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process those cells are very very sensitive to noise damage earbuds allow sounds in the environment toin often causing the user to turn up the volume,146,70
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these because i travel a lot and like to listen to music books and more in the plane the sound on these are good for the money when inserted into the ear they do a good job of muffling most of the ambient noise one complaint the silicone earbuds will become dislodged and can be lost easily recently i lost one of the silione earbuds during a flight could use the earphone without them but it was very uncomfortable sony charges 895 for a single large earbud and 695 for a single small or medium that is a little on the ridiculous for a small piece of silicone that costs mere pennies to produce not to mention you do not even get a pair they are hard to find also i found a company called audiocube that sells a pair for 10 better than 14 sony wants but still expensive shipping is 7 in us so you are out 17 if you want a pair for backup,165,71
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I am going to order this at amazoncom from an awesome deal i found on dailytoolcom i think this is a very decent price for this white earphones,27,72
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,comfortable and fantastic sound much better than the stock earbuds that come with the ipod highly recommend,17,73
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,pretty good replacement for my old ipod headphones they have the same benefits size easy to store and more and drawbacks cords get tangled sound quality and more as any other earbud headphones would the sound is just ok as expected but noticibly better than the ipod headphones so it was a good upgrade worth the cost,55,74
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,these and all the fontopia line sound great the big problem is the rubber coating on the wire comes off easily it feels like bubblegum,25,75
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i recently purchased a moderately priced mp3 player and was fully excepting the earphones that came with the product to be the weakest link my anticipation proved to be accurate i replaced them with the sony mdr-ex91lp set and the sound quality improvement was remarkable of course one could spend a great deal more on earphones but for the price these sony earphones are a great value,67,76
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i bought these earphones based on the amazon rating and have unfortunately been very disappointed i wear them primarily at the gym with my ipod nano while the sound quality is very good unfortunately they do not stay put and i am constantly having to fiddle with them to stay on the loop is just too big for my ears so when i put the ear bud into my ear the loop part sits way above and outside my ear not snugly fitting there is no way to adjust them unfortunately and it only gets worse when i sweat during a workout because then they are sliding off i also paid full price for them at the time january 06 and now they are discounted but even at that price they are of no use to me I am now in the market again for a set of earphones with good sound quality that are also a good fit for me any suggestions are welcome,164,77
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these ear buds were great they were cheaper on amazon and they sound quality is excellent they arrived in a timley fashion,22,78
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the earphone is pretty good and it gives exceptional sound quality it is easy to use sometime it comes off the ears but it is not a major problem overall it is very good,31,79
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,it does a very good job considering the price i use it everyday for my commute i take trains to work and i can listen to my ipod without blowing off my ears it is worth every penny you can get better noise cancelling headphones but they are bulky and north of 100 bucks,54,80
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the sound quality is tinny the treble range is fine but the bass response is absurdly bad to listen with these things is like leaving out entire instruments so if all you listen to are i dunno flutes go ahead and buy them but for normal music they are really not even better than the standard ipod headphones,57,81
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality is excellent do not get me wrong these earphones put out clear treble deep bass without washing everything else out and have a well balanced tone that i have not found in most other headphones i have used the backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect but does a better job than most earphones my biggest problem the fit i opted for the over-the-ear style because i thought it would be better for an active lifestyle and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are the length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make they simply do not work in my case others may have different a experience the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe almost an inch too far down for these to fit right huge mistake not making them adjustable sony bad bad bad design it is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones i have used,180,82
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i am not an audiophile i just need headphones that do a decent job of isolating me from external sounds and that are very mobile so i can not comment too much on how perfect the sound is from the sonys but my amateur opinion is that they sound great the sound isolation is not too bad but not too great either I had say they attenuate incoming external noise by about 50 i own a pair of etymotics er 4 micropro earphones cost 300 and the sony mdr-ex81lps a have much deeper bass response i use the etymotics correctly that is press them all the way into your ear until your feel that sucking feeling and when i do so i can barely hear what has going on around me so the etymotics are much better than the sonys for sound isolation i have not had a problem with the cords or durability but I have only used the headphones about 10 times no visible wear so far i love them and am glad i bought them i prefer to use them when total sound isolation is not necessary,183,83
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,great fit and sound does not work well with a cell phone adapter 25 mm to 15 mm do not buy for a cell phone but only for a device that uses 25 mm,31,84
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the ear piece is flimsy sound quality is good i do a lot of running and the things kept on popping out of my ears and if they do not stay in your ears you can not hear the music well you can but the quality drops from a 8 to a 1 i gave it to a friend of mine that just sits around and listens to music,67,85
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these earphones are awesome they are far superior to anything you would get oem with your mp3 player or other audio device it takes a little time to get used to these earphones and getting them to fit comfortably however once you do they do not fall out and sound great before during and after workout the only disadvantage seems to be the shorter cord to the left ear this is designed so that the main cord goes down on the side of your body rather than your chest but takes a little while to get used to and to hide the cord away in your clothing i wish the cord was shorter like with other sony earphones so that i could plug it into my in-line remote and not have a 22 m long cord but without a remote these are a great length for just about any type of use,150,86
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i got an ipod several month ago and want to boost the bass for my music so i decide to got this new set of headset it sounds good and clear but according to the bass it is really not as good as my original ipod set,46,87
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i usually have problems with ear-bud type headphones but this one is very comfortable even when used for 2 - 3 hours at a time i highly recommend these for the ear-bud skeptics the sound quality is excellent also,37,88
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,the best pair of ear buds i have had so far the sound quality is great and actually has a large amount of bass with the cords wrapping behind my ear i no longer have to worry about the buds coming out whenever the cord gets caught on something,49,89
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,indeed the sound quality on these is excellent but i am on my second pair namely because of the cord attached to the right earphone after a few months it loosens and inexplicably develops a putty like quality which soon peels away from the inner wire sony should have fixed this issue long ago,54,90
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the headphones have good sound and the buds themselves fit into the ear well the problem is with the ear pieces that fit over the ears they fit either my wife or me they evidently were designed by an engineer with big ears,43,91
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have purchased several earphones for my ipod shuffle including the apple small earbuds and the altec lansing im302 and these are the best in terms fit they also sound great,31,92
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,let me start by saying that I am pleased these phones definitely have improved bass response compared to the last ones 61s that i had from sony but they have definitely sacrificed some of the clarity you would expect from the stuck-in-your-ear type earbuds the pros the carrying case after i figured it out is very cool the over-ear hooks are nice they fit very good and block out a lot of the outside noise decent bass repsonse the cons the technology that sony has implemented in these earbuds definitely improves bass response but it comes at the cost of some clarity do not get me wrong they sound good they just do not sound great but definitely worth the price,118,93
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the packaging is great and the headphones come with different sizes of earbds and a neat little carrying case it is a very comfortable set to wear all of which makes it a real pity that the sound quality is terrible it sounds tinny it has none of the quality of sound of the standard ipod earbuds so i rate it 1 star for sound quality but bumped it up one star for the package as a whole,79,94
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i have had about 4 pairs of sony headphones from the basic earbud ones to these with the wrap-around-the-ear style I have loved every pair I have had very comforatble very nice sound quality which is why I have been so disappointed every time they have died these headphones will stop working within a year I have tried it 4 times it is true i use them for working out running or just when i need to be alone with music and they have worked just great [ ],82,95
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i have very small ears most ear-bud earphones are painful for me to wear these are the first that really fit me and stay on well they have 3 sizes of rubber covers to fit all ear sizes i use them at work and they cut the noise out very well on top of all that they sound great,59,96
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,I have gotten these three times from and within three weeks of gentle use each ear bud started playing at two differnt levels one fine the second about a third of the volume they are very comfortable but i did have some trouble fitting them i guess i have smaller ears i could use them at the desk but did not work for me at the gym,66,97
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i picked this headset over many other options for the price and comfortable secure fit they advertise along with premium sound and superior bass if you like listening to all your music filtered through a tin can these are for you there is little to no bass and the earbuds fallout with great ease makes for a great time at the gym if you like messing with your overpriced headset and not working out do not buy and if you do want to buy them you can have mine since i can not return them now,97,98
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i just bought these as a gift for my brother I have had them for almost 2 years now these headphones produce a crisp quality sound i wear them when i run outside and the only drawback is that you can not hear anything but the music that you are listening to someone could sneak up behind you and bonk you on the head and you would never hear them coming if you had these headphones on ok unlikely scenario but the description should give you a goodof how outside noise is completely eliminated i highly recommend these headphones,98,99
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,1 the over-the-ear hooks do not really fit over my ears they sort of balance on top of the ear they are not adjustable I am an average-sized male so it is hard to fathom this design 2 the buds pop out of my ears when they get wet from sweat from exercise all 3 sizes of plastic earpiece covers do the same thing 3 the sound quality is mediocre bass response is especially weak 4 after less than one months use the volume on the left earpiece dropped to around 1/4 of the volume of the right all in all I am thankful therefore for amazoncoms return policy I shall use the money from the refund to buy a different set of earphones,120,100
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,the ipod earbuds just do not stay in my ears which i found very frustrating these are great there are three options for the pads so you will find one that fits i was concerned from the picture that the bar that hangs down and connects the ear hook to the earbud was too long it is not adjustable but it is not an issue the design makes these very adjustable and comfortable also if you have only heard your ipod on the standard earbuds you are in for a treat the sound out of these is just fantastic so much better than the original earbuds the price i paid was about the same as buycom but amazon was shipping for free so this is a better deal i strongly recommend these for anyone who wants comfortable earbuds with a marked improvement in sound at a very reasonable price i can not wait to hit the slopes with them enjoy,156,101
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,first i bought these because i hate earbuds inserted into my ear so i thought the over the ear feature would be great however the sound quality from these is very weak the stock ipod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound to get any usable sound i have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible which is exactly what i hate even then the sound is hollow and tinny second the over the ear feature does not work for snot i can not get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time plus this is a non-adjustable element i think my ears are a pretty average size and shape but i can not use them i guess it does not matter anyhow since the sound quality is so poor the carrying case is a nice touch but about twice as large as it should be,168,102
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these head phones are great the sound is clear and it fits great on the ear it comes with three different ear bud size that allows you to change between them and use whatever is comfortable however there has one thing that i do not like about it i worked in an office where there are carpet floors and since there has metal around the head phone near the ear buds static electricity transfer up to the metal rods quite often if you like your ears being shock or if you can keep your feet still then go for it just giving everybody a heads up,104,103
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i bought these headphones for my ipod because the bud type headphones always come out of my ears and are terribly uncomfortable the ear hook design is a fabulous improvement the customizable earbud fittings also ensured these headphones have a very comfortable fit the sound is great from these headphones although the volume the headphones produce is lesser than what my ipod earbuds produce for the most part this is ok the only time this is an issue for me is when i am on an airplane announcements from flight attendants and from the cockpit drown out the volume even when my ipod is at the highest levels the only thing i do not like about these headphones is the earpieces have different length cords before reaching the single cord that goes to the mp3 player or whatever you are listening to this is picky i know but it makes it difficult to wrap up the headphones and requires that i strap my ipod nano on my left arm when i run if i need another pair of headphones in the near future and want to stay in this price range i would probably buy these again,198,104
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i bought these hoping they would stay in my ears while working out they are worse than the standard ipod earphones completely useless,23,105
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,definetely great sound superb clarity even if you take it to it is limits basses and trebles are nicely balanced and a natural sound is obtained there are several buts although the most important one being the difficulty of use the back cable is a mistake and the cable extension connection is always pulling your left ear down not a pleasant feeling when you want to move your head another problem i had is an interesting one one day i saw a cut in the coating of the cable and that got bigger and bigger that coating is supposed to hold the inner cables together but ex81s is made out of play-doh now there is a huge part only with the two inner cables and i can stretch the rest of the coating to cover that part it is that soft,140,106
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i got these yesterday after some glitches in the amazon where is my stuff system i was not sure if i wasn going to recieve it yesterday but i did i used them all last night and most of today and have been great so far one thing i have noticed is a very faint crackling in the left heapphone although it may just be my computer as i havnt noticed it when listening to the ipod or a defect with this set of headphones as several people have already mentioned the ear hooks are a bit large but are still a comfortable fit they just stick out the top a little bit apart from that they have great sound great bass and awsome treble so i give it 4/5 rating good job sony,131,107
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,beware beware first off they sound like craaaaaaap i have heard better sound comming off finger nails and a chalk board the orgianl ipod ear buds put these to shame next the ear hooks coolif your freaking dumbo must be some big eared freaks at sony when they designed these things no i do not have tiny ears these are just some big dang hooks I am not the only one who feels this way keep reading other reviews,79,108
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,overall the mdr-ex81lp is a decent replacement over the apple supplied earbuds that came with my ipod shuffle but too much bass for my taste the midrange is a little weak and vocals suffers the hangers are a bit large for my ears and as such do not fit snug around my ears but they are not falling off after useing them for a couple of hours of listening my ears do not feel fatigued i would have liked the ex81lps to be more neutral sounding but good value for what you pay,90,109
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the headphone line is made from 1 a material that sticks together making them difficult to unravel and 2 a material that falls apart from twisting and otherwise 6 months old and i need to buy a new pair keep looking for another pair,44,110
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,after trying these out for 3 weeks i dislike them for the gym they do not sit in your ear very well if you are running and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose if you are just sitting around they are ok but they still seem to fall out the flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming this means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box when i bought these i thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape but that did not hold true I have tried these along with other sony portable headphones like the mdr-g73lp never buying any more sonys again they always seems to miss something that makes it annoying I shall try buying those over-the-ear koss headphones instead,142,111
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i am not an expert in earphones therefore this review caveat emptor i broke my ipod earphones these are replacements i did not have the orginial ipod earphones to use for comparison i do not have a pair of enclose earphones for comparison either based on comparison with some cheap substitutes very cheap i was using in the interm they sony is definately better the bass is superior the range in the sound is great my favorite feature is sound insulation non-bud style earphones tend not to insulate outside sound very well I have had to turn the sound to maximum in the gym due to the ambient noise however with the sony provides excellent insulation against outside noise while providing clear sound,122,112
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i had ex50 ex70 and ex81 earphone performed about the same i can not notice any difference ex81 had loop around the ear it works pretty good construction on the ex81 is better than ex50 and ex70/71 white one,38,113
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,does this earphone have a detachable extension cord,9,114
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,ok i just got them through my mail well the headphone looking by bright pros can hear any surroundings might be bad because i barely hear car honking at me 30 is not too bad for these headphones easy to use very comfortable cons a bit costly low noise compared to ipod earbuds the chord are diferent length overall i say worth the money,61,115
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the sound is not very loud and clear and there has is no bass at all not worth the money,19,116
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,these headphones sound absolutely claer and dynamic the sound is full and bright the bass not overpowering they are very light and comfortable the asymmetric cord takes getting use to the downside is that every movement of the cord gets transmitted into the earphones so they are great if you are sitting and reading while listening to music not so great if you are excercising,65,117
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,muy contento con mi compra es un producto solo para los que saben con una respuesta muy por encima de todos los productos de sony que he probado en esta categoria confort ya que son casi inperseptibles no molestan usan la resonancia interna del cuerpo para generar un mejor audio reconosco que de primera me decepcione pero despeus de unos minutos se nota la calidad del produto con su sistema de cancelacion del ruido en definitiva una muy buena compra se los recomiendo,83,118
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the title says it all these are not good for small ears they are not adjustable and they will just fall right off with the least movement namely running sound seems fine when the darn things are actually in and on my ears still looking for earbud headphones that will work for me,54,119
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews on these earphones when i took them out of the box and tried them with my ipod i could barely hear anything unless i turned the ipod volume 3/4 up i have to believe they sent me damaged merchandise because these were the worse sounding earphones of all time i immediately sent them back and opted to just stay with my basic ipod phones which seemed 5 star compared to the mdr-ex81lps,85,120
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,great sound very comfortable and easy to use very high quality of sound but not as much base as the shure 2c which i had before,26,121
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i have now owned 2 pairs of these headphones they soind great but they do not last the rubber cord tends to melt away leaving exposed wire after less than 2 months this then will give you a great little shock from time to time eventually you will hear pops and cracks i loved the sound and feel but the quality of manufacturing was just crap avoid these if you can,71,122
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,been using these now for a month and have no complaints they are much better than the stock ipod ear phones and stay in my ear better i use these primarily under my motorcycle helmet and they are perfet for the task the loop holds on well and the rubber gaskets really seal out background noise overall great phones for the price,62,123
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,at first the headphones did not seem to fit right but that was before i discovered the different size of earbuds once i switched to another size the headphones worked great they do not fall out like other headphones and that is great since i use them when i workout i give these headphones a,49,124
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,they sound great however the length of the shafts are too long for my ears after several seconds of a slow jog these little buggers fall right out some manufacturers have adjustable shafts this model does not if you have big ears they will most likely be fine if you are the proud owner of small ears look for other earphones,59,125
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i ordered these headphones because i was looking to improve upon the ipod headphones that come in the package the reviews on the site were great i am extremely disappointed that i wasted my money on these lousy headphones the sound quality is actually worse than the headphones that come packaged with the ipod they are much more likely to become tangled in your bag than the ipod headphones and the silly carrying case that is supposed to prevent tangling is totally ridiculous to even contemplate using not to mention they are very uncomfortable in your ears if i had wanted to have the feeling like i was wearing earplugs i would have gotten the noise-cancelling kind these do not block out any noise at all yet have the uncomfortable feeling of noise-cancelling headphones do not waste your money on these,138,126
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i keep buying this style because they sound so good for the style but the loops just do not fit around me ears right,23,127
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,when can you say listening to rock n roll softly sounded well fact is these phones do not sound as good at peak listening levels yet if you are a careful listener that appreciates nuances then finding that correct volume will immerse you better than any other 40 private listener you have ever heard i own 800 studio phones that these cheap sonys give a pretty good run for the money,71,128
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i am audio purist so as soon as i bought my ipod i chucked the standard ipod headphones and bought the 50 ipod premium ones they had nice highs n mids but the lows kinda tinny well one day they fell outa my ear on the bus and someone stepped on one and broke it overall i was pretty happy with them so i was considering buying them again until i came across these headphones my sister in law bought me them as a present and I am happier than ever they are amazing in every way i have very small ears and the small earbuds fit perfectly and the clip secures them to my ear in case they get a lil tug the bass is very clearly defined because of the special sony magnet that you will only find in these in-ear headphones plus they block out outisde sound due to their ear-plug like shapping as far as in-ear headphones go none in this price range beat these,166,129
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was very happy with these headphones initially sound is pretty good for cost and they are very comfortable to wear having purchased sonys previous in-ear fontopia designs i was very excited to have some that would work well for exercising my previous complaint being the they would fall out of your ears whatever material they are using on these headphones begins to disintegrate about a month after purchase whether this is caused by sweat from working or not i do not know buyer beware my headphones have been reduced to bare wire,92,130
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,flimsy plastic hoops over the ears do not fit snug enough on my smaller ears and are not adjustable at all so they just fall out worse than ear-buds from that standpoint not much low end either it seems there is not much you can do other than keep buying earphones and trying them no retailers let you try them on for obvious reasons i read reviews and they were very positive for this product all around but I am finding reviews on earphones in general do not seem to be very reliable this was my 3rd pair of disapointing earphone products best fit for clip over the ear types I have found so far are the overpriced b o a8s they are a bit heavy and the earbuds are a bit large for my ear-canals but the hoops are adjustable and have decent base a lot to pay at 130 but what are you going to do if i had to do it again I had just buy the clunky over the head hoop type for my situation,173,131
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,the sound quality for a person who does not care that much is excellent way better than the stock phones that came with my mp3 player however i chose these phones because of the wrap around i thought it would be more snug for when I am traveling or working out at the gym i was disappointed to find out that they are not adjustable and they were twice the size of my ears I am 52 and female i guess i have small ears but my friend who is 510 and a guy tried them on and they were still too big why would sony think that there is only one size of ear and why make earphones for ogres weird i sent these back,123,132
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,paid 129 after 30 coupon for signing up for amazonin june 05 amazing sound so far and I am quite impressed by the depth and clarity I have not used them extensively enough to comment on the cord durability i give it 4 stars since I have not had them long enough to experience any issues described by other reviewers yet update 12/18/08 thse earphones are still as good as ever and the cord is still intact thogh it has turned yellow in portions that are regularly in contact with the skin during workout due to the sweat,98,133
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,love these headphones I have tried 5 different earbud type headphones over the last few years for use on my motorcycle and these are far and above the best I have used jabra koss and others and none were as comfortable or sounded as good as these I have owned them for 2 weeks now and ridden a lot with them in windy condiitons no cord disintegraton has be noticed as mentioned in other reviews reccomended without reservation,76,134
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,finally i have found a good replacement for apple earbuds apple earbuds never seem to fit well and would always fall out these earphones have a good fit and stay put sound quality is very good comes with nice carrying case that helps keep the cord straight when not using them,51,135
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these seem pretty good but i am no audiophile and these are the first head phones of this kind I have ever tried seems like good quality for the money although,30,136
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i played around with these headphones as soon as i received them and soon realized that the aluminum shaft between the ear piece and the speaker was much too long the bud itself fits into my ear just fine and i can see how they would be useful in the gym the very reason i picked them up if i wear them as they were intended inside the ear canal then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose i played around with them and realized this problem could easily be fixed with a shorter shaft about half the size if you have large ears these would fit and feel great i consider my ears average in no way are they small the speaker is remotely adjustable swivling a tiny tiny bit bottom line these ear phones would be great if they had about five more ways to adjust them,155,137
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,left earbud failed within 10 hours of use buds would not stay inserted in my admittedly small ear canals so they were worthless for exercising sound not any better than basic buds anyway do not bother with these,37,138
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,after reading reviews for these earbuds i thought here is the answer well they were not they fall out of my ears which may be a blessing in disguise because the sound is underwhelming they are very treble weak sounding earbuds with little full sound i will keep looking,48,139
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,these sony headphones are really great before having themi had to put them back in my ears because they kept coming off and i had to constantly change volume because off the different street noisesbut now with these i never have to change volume because they block almost all the town noise but they do not cover voices it even stop my skateboard noise hand they do not come offi say without a doubt that these are the best i have ha ve ever had an d some of the cheapest,89,140
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i use these for exercise with my ipod I am a recording engineer so I am picky about sound quality these sound great feel comfortable in my ears and provide decent sound isolation without blocking all sound my only slight complaint is that the hooks that go around your ears are a little too big and they do not really work quite as they should i have other similar sony earphones that had a better design in this area great earphones for the money although,82,141
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,the headphones fit alright but not that great i guess you need bigger ears for them the good news they do not fall out and the little rubber things do not fall off and they are white to match the ipod,39,142
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,this head phone works very good heavy sounds are heard very clearly good design and very light give me a style and i do not get tired even if i wear it for half a day,35,143
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,i enjoy running and mountain biking with my ipod and ipod shuffle i wear over-the-ear ear-bud headphones every day and own quite a few sets my current favorites are some inexpensive ones branded phillips although i have seen other companys names on the same model but i have been unable to find them recently so i got these sonys to try big disappointment the sound is really quite poor it is tinny and high almost piercing at higher volumes and totally lacks bass plugging my old earbuds into the same device without adjusting the volume and comparing it to these sonys just underscores how poorly these perform the fit is also lacking when running there is nothing which breaks the revery of hitting your stride like constantly having to shove an earphone back in your ear they hang over your ear like overcooked linguini i could even excuse the poor sound quality if they stayed put for more than 1/4 mile of running i would only give them 1 star but they look kind of nice so i decided to be generous,182,144
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i was looking for a replacement for apple ipod earbuds and these were not it the critical flaw was very poor bass it was almost defective sounding in the instruction it says something like if you do not hear high quality bass place the headphones further in your ear that is a lawsuit waiting to happen even following the inane instructions i could not get the bass much better i returned the headphones,71,145
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,this is the worst earphone pictures i have made i usually do not write reviews but felt the overwhelming need to write this one after reading so many positive reviews about these earphones i decided to pull the trigger and buy it the sound is okay but it was like he shall trying to get these to stay in your ears without sticking all the way in your ear drum get the standard earphones without the loop it will be much better,80,146
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,i was very dissapointed with these earbuds until that is i used the smaller earbuds very good sound definition it has a high bass treble response i am using them for overall listening and as in-ear monitors at my church so far very happy the back ear flaps could be smaller as someone else mentioned earlier get these you will be suprized at how good the sound quality is i was going to buy the shure e4cs but i am so pleased with these i do not think that is necessary good job sony,92,147
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,the headphones have great sound quality and if your ears are the right size fit on you perfectly but if you use them alot they quickly fall apart and break and that is from daily use not from abuse the cord is made out of some fabric that as another reviewer said almost seems to dissolve it is like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips and where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself these seem like headphones that were designed for short short use i got about 2 months use out of them and am extremely mad that this has happened so soon for even 30 it is just not worth your time,139,148
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I am no audiophile but i know how cheap headphones sound like and these sonys sound significantly better first off you need to stick this in your ears properly else you will not get good fidelity sound is generally well-balanced bass is not booming this is good but treble is still a bit overemphasized which leads to crackling typical of cheap phones volume is lower than most cheapos which can mean a lot of things but still acceptable ergonomics are good the buds fit in the ears nicely provides good isolation to outside noise i do not know how comfortable these are for sports since sweat inside the ear canal gets annoying for other things they are pretty good although you are not going to forget you are wearing them it is like wearing silicone earplugs which i do for swimming for a prolonged period of time so it can not be that bad overall a good value but not quite there yet I am not spending 100 for the shures so I am just going to keep looking for my whale I am giving it 5 because it fulfills my expectation of what 30 can get me,187,149
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,well i was completely happy with these until the white material that wraps the cables started to dissolve i do not know if it is because of daily use i used extensively for commuting purpose every day or if it is due to super-powerful sweat doubt that long story short these worked fine for less than four months and now with the white cords falling apart they are completely unusable,69,150
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i originally bought the ex71-sls which had spectacular sound quality and frontal-lobotomy-inspired design i switched to these expecting the sound quality to be lower than the 71s particularly the bass and that has definitely been the case the bass is clearly not as pronounced as the 71s but that is not necessarily a terrible thing had i never heard the 71s i would not have anything to compare these to however the design fit and quality of these is muuuuuuch better than the 71s scale of 1 - 10 the sound quality of the 71s is a 10 and the 81s these are an 8 or so but as for design i would give these an 8 and the 71s a 3 so the nod definitely goes to the 81s,124,151
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i just received these headphones after ordering them a few days ago and it is very disappointing for me to say that I am sending them straight back after paying thirty bucks for a pair of earphones which are listed at 50 i would expect much more than what i got which involved turning up the sound on my mp3 player to nearly the maximum level only to hear tinny distant-sounding music and here i have to note that my player is a creative zen touch which according to the reviews I have read many self-proclaimed audiophiles believe has the best sound quality of any mp3 player currently on the market granted I am no expert but it is funny to think that the included earphones which many of these same audiophiles apparently regard with contempt sounded a thousand times better to me than these more expensive higher quality earphones i guess this is proof positive that you can rarely rely on someone elses opinion personal experience is the real path to knowledge,165,152
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,took a long time to get it in the ear and then it does not stay in ended up returning it to get the white 51s instead at least with the 51s everybody knows how to wear it,37,153
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,i really like the ear buds that come included with apples ipods but wanted something that would sound better and be more durable these failed on both counts on a long flight last week i decided to break these ear buds out they kept falling out of my ears regardless of how far i jammed them in i tried using the two smaller sized nubs which made exactly no difference same with wrapping the cord behind or in front of my head they just kept falling off which would jerk me awake as i was drifting off to sleep since they slipped off after five or so minutes when i was sleeping i can not imagine how awful they would be if used during physical activity i found the sound quality to be fairly abysmal as well there was an omnipresent tinny sound that i constantly heard over the three days that i used them they did a terrible job of blocking out airplane noise despite advertisements to the contrary these were a waste of the 30 msrp i will never use them again meanwhile my search continues for a replacement to apples ear buds,194,154
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i went from sony mdr-ex71sls to mdr-v600s and i had those till they were stolen with these being the replacements i have to say they are of no match with v600s rightfully so these are almost 1/3rd the price and earbuds only they are still good enough to notice that you need would need to change your bitrate from 128 kbps to something higher as the other reviewers have mentioned although they do sound slightly better and more normalize than the ex71s by reducing the bass a bit this may or may not be good for you as some of you may like more bass of which then the ex71s would be better the earclips are of rubberly / plastic material that easily bends and the buds themselves twist making sure that there is a perfect fit much better than the other clipon headphones which are of a hard plastic i like them but I have also tried eshure e2cs which sound much more like my v600s in sound as costs,168,155
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,I have purchased many many headphones over the years from bose to etymotics to shure I have paid anywhere from 15 to 350 for headphones as a drummer I have played with these while practicing to music and they do a great job blocking out extraneous noise while delivering good quality bass and sound i also wear these while riding the train back and forth to work everyday and they are a pleasure to wear i have not tried to run in them so i do not know how well they are for running for the money these are the best value for such high quality out there right now i have a pair of shure headphones that i paid 180 for that have better sound but they tend to keep falling out no matter how much i adjust them i tend to wear the sonys most of the time because of this,145,156
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,maybe it is just me but i was very excited to get these and very disapointed when i had to return them as far as the headphone piece itself goes it seemed fine i tried the different sizes of little nubs and they seemed to be securely in my ears and had good sound however this unit also comes with the plastic piece that fits over year ear i got this model because i run and wanted the extra piece to help keep it secure well maybe it is just me but when the plastic piece was properly behind my ear the buds popped out and when the buds were popped all the way in the plastic pieces were not resting behind my ears correctly had the same frustration as the other reviewer as it ruined my run on the plus side i was very impressed with amazons return process click a few pages online it prints out a pre-paid address label for you and you just mail it they deduct the shipping cost from the return works for me,177,157
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,i had the earlier model ex71sp but the cable got snagged a lot and finally lost sound on one side hopefully the hangers will reduce the effect of snagging the sound on this model has definitely improved the ex71 s bass can be quite overwhelming the ex81s bass is gentler I am hearing details in the soundtracks that i never heard before and I am driving it at lower volume than the ex71 i encode my music at 192kbps with the oog format on my rio karma,85,158
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,i bought this for my grandson to watch dvds and tapes and it still works great he has only 4 so i do not imagine he is very gentle with it the people that are not satisfied expected more out of a low priced unit i bought the cheapest unit i could find and for the money it does exactly what i expected it to do it has great sound great picture and is easy to use and set up,78,0
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i bought two of these units exactly one week apart i liked the first one so much i bought a second one for the family room 6 months later almost to the day the dvd drive on the first unit stopped working i had to take the thing apart to extract the trapped dvd one week later on the second unit thetray began seeing a tape even although none was loaded which meant i could nota real tape so 6 months after buying two combo units i now have one dvd player and one vcr,98,1
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,as advertised works fine shipping was inexpensive but took forever,10,2
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,thewas cleaned and pulled apart and had hair and discs stuck inside the product not as was described,20,3
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was replacing the same unit i had for 15 years already the new one was used and worked just fine arrived as promised by vendor matt larue,28,4
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,press a button or use the remote flip back and forth betweenplayer and dvd easy hookquick and fast loading looks nice front aux port if your lazy just a great buy,36,5
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,this is a good combo player and have used it to record and watch movies both it works very well and i would highly recommend it if you like movies and also has the vcr recorder / player so for any of you with the older movies you will be able to watch also i love it and sure you will too,59,6
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i recieved a product from chicagadgets that was defective i ordered a refurbished toshiba dvd / vcr and when i tried to set it up in my tv system it was nonfunctional i happen to have had the exact same toshiba dvd / vcr and i was trying to replace that older dvd / vcr with the refurbished one they sent from chicagogadgets i reinserted my older dvd / vcr back into my tv system and it worked fine chicagogadgets would not replace the defective product they sent me you have only 15 days to return their products and they charge a reshelfing fee of 15 chicagogadgets should test their products before they send them out to make sure they function properly,114,7
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was looking for a second vcr / dvd for an extra tv we have and chose this unit as it seemed to have good divx support which i was interested in playing with well the divx support has turned out to be rock-solid playing everything I have thrown at it in countless formats burned on dvd-r cd-rw and cd-r it is never failed to decode a file I have moved the unit to our video room and we have been enjoying it ever since it is true the quality of playback of the vcr is not great but it is good enough for my childs videos in addition the remote is not too fancy but the unit has excellent controls accessible from the remote for controlling things like picture size jpeg playback and more,125,8
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,we have been very pleased with our purchase i found reading the previous reviews to be accurate and very helpful very easy to hook-up will work on old television sets dvd andwork wellis more noisy when rewinding we bought this for our children to watch movies and just use the most basic features so it has suited our needs well if looking for all bells and whistles would probably choose higher end model but if looking to stay simple and basic i would choose this model,90,9
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,after less than a year of limited use the picture changes fromto black and white the problem occurs intermittently and it is completely random i did not purchase an extended warranty plan because for something less than 100 it seemed silly but after limited use for something like this to happen just screams out junk to me,59,10
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i really have not had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product for me it was somewhat difficult to set up however i have always had problems setting up vcrs throughout my vcr buying history after consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear the unit appears to work very nicely once you understand the total setup it is quite easy and simple to operate i gave this a 4 star rating because i believe this vcr / dvd combo will do just fine the only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching for the price however i can live with that,116,11
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,i bought this product to replace my old sony slv-d300p dvd / vcr combo thinking that it would be more compatible with my toshiba tv than the sony this was not the case as the remote that comes with this dvd / vcr combo does not control the tv at all there is no way to program the remote to control anything other than the dvd / vcr player if you buy this product be ready to use your tv remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote in addition the user interface of the player is horrible much worse than my old sony i returned this the day after i bought it and exchanged it for the sony slv-d370p which includes a remote to control the tv and has a great user interface i gave this 2 stars because for the few minutes i used it the audio / video quality was fine and the product has divx playback compatibility which was one of the reasons i bought it in the first place,171,12
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,great product and well worth the price if you hook up the component video outlet your dvds look almost like hd,21,13
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,the vcr was broke after 1 week of owning it the company did replace it and i did not have to pat for shipping it back,25,14
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,this nextar gps is great for less than 100 you get 35 inch screen text to speech mp3 player and photo viewer unit is a little slow acquiring gps signal when first powered up and battery life coulld be longer however it comes with a car power plug and an ac power plug and will charge via usb i see a lot of people complaiining about the volume and not being able to hear it i do not have that problem mine is extremely loud and i have to keep it turned off the maximum because it is blowing me away i drive an old toyota 4runner that is 4 wheel drive so i have plenty of road noise anyway i would highly recommend and put it up against anything garmin and magellan make in the 150 200 range,138,0
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,it is 3-in-1 product gps mp3 player and picture viewer i did not use other than gps it is a great product other than 1 it can be slow to update on road it can be annoying if your turns are within 200 feet or less by the time gpss done saying I have already missed the turn at the speed of 20miles / hour 2 it does not get gps signal that easily good value for the price overall,75,1
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,i loved everything about this unit it was super-easy to use quickly responsive provided street names had all the features one could want but we regretfully had to return it after one short trip we soon discovered that when traveling at a faster speed on the open road the volume even at maximum could not be heard over the normal road noise in a honda accord if you are alone in your vehicle no music and just in-town traveling it would be ideal,82,2
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,bought one had to take it back because at full volume i could not hear it got another and still had the same problem now i have a garmin and can hear it fine,33,3
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,i got this gps unit last week and for an entry price range unit i was really blown away by the performance and functionality of this unit this unit only takes about 5 to 10 seconds to acquire satellites and locate my position and i love the ability to select major road as a route option and the ability to navigate by higher level view or zoom in to local streets in the high level view i really like that every street is named so i really know what has around me and i can really see where I am going when i pull off route into a mcdonald the gps recalculate my route in seconds when i get back on the road i have not tried out the mp3 player or the photo viewer yet i am sure it work fine but i really do not need this unit for those function anyhow I have owned and use other navigation products from the tom tom one to mio c220 and even the garmin nuvi 360 i like this gps unit the best this product really exceed my expectation so i highly recommend this product,190,4
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,love this little thing i had one from this company b4 so I am used to how easy it is to use for example when my crew members would try and navigate to my location using many other brands of gps the 1st thing they would ask me is what has the zip code and I am like i do not know why do you need that and they say oh i need to put it in my gps and then the town or whatever please are u kidding me nobody has time for all of that and besides i work in a lot of different places so half the time i would not know the damn zip codes now with this wizard of a tool by default your city is already in there unless your changing it but all you do then is throw in the street name and then the street number it then gives you the list of all the towns in alphabetical order and you just pick it out and it goes no zip code needed this is every bit worth the cash and more,174,5
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,i understand this is an older model but if you are thinking of getting it to save money do not i have the 2008 x3 first day the dash mount broke also it would say waiting for gps signal for 20 minutes once i was in an unfamiliar place when it took very long to find the signal i drove around waiting for it to find one and ended up in a bad part of the city i stuck it out until i could save for a higher-rated brand gps because while planning a trip the night before this gps froze and would notpast the power screen reset button would not change this luckily my friend had a reliable gps i could borrow do not buy this product seriously save for a brand name product that is worth it do your research,143,6
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,this is not the first nextar that i have had this one like my other one is easy to use and has numerous options not seen on other manufacturers units higly recommend,32,7
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,product worked splendidly for the first 12 months almost to the day one year later it would not allow you to get to the address screen to enter your destination called customer service they said since the warranty had expired basically i was out of luck i said i understood that they were no longer required to repair my unit for free i was interested in what the cost would be to repair it no such option they said after the warranty expires nextar does not accept units for repairs if i wanted to try to get it fixed try local computer repair shops in my area never before had i ever encountered a company which absolutely refused to stand behind their product like i said disposable gps nextar never again,129,8
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,nice compact gps but touchscreen does not work when temp is above 75 degree and it is only two years old when it worked it was a really nice gps showing distance and time to designation and current time map direction was very easy to understand and unit is very easy to operate volume is a little on the low side battery lasted only 15 minites when it was new i would like to have this unit repaired but nextar only offer exchange program for 7999 same cost as a new unit,91,9
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,unit does not even work and nextar will not resopond to requests for a replacement or repair my suggestion would be to spend a little more for a real gps that works,32,10
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,2.0,negative,let me start off by saying i like this gps it has all the feature i like and i really can not complain about it while it was working however i would have to say buyer be warned i had mine for a year and just short of the warrantee it died one day it worked the next it would not go passed the splash screen i would say it was my bad luck but in researching it online i found quite a few others had the same problem some shortly after they purchased it nextar has a lifetime exchange program but the price is about 140 which is more then i paid new they originally told me they would fix it but the supervisor turned it down because i lack a good reason standing by there product is not a good enough reason it is also my understanding that even under warrantee nexter requires you to pay for return shipping on your repair both way i caution you to research this unit before considering a purchase,178,11
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,1.0,negative,I have own the nextar x3-t for 2 years now and will never own another nextar product again no support no updates nothing had to go out and buy a tom tom while on vacation to disneyworld so i could find my way unit is slow you can get where you are going before it locks in on a satellite no map updates my maps are over 4 years old and nextar has no plans to update unit also locks constantly have to keep pressing the reset button in order to get it to half-way function buy something else i would purchase this unit if it was 5 dollars,112,12
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,i bought a x3 - 08 nextar i deliver flowers and twice a year phone books so i run across many new streets that are not on city maps this unit is fantastic for finding them i learned to use it in just a few hours sure saves lots of time andi had read other reviews that said this gps goes into sleep mode and freezes the display i have not run across this but decide to correct this problem ahead of time could not find any spot to change sleep mode very satisfied,91,13
Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,4.0,positive,easy to learn a first gps as good as tom tom 130s and garmin 255w both 35 screen i paid 8995 tax if you can get it under a 10000 it is a steal,34,14
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,after being a photography buff for over 20 years i wanted to protect the surface of my new rebel xsi while the armor fits relatively nice it hinders lens changes and blocks the sensor which allows the lcd to display even after cutting that part of the armor i still found it negativley affecting the way i shoot photographs i did like the lcd protector that came with it but it is a high price to pay for that it is off my camera and i will not be putting it back on i would not recommend this product for purchase,98,0
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,it fits and works great the only thing which is a small issue is sometimes it blocks the light sensor and in turn shuts off the lcd screen but that is only when the cover gets moved a little in that area,41,1
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,i have a cannon rebel t3i i love my camera and want to protect it but this did not fit at all it is a good concept but it did not work out i should have know seeing that it was only 10 bucks i simply threw it out,46,2
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,yes I am one of those persons walking around with a silver camera xsi no i never have liked silver cameras but i got it from my sister so it was not entirely my fault i mean it is almost better than nothing anyway i got this armor not to protect my camera but because it looks a whole lot better than bare silver granted it does not make the camera awesomely black but at least i can say i tried without braking the bank it does add to the grip a bit as well so if you liked silver then found out after the fact that it was not really in this is a good way to cover your mistake trust me there are not a whole lot of people out there dying to buy your silver camera or trade for black so go head and at least try it,144,3
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,this body armour does the job of protecting my rebel xsi but i have a few complaints in installing it one rubber piece snapped because it is really skinny and was extended too much as i was fitting the body armour on my camera it is the piece that goes between the flash and the dial it is really skinny and fragile overall the armour is not snug enough i was expectibg it to really be a snug fit arond the camera body it is not the case it is a little too loose and you feel you do not have a good grip of the camera because of it the bottom piece holds to the rest of the body armour with rubber tabs these tabs keep coming out and i have to constantly put the tabs back in place feels really cheap but it is inexpensive after all the lens hood protector pice does not fit a 77 mm as advertised the bottom pice has to be completely taken out to replace the battery so yes inexpensive but you get what you pay for,184,4
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i bought this as a gift for a friend thedoes not fit the camera well and it was a tad bit embarrassing to watch as the recipient struggled to get it onto his xsi it also made the camera a dust magnet,44,5
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,i am more than happy with my purchase of the camera armour there is no better way to keep scratches and dings from a camera and the price was definitely right,31,6
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,the products company said it best you will get a case for your 20000 cell phone but not your 150000 camera that convinced me i got this and it is great the fit is a little loose but it is fine it will protect it way more than before buy this if you want a good case at a decent price,59,7
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,the fit on the camera is a bit awkward but once you get it on it covers a lot i have a canon t1i and the armor covered the light sensor plus the lens cup on the front blocks the flash if you use it,45,8
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i bought this for my girlfriends camera after much difficultly we finally got the thing on the camera only to find the armor blocked access to some features and would not stay tight around the body it sounded like a goodbut the final product is shoddy and not worth the money we have already thrown it out,58,9
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,this does fit my canon xsi quite well a little bit tricky installing but now it is on lens installation was not hard either i really just wanted something to protect the body from bumps scratches a previous post complained about having to remove it to replace the battery personally it seems quite easy to remove the bottom plus my battery tends to get several hundred pics so i do not see it to be a huge deal i do not see myself using the rubber lens hood for less than 10 i think it is a bargain,93,10
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i purchased the camera armor through amazon for my canon xsi last year at the same time that i bought my new camera i have been very disappointed in the camera armor it does not fit my camera well the armor makes it difficult to operate some of the features on the camera the extensions on bottom piece easily slip out of the slits in the main part of the armor that are intended to hold it in place the bottom piece of the armor falls off easily this is aggravating the part that would protect the lens is bulky and i have not been using it some areas of my camera specifically the led screen and the pop-up flash as well as the buttons and dial are not protected at all by using the armor further the rubbery material seems to attract dust i have put up with this product for almost a year and now i am looking for something else that will be easier to use and will protect my camera better,175,11
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,when i ordered this camera armor i knew that it was not popular but the price was reduced to under 700 and i thought i would gain if any part of it was usable alas i found no part worth using every part either falls off too easily makes camera use awkward and/or contributes nothing to protect the camera i believe that this product was honestly conceived and the best materials were used in construction it just does not work for me i ordered it to give it a try without high expectations i have no regrets,96,12
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,the armor does what it claims to do that is to protect your camera with a rubber coating that gives it a better grip just like having a nose mask for your car this product covers your camera with a nice protective shield all the buttons function normally except for covering the button labels so get to know your cameras buttons a little before putting on the armor the lense hood is too small for my canon 28 - 135 usm lense the only surprise was that i have to remove the base covering to replace the battery I am thinking of buying a second one for future use because i plan to keep my t1i for a long time i give it 4 stars because it is not tight fitting and you have to adjust it a little on occasion,137,13
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,2.0,negative,does not have a tight seal sometimes the cover interferes when you try to attach the lens feels terrible in hand do not really offer much protection the bottom part is hard to install the lens hood is unusable because it is impossible to attach it on to the lens felt like i paid 30 dollars for a small piece of low quality rubber do not buy,64,14
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,this product has given me the freedom to carry my cannon camera in all conditions without having to use a camera bag the lens protector is excellent as are the other armor protection elements,34,15
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,nice product hope it will save my camera if i ever drop it it was easy to install and does not block any functions,24,16
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,the armor was easily installed on the eos rebel ti1 camera i have it works great and protects the vital parts of the camera I am througly satisfied with the product i have body armor on other cameras i have and found that it is a very good investment the armor makes the camera easier to grip and if you should drop it the armor provides some degree of impact protection,70,17
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,camera amour is excellent protection for my canon xsi the screen cover may be the best part of it one design flaw the lens hood does not stay on the lens unless you are using a filter otherwise an excellent product,40,18
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this it interferes with the lense change does not work well with the flash the lense protector makes it difficult if not impossible to manually focus the screen protector is the only think that was worth a darn i paid 40 at wallymart i promptly returned it for my money back,55,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,bought this to organize all our wrapping paper we have it hanging on the back of our bedroom door so we can not access the slots for storing bags not a design flaw just in the way we chose to use it if you hang the bag in the closet you will have access to the bag storage slots,58,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a superb organizer for storing gift wrap and ribbons packing tissue and tape by hanging this stuff in a closet i have freed up bureau space and eliminated the crushing of wrapping paper and gift cards my only criticism is that i wish it were bigger i bought a second organizer just to hold the christmas season themed stuff it is sturdy and i recommend it,67,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i buy way too much wrapping paper i think it is all the pretty colors so my house has been a mess of paper stacked in corners bags stuffed in the back of a closet and boxes of bows thankfully i found this product the organizer is super space-efficient you hang it in your closet and it takes about the same amount of space as a winter coat there are compartments for paper bows ribbon scissors tape bags and flat paper even completely full as mine is it is sturdy and holding up fine however it is not going to hold everything the description says up to 12 rolls but i was only able to fit 8 large size rolls of wrapping paper i still give it five stars although because who really needs more than 8 rolls of wrapping paper bottom line this product is so much better than the plastic organizers you can buy at stores like wal-mart or target i plan to buy some for family members as gifts this christmas,173,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the picture is very deceiving it is actually a lot smaller and can hardly hold anything it can maybe hold 3 roles of wrapping paper on each side and one or two bows in each little bag,37,3

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,used as christmas presents for my daughters and they find them to be invaluable helps them stay organized,18,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,does the job but not as pictured or described cheap material much smaller way smaller than pictured even on the packaging not worth the money priced way too high for the size and quality,34,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love this holds so much and tamed my mess,9,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the large pockets on this organizer are all on one side so that when it is loaded up with wrapping paper it leans forward from the hanger and not straight up and down as pictured i bought two of these and put them back to back which helps somewhat but it does not balance out on it is own,58,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,yeah the jokari was on me what a bunch of garbage it did not have the strength to hold any tube wrapping,21,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointing the pictures makes thislook a lot bigger than it is and it does not hold items very well i would not recommend this,28,16

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,best purchase ever sturdy holds quite a bit,8,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,this is ok everything kind of falls out of it when it is hanging in the closet with coats I am selling mine at a garage sale and buying something else it seemed like a really goodand it is served it is purposes for a couple years but i want my organized closet back,52,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this product is so cheaply made it would not even hold the wrapping paper without flopping over while hanging,23,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,product does not hold as much as described and is extremely small only good for half sized rolls of wrapping paper and super tiny bows and ribbons,27,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very cheaply made not sure how long it will last holds about 8 - 10 rooms of paper back pockets hold some gift bags and tissue paper front pockets were ok for small rolls of ribbon or small bows I shall keep it just because i do not want the headache of processing a return,52,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,please save yourself the time and money and do not bother small small small look again not worth it,19,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is great it is got many pockets and seems pretty solid however the ribbon compartments are not very sturdy so sometimes they fall out,25,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to hold my christmas wrapping paper and supplies and this did the job i was able to fit 6 or 7 fairly thick rolls of wrapping paper in it as well as all my tags tapes pens tissue paper and scissors,46,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,looks much roomier and better maid in the picture i kept it because it does soulve an immediate problem but i will be changing after the first of the year,30,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,cheaply made does not hold much does not appear like pictured,9,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,we ordered this to organize our wrapping supplies it feels a little flimsy and i hope it holds up it is hard to get the bows to stay in their designated boxes i also can not get some of my longer rolls of wrapping paper mostly from costco to fit overall i like it,53,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,so many large pockets no more digging for my gift wrapping supplies,11,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,happy i purchased this product i bought command strips to hang this on the back of my closet door i do wish the bags on the front were a bit bigger and had zippers on the tops instead of being open in the front otherwise I am satisfied since it gets the job done,53,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,when i read the description of this product i knew i needed to have it due to my love of always having gift wrap and all things related to gift giving this organizer hardly takes any room in my closet and keeps my gift wrap nice and tidy as to where it was everywhere before the pockets are very nice and forgiving with different items i keep my ribbon and tape in the pockets but can keep many things other than that for the price this is a great buy that i highly recommend for all the people who love to organize perfect for christmas time and all year round,110,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is the best i have a small apartment and this really helps me save on space and keeps things off my closet floor it is sturdy and has a lot more pockets than i realized awesome product,37,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ripped as soon as i opened it very very thin and poorly made returned,15,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,put it in and set it up in less that 5 min made out of decent material but i would not put more that 7 - 10 pounds in it if you are really into wrapping you should look for something more durable,39,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product is great for holding all of your birthday wrapping paper items i packed it full the hook still holds it everything an looks good,26,35

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this thing i had a whole dresser full of ribbons bows cards gift bags and wrapping paper that i packed into this thing minus one bag of bows but seriously i had waaaaay too much now everything is easily accessible and visible so i know not to buy any more bows and can easily wrap a present my favorite part are the dedicated scissor and tape pockets on the side because i was always scrambling for these two tools,80,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,really like them i used 2 to organize wrapping iarea works well would recommend it,15,42

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,helps me to organize my wrappers ribbons gift boxes gift cards and small bags in one space hanged behind my door however i do not really like the quality of the sewing and the way the compartments are designed they do not seem to close properly due to the bad fitting and workmanship things may fall out so i would say thisis overpriced due to it is poor workmanship butwise i m sold i love to organize,78,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does not hold rolls of wrapping paper well not balanced,10,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,it is amazing how much stuff you can get in this organizer and hanging over the door of a spare room closet really makes the best use of your space i will definitely buy another one in the future,39,49

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i am not crazy out it quite flimsy and does not hold very much,13,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,horrible only 6 rolls in and it hangs lopsided the velcro straps do not even come close to holding the rolls in as they are located towards the bottom half poor design and cheaply made even the hanger is cheap so thin waste of money,44,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i bought this and it is companion gift bag organizer to get my wrapping out from under my bed and hang it up in a utility closet we have it worked great i do not have a crazy amount of wrapping paper rolls although i would say it maxes out at about 4 - 6 depending on the diameter of your rolls,58,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the product arrived on time but there was no built-in hangar even although it is described as such there is a series of snaps at the top where a hangar could be placed and removed but the snaps could not fit around any closetand i do not have a hangar wide enough to fit the whole top width then the compartments shown in the middle of the organizer are just cheap plastic walls with no white finishing stitching / fabric as indicated in the picture the result is a much cheaper design than what is pictured and described when purchasing there is no way to secure those compartments closed and no stiffness to the plastic to remain closed themselves i will likely be returning this product,124,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,goodbut it does not hold the longer rolls,10,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the gift wrap organizer the plastic was cheap and flimsy this product is just poorly designed i placed 6 rolls of paper equally divided and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper i plan on returning it,57,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,one thing to note as that depending on how much paper you include the holder does not stand up straight in the closet,23,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,works great we needed to clean up the disorganized mess we had,13,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,as advertised made my closet more user friendly,8,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was terrible and cheap and it did not even come with a hanger to hang it up with it went in the trash easier than shipping it back,29,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ended up in the trash do not waste your money,11,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not wste your money too small and extremely poor quality,10,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,did not hold as much as i was hoping jumbo rolls are too tall but it is nice to have it hanging out if the way,25,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it does not come with a hanger we tried using one of our hangers but it was tooheavy hanger would break or bend we tried putting 2 hangers to support the weight but the buttons will not close a sturdy thick metal hanger should be included with this product,47,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,once you put wrapping paper rolls in the side pockets they fall forward there needs to be a rigid back to this thing it is really junk and does not work at all,32,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does an ok job holding the paper rolls although it is a bit unweilding to get in and out of a closet the pockets on the front are virtually useless pick another product,33,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really like this organizer and i really like how little space it takes up it is about as wide as a hanging shoe organizer it sits in the back of my hall closet and i like that when i pull the whole thing out to get what i need it does not dump anything out of it is compartments the compartments are spacious and numerous and i like that i no longer have a crumpled mess of unusable wrapping paper or a hard storage system taking up space under the bed or closet,92,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i received another brand as a gift at christmas and could not find it to order another so i ordered this one the snaps constantly unsnap and it falls in the closet from the weight the other one i own does not do this would not buy this one again,50,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i love wrapping gifts and making them beautiful for the receiver but i have always disliked having to store wrapping paper and supplies in awkward containers that hide under the bed or in the attic this works well hanging from the door in my home-office where it is easy to get to and out of the way i like having everything i need in one place and not having to worry about the kids getting into it or it taking up valuable office space,84,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i wish i would have read the reviews i would not have paid more than 5 for this if I had seen it in a store and here i paid 20 it is so cheap i did not even bother putting anything in it i just just printed out the return receipt other than it being cheap it definitely shows a hanger at the top yet when i took this out of the package i saw it folds down at the top and snaps with nothing to hang it on I am extremely disappointed and mad at myself for buying it,96,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not the highest quality product the plastic is very thin and flimsy but still functions and is very useful for getting organized,24,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was cheap and i returned it there was no way to even hang it and the material was not up to my expectation,24,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i have not hung it yet but it appears that it will serve it is purpose well it is smaller than i expected but that was reported by a previous buyer so i was not disappointed,34,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this gift wrap organizer there are pouches behind the place where you would stand your tubes of wrapping paper that do not seem to serve a purpose and the front pouches for bows and such would work better if they had velcro to keep them closed but they do not so it all falls out,57,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,terrible it fooled me because it looked like it was a pretty awesome product but i put two medium size rolls in it and it fell over it a silly design it would need to have wrapping paper spots on the other side to even it out,47,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,at first i really could not tell if it was worth it but to my surpise it holds all my ribbons wrapping paper boxes and more great work horse,30,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it is ok for everything but the wrapping paper it leans forward like the paper is going to fall out of it,21,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i did not request a refund or return thisin fairness to the seller this does not work at all the pockets do not hold stuff at all and are really terrible it does not sit up-right like it shows and i really wish i had not ordered mine i would never ever had done so and i hope that you will take my advice,63,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,thislooks much better in the picture than in person the unit arrived without built-in hanger as advertised or any instructions very disappointed because i specifically purchased to hang in a closet,33,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very flimsy cheap material i do not even use it and sadly took too long to return it my bad the picture presents a highly organized tool but the reality is that it barely holds anything and everything droops hideous piece of junk,42,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the description and photograph showed a hanger at the top there was none i returned it and found one elsewhere to meet my needs,24,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,there should be a place to put wrapping paper on the other side too for balance but there is not seems common sense how are gift bags supposed to equalize the weight of wrapping paper tubes not very intuitive the areas for storing ribbons and bows are flat and shapeless it does not protrude like the picture if you store this in a full closet your ribbons and bows will probably get crushed or wonky,73,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,first of all mine does not have a hanger it has velcro which means it hangs horizontally and takes up way too much space instead of thinking i could slide it in as if it were clothes secondly it is not secure just flimsy open spaces that do not close so things just fall out do not waste your time and effort trying to organize with this it is not functional and costs too much,71,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love love love love this good quality plastic strong enough to hold all my wrapping supplies i am finally organized,20,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is actually the second one of these I have owned i do not remember where i purchased the first one and after many years of use it broke the plastic on this one seems a little thinner but i still think I shall get extended use from it the storage is arranged very well there are pockets on the back where i store tissue paper and gift bags there are side pockets just behind the wrapping paper rolls where i store gift tags and shrink wrap bags it even has special pockets for scissors and tape,94,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,great to have in the closet for all my present making supplies it actually fits alot inside more than i thought definitely worth it,24,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is perfect for all my wrapping paper i liked the back pockets on the unit as well between this and the gift bag organizer from jokari everything has a place now,32,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this is a waste of money made with cheap materials when i got this home it was already ripped i should have read the comments before purshasing do not waste your money,31,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was in such a rush to get the gift wrap supplies organized that i bought the one organizer that i thought would fit the bill i received it today and preceded to fill it up i am surprised that amazon would sell something so flimsy disappointed in the poor quality of the cheapo plastic smaller than the posted photo and does not hold much at all i have a feeling that it may start to rip on it is own as it hangs there i will then return it,89,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i does not match up with one i previously had it wore out this one has no place for long rolls of paper and i find those pocikets are about useless for anything,33,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this i only wish there was a larger pocket at the top like the 3 at the bottom i also wish it carried more wrapping paper only 12 rolls,30,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this organizer is just right for the average family there has room for multiple rolls and spools of ribbon with slots on one side for bags and small boxes unless you are a real pack-rat this organizer should suit you needs,39,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,daughter wanted it for her birthday she had picked it out she has not said that she does not like it nice,20,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was surprised at the quality on this the hanger is not plastic and it swivels easily the compartments are roomy enough for about eight rolls of wrapping paper i love the fact that i can hang it in the back of the closet where it is hidden away i figure if it tears a little over the years I shall just make pretty flowers out of coloredtape to strengthen i think this is perfect for my needs highly recommend,80,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer is wonderful i have it hanging in a closet and it is very handy to go to when looking for gift wrap ribbons and more i think I am going to get a couple more for x-mas paper,40,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,barely holds anything without squishing it and it leans over taking up more space would not recommend do not waste your money,21,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this gift wrap organizer is a little on the flimsy side but there are no tears or rips in it and it is convenient to just being hung up in a closet when minot in use i do love it because all my wrapping needs are placed within this organizer,50,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,buyer beware when i finally received this via the mail it was jammed into a mail slot and appeared much smaller than it does in the picture it is very cheaply made and the reinforcements you see on the middle pouches the white strips on the openings are not present i will be inquiring about a full refund for this,61,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really use this alot i wish it had more space for tissue paper and gift bags it would be nicer if it had snaps on the ribbon pockets if you do not have everything distributed properly it hangs forward,39,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this picture looks great however this is made of the same plastic that the throw away bag it comes in is the best thing i can say for this is that it was returnable even although i lost shipping money,40,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it seems sturdy enough so far i like the different pockets it was a little difficult to figure out where everything goes,22,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i was not able to put any wrapping paper in this organizer it is mainly meant for gift bags bows and smaller items i was upset since the picture advertises that it can hold wrapping paper again it is made out of cheap plastic but it at least can hold some things,50,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i hate it when they send a similari did not get samefirst it was black and second it did not have a hanger built in on top it has 5 button snaps instead annoying,38,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it has enough room for most of my gift wrap materials and it does not take up much space i like it,21,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,thisis cheaply made the plastic is very thin and flimsy the opening to the areas to hold ribbon is a cut in the plastic after use i am certain this opening will continue to rip additionally the area to hold the rolls of wrapping paper is not adjustable therefore the rolls fall forward and make the entire organizer fall to one side i would not recommend this product especially at this price point i have since purchased another at half this price and it is made with thick plastic and compartments with zippers,95,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,made from really cheap plastic really really cheap plastic the hook hanger head is not curved long enough so when you hang it it may fall off your rod this will work better if hangs flat against a wall if you have tall wrapping paper this will not fit in your regular standard closet it could work on the back of a door,60,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does what it is supposed to do but it is very flimsy and most of the compartments are not as roomy as i was expecting definitely not worth 20 bucks,29,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,if you are in the market for a gift wrap organizer i encourage you to move past this low qualitydo not buy i would barely pay 5 for this organizer it was so incredibly cheaply made and nothing like the picture suggested it is tiny and the pockets will not hold anything because they have these gigantic slits in them presumably for easy access but they do not hold ribbons and other wrapping accoutrements well because everything just falls out very poor design and another cheap made in china product,88,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I am trying to organize my space and thiswas a very big disappointment it fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging the organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package the retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer the areas for bows allow bows to fall out the area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn actual use of theis difficult replacing items after use tore the assigned compartment even more I am looking for another storage solution this one did not work,129,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product cheaply made and very flimsy i pulled this out last night excited to start organizing and saw that 2 of the front pockets had rips across the plastic would not recommmend wasting money on this,40,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i purchased this to organize scattered christmas wrapping supplies unfortunately this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life it also does not work well at all once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it does not flop around the hanger also can not take a lot of weight on it i tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section it would not stay up and hung kind of lopsided right now it is laying down and barely holding it is contents I am going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer i would not recommend this to anyone,128,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed i bought one of these exact style of organizer over 10 years ago for 1100 it had served me well for this long and just recently the plastic began to tear so i felt that it would be a good value to get another one this one that arrived that i paid twice as much for is so cheap and flimsy that i doubt it will last two years the plastic is so thin that it will not even stand up straight enough to support rolls of wrap and this is while it is hanging i have to tie a scarf around the whole thing to keep the rolls of wrap from hanging in all directions the slide pockets in the back are oddly small and i can not even fit my sheets of gift tags in them this was a complete waste of money and i wish i had not bought it keeping my old one for when this one falls to pieces do not waste your money,166,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,maybe i was not realistic purchasing thisfor the price i did not expect it to be attractive or super high quality but i did not expect it to be as cheaply constructed as it was either it is a very thin plastic that rips easily the pockets that are designed to hold bows have the opening on the front sort of like a portable tissue pack so you when you hang it they are not on the top and the bows can fall out plus the weight of the wrapping paper rolls and i only loaded in 5 it was not like i tried to fill it pull the entire thing forward when it is hung so the plastic starts to tear and every time you touch it things fall out greatpoorly designed do not waste your money on this one,136,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a great thing for getting wrapping paper contained along with all the other things that go with it the organizer is two sided so you can store on both sides and hand it in a closet and access either side such a great,46,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer works very nice with everything you would have for wrapping packages very neat and more sturdy then expected you still have to be careful with the plastic compartments they hold just about everything you can think of very well saves space too,47,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i just received it today i was able to fit in 5 rolls of wrapping paper that i had all my cards tape lots of bows few rolls of ribbons i had scissors everything there was space for everything it is hanging in my closet and everything is accessible easily since i just got it today i do not know about the longevity when i first opened it i thought the front pockets had tears in them but actually that is the opening to access the pockets,85,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i used to have a tall plastic container for my gift wrapping supplies while it was slightly better than storing all of my wrapping items in paper bags it left me more frustrated than anything extra long wrapping paper did not fit bows got squished you get thei have just organized all of my supplies in this hanging organizer and i am so impressed it holds everything even that too tall wrapping paper the mountain of gift bags that i have acquired now have a home on the back of the organizer i used a 3 m hook to hang the organizer on the inside of the coat closet door i plan to check out other organizing items from this company 11914 update looks like the reviews are quite mixed about this product I have had mine since early 2011 and it is still working great i think that hanging it as described in the initial review really helps decrease the wear and tear on thei agree with other reviewers that the materials to make this product could be improved upon maybe something canvas but I am still happy with it as is,192,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i had the previous model it wery well made with fabric netting and i love it needed one more found it is now made only in plastic ordered it amazon sent it quickly the thing looks and feels like a cheap thing i would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape or hang it outside on a hot day but here is the really big problem it is missing the cardboard stiffeners that this cheap version needs to make the plastic compartments have a usable shape yeah assembly is required but the stiffeners are not in the package so i notified amazon i needed a replacement the new one arrived lightning quick it has no stiffeners either theis useless and i have had it so i am just returning it for a refund i can not see re-ordering theobviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces i am not a happy camper,166,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,shipped extremely fast greatfor organizing gift wrap stuff which was what i purchased it for would be even better if it could hold more than 1 roll of gift wrap on each side in their respective pouches other than that a great product,48,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product met all of our needs the storage is extensive for the size of the product and it is organized well the fact that you can place this in a closet and have it take little room is just great all in all this product is recommended to anyone with lots of gift wrapping items and needs to store them in a small space,64,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,get rid of the clutter and get this awesome thing i had one of those under-the-bed rubber maid things before buying this and it was awkward and clumsy and everything was always a mess inside i love thisyou can take it out of the closet and lay it out on the table or bed and everything is easily accesible you can take it anywhere you need to or just leave it in the closet where it takes up minimal space and access what you need in a snap there are pockets for everything buy it,97,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i bought the jokari gift wrap organizer amid much scorn from my family for my consumer habits but now everyone at my house is so pleased i went ahead and made the investment this organizer is similar to one of those closet shoe organizers only this one works it is flat made mostly of clear plastic and hangs off the integrated hanger to fit in your coat closet the front of the organizer is flat with two long vertical pockets on either side which hold about 4 rolls of wrapping paper each between these two wrapping paper pockets are three small pockets which hold ribbons gift tags cards scissors and more on the back of organizer are three somewhat larger pockets which you can use to hold gift bags and similar larger flattish items all of our christmas and birthday wrapping items are stored hanging flat in an easily accessible closet the translucent plastic ensure that you can easily find what you need if you have a coat closet that can handle one more thin object on a hanger and are looking to store 6 to 8 rolls of wrapping paper and would not mind some related items with them i highly recommend this hanging organizer,203,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love thisit has saved so much space in my closet and made it easier to find wraping paper and more no complaints,24,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this product tore the moment i took it out of the box i read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I had simply be more ginger with it it practically ripped to the touch it was impossible to even unfold it let alone put anything in it without the plastic tearing at the folds or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself it is too small for my purposes as well but that is subject to personal needs i will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them overall the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it did not last a half second upon arrival 20 down the drain,136,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i am very pleased with my newly acquired ability to organize all of the stuff that was in bags piles and more i am fortunate to have a perfect spot in my basement to hang the gift wrap organiizer and appreciate it is usefulness great find,44,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,purchased this during a recent reorganization of the closets at my home this works much better than the previous organizer i had it saves floor space since it can be hung in a closet and has plenty of room for rolls of paper bags bows tissue paper scissors and more overall I am really happy with this organizer,56,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i have had this product for over a month now and it is great it fits really well in my closet and holds a descent amount of wrapping paper it also holds bows and there is even a place on the back to put gift bags and cards i highly recommend this product it definitely helped to free some space,60,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the plastic on this product was ripped when it arrived it is very cheaply made definitely overpriced for the quality,20,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it has a great design but the quality of materials is seriously lacking the clear plastic started ripping in one area as i unfolding it most of the plastic seems just about to rip if given any tension also the velcro does not hold very well,45,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really love this product and if i could give it 4 and a half stars i would i wish the material was more eco-friendly but i bought it anyway the only real problems are lack of accommodation for large tall rolls of ribbon the tape compartment fits only the smallest tape dispenser does not fit a normal 3 m gift wrap tape dispenser and the card pockets are too small otherwise the design is great and i like it much more than the rubbermaid giftwrap bin we used previously versatile storage options under the bed in the closet free standing are a plus,102,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is a little flimsy in construction but i can put up with this as it does a nice job of organizing all my wrapping paper and more i am very happy with this,35,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not an expensive product but it has held up very well for the low price it does not hold as much as it says it will but what does i have been much more organized since buying it and am planning to buy another since i reuse bows and ribbon and need the storage,56,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i think this is great i love that it hangs up in a closet does the job i need it to do perfectly so glad i bought it,28,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,pay attention to product dimensions appears to be larger than it is the rolls of wrapping paper in picture must be tiny rolls other than it is size it is an ok organizer it sets up easily and is easy to access,42,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,absolutely amazed at how well this works we use it all the time,13,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,very cheaply made thin metal and easily scratchable,8,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i did not use it for about a month after i bought it when i first took it out of the box i noticed a crack in the lid handle washer on the underside of the lid did not look like a problem by the time i went to use it the packaging was long gone the first time i used it i noticed the lid did not fit properly and was deformed when i picked it up by the handles a big piece of the left handle broke off in my hand the function as a skillet was ok but it was literally falling apart in my hands unfortunately i could not return it as all the packaging was gone,117,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,beware this is junk knob on lid will not secure consequently lid spins around anytime it is handled dangerous after spending a lot of time i decided this looked like a good deal and wanted this large size so this was very disappointing to say the least it was printed in large letters on outer box china yep disgusting returning for sure so do not bother who needs this aggravation,74,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,so far I am very pleased with this product it is large enough that i can cook an entire breakfast in it that is eggs sausage and hash browns i also use it to make casseroles and it is great for that the pan is well balanced and the heat evenly distributed the glass lid is vented which is the main reason i bought it the pan itself can not be washed in the diswasher but the non-stick surface makes it a breeze to clean you can wash the glass lid in the dishwasher if you prefer but it s not that hard to wash by hand either the price is also reasonable and after my nearly 200 electric top name skillet started malfunctioning after less than three years i decided to replace it with this one and I am so glad i did,139,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,worked great for all of our needs would buy again if i needed another makes excellent fried chicken nice product,20,5

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,the first time i tried to use the skillet the electric power plug would not stay in the socket even when i held the plug the pan would only heat a little although it was set to 425 the power plug does not have incremental degree numbers so one would never be able to set the exact heat needed since the plug does not fit tightly enough to heat the pan is worthless stay away from this skillet it is a dud,81,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i bought thistook it out of box and the lid handle was chipped and the left handle was cracked in half amazon replaced it for more and i received it the next day and the replacement was broken in the same places also the plug did not even fit into the skillet properly it just slid right back out will not ever buy this brand again and i will not recommend this to anyone,76,12

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the handle on the top falls off it is not safe at all,12,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,teribble product stay away right away it seemed to heat in hot spots and could barely cook over 250 now just one month old it has stopped heating all together terrible product called the company and received an ra but have to pay to ship it back to them i would avoid this product like the plague as cheap as it is made do not really want to spend more to send it back so it cost us 3500 to use it maybe 5 times,86,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,absolute junk got about ten uses tops out of it before the cheap element on the bottom burned out and cracked buyer beware went back to using my old 7 year old one made by a reputable company i knew the second i opened it up that it would be garbage by the weight of it this thing was made so cheaply and the longevity shows in the quality of manufacture my old one weighs twice as much and is twice as thick all around,85,19

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,this was great for my classroom i did not want to spend a lot of money for an electric skillet this was large enough for my classroom needs,28,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,this is very big that is a plus it does not cook fries so well but does wonders with chicken big enough to cook 10 chicken legs at a time laughing out loud and i cooked enoughsausage / tater tot covered in cheese dish to feed 9 people and had left overs so i love it the black handle for the lid had a small piece broken on it but did not hurt the way it attached and the legs are kinda rough not smooth and polished so i was disappointed in that especially when it cut my finger but all in all it is good so I am gon na keep it,104,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the skillet is nice but the glass lid was broke,10,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i got this at an amazing price so i really can not complain it is light but provides amazing warmth and comfort my only discomfort is that the feathers come out from the comforter so getting a duvet cover would be a good,42,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was a little weary when getting this because usually the gold box items are not too great but i am so pleased with this purchase the blanket is warm but not too hot and is so comfy i love the softness of it and the brownis very nice i wish they still had them for sale because i would get another,63,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is a very thin and light weight comforter much thinner than expected but the price was right looks very nice on the bed it takes a few weeks for the wrinckles to come out shams are standard size even with the king set good buy,46,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was hesitant to buy these at first when i saw it in the gold box but then i said why the heck not my hesitation was due to the fact that i had way too many comforters however these were the first that i ever bought for myself the other ones were given to me as gifts this comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time i still need an extra blanket as usual since i can get very cold but it is a lot better than my old comforter like some other reviews said the pillow shams are pretty small but it is fine for smaller pillows a word of advice most likely your comforter will arrive extremely and i mean extremely staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box the solution i have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity so be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy,187,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter in the olive shade and it is gorgeous it is also soft light and very warm n cozy the husband n i love it sadly however the cats at least one of em do not this thing is loaded w / static if you touch it in the middle of the night you can see blue sparks my lil furry guy was acting all weird and did not want to jump up in bed w / us per usual when he finally did he stood at theof the mattress i unknowingly pulled him against me on the blanket welp blue sparks flew off him and he went a-runnin so sadly i can not really use this blanket unless we are purposely trying to keep him outta bed if ya know what i mean laughing out loud o,131,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this as a deal of the day special for 39 for that price it is ok but i would never pay full price the pillow shams are too small and the king size is too small for my king size matress i can use it as an individual comforter but then I shall have to dry clean preferred or launder it more frequently the cover does not come off the feather / down insides it is one piece that makes it a pain in my posterior the cover is very soft and the chocolatebeautiful it is nice and warm and very comfy it is quite lovely to look at and touch for that plus the cheap price I shall give it barely 4 stars for the undersize and launder problem i should give it no more than 3 stars,138,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,what a great product if you are looking for comfort and warmth without all the weight this is the perfect comforter love it so much i am going to buy 2 more in other colors would have given this product 5 stars if not for one thing that they do not mention in the description the pillow shams for the king comforter are not king shams as most all other king comforters come with to accommodate the width of the bed other than that a great buy,87,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,comforter can not hold the feathers had this over a year and i collected enough feathers to make my own pair of wings not to mention the feathers were not clipped so they hurt if they poke you beautiful looking as long as it is not intended to be used to sleep on,50,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it was very nice looking until the feathers started coming out they would poke and poke and i had a very thick blanket under it but the feathers were so horrible i only used thisfor about 2 weeks,40,8

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this in 07 and I have used it every other week since and it now 13 the only complaint I have had is that the pillow cases never stay on an entire night I have washed it numerous times I have never had feathers escape quality may have gone down since i bought it i also got it for under 35 back then,61,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,looking at the image and knowing it is microsuede urged me to purchase this comforter but the major problem is feathers keep coming out of it i can probably fill up a coffee mug of feathers in just a week of using this comforter seller should have thought of sealing the inside really good or even trying these before selling 2 thumbs down for this I am guessing in a month this comforter would be featherless,74,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i recieved this shipment promtly and was very happy with the quality for the price this was for my teenager and she was very happy very warm implanning on getting a set for my husband and i as well,39,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers coming out of everywhere was soft but could not sit on the bed without being stuck by a feather threw it away,23,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a lot for the moneyvery true easy to care for washes like a dream highly recommend and worth every penny,23,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was staging my house to sell and the stager wanted two red bed spreads on the bunk bed i could not find them anywhere so i bought these ones from amazon i am delighted they are very classy in appearance very suede-like my kids like them a lot and they are soft and cozy for sleeping when i eventually wash them i will certainly wash on delicates cycle and line dry to avoid any feather poking issues as mentioned by others i bought them for staging but i am bringing them to the next house no question,98,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,all the critical reviews were right the king size not quite big enough for a king size bed the filling is not very thick and the material on the back side is a little crinkly but whadda ya want for fifty bucks if you like microsuede it looks great and anyways how often does the comforter touch your skin with this one preferably never i can not say I am unhappy with the purchase the other reviews were real clear i went in eyes wide open it is a decent value and it serves it is purpose nicely but it is not a comforter you are likely to fall in love with when you pick it up those cost way more,115,17
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought two of these comforters for my boys twin bunk-beds they are cute to look at my boys love them and they are both easily able to make their own beds at 6 years and 4 years their old comforters were had to make and looked messy they look nice and neat even when they are played on i love that they are thinner so if you want a think plush comforter this is not it for you but it is perfect for us,82,18
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,after a week of use feathers began to poke out of the suede like there is no tomorrow they pinch you i would not recommend buying this comforter,28,19
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is warm if you can get past the feathers jabbing you in the neck arm rear end and falling out everywhere sharp tips to the feathers that seem to just fall out thru the material constantly picking up feathers off the floor would not buy this again and to top it off it is noisy must have used outside feathers and not down would not recommend this comforter,67,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the only reason this is not getting 5 stars is because it is not as thick as i expected but it gets the job done and keeps me warm thisis what i was looking for and the material feels nice i have not yet had any problems with feathers poking out,50,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i received this comforter about a month ago and i love it it is very plush and easy to wash while looking fantastic in my room the only thing i dislike is that when it came in the mail and i opened it i realized the pillow cases are huge looks like they are made for a body pillow as opposed to regular sized head pillows oh well although i just folded the extra fabric inside with the pillow and they are still very comfortable to lay on,85,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this microsuede feather king comforter set did not fit a king bed it was far too small in addition the comforter makes an odd sound as it moves a rustling noise that sounds like very cheap quality i was giving this as a gift and now am beyond the return date because it was just given back to me i was very disappointed in both the quality as well as the description this was definitely not as advertised i would give 0 stars if possible,85,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,product is nice to look at but that is the only good part when you move it it sounds like there has plastic in the inside layers also little feathers are constantly poking through and falling out of it,37,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the comforter would be all right if the feathers would not be poking through the material everyday i pull out 6 to ten feathers that are sticking out of this comforter,30,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,we use this thing for our guest bed and in limiting the stay of guests i suppose it does a good job however as a cover for a bed and while asleep it fails spectacularly the first thing you notice with this product is the sound it crinkles and sounds cheap the sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant then you notice the big fault it will not stay stuffed from the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50 of the feathers they are everywhere it makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use i would not buy this again and would indeed refuse it should someone offer it to me free of charge avoid at all costs unless you like a loose feather decor and the feel of amateur acupuncture,152,26
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i guess i do not have to say too much about this comforter set everywhere is feather keep poking my arms legs it is so annoying sometimes i get up and find feathers that stuck my t-shirt or short,37,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,looks as true and nice as pic no apparent flaws have not washed it yet but it does the job and reasonably priced,23,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,unfortunately in thisyou really do not get what you paid for just about every single feather that was sewn into the comforter has managed to slip out my bedroom at times looks like a chicken coop every time you look at the comforter all you see is little white feathers sticking out no matter how long you spend plucking the feathers out of the comforter there are always more and they hurt too it is not the fluffy side of the feather which sticks through it is the needle-sharp quill that always does manufacturer should have done a better job ensuring that their feather product stayed inside of the comforter,109,29
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is horrible all of the feathers fall out and poke you everywhere do not buy this trust me spend a little more and get down feathers these are the regular feathers and they poke out everywhere unless you buy a duvet cover that is like 4 inches thick do not buy this,52,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice comforter if it is not going to be used nice for spare room the feathers have a tendency to poke through the material and poke you if you lay on it just right I have had mine for about 3 weeks and it has lost hundreds of it is feathers do not be fooled into thinking you are getting a great buy because it was marked down from 11000 to 4000because it is not worth the 4000 i gave for it,78,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered thisto match thein my room thematched perfectly but i regret to say that this was a waste of 40 why well because after using the comforter for 3 nights the feathers started to come out from the comforter there are no holes in it but the feathers themselves poke thru the fabric and eventually make their way all the way out or they hang out half way and poke you all night if you sleep in the nude like i do horrible product i have no choice but to keep using it and cleaning up a few feathers here and there each morning until enough of them poke out to where it will stop at least that is my hope if not i will have to she shall out real money to buy a quality comforter from sears or macys and chuck this one in the trash where it belongs,156,32
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i got a king size and it looks fantastic but watch out after you wash it the feathers are constantly coming out and poking me it is annoying i would not recommend and it is too bad since it looks so great,39,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i have only the comforter for about 2 months the feathers inside are poking through the material on both sides which not only makes it uncomfortable to sleep with due to the quills coming through but makes a mess because of all the feathers on my floor it also becomes very unsightly my comforter is dark brown and the feathers being white causes it to look like there is something all over it the only good thing i can say is it definately keeps you warm,86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,like i said horrible cheap microsuede material and stitching down feathers poke through the microsuede and poke you in your sleep very painful and uncomfortable also the comforter just barely covers a queen sized bed wished i had never bought thisto begin with had to buy a completely different comforter,52,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered this comforter because i thought it would be a great comforter and very warm for this winter but i was wrong this comforter has alot of feathers that always she had every night and the ends of the feathers actually stick your skin if you do not pull it out once you see the feathers poking through i wish i had never purchased this comforter,66,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,took one wash before the feathers were poking out everywhere and it stunk like wet dog for weeks plural needless to say i donated this to a homeless man just a terrible product overall,34,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the most annoying blanket i have ever purchased the feathers seep out from the entire surface of the blanket i will be purchasing a new blanket this week since this brand new blanket is just a mess,39,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,I am not really a picky consumer but the feathers thatout of this are a nuisance at first i thought that it would get better after it was broken in but after more than a year it is still bleeding feathers but it is a beautifuland is incredibly warm to boot,54,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,I have had thisfor about a week now at first it smelled horrible but i had seen another review on it that stated the same and they suggested to hang it outside over night i did and it worked no more smell there are a few feathers finding their way out but that happens with down filled things for the price it is a good find we will have to see how it holds up over time,76,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it leaves a lot to be wished for not the greatest comforter i have ever owned,16,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased thisas a wedding gift assured that since i bought it from amazon the party i gave i to would not have any problems nevertheless and unfortunately after they used it for about 5 days the feathers started to she had and they had to buy a duvet to cover it this embarrassed me i suggest that amazon check the merchandise before sending it to their customers thank you yolanda rovirosa,72,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was worried about ordering my bedding on line but was surprised when i recieved it beautifulawesome feel and very warm along with being very soft the only thing i did not care for is every now and then you can feel a feather sticking out of it other wise iam happy with it,55,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,very bad product the first damage in 4 days and calling for changes to conforter and spend the same stick out their feathers and skin hurts so i asked him to return and refund of the two conforters me and has already gained over 2 months and i still do not refund any of my credit cards,57,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the one i bought about 2 months ago has barely any feathers left in it due to them falling out on top of that it is a constant battle to keep the feathers cleaned up the ends of the feathers are always poking me the next comforter i buy will most certainly not come from this company the price is cheap but i got what i paid for junk,69,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i did not notice that this comforter is filled with feathers while purchasing whole night feathers keep popping out of the comforter causing extreme discomfort i keep sneezing as well and worst thing is when we tried to wash it needless to say but all feathers have started popping out and it smells bad too please please never even think of buying this product if you want to have a good sleep in the night,74,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,in case you missed it as i did this comforter is stuffed with feathers not down not batting feathers the kind that have sharp quills that poke through the fabric and scratch your skin the kind that make noise when you turn over this bedding could not be more crackly if they stuffed it with corn chips and you will not want it anywhere near your skin unless you are wearing kevlar pajamas so unless your mattress is stuffed with straw and you drive a covered wagon to work give this one a pass,90,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i searched around for quite awhile looking for a red comforter set before deciding to buy this one unfortunently i did not read the reviews well enough or i would have noticed that it was complete junk i wake up every morning looking like a chicken because the slightest movement will because sharp tipped feathers to fall out i really wish i had sent it back but sadly i had taken it out of the bag and endured one night of it before i noticed this faulty manufacturing detail save yourself from a waste of money and many sleepless nights and buy another comforter,103,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,at first this product looks pretty good after a couple of days this comforter starter to drop feathers from both sides it was very uncomfortable because these feathers would stick to the pillows and sheets do not buy it,38,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i thought theof this blanket would be much brighter than it actually is and i am disappointed with how it turned out,24,50

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought this and i hate it there are feathers sticking out all over through the cover and the duvet cover i was always getting poked by feathers so i had to toss this out what a waste of money now i have to buy another comforter and this time i will not buy down i will get an alternative no more pokey feathers,64,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,had this for a month and the feathers started poking out of it and they were sharp like needles horrible,20,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,we bought this comforter because it was beautifull and a great price I have had down blankets before and i expect some feathers but this is ridiculous my whole house looks like a scene from witches of eastwick feathers constantly come out a few handfulls a day it is beautifull and warm and cozy i loved it other than the embarrasement of having to pluck feathers off everything i own i have ordered a duvet cover but i doubt that will help much do not waste your money,85,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,be aware this is not a down comforter and it is not described as one either we are talking full feathers with calamus if they are not stabbing you on one side are poking through on the other terrible product not worth half the price buy one and you will regret it,51,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the blanket is soft and very comfortable but the care was way to much trouble the cost to have this cleaned professionally was the same as buying a new one so i did what i could to clean it myself since the blanket was too big to really get clean in the washer and micro suede will melt / burn in the dryer i washed this in the bath tub and hung it to dry it was so hard to ring most of the water out and so heavy to move to hang the other thing i did not like was the feathers came out of the blanket so constantly that it was never without a lint covered look and there were always feathers everywhere to clean up you live and learn i now have a different blanket that is not filled with feathers,141,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,good price bad blanket the blanket has a good look to it but the actual usability is not good the feathers poke out and when under the covers and moving around the blanket sounds like sand paper or plastic bags rustling around it is warm enough but i wonder how long the warm will last with all the feathers coming out i would suggest this blanket for a guest room that is for show and does not get much use,76,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is a nightmare to say the least feathers are everywhere the feathers also stab you thru the material and make for a very very very unpleasant experience if you are considering buying this i advise you to think again worse purchase ever made on here people who sell this crap ought to be ashamed of themselves btw the only reason i gave it 1 star was because it would not let me leave it blank or put a negative star,81,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was so happy with the initial appearance of this comforter however i awoke in the first night to an eruption of feathers i felt like i was on the set of a horror movie revenge of the chicken feathers it felt like a million needles were sticking me and it was impossible to clean up i had to move to a new apartment and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only there is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again there are just too many feathers everywhere my maid rosario cursed and ran out of the apartment when she saw what had happened this comforter will ruin your life,113,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i really like this comfortor it is warm and cozy and it is just what i wanted,15,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is a complete mess of a comforter i got a great deal on the price and yes it does keep you warm but at a price and the price is feathers everywhere I am not just saying a couple here and there I am saying this thing is a feather factory which puts out a handful of feathers daily if your goal is to make your bedroom look like a chicken coop then you will succeed if you purchase this blanket set if you trim pine branches outside and go to bed without getting all the sap off you will wake up looking like a bird man this blanket is currently in a garbage bag stored away in a closet waiting for an emergency of to annoy an unwanted house guest,130,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this about 2 months ago it was very staticky at first i did end up washing it and drying it according to label directions with no problems i am really diappointed in the amount of feathers that are constantly working their way out of this comforter although at night the pointy parts of the feathers stick through the sheets and it feels like needles when i have to take this off to change the sheets the feathers go everywhere and it seriously looks like a goose exploded in the bedroom i would not order this again nor recommend to friends or otherwise,104,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this and was happy the way it looked and thebut the first time i used it i hated it it was scratchy itchy and downright pokey and pinchy plus the feathers came out all over where i slept i returned it,45,64

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,outside material was ok nothing special inside stuffing was feathers that broke through and she had all over my bedroom plus feathers would poke you while sleeping pretty uncomfortable would not recommend gave to goodwill,34,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,warm feathers fall out they are everywhere back side fabric microsuede is on one side only not sufficiently strong to prevent their migration into your room,26,67

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i had a really great nautica down comforter for years that never ever she had i had a penon that one and bought this as a cheap replacement you definitely get what you pay for this comforter sheds feathers like crazy I am constantly vacuuming and finding feathers on clothes this purchase was not worth the money,57,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i purchased thisat more than i see others paid for and one reason i bought it was that it says machine washable i just opened it up and the first thing i see is dry-clean only wow what has the deal i feel cheated i do not do dry cleaning and now I am seeing a lot of complaints about the feathers poking through sigh,64,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this sucker has been moulting feathers since i put it on my sons bed also it crackles when you move it around price was cheap but if i would have known about the feather problem i still would not have bought it at the reduced price,45,71

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i fell in love with the look and feel of this comforter until i had to sleep under it feathers started coming out from night one and not the soft side of the feather the hard pokey side i can not stand this i wish i could return it amazon should not sell it you should not buy it,57,76

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this cover looks good and keeps you warm but that is the only thing good i can say about it the feathers comes through the material on both sides and constantly stick you and get everywhere this is listed as a comforter but it is uncomfortable just bought it 2 weeks ago and i am already on the market for something new,62,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,purchased this for my daughter and my mother as their birthdays are in summer we have only begun to use them these comforters are soft and warm beyond belief theworks well with the sheet sets i purchased at the same time i am very pleased with these comforters and would buy more the price as always from amazon was extremely affordable the only negative is they are supposed to be dry cleaned but i plan to spot clean if necessary however the dogs are not allowed to sleep on them which was disappointing to them,96,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers are every where do not buy worst purchase I have made on amazon i do not know why it is still selling this thing should be off the market as soon as possible read the rest of the one star reveiws and take heed,41,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theis true to what you see here on the amazon website nice dark chocolate i recommend washing first since it is such a dark hue it can bleed on lighter colored sheets you may sleep with after time i washed as soon as i received it and had no fading issues provides great warmth as it is luxuriously full with feathers and the shams are perfect for regular sized pillows i gave it 4 stars because the feathers come out a little easily i have other microsuede feather comforters and this one definitely sheds more but still a great buy,100,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i brought the comforter in may 09 and did open the package until recently do not buy the blanket it bleeds feathers that stick you amazon should take it off the market i can not even return it since the 30 days are over,43,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i got it i thought that some reviews were exaggerated well i was wrong withing the first night i felt i was getting stabbed by hundred of little feathers and there a plastic sound every time you move the comforter which does not help if trying to sleep worst part it is waking up to the barb little stick on the feather sticking trough the comforter i send back because cleaning the feathers of something one week old was very tedious,79,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i like it so much that i have been thinking of ordering another one to have as a backup as for this particular amazon page i will never write another review unless amazon ceases at once to virtually dictate yes dictate what the reviewer should do give your customers some credit for intelligence by the way i just previewed what i wrote here and i did not check the box next to receive e-mail when customers comment on your reviews but when the preview page came up i was informed you did not request to be notified when customers comment on your reviews clearly anyone is more intelligent than whoever dreamed up this page,116,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,great price great colors but you would be more comfortable actually sleeping in a real bird nest complete with sticks and branches as well as feathers this comforter had the feathers sticking out everywhere pokey and painful and gross no possible comfortable position unless you sleep on it upside down,49,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter set far surpasses what i was expecting for the price it is a beautifuland is substantial in weight love it and highly recommend it if you want great quality and affordable pricing,35,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks nice when you buy it however the feathers keep coming out and it sounds crunchy when you lay on it like there is a plastic bag in the middle of it weird but true,37,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter set black this blanket sucks the feathers poke out everywhere i have to constantly sweep and pick feather from my floor and bedspread i do not recommend this mess to anyone,38,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what was i thinking when i ordered a microsuede comforter i think i was thinking affordable down comforter and blanked everything else out it came with two microsuede pillow cases yet which will see the donation box before they see my head upon them the underside of the comforter is a weird material that makes a swooshing noise I have been using it for two weeks and it is already losing feathers but the very worst feature that i did not know before purchase is that it requires dry cleaning if only i had not used it right away i would return it why why why did i have to use it at all be warned unless you like sleeping with suede,118,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,awful as others are saying it is a very nice set but the comforter is too cheap and the feathers poke through it is a pita because they are all over the floor and it looks awful with feathers on it let alone sleeping with bird feathers right back to amazon it goes not even worth the 60 for the set,58,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,after three months this comforter is a shedding feathers on both sides i will not even let my dog sleep on it waste of money do not buy,26,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,if you like having 10 thousand feathers everywhere all the time then buy this comforter the feathersout of the fabric like water through a sieve if i thought it would do any good I had return it and demand my money back if i could submit this review with no stars i would,55,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the biggest waste of money i purchased it for my sons bed after having redone his bedroom well i found it stuffed in his closet the other day and did not know why well he showed me why it looks fine on the outter side but when you turn it over it has feathers poking out everywhere he said they poked me all night long now this is coming fr a 17 yo who has never cared one way or the other about what his bedding consists of i went to send it back but it was to late do not waste ur money,105,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this thing is way too small for my king size mattress it barely covers the top part of the mattress much less hanging over the sides so i will be returning it,32,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i bought a king comforter for only 40 despite all the reviews about the feather issue well you get what you paid for the feathers are everywhere in my house because of this comforter every time i wash it i spend 30 - 45 minutes pulling feathers out that are protruding through meaning a trip outside to pull the feathers out you can not sit comfortable on top of it because of the feather poking issue this was an issue straight out of the package I have washed it 11 times now and can not believe how many feathers are still coming out otherwise the microsuede is really nice it is just the feather issue is too much for me to handle and i own several down blankets this is the only one with this bad of an issue,135,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is really pretty but it sheds and while you are trying to sleep the end of the feathers come out and stab you all night everyday i had to pick fethers up all over my bedroom and all over the comforter,43,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very upset about this product it is very thin which you would think it would be thick and it crunchs like it is full of plastic but theis really good the size is excellent,38,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i thought for the price that it would be something simple and soft was i way wrong i am still shocked at the quality of my comforter the thickness it is the best buy i have ever had and am thinking about getting the one in chocolate too what i love about this is that it stays in place on the bed no matter how my husband and i and our puppy move during the night it does not slide off the sides it is a must have to any bedroom ensemble,90,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is very inexpensive but there is a reason the feathers started coming out quill first and poking us from the very first night it is warm although i think we are just going to find a duvet cover to slip over it can not be to disappointed but heads up it is pokey and lot of loose feathers,57,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought 2 of these in the full / queen size one for my husband and one for myself we have to have our own blankets because we both like to have control over the blankets haha well when we first got them they were very loud like tissue paper in a way so one of us would move and the other would hear all the noise and vice versa but the noise has quieted down and it is an excellent blanket it is very warm and not too thick very soft i like to sleep with the suede side against my skin and it feels very nice,106,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is made pretty poor you get what you pay for i can see why it is marked down so much one side is softer while the other is stiff and crunchy not comfortable at all i decided to use it for the warmth factor and actually have the sueded side facing down because the opposite stiffer side does not feel very good against your skin therfore i have a quilt on top of it the tags read dry clean only i know as a fact i would not go to the expense to have it cleaned that way as the set is not worth it it does have a decent weight to it but other than that if i had actually seen this at a store for sale i would not of purchased it even at the low price,138,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought thisand with in a week all the feathers are all coming out of it you can lay with it casue the feather stick you in the morning there all over the bed on me and the floor i threw it away it was a waste of money,54,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this the worse thing we have ever bought the feathers are already coming out of it we do not wnat other people making the same mistake we did,28,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the comforter is beautiful it is just what i thought it would be the delivery was prompt and it was a great bargain I am very satisfied with my product,29,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the product that i received is very poor in quality after only having it for a few weeks the comforter began to she had feathers daily all over the bed it is so bad that u can literally feel the feathers sticking you when you lying down i have pulled out over 30 feathers during these last few weeks and definitely think this is a total waste of my 50,69,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is a very nice looking comforter but the thing can not hold feathers at all i would wake up at night covered in feathers with a bunch more poking into me from inside the comforter,34,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,although thisis beautiful when first put on it has some very big downfalls it crinkles because of the filler and it sheds feathers all the time you end up having to vac constantly and make sure to check your cloths in order to ensure you are not walking around with stay feathers on you or in your hair it was really a shame because i have other microsuede comforters and this one was the perfectfor my room but i am at the point where i can not use it because of all the feathers,98,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i had two of these for a month you get what you pay for the shafts of the majority of the feathers are all bunching in the corners and constantly poking through the materiel that is us the comforter is very warm for it is weight seems well made except that the feather shafts are very hard and really hurt enough to wake me up,63,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,very pretty rich browna little crunchy in terms of down but warm and very attractive for the guest room,21,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter looks are deceiving in this good feeling comforter I have used it for two weeks now and already the pointy edges of the feathers are sticking through and poking me there are feathers on the floor and on everything i wear when i sit down on the bed the warmth and weight of this comforter are great but get a duvet cover to keep the feathers inside,71,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i read the reviews and still bought this comforter set at my age i could surely take care of a little static and loose feathers this comforter has it is own power source i have used 2 cans of anti-static spray and a bottle of fabric softener / water mix and still have trouble getting out of bed in the morning-I am stuck to it the dogs fear their morning greeting i believe it is a combination of my hair standing on end the dozens on feathers stuck about my body and my newly obtained super power to shoot lightening bolts i also believe the nightmares of aliens with probes are directly associated with all the loose piercing feathers i gave this 2 stars because 1 it is warm and 2 the manufactures ingenious ability to continue selling this product after reviews like mine and yours,141,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theof this was perfect went great with my existing decor but i keep getting feathers poking me in the middle of the night they come thru all sides of the comforter and make a mess when you pull them out because you certainly want a clean looking comforter overall very warm and great for the price,58,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this product is great however you do lose a few feathers all and all it feels great,17,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,feathers are coming out of the comforter and are everywhere i definately would not have purchased had i known this i have other down / feather duvets and comforters and have not seen feathers come out like this one you usually see the odd one or two it is soft and light and keeps you warm so if you do not mind the feathers everywhere this is a good choice,67,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with thiswhen i received it it looked very nice but had a substantial amount of feathers all over it after picking off the feathers the comforter looked great i bought this for my teenage sons room and after he slept with it the next day there were feathers all over it again i have gone through this pruning process almost daily and the feathers never seem to quit coming out of the comforter i am now finding feathers in other parts of the house i recommend spending more money and getting a high-quality comforter i wish i would have,108,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i ordered this set to go over an existing coverlet on my bed that had camel and browns in it i fold the comforter down and with the shams it makes a beautiful statement for the bedroom the fabric is quite nice and well worth the price i would recommend this to anyone,53,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was disappointed from the get-go with the comforter when i think down i think fluffy and thick this comforter was neither it is extremely thin also beginning the first hour of use feathers began sticking out they poke into you while sleeping or even just sitting on the bed to watch tv vacuuming had now become an every-other-day activity because of the fleeting feathers needless to say i have already gotten the return labels,74,120
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i am seriously disappointed with the workmanship on this comforter it is been leaking feathers daily through all of the seams while theis nice and I am a big fan of microsuede i would never buy this product again due to how poorly it has been manufactured,47,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was made of newspaper and straw unless you need something to put on a bed your child is often wetting this is not a good deal i would only put this on a bed i knew was going to be ruined shortly the poor quality is obvious in the look and the feel do not waste your time or money,61,122
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,just want you to know my nephew was thrilled with his christmas present he loves his warm good looking comforter set thanks amazon,23,123
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,got this comforter for my daughter for christmas and she loves it she is age 17 so usually impossible to please that has to say it all,27,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,oh my god we got this for our new king bed and the feathers have not stopped coming out yet it is been over a month when we first got it it was all crinkly and made a plastic like crinkling when it moved then the feathers started breaking up i guess and they are sticking out every where we have it in black so this looks pretty bad not very snugly or comfy for a comforter either more like a sleeping bag feeling,85,125
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks great until you wash it once it is washed it is done for i used to pay my sister to de-feather when it comes out the drier because there are feathers poking out everywhere you do not want a comforter with feathers you want a down comforter to avoid this my husband and i have stopped using it because it is so annoying feathers are everywhere in my house i would wake up with feathers in my hair do yourself a favor and get the down one,86,126
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,love the softness and it is warmis nice and was a good value,14,127
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i received this after adding it to my wedding list and it looked really nice to begin with after a couple of weeks however the white feathers began poking through and scratching my legs when i was in bed i have shaken it had it cleaned and more but i always end up with white feathers showing showing a lot because of the black cover and eventually coming through the cover completely it looks awful when this happens and i have bought a cheaper microfiber cotton comforter which i cover with a nice quilt no more scratches and no more nights where i wake up looking like I have had a fight with a dove in my sleep,116,128
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,what is this thing filled with garbage bags it crinkles like plastic it is as flat as a pancake it is uncomfortable it is not warm it is got a serious static problem the feathers poke through the back lining but it looks good on the bed so i fold it down at night and use my old duvet to sleep under,58,129
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what a bad product is this stuffed with chicken feathers this is definitely only a comforter to put on an unused bed in your guest room after a very short amount of time feathers began to poke out everywhere and it took on a crunchy feel due to the feather spines inside i am very disappointed with this set because it is really pretty in case you are wondering if careless laundering led to the problem the answer is no since i quit using it even before it needed to be cleaned for the first time do not buy this comforter set,99,130
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i like it it adds warmth without being to heavy but it is a little noisy it also stays on the bed unlike someothers i have had,27,131
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,thisis so comfortable so warm and so awesome that i can not imagine going to bed without it i wish it were machine washer safe although,27,132
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,looked forever for a brown suede feather down comforter finally found it at a great price free shipping and came fast,19,133
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was surprised at how warm this comforter is it looks a little thin at first when you open the box but sleep under it for one night and you will be amazed now i know why birds do not shiver in the cold it is also very soft to the touch due to the micro suede,56,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i love this comforter it is soft and warm the only thing i do not like is that it has to be dry cleaned otherwise it is perfect,28,135
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this quilt is great it is a deep rich brown and very soft to the touch it is not as cushy as i thought it would be it holds it shape and looks great on the bed as a topper with bedskirt,41,136
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,blanket is not comfy very thin and stiff ordered a king for a queen sized bed and it just barely fits,21,137
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is so warm and soft we use it on our bed and we have no problem keeping the heat down at night also great for watching tv would recommend it to anyone looking for a light but warm blanket do not let the thinness or weight fool you,49,138
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in this comforter i have only had it on my bed for a month and already it has feathers poking out all over and i have not even had to clean it yet definately not worth the investment,41,139
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this microsuede comforter for my spare room get compliments on it all the time it also looks very rich i liked it so well i got another one,30,140
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is very very thin a few feathers have already started falling out after a month theis great just as it looks,24,141
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the fabric is soft and theis true to the picture a rich chocolatelike a hershey bar the comforter is not as fluffy as i thought it would be but that worked out for my husband who does not like a heavy blanket it really looks more sophisticated than it is low price i just wish the matching bedskirt was cheaper,62,142
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter set camel i bought this about 9 months ago for 35 when it was on sale at first i was really impressed with the comforter the cover of the comforter microsuede side felt wonderful and it kept me plenty warm after a bit of use and washings i noticed more and more feathers escaping right through the fabric side no holes just right through the fabric also my comforter only has xs and does not have the full sewn boxes like more expensive models to keep the down in place so the down and feathers end up in the edges of the comforter while you lay under the middle i would recommend you save your money and buy a better comforter personally I am tired of having to pluck myself each morning so into the trash this one will go,144,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter last spring i was looking for an inexpensive comforter and found this one the microfiber top is nice and soft it is rather light but is good for the warmer months it washes up nicely my only complaint is that it sheds feathers the blanket i have under it usually has feathers all over it i only paid 3500 for the king size it is hard to find any king size comforter for that price if it was not for the feathers coming out i would give it 5 stars for what you get for the money,100,144
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks nice but feels cheap it crackles when you move and is already losing feathers after just a few short weeks we used to have a great microsuede down comforter from jc penney but they no longer carry it no one seems to have one that matches the quality i think i am going to get a regular white down comforter and a pretty duvet for it this one is just irritating,74,145
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was everything expected very comfortable lying under the cozy down filling on a cool night great productthanks,18,146
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is not only very warm but is absolutely beautiful i have not had any problems with the feathers moving toward the center or poking out and my husband is a big guy also the only bad thing about it is that it is not that big i bought a king for my queen bed and it barely reaches to the bottom of the frame i may buy a bedskirt to go under it other than that it is so warm and so nice,84,147
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this set for my teenage son he specifically wanted a black comforter set which hard to find in department stores i came across this one and decided to give it a try the price was really great and this comforter set looked really high quality however within one month my son was complaining about all of the pokey feathers the feathers are coming out all over his comforter and he is no longer happy with it i guess the price was too good to be true,88,148
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i orginally ordered the set thinking that i was not going to like it as soon as the package arrived i openit ans was surprised to find that the comforter was well constructed and the perfect weight for fall weather in maine i am going to order another comforter set for the guest bedroom,53,149
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,light weight it feels soft it would have been helpful for me to know before i purchased it that it required dry cleaning,23,150
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought this because it was cheap and boy is it cheap it is thin as paper and i think it has paper inside it by the feel of it I am tempted to slash it open to see what has inside because i certainly can not use this as a blanket the material inside is actually crinkly and noisy which is not a benefit when you are trying to sleep the blanket is thin uncomfortable noisy not particularly warm and i highly recommend that you avoid it,83,151
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,great quality and price nice weight of fabric cozy texture description is very accurate i would have liked to know the length of the comforter,25,152
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the price was incomperable 3000 for a king sized micro suede down comforter the only thing i would change is making it more fluffy it is comfortable soft very light and breathes better than you would think i have it on top of one of my very fluffy down comforters and another micro suede comforter a little fluffier than this one so this is almost like the cover of the bed nonetheless it does not matter to me that i have it on the top of the bed it is nice to settle down on the bed and relax into it it is very soothing,101,153
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this comforter set is as plush as advertised and looks wonderful on a bed complete with pillow cases that nestle the head into dreamland,24,154
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a really nice blanket great price for a down blanket light and airy but warm,15,155
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,for the price i thought this is a great fit for my bedroom not big and bulky but still keeps us warm and looks nice we have a queen size bed and bought the king size comforter and it just barely covers the bed so definitely worth it to buy the size up,53,156
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,very pleased with the quality of this product i would never have been able to find a microsuede down / feather king comforter or any size for that matter at this terrific price,31,157
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is really beautiful and i love it the only thing is it is not as thick a i thought it would be and the feathers keep coming out of the material,31,158

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was not at all what i expected i have now returned it awaiting my credit back this is not anything like i would ever purchase againthank you,28,160
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is got a plastic liner which makes crinkly sounds when it moves and yes it sheds and it does not really feel as good as you would expect a microfiber to feel i went out and bought a different one paid twice as much but I am a lot happier with it,49,161
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the feathers in the blanket are always coming out all over and at night you can not cuddle up in the blanket because the feathers are always stabbing you,28,162
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i really liked this when it arrived very soft and warm and thewas perfect but after about 4 months the stitching started coming out i do not lay on it and i have never washed it so i guess you get what you pay for,46,163
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i did not expect anything amazing the king size is the same size as a queen set i ordered at the same time from a different manufacturer this set was thin barely as thick as a quilt it makes a crackly noise too theis what i consider a true brickdeep red thewas exactly what i wanted so the shams are very useful the comforter itself not so much i have it folded across the foot of my bed forrather than function,88,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is not as thick as i prefer my comforters to be and it is noisy meaning whenever you turn you can hear the cover rustling around not good for very light sleepers,32,165
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was such a great deal and so comfortable not to heavy just right keeps me and husband warm and looks great on our bed the matching pillow cases are a bonus thanks so much,36,166
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is very pretty but needs more bulk also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter but the price was cheap you get what you pay for it is okay for spring or early fall but do not expect heavy duty warmth from it,46,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i have a ralph lauren down comforter that I have had for a while but needed something a little lighter for the summer this comforter was perfect as a precaution it is pretty thin this is not a winter comforter but it does keep you warm the materials are semi high-quality you get what you pay for my only problem with the comforter is that the feathers tend to come out through the material on occasion but that is expected with a down comforter for the most part overall i was happy with the gold box price i paid for this set and would reccommend it as a good comforter under 100,112,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,there are two reasons i did not give this product 5/5 it sheds feathers like crazy and is dry clean only otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter,26,169
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i tried to get every one i knew who was redecorating to snatch up this comforter only a few of my friends took advantage of the sale free shipping and we are all very much satisfied at first i thought the package was kind of light for a comforter but once this puppy got some fluffing it worked out to be very nice,64,170
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,when i first unpacked it i thought it looked like a very nice comforter especially considering what i paid for it i soon realized that looks are not everything a day has not gone by where i have not had to dispose 8 or more feathers at this rate it is going to be nothing more than an empty she shall even at 35 i feel i paid too much for this i would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a donaldcostume you are working on but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds / colors of feathers inside thing only 15 of it is content is actual down,116,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is not a fluffy down comforter it more like a down bedspread i purchased the king for a queen size as i want that look it does have a nice feel to it however you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede i love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it people have commented that it does look very nice i paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as i did get king size pillow shams with my set,109,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i purchased this on a friday special sale price and received it for only 2999 it is very lightweight and comfortable and the pillow shams were king size not standard as in the other reviews i have a queen size bed and ordered the king size glad i did because it just covers the top nicely and has very little on the sides i am diabetic with neuropathy in both legs and feet this lightweight comforter is replacing another that was too heavy on my feet at night i reside in florida where you do not need a heavy comforter but because i also have the microsuede throw that i ordered last winter i can attest to the fact that they are also very warm and comfortable while remaining lightweight there was no bedskirt included in my package which was also fine with me because my bed is adjustable the bedskirts do not work well anyway definitely a 5 star product for the money the microsuede is very soft also,168,173
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it is soft warm and all you can say but i have feathers all over my room the cover is not strong enough to keep them inside it is a shame because the price is good and the microsuede is soft,39,174
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was so happy about the quality of the comforter i was nervous that thewould be gray but it was not its definately black and when i first opened it it did not look like it would be too thick but it just needed time to air out it seems thin but it is extremely warm and the under part is almost like a vinyl so it keeps you cool also overall very satisfied i recommend this,77,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was in the gold box and the customer reviews were very positive so i bought the queen / full set for my guest bedroom I am very pleased it is light weight looks nice it is warm and more i found the range ofchoices kind of icky but the camel is sufficiently bland to blend with any decor additionally it should withstand getting dirty easily it weighs nothing and it does not smell at all apparently people have had odiferous adventures by machine washing it there is a rather prominent tag on it saying dry clean only laughing out loud,95,176
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter it appears to be a little on the thin side but is very warm i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it the pillow shams are only standard instead of king very good price too,56,177
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i got this on a gold box sale and i love the price also love the feel of it and the best thing is that i love there d and this is one of my favorites most of the time i only see maroon items to buy but thiswas better oh i also received it on time and in great condition,64,178
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice looking comforter however it lacks in the filling the comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have been to bad they skimped on the filling,37,179
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter might fit a full size bed but it was way too small for a queen,17,180
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i am so pleased with this product very reasonable price and excellent quality and looks good and feels good i highly recommend this purchase,23,181
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i paid 3499 for this microsuede down comforter set i was thinking i was getting a sheet comforter and pillow cases because of the set but this set does not include the sheet I have been using this for about 2 - 3 weeks and it works well i tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it it is really comfortable soft and has no weird odor coming from it additionally you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it one really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter you contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout the reason this happens is because the squares / pattern on the comforter does not completely enclose the down stuffing so the sides of the squares are open allowing the stuffing to move to the sides and end of the comforter,166,182
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is fantastic it is light so you do not feel weighted down it is very warm cuddly soft and comfortable and seems to be very well made and it looks great on my bed i can not find one thing to complain about i wish i had bought one in everygreat bargain for the money,55,183
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,great value for the money a bit on the thin side but very warm great,16,184
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is lightweight but very warm i live in the basement of a home where it is cold in the winter i sleep like a baby now,28,185
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i would only change one thing about this they should use a different material for the inside cover i feel like I am sleeping in a barn with a lot of chickens the feathers are everywhere and sometimes they poke when I am sleeping if the feathers were to stay inside i would totally recommend it btw it is really warm and cozy,61,186
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it was much thinner than i was expecting and i did not think it would keep me very warm but once i started using it i realized it is very warm and am very pleased with it,36,187
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the price was great but other than that it was not at all what i thought i would be getting the quality is not great very thin thin comforter for feather down disappointed for sure,34,188
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,you would think when you open it it was thin and would not be very warmactully it is real warm just has some staticlove the feel of this blanket,29,189
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,while the comforter was not as heavy as I had thought it certainly is a steal for the price and is sufficiently warm when i ordered there was some question as to washability it is machine washable although i have not needed to launder mine yet the oliveis very similar to the picture it is a rich deep olive green i am thrilled with this set,64,190
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,is not exactly matched with our can but it does what we need keeps the dog out of the garbage,20,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i just received this product and it is missing a crucial piece the medal rod that stops that flaps from folding down on one of the sides please contact me and send that piece thanks rubbermaid commercial fg267360gray slim jim rectangular trash can swing lid gray,61,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,i ordered three of these lids for the slim jim cans that we have in the office we typically use glad 30-gallon trash bags in the cans they are nice because the footprint is not wide in two directions so it fits nicely against a wall or the end of a counter without being in the way the lids are a nice touch because they stay shut after trash items have been dropped inside i realize that the lids are a bit costly about the same price of the trash can itself but i think we need it in our office environment because they look much better than just having an open trash can i have it four stars because of the price is higher than i would have preferred 3184,130,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,i ordered a replacement lid 14 1/2 x 14 1/2 i received the slim jim instead the company took no responsibility for sending the wrongand i had to pay return shipping very unsatisfied i will never deal with this site again,43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,not worth the full street price I am going to but I had still keep mine the plastic is surprisingly thin and light and mine did come with the jagged flashing as another reviewer photographed the rods were shipped loose as was expected and as i suspect they are supposed to be shipped installation tip do not attempt to take the doors out of the frame to install the rods instead push the rods between the door and the frame then loop around from behind to pop the rods into the doors another reviewers trick of using a sturdy hook or s-shaped tool works great i just used my fingers as for the doors catching on the plastic liner that is solved by buying the correct sized liner such that it is stretched taut over the mouth of the trash can buying too large a liner inevitably results in ballooning or bunching of the bag which invites the door catches getting caught on the excess plastic,162,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i had to fix the inside rod on the lid i returned the first one and received a second one with the same issue so i fixed it myself,29,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,durable and sturdy material where the flaps come together in the middle wish that they touched each other instead of leaving a smalli feel that bugs flies and more can still get into the trash,36,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,fits very well woks great easy to clean,8,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,matches my garbage can works perfect and conceals the mess / smell one flap has a little slower spring so it is slow to close but still does close and works fine,29,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,these are not the commercial quality that the slim jim cans are i returned the grey and the blue the same day for fear they would break before i could box them back up and ship them,36,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,it is a trash can lid it fits the trash can what more can i say,15,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,works great with the slim jim can no more manually opening the lid,13,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,the lid arrived with huge scuff marks making me wonder if it was used turns out the doors do not reliably swing into closed position you have to constantly adjust them if you want them closed seems a waste of money to pay extra for hinged doors to hide the trash when the the doors do not work,55,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,perfect for hands free and keeping garbage smells at bay,10,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,terrible expensive product lid does not close gets caught on bag and feels very unsmoith anyway even if bag not in can just lays on top of can no firm fit touch it and falls off hate this product,39,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,i ordered two of these for my middle school classroom to help improve the aesthetics of my space and encourage students to place trash in the appropriate location it has helped in both cases the lid is generally sturdy unfortunately one of the sides came loose on one and it took several minutes and some creativity to get the metal rods back in place to restore it back to working order as mentioned in some other reviews the swinging lid sometimes gets caught on the plastic can liner,88,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,this lid will not stay closed once i put trash into the garbage can the lid swings open and then hangs there i have to manually grab the flap so it will swing closed or i have to try and jostle the can a bit so the lid will swing closed this makes thebasically useless i could have just kept the garbage can open and achieved the same thing i added an extra star because it looks nicer than an open can even although it still functions like one,91,16
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,while the lid itself is what i expected however there are metal bars that allow the doors to swing open and close those metal bars when not in their track properly which is impossible to do fall out some of the lids came with the metal bars in their track properly most of the lids did not and the metal bars fall out constantly i own a childcare center and purchased these for the classrooms to use for food disposal but the doors are suppose to close very disappointed with this product as they were expensive and are not performing,100,17
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,the weighted rods were shipped loose and were difficult to install i thought i was going to break the plastic when bending it back other than that it does the job,31,18
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,fits the matching trash container perfectly easy to take off for project cleaning and easy to replace,17,19
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,i ordered nine and six of them came with the weighted bar that closes the popped off i had to put them back on myself which was a pain i expected better from rubbermaid,34,20
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,did not last 24 hours in use waste of money,10,21
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,we recently moved into a new house and one of our dogs likes to eat the trash when we are gone happened once l before we ordered this lid we ordered this kid came home from going to the grocery store only to find that she tried to tip over the trash and eat it due to the lid being on she could not get ahold of the bag to pull the can over we have never been so thankful for a trans can lid before one of the best purchases,90,22
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,5.0,positive,made with heavy duty plastic durable a must have for container,11,23
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,one hinge was snapped off when product arrived the other hinge would not close the lid just stayed in the down position,35,24
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,it worked just fine with the trash cans it matched i like the way it closes and it is very heavy duty and i think for the money you can not go wrong,32,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,for the most part this lid is great it covers the rubbermaid slim jim garbage cans perfectly my complaint rests with the flaps not always closing at times it gets caught on the garbage bag and at others it seems like the weights are not strong enough to close them a slight tap on the side gets them to close and these garbage cans fit nicely in tight spaces,68,26
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,can not get both lids to open while mounted on can,10,27
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,works great after being used a lot only issue is when it arrived one of the flaps did not go back into place after being pushed down it still does not bounce back up all the time after someone puts trash thru it but it is only that one flap we can live with that,52,28

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,4.0,positive,i got this for my 4 year old son who needed something tactile to fidget with my son loved the ball and does use it and i love that you can clip it onto things however i am only rating it 4 stars becuase my hope was that i could clip it to his belt loop so he woudnt lose it at school but it is too heavy and too big think sized for adult hands if they could make a smaller version of this i would be so happy some people complained that there was a film on the ball i did not experience this and it has held up extreemly well to the trials and tribulations of an active 4 yo,123,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,i have many tactile hand toys but this is my least favorite it does not squish enough my students do not like this one either,23,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,my son is 7 and has aspergers syndrome with sensory issues he finds fidget tools soothing i liked theof this one having a clip that could maybe go on a belt loop as he constantly misplaces his toys the plastic on this ball is too stiff so it is hard for him to squeeze it is much too large for his hand the plastic feels oily i do not know how to describe it other than that i was hoping he would be able to squish it he has lost it already i thinks it is a greatbut the product itself leaves a lot to be desired,108,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005P3NJ0A,2.0,negative,has some hard nobby thing i side and very hard not at all what i expected did not bother giving it to my son,23,7

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,2.0,negative,does not fit well on littmann cardio 3 or 4 and on lightweight either and it adds a lot of weight,21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,1.0,negative,it is way too big to be used on a normal stethoscope like the littmann classic it is pretty much useless in this combination,24,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,4.0,positive,my only issue is that it can not attach well to the stethoscope due to it is size,16,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ZCM43JU,2.0,negative,too much big for a female really annoys u when u have to check a patient after putting it on very cute but disappointed that i can not use it,29,11

Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4.0,positive,I have been playing shakuhachi pipe flutes for about ten years now and am now able to produce tones that sound pretty fair but please be aware that it took months of casual practice before this was so with this style of flute you are essentially making your mouth be the mouthpiece the technique is not unlike getting a tone when blowing into a jug or glass soda bottle your mouth needs to change shape some for each note as well i like this flute and take it with me when I am out and about by itself or in drum and hand instrument circles it sounds quite nice i got applause from the other musicians last time i had a little solo with it this flute can be surprisingly expressive it is also priced such that if something happens to it it is no big deal,143,0
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1.0,negative,you can not call this an instrument do not waste your money on this a plastic flute sounds better then this just horrible,23,1
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5.0,positive,great price great value i received it in record time extremely fast shipping would definitely purchase from them again,20,2
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4.0,positive,greatfor students or beginners very playable binding may not be green as shown mine came in ugh pink,20,3
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1.0,negative,I am not an expert and know very little about the shakuhachi but i did do some research and I am convinced that the utaguchi the place on the instrument where you breathe is too large I have read articles commenting on this that it is common on cheaply built instruments i would compare pictures with the more expensive ones and you can see the difference anyway do plenty of research before you purchase this one,72,4
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4.0,positive,shakuhachi is hard to play but it helps if you have experience with other wind instruments i was making decent tone within 15 minutes and by the end of the evening can play an expressive range across 3 octaves the tuning on this for the low c is good but the minor pentatonic seems a little off as you work your way up the scale and is exacerbated in the higher registers so i think some of the pythagorean intervals could use some work or maybe it is just my western ear but it works i would definitely call it a beginner instrument but the tone is strong and beautiful and definitely musical,113,5
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5.0,positive,for it is price it is perfect with practice you can make very smooth and clear sound i loved it,18,6
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4.0,positive,the company definitely delivered a high quality product in a speedy manner no fault with the company or product but only with the description this is not an easy instrument to play I am experienced with tin whistles and i could barely get a note out of it a friend with several years of flute experience did a much better job but still struggled to get anything melodic out of it for the cheap price it is worth the risk but not recommended for novices,83,7
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1.0,negative,it is very difficult to strike a note any note including off-key shrieking on this flute if i had to make a guess the problem is that theone blows air across is not very cleanly cut perhaps it has been damaged by handling but it just does not look very well done i can easily get a turkishto play it is played like a pop bottle the wikipedia article on shakuhachi shows an instrument with a very sharpmade on some sort of inlay the instrument i received clearly lacks this sharp,98,8
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5.0,positive,good quality shakuhachi i just have not been able to get the sound to work I have heard it is a little tricky but i am close,24,9
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,5.0,positive,the sound of the shakuhachis low mellow sound is very soothing for me i love the sound of the shakuhachi,20,10
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i bought this to use as a handbag with my 1920s gangster outfit for a company party it was perfect yes it is plastic yes it does not tolerate rough handling hey what do you expect for this price i read the product information so i knew what size it was before i ordered it i popped my cell phone drivers license and some cash in there and carried it around all evening it made my costume it was too cute for words and everyone who saw it loved it i can not wait to have another excuse to use it,98,0
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i bought this violin to be used as a container to put a floral design in it i entered a floral competition and came in 3rd i was thrilled the thme was the godfather it looked fanastic decorated with red roses and red carnations,44,1
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,piece of junk the worthless clasp broke the first time we opened it and tried to shut it again plastic toy overpriced too expensive to try and ship back i am just going to give it away as a gift to our music teacher propped open and filled with candy or something nothing i would really keep for my kids,60,2
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,i thought it would be a full size plastic violin case to fit a toy tommy gun it is about 1/4 the size of an actual case,26,3
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,this was just a super cute accessory but the cost to ship it seemed disproportionate to it is size and weight granted i got it shipped to australia but i also go other items that cost far lest,37,4
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,this case is made of very cheap plastic and broke within one hour after we received it unfortunately i did not have enough time to return it for a replacement so that is just money down the drain i will not order from this company in the future however,46,5
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,a bit small although i should have read the description before hastily ordering this for a halloween custume it is sturdy although and the latches do not stick my teenager is using it as an art supply case it is probably half the size of a normal violin case,46,6
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,very cute perfect size for my 6 year old nephews costume hard to open although,15,7
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,it was a lot smaller than i expected but it worked out fine dimensions on the listing would be a big help,22,8
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,this is very small take the time to look at the dimensions,12,9
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,not what i expected i was looking for a regular size violin case and this is not what i wasbelieve it was,24,10
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the size i knew it would be a cheap facsimile of a violin case but it was much smaller than the size i expected seller shipped it quickly,32,11
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,so small it could be used as a pencil case would work only as a babys costume prop,18,12
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,i thought it would have handbag straps but the thick handle to carry like a purse over 25 makes adding one impossible and i need my hands free to film so if you like carrying it as a purse all night it is perfect for you also it is smaller than expected will not hold all i need it too so it will be a challenge to use this with all I had hoped to carry in it instead of small camera bag that is smaller but holds all i need to bring just not at all gangster violin case is about 4 - 5 in main with about 3 4 of unusable space in long skinny part should have got tommy gun shoulder bag instead,121,13
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,hit of the party this made my husband 20s gangster outfit it is small although but it did not matter,20,14
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,5.0,positive,i was warned it was a small inexpensive toy so i open it very carefully looked perfect for my prohibition party,21,15
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,used this for my 2 year old sons out fit works fine would be too small for an adult to use as a prop,24,16
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,2.0,negative,the case is way smaller than expected i should of read the reviews before i purchased there was no size description that i could find so here are my measurements apporximately 14 1/2 long 5 3/4 at the widest part and 2 1/2 deep hope this helps someone else when looking at this product,54,17
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,u need to put more info about it i thought it was for a full size violin not a toy,20,18
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,4.0,positive,even at the most generous measurement this is only 14 1/2 inches long however i read the reviews and question answers and was prepared for this fine for what i bought it for a prop for roaring 20s photo op w / costumes nothing too fancy just fun if you are looking for realism this is not it however it arrived on time undamaged and is fairly sturdy,65,19
Musical_Instruments,B000W5MRW2,1.0,negative,it was not what we expected we were looking for a real violin case,14,20
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i use 2 of these very thin nanokeys one for the right hand one for the left had and have them plugged into a laptop with pianoteq installed set them at different octives and it works very well touch sensitive keys in such a compact form awesome 5 well earned small,51,0
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,the korg nanokey is great for the traveling musician when was the last time that you wrote and recorded music on a flight or in a car and did it comfortably even if you have it probably was not this easy to get set up it may not be the sturdiest feeling keyboard in the world but for the price it is awesome the software is not too bad either once you find it it would be nice if it just shipped with the software or a link that actually sends you to the software but it took only 5 minutes to find it online and i was up and running it works great on windows 7 I am very satisfied and am considering getting the other two controllers nanopad and nanokontrol soon,129,1
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,running in her blood is the pure soul of rock and roll she is amazing,15,2
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,like probably most computer composers I have lived with the tradeoffs of trying to have a computer keyboard and a midi keyboard handy when basically they are designed to be in the exact same position relative to my hands while i will not be writing masterpieces with this little guy the size puts it right where i want it for putting in a few notes or chords while keeping my desktop organized for regular non-musical work just having it there is like finally getting to scratch an itch I have had for years the build quality is very good for what it is a tiny handy two octave musical data entry tool also it looks very cool,112,3
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,great little keyboard excellent for traveling however when i received it one of the keys did not work so i had to get a replacement the keys do feel a bit on the cheaper side of things a little bit wobbly plastic springy-feel but it works fine the velocity is fine too works much better than using your keyboard pad if you are a logic user which does not have velocity sensitivity,69,4
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i bought this keyboard specifically to learn to play piano / get used to note locations while it is perfect for it is intended use i was slightly disappointed in the mechanism of the keys they do not press down quite as easily as i had hoped you do not necessarily haveto put a whole lot of force into pushing them but you do need to be thorough when doing it and there is not a whole lot of feedback for when the connection is made however with some getting used to it would be no issue at all,93,5
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i loved this keyboard like some i had a few problems to record with it i had to use 2 computers and do an analog feed no big deal i live jerry rigging then i was able to download thousands of korg instrument sounds wow i used this for almost 2 years and the usb connection broke very poorly made i used the device a lot but have never had this kind of a musical device failure be careful with this device it is fragile,85,6
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i was delighted with this keyboard for the price it definitely has some serious shortcomings the keys feel like keyboard keys and the lack of contour makes it much harder to locate your hand on the keyboard without looking think of it as a small portable velocity-sensitive computer keyboard take it with you on your next stay in a hotel room and be happy that you have something to mess around on,72,7
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,this is a great product easily connects to any computer and easily fits in a laptop case / backpack for easy travel this product is very easy to use and did not take very long before i had it running like a dream with both apple garageband and apple logic express the only problem with this keyboard is that it is sometimes hard to press the keys when you are trying to do soft strokes also the velocity is sometimes hard to keep consistent depending upon where on the key you are striking,91,8
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,pros it is the most portable and the least expensive usb midi keyboard out there cons it is very difficult to use for recording music the keys are built like a laptop keyboard it is difficult for entering chords playing melodies the keys do not provide the proper feel when playing they squish when you press them it is hard to explain it is ok for entering in melodies one note at a time i can see how this could be very useful for the traveling composer because it is extremely thin but that portability comes at a price usability i should have bought the akai lpk25 instead normally i love korg products they make some of the most amazing innovative stuff like the kaos series it is just that this product does not provide the tactile feedback of a real keyboard and it is too difficult to enter chords for me verdict this keyboard is extremely portable so it is a good 2nd keyboard for the traveling composer but i would not recommend using it as a primary keyboard in a home studio as it only provides very limited utility,183,9
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,the nano series is perfect for the musician / producer who wants to have beneficial aspects of being in a studio all in portable devices the nanokey is very good ultraslim and works with almost all programs i do recommend,38,10
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,the korg nano key is an answer to my prayers as a guitar player with no piano experience whatsoever i was stymied when first learning to use a daw digital audio workstation i knew nothing of midi or the dozen or so vsti plugins that came with the daw i knew i needed a keyboard but did not want to sink a lot of money into one enter the nano key it does everything i need for entering midi data into the daw it is velocity sensitive meaning the harder you hit the key the louder the note sounds I am sure some will say it is light weight or a cheap piece of plastic but i do not intend to do much pounding on the keys after all I am not little richard or jerry lee louis laughing out loud hey for 35 bux I am completely satisfied,139,11
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,great basic midi controller for the price and intended purpose it is fantastic dead easy to set up and intuitive only drawbacks are expected ones because it is such an entry level device the keys have no pivot point and feel like computer keys rather than piano keys the keyboard itself is scaled down significantly so playing chords can get quite squashed also the pitch bend tool is a button not a wheel so you have no control over the speed of the bend or the inflection amount for a basic cheap midi controller it is fantastic and does the job very well i use it primarily for input into finale 2010 via the speedy entry tool and it works perfectly takes up very little real estate on my desk which is a bonus,133,12
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,this midi keyboard controller is nice and compact it fits in a side pocket of my computer bag it has the range of an entire piano when you use the octave up / down keys so there is no problem entering notes in any octave i use it toenter music into finale and it works great the only drawback is that the keys are kind of cheap and do not have a positive feel to them when you push them down like a computer or midi keyboard other than that the korg nanokey is a great addition to my computer bag,99,13
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i just received the korg nano key it is stylish small / thin which i wanted and fairly functional but the keys feel like stiff laptop keys i was expecting something a little easier to play i do not really need the unit for anything fancy but i do not think it work even for what i need,54,14
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,hardware never played the keyboard before and purchased this one to create simple chord progressions one octave only very limited space between keys and very bad sensitivity unables you to make nuances or to make accents decently very good to on the go music because of it is size but not rugged enough keys started to fall apart around two months after purchase software very good software included and easy to install too tested it in cubase 345 reaper and various vsts the key mapping is almost perfect in every case overall i consider the product more like in the toy side than for professional use,106,15
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,I have gone through three of these in the last two years i guess i do not learn too easily the first one broke because the usb connection cracked i opened it up to see if it could be repaired and realized the only thing that had been holding the connector to the circuit board was a tiny blob of solder the second one lost several of it is keys because i had it in a padded laptop bag the slightest amount of pressure will because the keys to fly off like springs and they are designed in such a way that they can never be put back on correctly I am now on my third nanokey a few keys have popped off this one as well I have glued them back on with silicon but this affects the action but even in new condition the key action on this device is no more playable than a computer keypad how such a product ever got past the r d stage is incredible for a while this was the only mini-controller on the market but now that the akai lpk25 is available I shall be picking up one of those as soon as i can find a place that has them in stock,204,16
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,small light and compact the nano key is perfect for the in home studio setup,15,17
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i got this because it is so compact and easy to toss into my briefcase you will have to get use to the small amount of key stroke compared to any real keyboard for single note entry it is fine however if you want to enter a three-note chord with any black notes forget it you know how when you depress the edges of black keys that you slide in depressing the far inside part of the white key well there is no far inside part of the white key it does not exist which makes chord entry very slow four-note chord with any black keys forget it spend the extra 10 and get some real keys,113,18
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i got one of these things when it was new and loved it it was usable rather inexpensive and tiny however it recently broke i had it in a cabinet and i slid a magazine on top of it one of the pages caught a couple of keys and tore them off wow this thing is fragile it is ok if you take care of it but useless when you have to throw it away akai came out with the lpk25 which is the same concept but looks more like a real keyboard it is about the same width and depth as the nanokey but is over twice as thick which may or may not be a factor for you the lpk25 adds an arpeggiator but drops the pitch-bend buttons the nanokey also comes with a license for the basic m1 software synth also usable as athat the akai does not come with and the akai is about 20 more,162,19
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,the keyboard is compact and works very well fr such a small package it has many features and I am satisfied witht this purchase i would recomend it to everyone,28,20
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,the keys were much like a laptop keyboard which had little depth and made a loud click when you used them which irked me,25,21
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,although the laptop-style keys are a far cry from a real piano this lightweight modular keyboard lives up to all it is promises with a little practice any issues i had with velocity sensitivity or missed notes disappeared if you are looking for an ultra-portable easy to use midi keyboard that costs about half what i would have payed for something this useful look no further,64,22
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,super cheap super small does the job I am not a keyboardist and do not use it to perform i use it paired with finale and my macbook for putting together sheet music does the job simply and well and fits in my little laptop bag uses just one cable no power cord or batteries required it was exactly what i need,60,23
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i thought it would make writing music easier however it was just more of a pain first it took me three days to set it up it did not come with directions and offered no technical support second once i finally got it working it was very glitchy and did not work well with the music software i have finale 2010 it was delayed and did not read notes well it is a low price because it is pretty much useless i will likely never use this product do not waste your money,89,24
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i got this for when i am working away from home i use finale and sibelius and need something for note input mainly chorded input the size of it is very small not even as thick as your average magazine for that reason i would pack it carefully do not put it in a soft pack because it appears that it would not hold up well under normal travel impacts luggage handling and more my last portable midi controller was a novation this one is literally an eighth of the size of that one it works as advertised i am happy,99,25
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,was hoping to have a decent midi controller to take on the road product arrived with several keys not working right out of the box was not expecting much for the price but especially considering brand name this is disappointing not recommended,41,26
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i was looking for an inexpensive midi controller to connect to a pc for my 5 year old to play around with he has already playing with my old dx-7 and does well at drums he has making his own songs using an iphone based application i have so i wanted to see if i could get him going with an inexpensive basic multitrack midi based studio i read all the reviews about this against the akai and decided he does not need anything fancy or expensive he may only like this for a week or not at all and i did not want to spend a lot of money this is essentially a computer keyboard with large buttons i plugged it into my pc and loaded up mixcraft 5 it worked fine but the velocity sensitivity is so bad i really had to apply a good amount of force to get reasonable volume out of this there was no real control over the sensitivity and given my frustration over it there is no way my 5yo would have done well with this at all it is already boxed up and ready to go back tomorrow,191,27
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,i was looking for something similar about 15 years ago there was no such thing so i waited after i bought it i was reading the reviews and getting buyers remorse because of what buyers were saying about the keys falling off and it being cheap cheap was why i bought it having 4 kids and all i bought this nano key to use with reason 4 the only downside is latency now i have to wait until next tax season to get a sound card the keyboard is well worth the price,93,28
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,if this thing was 10 dollars i would say yeah go for it maybe it would be nice for your laptop when you are on a road trip or something assuming you do not have a mac and are not using logic or garage band which have keyboard pianos built in unfortunately it is not 10 dollars it is 60 dollars the thing seriously feels like a toy and not a well made toy it feels like the kind of toy you buy at the dollar store it is plastic keys make snapping sounds when you press them down which make you think it is going to break at any moment not only that but sometimes the keys just do not work are they seriously asking for 60 dollars when it clearly costs under a dollar to make korg you have gone downhill since the 80s get your act together i owned a korg m3 for a while which is the top of the line music workstation it did not impress me either a week after i bought it a few of the drum pads stopped working and i returned it bottom line is do not bother with this nano it is not worth your time,196,29
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,un producto excelente con un gran desempeo facil de utilizar ideal para presentaciones en vivo y no estar llevando muchas cosas,21,30
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,keys are far too small to play anything it is too soft really different from regular keys you have to hit them hard to get a sound strong enough used with cakewalk other full size quality keyboards work well the keyboard is built well and the quality overall is good the problem is really it is low sensitivity,56,31
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i know this is not suppose to replace a full size midi keyboard however it feels cheap one of the buttons i had seemed like you had to hit harder to get a sound i looked into having korg replace it the cost of shipping and waiting for the exchange would have been way more than the cost of buying one,60,32
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,i bought this for my husband he has a pretty smart guy but is currently having problems setting it up on his computer,21,33
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,and the key response is poor check out reviews on this versus the akai lpk25 before you make a decision,20,34
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i bought the korg nanokey with much excitement from the very good reviews but my experience with the product is similar to the person who wrote the bad review right out of the box one of the keys was not working a few days after i discovered it was unhinged and it eventually fell off the rest of the keys are ok plus the key sensitivity is good as advertised however the keys are just not sturdy and secure that minimal transit can because them to fall off,89,35
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i was looking for a simple keyboard to play around with apples garageband and that is what i got with this korg it is very good and i like that the keys are velocity sensitve but the keys are a tad small and while you can use this for learning to play or to goof around in garageband i would not want to try and play anything more than a melody with it i suppose if you are good at using the octave up and octave down keys you could do something more complex overall i like the keyboard the downloadable software m1 is wayyyy more complex than i need with the ability to change all kinds of parameters might be good for someone that knows more about midi than i do,129,36
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,nicely done thank you appreciate the fast service,8,37
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,i eventually got rid of this on craigslist because several of the keys kept popping off when playing with just a little force i recommend the newer version from korg,30,38
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,it works but be careful very fragile our cat knocked it of a table onto the carpet the three foot fall caused a good portion of the keys to pop off the board rendering it useless i was not too freaked out over the loss of this as i rarely used it in the first place i thought it would be nice for doodling ideas with when i was away from home but it is felt very unnatural to play and reminded me more of the toy keyboards i buy for our six year old not very practical the slider and the percussion versions may have met my needs more most daws have a setting for using your typing keyboard as an interface comparing that to the nanokey 25 i would save your money instead and use what you have you probably will not notice the difference either,145,39
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,i mainly use to trigger my drums in my daw a little too small to use as an actual keyboard but i did not need it for that works well as a simple controller and it does what it says,39,40
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,my son was studying music education in college and needed something to compose and arrange music that he could use with his computer we purchased this and it has met te intended purpose with perfection,35,41
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,4.0,positive,nice little keyboard it is very easy to transport if you travel a lot and it gets the job done,20,42
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,5.0,positive,worked perfectly great product for production on the go i travel a lot and when i want to make a beat while in a hotel room i can easily pull this out of my laptop bag and have at it,40,43
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,did the job one pest c string was out of tune and this little guy allows me to make any quick adjustments without shelling out 75 to tuner,28,0
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,i prefer this style of handle because it fits inside the piano better and I am not sure who broke their handle but maybe they need to work on not jerking the tuning pegs so much i did my entire piano and the long handle allowed for a finer adjustment also great price especially because i did not need all of the sponges mutes and more that are in other kits,68,1
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,works great but i wish it were just slightly longer to give more torque i have a very old piano and have to micro-tap this thing with one hand while turning it with the other to get small adjustments of around 3 - 5 cents I am sure with another 15 - 2 inches extra on the handle i could get it down to 1 cent I am tempted to take it to the saw and weld it onto a bigger rod,76,2
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,it did a good job tuning the strings to themselves on my piano which had a some strings that were out of whack it easily tuned the strings that had dropped out of tune and if i got a little sharp it allowed me to loosen the string and try it again the square end fit tightly on the square pegs and did not have any play in it i have yet to tune my piano with a tuner because it was not that far out and i did not have that much time on the day i got it so i can not comment on how durable it is in the long run yet the fake wood plastic handle did not feel like it was going to break at any point it has been worth the money i paid for it just getting it back in tune with itself i will update my review if i find the quality to be poor when i redo the whole piano to a tuner but otherwise you can assume it still works good at this time I am happy m,182,3
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this is a good price for a useful tool i like it i used it and it worked well for our piano,22,4
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,thought to be on the safe side but the handle broke when used the second time i can not recommend this hammer,21,5
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this tuning hammer easily fit in my hand and did the job perfectly i have small hands and appreciate finding tools that are easy to use,26,6
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,small good for quick touchup would not want to do an entire piano with this tool,17,7
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,too short hard to use with any degree of accuracy get a bigger one,14,8
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it works but this is so short it seemed harder to use than the ones with a longer handle,19,9
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,i was really excited to start tuning my piano that I have had for years now however i realized too late that this wrench is much to short to be even slightly accurate you are going to be struggling for a long time trying to get it in tune on top of that the fit of the wrench is less than ideal it has a lot of wiggle room definitely not something you want for a tuner as it will slip off if you let go of it the worst part of it is that after about 3 or so hours of using it the handle slipped right off of the metal wrench part seems like very cheap glue was used to secure the two pieces i can not recommend this product i suggest spending more money and getting a tool you can be accurate with that will also save you time,150,10
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,do not buy this product if you want an accurate and non frustrating tuning experience 1 it is way too small you need to attack something to the back to extend it if you want the leverage to tune easily and accurately 2 it bends a lot it has a lot of give this makes it really hard to tune accurately since the thin neck of this hammer will bend quite a few degrees before it provides enough pressure to the tuning pin to turn it 3 this has a square hole instead of a star the star is superior i know that this is the cheapest but it is not worth it spend an extra 20 dollars and get a decent hammer this one is just a waste of money i would have taken it back except that it was a gift,141,11
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,worked perfectly for me my piano was so far out of tune one of the strings that was supposed to play a b was closer to playing an e so it definitely was worth it particularly since it is only a couple of bucks,43,12
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it works but it is loose on the pegs a bit shallow and a bit short,16,13
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,really really s m a l l useless for the fine adjustments needed for tuning,15,14
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,delivered on time and it works great also can not beat the price,12,15
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,could have had a longer handle could have had an angled handle but it could have been 50 used a smartphone app as a tuner and a couple hours later it was a done deal,34,16
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this worked for what we needed it for but if you are going to use it alot i would not waste your money on this one we used it to take apart an old piano,33,17
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,does his job i managed to tune my piano and save lot of,14,18
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,works great for the baby grand saves alot of money iphone piano tuner app helps,16,19
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,granted this is the cheapest one offered by amazon so no complaints if i had it to do over i would have spent a bit more for a wrench with a longer handle a tighter fit and a star asterisk shaped hole it is a little harder to get the wrench at the correct angle with only 4 contact surfaces still it works fine,63,20
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,very loose fit to not fitting most pins at all had to wiggle and wobble to remove which put the piano further out of tune do not waste your money,29,21
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,the piano tuning wrench was very cheaply made after very much fine tuning on my upright piano i began to notice a hairline crack in the plastic i did not think much of it until one day it completely cracked in half this is a good tool if you are going to use it lightly but not a very good tool for fine tuning a lot,65,22
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,too short and seems to wear out pretty fast would invest in a better one in the future,18,23
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,i used it to take out a couple hundred pins in a piano and it held together you are getting what you pay for it has a plastic handle and the pins get stuck in it but it is cheap and gets the job done,45,24
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,poor constructed socket that did not fit my pianos tuning heads returning,12,25
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,by the time i was 1/3 done the soft metal had deformed into a useless circle,16,26
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,oversized for either set of tuning pins i needed it for loose sloppy poorly made this will damage any tuning pins it is used on,25,27
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this has a metal socket and neck with a plastic handle simply does what it is supposed to do when tuning a piano a lot of the difficulty comes in how tight / old the pegs are not on how expensive the wrench is i was able to fine tune an old upright with no problem and also take strings completely off with little effort but again this will vary by piano,70,28
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,fit too loosely on piano pegs so tuning was difficult handle broke after several uses buy a better one,19,29
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,works well i wish the handle was a little longer jl,10,30
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,very good value and works well as expected,8,31
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,broke within one hour of using it metal shaft does not go all the way thru the handle and it snapped off,22,32
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,my husband attached some sort of tool to the end of it for easier tuning but other than that worked fabulously and much cheaper than paying the piano tuner 150 to come to the house,33,33
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,this broke on a d key one with two strings it is good for it is price and works fine on the keys that have 3 strings but it can not handle much pressure at all,33,34
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,not a very reliable or effective tuning hammer it barely grips the pegs and some pegs just slide around inside it,21,35
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,it fits to tune the piano but after a while i was getting a lot of play the tool will soon strip and i will have to buy another better off getting a better quality on,36,36
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,the plastic handle snapped on the very first attempt to tune I am still using it without the handle and it works fine just a little awkward you get what you pay for,31,37
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,great tool saved me 500 on a retuning,8,38
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,very cheaply made soft metal barely made it through one tuning before being so stripped it was useless returned and ordered a different one,25,39
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,while this hammer works fine i should have bought one with a longer handle the hammer is quite small which makes it difficult to fine-tune the strings a larger hammer would make it easier to make small movements or adjustments when trying to tune a piano it takes forever to get a string exactly in tune i think it is worth to spend a bit more money and get a better hammer with a larger handle,76,40
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,this tuning hammer together with the mute kit and the olympus l-12 recorder with tuner all helped me in tuning my daughters piano and will probably keep helping me in the future,32,41
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,it stripped out on the second tuning pin i used on a waste of money,15,42
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this wrench allowed me to tune my antique piano for free along with an android phone tuning application i am very happy with it,24,43
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this worked great for my needs which was to loosen the strings on my piano to get to the screws underneath which i needed to unscrew to remove the string plate from the back of the piano and then hang it on my wall as a decorative piece,48,44
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,this is a very inexpensive tuning hammer but it works and I am glad i finally got one so i can make tiny tuning corrections to my piano,27,45
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,terrible product not only does the length of the handle make for inaccurate tuning but it is head fits the tuning pin loosely i had actually measured the size of my tuning pins beforehand and they fit exactly the measurements of the head while trying to tune my piano i had to jimmy the tool to get it to turn and when it turned it did so at an odd angle after being nearly done with my first note with this tool the head itself stripped all in all this thing will definitely turn two or three tuning pins but do not count on it to tune your entire piano it is much more difficult to use it than it should be and more likely than not it will because damage to your piano like it did mine,135,46
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,came rusty in the package did not bother returning just threw it away for fear of tetanus,16,47
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,was skeptical but it was so cheap i gave it a try i have a weber baby grand at my vacation home and can not easily schedule tunings to align with when i am there but i wanted to get some of the bad odd notes fixed did the trick i used a phone app for tuning and this did entire piano in about 2 hours first try and now do as needed not a replacement for long term care but great for my situation,84,48
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,soft metal starting to strip inside square now looks more like a circle after about 8 hours of tuning,19,49
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,quite small and makes it hard to reach the point one wants when tuning,14,50
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,worked perfect and made piano tuning much easier,8,51
Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,2.0,negative,the clip on the neck strap is too big you have to jam it on the cleaning brush is too thick gets stuck easily the end cap actually broke off inside my clarinet reeds are very low quality,38,0

Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,5.0,positive,exactly as described however i thought that the cleaning cloth would be one of the weighted ones for cleaning the clarinet or any of the woodwinds because the description does not state what type of cleaning cloth i can not hold them responsible,42,6

Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,1.0,negative,cork grease was missing from the kit certainly not 5-in-1,10,13

Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,thedoes erase well if you use fine quality paper it does not erase well on cheap paper i suggest if you are using these to sketch you use moleskine sketchbooks which use a heavier paper than most brands i use thisa lot and i mean a lot when i sketch it is helpful when i am laying down a foundation for character work in my sketchbook now that i own it i can not see myself not using it i can not believe more brands are not mimicking thislead thing i was able to find blue pentellon another site i wish amazon carried it,110,2

Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i was expecting this to be exactly like the blackrefills only in red unfortunately it is not the same quality as the blackrefills and breaks very easily i found the constant breaking frustrating and gave up using it i would not buy this product again,48,5
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i disliked this product because it does not erase completely and it is pointless since i wanted to use this in my math class,22,6
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,received the wrongi received 07 mm instead of 05 mm,10,7
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,the kids were so tickled especially our youngest to get this product they really love theof havingthat is ait works well but the novelty effect for children is even better than the product itself,39,8

Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i mean i got what i asked for when i bought red pencili got red pencili did not however expect such weak quality it is difficult to use for what i intended it for I am disappointed i can not apply too much pressure or it will snap which means i do not get as strong aas i was hoping for,62,10
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,easy broken colour is light and broke easily,8,11

Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i tried thisabout 15 years ago and it was terrible i tried it again recently and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be firstly theis very light inyou can barely see it when writing on white paper it is really more of a light pink than a red as well secondly theis very brittle it breaks constantly even when writing with a light touch i can barely write a few lines without a breakage given this fact i do not think thisis useful for anything more than making check marks on papers i certainly can not do any serious writing with it lastly it feels very strange to write with it granted it is not a graphitethe feel is still unusual like trying to write with something made of wax if thiswere not so brittle and light init might be worthwhile but alas i simply can not use it,170,17
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,just got it today so i decided to try it out first off i bought this to sketch with i see many reviews on this product saying it breaks too easily from what i can tell it does not break that easily as far as the lines on paper i can sort of compare it to colored pencil like but not necessarily overall i like this product and i am very glad i bought it,74,18
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,very cheap breaks easily dony bother putting it in through the tip because it shall peel and erases terribly do not waste your money,22,19

Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,breaks constantly so much so that is it not useable,9,21
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,i use them for design drawing markups red-pencils are bolder so i keep those handy these allow me to make finer detailed notations it is true that theis softer than black leads but as long as you are gentle enough they work just fine i put a red-band of fingernail polish on my pencil so that i know which one has the red leads in it,66,22
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,breaks at the slightest pressure poor quality,8,23
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,not brightnot good for writing at all eraser can not remove this pencil so it is pretty much the same as ball-point pen not what i expected,27,24
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,thebreaks very easily however I am able to get a good range of values for sketching and it is really fun to use coloreddefinitely pick it up for the price of it,34,25
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,we use these in our inspection pencils and they are just what you expect,14,26
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,there is no such thing as redour pencilis actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon cc this is actually very thin wax the same kind found inpencils i love this it pairs off with the 5 steadler pencil i received as a gift nicely it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact you must be soft with it and use many layers one thing i learned is that you should only use about 1 mm or 2 mm ofat a time coming out of the pencil I have attached some photos of my doodles i do at work while combing thiswith graphite and sumi ink respectively,126,27
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,they break fairly easily but that is no indication of poor quality it is just the nature of coloredgo with 07 mm for colored leads it is much more durable,29,28
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,too fragile press hard enough to see the writing and they break,12,29
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,use these a lot for sketching very smooth and easy to use,12,30
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,thebreaks easily when using a steel mechanical pencil only use in a plastic one if you do not want it to break every stroke,25,31
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,good product but breaks easily going back to regular red pencils,11,32
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,these break if you even look at them,8,33
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,it is cool that it is mechanical and red it makes ticking work easy thebreaks so often although it is barely worth even trying,26,34
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,this is basically just led removed from a colored pencil and coined for writing works very poorly less effective than simply writing with a colored pencil to begin with,29,35
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,i work as an intern for a construction company and to make corrections to drawings we use red pencil and this works perfectly in my pentel 1000 graphgear pencil however if too much force is used while writing thetends to break quite often other than that this stuff works great,52,36
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,theis very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks it is not a dark red and can be hard to see if not using on white paper it does not erase easily but you can erase it if you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light inand fragile than this is your pick i can not really say i have tried others,71,37
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,i homeschool and was going through red pens like mad decided a pencil would be cheaper and work better so ordered these they work fine but the next time I shall probably try to get them for my 09 pencil the 05requires that you write lightly and to get red pencils to really show on students papers you have to press a little harder than normal,67,38
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,this product is exactly what i ordered and it arrived quickly thebreaks easily but is expected out of red 05 mm,23,39
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,thisis very soft and will break on a regular basis theis very light if you try to reduce the amount of pressure you use,28,40
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,like most i wanted to have a second mech pencil with redfor markup i do not know how hard some reviewers stroke is but these work fine for me with no breakage yet even pressing hard however they are more waxy than blackso when pressing hard they do wear quickly and they do erase but not nearly as readily as normal blackas tothese are red not pantone whatever maybe they are a shade of pink but they are red as distinguishable from black which is all i think they are meant to be,101,41
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i am a teacher and was hoping to use these for grading since i prefer writing with a pencil these did not work out at all for me thebreaks every few minutes annoying i will try a thicker gauge,41,42
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i can certainly would like use good colored auto pencils to underline my bible and supplement my drawing pads but i found this redto be a little light when drawing and i had to press harder so i like the concept but please make something with more ease of drawing and deeper,55,43
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,thewas not red but a light pink thewas hard and scratchy i could neot even see the lines unless i used heavy pressure,27,44
Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,took kind of a while to arrive it is a fine pentel product some people has complained it breaks easily and it does break easier than regularbut I am sure it is difficult to make coloredas hard as regular i press really hard when i write so i just had to be mindful and it was fine,58,45
Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,if you have to red line or correct tests homework or mechanical drawings this is what you want to use it produces a fine accurate line for any 05 mm mechanical pencil once your peers see your handiwork they will all be asking you for a piece of red led for their correcting pencil it can not be erased like a pen so it is pretty much tamper proof red marking,68,46
Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i bought the redfor correcting papers but it has proven useless theis very soft and crumbles easily while writing the crumbling is especially a pain when revising papers because i think i tend to press harder while correcting small detailed text features also theis too light and compared to regularthere is no advantage it also does not erase so clearly i wish i had not bought this especially so much of it,79,47
Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,thisis very soft if you push out more than a millimeter it breaks i find i can not use thiswithout feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper if you advance it any further thebreaks very disappointing product,44,48
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,it worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month I am so exasperated a previous panasonic cordless phone i had was muffled for the person i was talking to apparently with this phone they can hear my clearly but i can barely hear a word they are saying sometimes it is really hard to hear and other times it is downright impossible either way terrible it is like having your tv on volume setting 1 you can hear there is some kind of faint noise but you just can not make out anything being said,99,0
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,this phone has every feature i was looking for and alot more too it is very simple to set up and is user friendly i love it,28,1
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,the unit provides crystal clear phone service in conjunction with a dsl and wifi system it does what it says it does it is well worth the price,28,2
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,phones work just like they are supposed to my wife wishes they came with clips so you could carry them around the house or yard while doing other things overall a good value,33,3
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,excellent clarity user friendly for programming does not have capability for receiving messages,13,4
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i used this phone once and put it back in it is annoyingly complex packaging for return to start the handsets are poorly designed on my first call i twice hung up on my callers since the off button is located exactly where you would rest the phone against your cheek besides this two of the three handsets had communication problems with the base even when they were in direct sight of the base such that they could not maintain a constant dial tone and kept cutting out,87,5
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i recently purchased the four handset version of this system and am very pleased with it all of the features are convenient and work well and the voice quality is very good one feature i especially like is that it can store up to 50 names and phone numbers in each handset and once programmed in one handset entries can easily be tranferred to the other handsets if desired another convenient feature is that the system can be used as an intercom with each handset capable of calling each of the other handsets this is the most complete and most convenient phone system I have ever had and i like the quality and reliability of panasonic products note however that this model is just a versatile cordless phone system and does not include an answering system this feature is included in model kx-tg5633 which also has all of the features discussed above,151,6
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,we have always considered panasonic phones and their other gear to be first rate but the volume on these phones even with all possible boost applied is much too low other reviewers on the target website have noted the same we have returned them for a set of well-rated uniden phones from amazon and are hoping for better results it is good that amazon has a fair return policy that makes this kind of disappointment less annoying,75,7
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i can not believe that this panasonic 58 ghz can not hold a candle to the verizon 900 mhz i gave up for this phone i could not hear my party at all buzzing noise horrible stay away from this phone returning today,41,8
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,this phone has it all as far as features as long as you do not want to actually hear the people you are talking to worked good for about a week and then could not hear anyone buzzing and sounded like people were standing next to an electric tower i tried several ways to fix the problem once i went back to my uniden 24 ghz i could hear great save your money,71,9
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,number entry from the handset keypad does not work properly this evidences itself in 2 ways 1 long phone numbers such as international do not dial properly 2 keypad activated programs like prescription refills do not recognize the numbers otherwise the phone worked fine except the handset volume was very weak even with the enhancement turned on but the number entry problem was extremely frustrating and a major issue for me i returned the phone and bought a uniden which seems to work fine,84,10
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,this phone has no back light on the key pad you can not see the key pad if you have to make a call in the middle of the night and or darkness this is a big deal panasonic phones used to have back lit key pads also you can hear a back ground buzz or white noise sound while you are on a call you and your callers will think i can not hear you now poor design,76,11
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,the phones work great no problems at all reception is excellent i would reccommend,14,12
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this phone was exactly what i needed i wanted a phone without an answering machine to put on a wall outlet i wanted at least 1 extra handset that did not need to be plugged into a phone jack with this phone i got an extra one lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones you can even assign different colors and rings to different callers one thing i do not like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from there are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone i have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and have not had a problem with either one the phone is pretty easy to program but i did have to read the instruction booklet,143,13
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,super if you have any type of interference from your computer dial up conection this is the phone to have even if you do not this phone is easy has great options love it absolutly no problems,37,14

Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this cordless phone has the best reception of any cordless telephone we have previously owned so far we like the feature of conference calling between three handsets the paging option for the handsets is another great feature to page another handset during a call to include another person in the conversation or to contact another person near one of the other handsets instead of yelling down the stairs the flashing lighted ring around the top of the antenna makes it convenient to locate the handset in the dark when you are receiving a call,94,16
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,you can not go wrong with this phone I have always been a fan of panasonic phones I have still got 3 old panasonic cordless phones that just will not die pros feels solid and comfortable in your hands sound quality is good even at a good distance from the home base speaker phone is clear and callers can hear me well blinking light on antenna for voice messages black and greyis attractive and looks good almost anywhere in house cons i wish the keypad had a backlight when you scroll through calls the name and number are not on the same screen,102,17
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,lots of good featuresunfortunatly the most important feature of a phone is clarity and this phone system does not deliver hard to hear your conversations,25,18
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,after having tried two other systems i found this one really worked well the handsets are very functional and the sound quality is excellent the speakerphone capability has proved handy i did not think i would use the intercom feature much but it turns out to be very handy given it comes with three handets we put all throughout the house,60,19
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,where to begin very difficult to hear even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets programming is not as easy as many other brands those are just a few of my concerns I shall pick a uniden model next time,57,20
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i have had these phones for a week now and at first they worked great and one week later you can hardly hear the person on the other end this is my second set i returned the first set for the same problem n hopes that it was just bad phones but the second set is just as horrible do not waist your money,63,21
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,overall i really like this phone great features and more however like some of the other reviewers who have posted here my phone began buzzing almost immediately so badly that i could not hear the person on the other end they could hear me fine since i have digital phone service connected to my dsl modem i followed the owners manual tip and bought a noise filter this worked fine for about a week then the buzzing returned i bought another filter thinking the first one had crapped out but the buzzing persisted i even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment which was in perfect working order i was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone so after much frustration I am returning this to amazon today luckily it has not been 30 days since delivery yet beware when considering buying this unit,151,22
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i bought these phones on the recommedation of a family member and i could not be more thrilled these are the best phones that we have ever used the sound quality is unbelievable and they had all the features we were looking for i have to emphtically disagree with some of the other reviews on this page you will not be sorry with this product,63,23
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,have not had the buzzing problems people have written about very nice range and clarity,14,24
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,1 there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base 2 phone features worked as advertised but the voice enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse 3 it was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset i returned it mainly because of the buzzing,62,25
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,at first i thought this phone had everything and it is loaded with features and has a good range however after using it for about 5 weeks i now have a very very loud buzzing noise on all the handsets it appears to come from the base and it is so loud i can barely hear the caller i have tested this base on other jacks still same problem and i have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack and they work fine with no buzz I am convinced it is in the base unit of the panasonic phone but after multiple email customer service attempts at panazonic i have not yet heard anything from this company I am scrapping the phone and buying a much cheaper but more highly rated at t,133,26
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,this is perfect for what i was looking for very rich and classy looking i would def look at other produces made by satechi,24,0
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,thought the product itself looked nice but the adhesive holding it together is already separating on day one no way to contact seller except for returningwould be willing to keep it for a discounted cost can glue it myself,40,1
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,a beautiful leather-looking desk pad it was beautifully packed and shipped very well the pad is sturdy and reversible for long life on my desk which is glossy and slippery i needed to purchase some velcro to prevent the pad from sliding when i moved my laptop this is a purchase you will love,54,2
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,i am going to buy another one as soon as i finish this review it is the nicest desk pad i have ever owned,24,3
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,great quality and has a wonderful feel to it only downside is that it is thicker than i would have liked,21,4
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,I have had the pad for roughly 18 months and it is still quite functional i have not had any major problems as i gently use for my keyboard and mouse no mouse pad needed i really like the size on how easy it is to keep clean a simple wipe does the trick another thing i like about it is that it at least in my case is resilient to scratches scuffs and dents however the glue and stitching it poor is some areas especially when the humidity is high that being said it serves it is purpose very nicely,101,5
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,cheaply built filled with cardboard and split at the seams right away glued it back together and serves the purpose but way over priced,24,6
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,product is nice but the shipping packaging allowed one corner to get smashed up fortunately that corned can be hidden under my desktop speaker,24,7
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,for the price this is pretty much what i was expecting it does not look feel or smell like anything more than coated cardboard but serves the purpose just fine,29,8
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,matte black and great oversized option for a desk only complaint was it came bent on one corner i think due to packaging being not the best,27,9
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,the desk pad de-laminated size and surface were nice but the fact that fell apart would certainly prevent me from purchasing thisagain i returned theand purchased something different,32,10
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,bought this pad along with one by satechi and have been satisfied with both of them nice quality and provides the perfect density for writing support has a simple esthetic quality and just the right size for my needs overall a good purchase and while it seemed a bit expensive at the time in comparison to other products and for the quality of the merchandise i am quite satisfied,69,11
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,the desk pad delaminated after about two weeks can not recommend it do not buy this desk pad do not buy this desk pad,21,12
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1.0,negative,first at the 11 x 17 size this isis floppy and flaccid and will not work for the purpose of supporting your papers while writing on them it will only work to clip papers together and hold them in place very disappointing also it arrived in it is sealed plastic wrapper with a chipped corner and looks like that happens easily,61,0
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,i did not like it i sent it back the back was to flimsy and flexible,16,1
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,it is to flimsy for what i needed and a little larger than it needed to be,16,2

Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4.0,positive,clipboard is very flimsy made of thin plastic i originally bought this to use as i was moving around the warehouse but when held it just flops around i now use it to organize my 11 x 17 drawings at my desk,42,4
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,very flimsy and does not really hold the size paper it states,11,5
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,served it is purpose well for about 3 months until it slid off the desk and the whole corner chipped rendering it almost unusable i would concur with other reviews that this product needs to be a little heftier for good durable field use come on it is recycled plastic it is not like the raw material is too expensive given it is short life and cost thisis too expensive for what you get,72,6
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1.0,negative,i thought i was getting an 11x17 clip board not a 11 3/4x12 7/8 useless i did not think there would be fine print to read on this product as well,30,7
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5.0,positive,works great plastic is bendy when compared to a regular clipboard / hardboard material so if you need a rock-hard platform to do your work look elsewhere i needed to draw piping diagrams and more while standing in the field so this is not the best option it has since been repurposed as a vertical drawing holder in the office so all good,60,8
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5.0,positive,perfect for holding just one or many sheets of 11 x 17 paper we use them for holding drawings of construction sites while we are out taking measurements of details,30,9

Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,clipboard arrived today the good news the clip is great and holds items securely the bad news the plastic board is too flimsy for what i need it for which is writing on it while standing hint to manufacturer use a little more of that recycled plastic and make a sturdier board,53,16
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5.0,positive,excellent sturdy and just the right size we needed,9,17
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,it is too flimsy it gives and bends if you need something rigid this is not for you,16,18
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,4.0,positive,the plastic backer is a little thin and floppy,9,19
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1.0,negative,thin and flimsy virtually useless the clip board is thin and absolutely not rigid enough to write on while holding it is not even rigid enough to used while sitting on an irregular surface the pictures are misleading and the clip board will not even support it is own weight when held from one end,53,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,the photos are extremely misleading they take 3 aaa batteries not solar powered like the photo shows and are smaller then the photo shows about maybe 8 in tall by 5 in wide the are very top heavy so they tip over easily and have no overflow for the flowers also they are made of very thin plastic not too sturdy,59,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,fun and excellent i am not sure why everyone says they go through batteries i have had my pot 1 year and just replaced the batteries for the first time i turn it in almost every evening through the summer / fall while out on my porch i added clear aquarium glass rocks to the bottom of my pot to give the base weight in the breeze and it has never tipped nor does it interfere with theactually it gives some pretty dynamics to the colors i love this pot and would definitely recommend it for some fun lighting,99,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,i gave this gift as a birthday present both myself and the recipient were very pleased with the product she loves gardening and more and i had to install batteries before giving the gift so i got to see how it worked really great you may want to consider putting a small already-potted plant within this pot but thechanges were so beautiful would make a nice addition to anyones garden area or to be used inside have not heard any complaints from who i gave it to and that was in july it is november now so i think it is safe to say everything is working just fine,107,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,this is a lovely addition to your home if you like lots ofit is not solar so it is best used indoors prettyespecailly for kids rooms instapark tm flower powerchanging led plant pot,40,3

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,the pot is a lot smaller than it appears i can not place my plants in the pot as it is too shallow also the led has already come a part from one of the pots so i do not expect for it to last much longer especially if it gets wet,50,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,we love it at the moment we are using it as a night light it works just fine thank you,20,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,although i should have realized that this would be best viewed at night i have had many comments on the plant pot even when it was not turned on i enjoy it more at dusk and later but the pot is even pretty in daylight,44,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,5.0,positive,this was a perfect little pot for the price it is very small although it will fit something like a gerbera daisy i really like it and i would recommend it,31,13

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,my sister wanted a light changing flower pot i should have returned this one it is small and top heavy when you plant a small plant it is easy to overturn when watering the water flows over the edges very messy i would not recommend this,46,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,1.0,negative,this flower pot was a big disappointment very cheap-looking and feeling it is not deep enough to even consider a real flower pot if all that was not bad enough the light barely works you turn it on and have to manipulate it to actually come on and once you move it it goes right back off i was very disappointed with this product however the company instapark were very kind friendly and receptive to my issues they responded immediately to my complaint and i did receive a full refund i would purchase from them again but just not this product,100,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,not what it seemed poor quality can only see one lightwhen it changesit fades out one of the batteries will not stay snapped in very disappointed,30,17

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,4.0,positive,the flower pots look great and decorate our entire door steps withchanging lights we just put them so we are not sure how long the battery will last to conserve one must switch off the lights every morning it would have been nice if they had come up with a light sensor that switched off automatically during the day otherwise they work as advertised,66,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,this product is made of very cheap plastic and does not even include a set of batteries for the first time use i do not think it would hold anything heavier than a single marble i gave it 2 stars because theis cool but the execution was poor,48,22

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0014A8EZI,2.0,negative,i was expecting a white plastic flower pot that changed colors the three that i received are bright purple unlit and no where does it give you the choice of choosing ai thought maybe they had sent the wrongbut the picture on the box matches the box that i received cute if you want purple,59,29

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,for the price this is a really convenient way to hide a spare key plus the thermometer works great for a garage or,24,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,the hide-a-key thermometer works as expected it was easy to mount on the wall beside my door and provides real easy access to a key one thing i do wonder about is whether it is too obvious a place for a key i would think that any decent burglar would know all about popular key hiding places but i view the thing as basically a convenient place to put a key outside for my own use a better place in any event than just hanging it on a nail beside the door burglars will get in if they want to key or no key,102,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,you slide the cover and there are 2 spots for keys it is lightweight and easy to hang up i started using it right away well worth the price,31,3

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,it is poor quality the plastic body is very thin and see-through and you can see a key inside you can not hide the keys,24,6

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,arrived on time and was as described excellent,8,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,it is a greatbut i would not waste your money i have bought two because basically you have to replace it every year the plastic becomes brittle from the sun and it just falls apart by the end of summer i recommend getting something not so cheaply made and more durable,51,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,it was a greatbut when it arrived the thermometer was broken can not use now,16,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,pretty flimsy thermometer fell out when i opened the package and i had to glue it back in the housing the actual housing is made of a softer plastic than i expected also,33,11

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,not sure how i feel about it yet it is really cheap dollar store quality plastic that is falling apart although i only paid 5 for it i still feel that it is overpriced it is bulky so definitely sticks out not slim at all so pretty noticeable when looking at it from close range from far however it does not look too bad not sure if I am keeping it or not i originally bought this to keep a key available for my son for just in case so he can access the house,89,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,had to cut the hooks because they were too fat to hold key kind of cheaply put together but does the job of discretely hiding keys outside,27,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,avoid this chinese garbage junk at any price,8,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,cheap and looks like a key holder rather than a thermometer did not feel like this would be a safe way to store keys,24,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,the temp gage is not readable the red is all up and down the gage so you can not see the actual temp but it does hold the key,28,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,very poor product i thought this was going to be a discrete thermometer to hide a key that people would not immediately be able to spot out like a rock or a turtle the product came it was huge definitely not slender and of very poor material did not come with anything to hang it either i honestly tossed the product not worth the money at all plastic and very cheap,69,20

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this is a great concept andthe problem is that it is too obvious i did not realize the product would be so thick that you cold tell it is also flimsy even attaching the back with the two screws i believe a strong enough wind would simply blow the cover right off we are not returning it since we have a keypad to get into our garage we will simply place our spare key s in this product and then dump it into a junk box for safe keeping,86,28

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,the plastic compartment is too large so the thermometer looks like a compartment and looks fake also the thermometer was not even close to accurate the worst part was that somehow even although it is white the direct sunlight seems to have made the plastic very brittle and when i really needed to use it less than one year later as i carefully slid the compartment open all the connecting grooves snapped inward and it no longer closed correctly it is now in the trash without even one successful usage,89,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,worked and looked ok however plastic is very thin and after a few key retrievals it started breaking apart i guess it became more brittle with exposure out doors northern side out of light but colder,36,33

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,will hang in garage because it is to thick to put on wall i believe if someone looks close enough they will know it can be opened,26,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,thermometer top loosely slides up and down a track on the wall-mounted portion and is not sturdy but wanted to try it anyway installed it on the framing around a door on my rooftopin new jersey the casing became brittle when exposed to sunlight and temperatures above 85f it fell off due to windy conditions and shattered when it hit the floor it is now trash not durable and do not recommend this product,74,37

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,cheaply made key box that looks like a storage box it would be difficult to pass it off as merely a thermometer also the plastic housing is poorly constructed with a noticeablewhere the top slides up to reveal the interior,42,39

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,very cheap and does not hide the key well it seems like it would fall apart if you look at it the wrong way,24,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,there has no way someone would believe this is only a thermometer it is super thick and bulky the bottom does not close completely which would allow things to get in spiders bugs water and more or out the top seam does not match up either the thermometer is inaccurate and is poorly painted on i would not recommend this product,57,63

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,this does the job but it is so thick it is suspicious and the plastic is cheaply fit so it is hard to avoid seeing the seams,24,70
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,very cheap shows the sliding mechanism so not really hiding the key very well,14,71
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,seems sturdy enough could be a little thinner and wider in profile overall okay,14,72

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,i like this product it looks like a legit thermometer it is just a tad thicker than a regular one i live in an apartment building so i have yet to figure out where to hang it that it will not be noticeable but it really works and that is a major plus,51,81
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,this has been the perfect little hiding spot for a spare key i never liked the looks of the fake rocks they always look too plastic this blends well and looks like it is been there for ages it is easy for even my youngest to slide open and perfect for when my teenager forgets his keys it is even saved my husband and i a time or two easy to screw in nails or screws not included and hides two keys safely inside the thermometer has been surprisingly accurate given the wonky weather we have been experiencing in new york lately laughing out loud would definitely purchase this again it was a great deal for the price too,113,82
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,slide is a bit stiff initially but workable inaccurate temps which several others addressed suits my needs however so I am happy,21,83

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,looks cheap the numbers painted on are fuzzy and blurred can tell that it has a slide open front looks like a cheap decoy amazons been great about returns in the past but not sure it is worth the effort on this one maybe sell it at a yard sale,49,86
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,a little hard to slide open i am afraid will break sometimes getting easier and i plan to wax a little of course do not want it to slide too easily,30,87

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,while this product claims to have a concealed and secure key compartment it is actually not secured in any way i own a similar product that utilizes a combination to open the hidden compartment to open this secret compartment you simply slide the cover up,45,91

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,i find this hard to slide open and I am a little concerned it will break with too much use but the temperature seems to be pretty accurate and it is a nice way to make the spare key a little harder for an unauthorized visitor to find for the price i found this more practicable than a hide a key rock and certainly better than the prior method of under the doormat,71,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,i love this product it is very conspicuous no body can guess it hides a key,15,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,does not really work good but would never know it held keys,11,95

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,if you need something to tell the temperature this is not so bad but it comes with no mounting hardware and is made of fairly cheap plastic also as a hide-a-key the seam is very obvious and i think I shall just use it as a thermometer,45,132
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,i wanted something so that my daughter could hide a key at her house the picture was a bit deceiving when i opened the package the glue on the thermometer had failed and it fell out i think i can glue it back together but the unit is so thick it is almost a give away that it is meant to hide something inside,62,133
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i purchased this after my boyfriend and i kept locking ourselves out of our house and having to call someone with a spare to let us back in my boyfriend chose this hide a key because it looked inconspicuous when it arrived i was not too happy with the materials granted this is a pretty cheap price for a hide a key it is made out of very cheap plastic and it looks inconspicuous from afar but if someone were really looking to break into my house i feel like they could tell this was a hide a key and would be able to just let themselves in because of this i am reluctant to but my spare in here but the thermometer works,122,134
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,an inexpensive way to guarantee that you never lock yourself out everyone sees it but nobody suspects that there is a key inside,23,135
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,this may be the worst thing i have ever purchased the glass thermometer fell out of the plastic housing as soon as i opened the package do not waste your time with this trash,33,136
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,these were flimsy and the thermometer falls out even after regluing i would not recommend these i bought 2 to any family or friends,25,137
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,very very cheaply made if you are going to use this put it somewhere half hidden cuz it is a deep box for a key or 2 and stands out like a sore thumb you will need to take the whole thing off the wall to open the box so do not secure it for good anywhere screws or nails are not included and the holes are huge and do not depend on the thermometer it is been stuck at 75f since arriving when it is been in the mid-40s here,84,138
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,the thermometer part of it removed or broken therefore it did not look like a working thermometer it seemed to be cheaply made,23,139

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,unfortunately i never got to use thisas it came damaged and leaking mercury fluid the numbers on the thermometer were smeared and unreadable it was ordered as a gift but i just threw it in the trash upon opening it i can not comment on customer service since i never notified them so it may have been just one of those flukes that sometimes happen,68,143
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,i did receive the paper bowls but not the thermometer hide-a-key i do not believe they were coming from the same place so it is unlikely that they were in the same box,31,144
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,can not even tell it is hiding a key the temperature measurement is accurate and it looks nice the only issue would be that it is a bit difficult to open without taking it completely off the wall it is not drilled to the wall so it is not that big of a deal,49,145
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this came and the glass came right out also it does not register the temperature it stays at the same the last three days so if someone looks at it there going to wonder if it is real or not i did not send it back because it would cost me to ship back the same price i paid for it,58,146
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,after so many bad reviews you would think they fix it nope different day some s came broken went right in the trash dont buy anything from stalwart,27,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i was really excited about this hide-a-key because it is also a thermometer which is less obvious but upon receiving it i am not happy the glass thermometer piece was broken off of theinstead of going through the hassle of returning it i will just super glue it back on and there is not a lot of room for keys inside thewhich i was not excited about i had to take them off the key rings to make them fit i love thebut would not buy this product again,95,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,thermometer does not even attach to the plastic unit i hope nobody actually buys this for the thermometer and not just to hide a house key,25,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,very deceptive type storage for an outdoor key blends in well with our paintand trim easy to place in an inconspicuous place,24,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,made very cheap i had to take the thermomator part back onto the box and for a hidden key compartment it is blantly obvious that there is something stored in it they could and should have went with about half the size compartment on the back plus if the sun hits on it right you can see a dark something in the back of the thermometor when just one key is hanging inside of it save your money or buy the hidden key rock,84,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,we had one similar to this for many years and it broke we could not find another one and was thrilled when we found this one it works so much better for us than a pet rock,36,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,now i can get into my cousins storage unit if i forget my key so much easier than returning home,20,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this looked like a goodwhen i was looking around for a hiding place for a spare key but upon arrival and inspecting the product i saw where the two key holders that are hidden in the product were both broken and unable to hold a key i was not sure if it had shipped from the factory like this or was damaged during shipping so i chalked this up as a loss and have used something else,78,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,this is a good product in theory hangs on my back porch and is very utilitarian i needed to retrieve the key one day was unable to get it off of the hook inside and ultimately snapped the hook off the face also is hard to move up and down if you purchase this I had advise to put your key on a small ring first to avoid destroying your purchase,70,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,very handy device for a moderately adisabled person it allows easy entry for assistance when it is required a good companion piece for an alert system novel product,28,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,two stars because it will serve it is function the product is the lowest quality you can imagine the thermometer piece has glue oozed out all over it the box has scratches all over it and does not look like it will withstand outdoor use for long worth maybe 199 without shipping,51,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,when i received this in the mail i was completely disappointed first off the glass thermometer part had come unglued to i had to fix that right away second it is so big and bulky that it is so obvious it is made for hiding something inside i had to set it up against the door frame so it was not as noticeable,62,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,works great and very handy well made to last cold minnesota weather and very usefull too wow neatlove it,21,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,when i got thermometer the little red part that shows the temp was not in proper and it broke when it fell on the floor so i did not even get to use it i think they need to find a better way to keep it in not just glue,48,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,this product is made from a hard plastic which appears easily broken the shipper send product by usps standard delivery i arrived with a portion broken off the case which attaches to the outside wall i guess i could use it to hide a key ok but am concerned about bugs and more getting into it and building a nest notified the seller of the problem and they authorized me to return it but i would have to pay for the return not what i expected from an amazon vendor edit the shipper frank has offered to play for the shipping to return the broken product but I am going to see if i can just glue the broken piece back into place it is not like it should be that difficult for me to do would sure save time,137,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,i thought it was a real thermometer but it is not it needs to be made a bit more obvious and perhaps not call in a thermometer hide a key,30,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,thisis a little thick for hiding a single key but it does have room for two there are two hooks behind the cover upper and lower spots but if they were not a deep it would have made a slimmer profile and looked more realistic,47,163
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,do not bother this is the cheapest looking thermometer ever not only that it broke in my hand when i picked it up out of the shipping box,27,164

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,this is a good find my son and husband are good at locking their keys in the house it is light and does not take up much room the temp reading seems pretty accurate too,34,166
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,what can i say this baby does both jobs it is sold for it has a very accurate thermometer and no one has a clue it holds the key to the door behind it,34,167

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B008E075GA,2.0,negative,not very impressive but it is worth what i paid i got 4 as gifts and at least one was defective bird bath bowl had a hole,26,4

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B008E075GA,1.0,negative,the picture makes it look way more glamorous than the actual product i should have read description better product is smaller and not as solid colored as picture,28,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B008E075GA,4.0,positive,nice decorative birdbath could also use for birdseed,8,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B008E075GA,2.0,negative,expected the little bird in the picture to come with the bird bath it was one of the main reasons i purchased thought it was cute quality was ok not as sturdy as i had hoped but i guess you get what you pay for,45,12

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,this backseat barrier kept my dogs from coming up front for about one hour until they figured out that they could just easily jump right over the top of it this might work for a very little dog or a car with an extremely low ceiling or a dog that does not have much desire to make it is way into the front seat but I am not sure why you would need this in the first place if your dog was not constantly trying to jump into the front while you are driving i thought this was going to be the answer to all of my dog transporting problems but it is just a waste of money,114,0
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,while the main portion of the barrier is well made it is too short and flimsy to keep my border collies and golden retreiver from jumping on top and over it the upper netting will not stay in an upright position partially because the two stabilizer bars holding it up broke the stitching holding them in place so they are now useless get the outward hound version for less than ten bucks and save some money,74,1
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we bought this product because our dog kept jumping into the front seat the product is a little flimsy and she can still jump over it but it is helping us train her to stay in the back it also keeps her safely contained when we have to slam on the breaks overall it is a good product but possibly a little over priced,64,2
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,this is a durable product that even works for big doges it is somewhat complicated to install and the top round wood rod keeps coming out so i removed it the barrier still works fine 100 effective but a little difficult,42,3
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,worked great for my 2014 toyota corolla i had to be creative on how i hooked up the bottom strap but it worked great kept the dogs in the back seat safe and sound,34,4
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i have purchased kurgo products before the quality is nice it keeps the dogs in the back seat but they can still see what is going on in the front seat,31,5
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this kurgo does not work with all vehicles,8,6
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my two goldens jumped this in a heartbeat back to drawing board this actually hindered getting them back into the back seat as they did not have as much enthusiasm going back to their seat,34,7
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,it was okay did not love how it fit in my car could not seem to get it secure enough now matter how much i tightened the straps,26,8
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this is very difficult to get attached to the seats it is flimsy so the dogs just went around it with some serious rigging you could probably get this to work or if your dogs are not very adament about sitting on your lap essentially you get what you pay for,49,9
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,a little complicated to get set up but i installed along with the seat cover and dog bridge works great to keep dogs in the back seat which is critical since we foster rescues,35,10
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,worst thing every the dogs can just pull it down and run over it,14,11
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,52 lb springer spaniel plowed over it guess he really wants to ride shotgun he also did not like looking thru the mesh one we tightened his back seat harness and he could see out the front window clearly he was a happier dog concept is terrific but not for us,51,12
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my dog had already put a hole in the mesh part of it ther than that it is a great investment if it were taller it would be better,29,13
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,lasted about 20 minutes then my dog chewed through the side straps and was back in the front seat,19,14
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,keeps my dogs in the back where they belong,9,15
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is fantastic being that i am 71 years old it took a little while to put it on but i am so happy with it now my dogs will be safe and i can quit worrying about them when i take them places well worth the money thank you,50,16
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,excellent stops our dogs from coming to visit us by standing on the armrest yet does not stop them seeing out the front window space to keep a water bowl and ball without them rolling around in the back,38,17
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my very athletic dog has managed to get around the barrier so not all that useful,16,18
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,for small or medium size vehicles bought for our 2016 ram mega cab and does not fit received product quickly but did not try to install until planning our next trip with our pets needless to say it was a few days after the return period expired reading the reviews and description sounded like it would fit wrong also noted that once installed and tight it prohibits the passenger from putting the seat back in case they want to sleep or rest would not recommend for large trucks if installed elastic bungee chords might help lowering the backrest,96,19
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,unfortunately this did not work with our very spoiled labs,10,20
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,not a perfect match for my car volvo but has enough straps and connectors that i was able to make it work anyway seems sturdy definitely deters my dog from clambering up front while I am driving,36,21
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,strap tore pretty quickly i am going to look into alternative options,12,22
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is the second type of backseat barrier that i have purchased and the only that i would recommend the construction is very sturdy particularly if you insert the optional metal bar and should hold back most dogs,38,23
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,quality made product my dog climbed over it in less than 5min,12,24
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,the rod that goes across the top for stability is too short could not get it together and,17,25
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,easy to install in my silverado keeps my two english mastiffs from crawling into the front,16,26
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,put this in my suburu outback it did fit nice but it did not hold up at all to the dogs hanging on it easily jumped over and they chewed thru the bottom connection cords it was money thrown out the window took about 10 minutes for my 25 lb cocker spaniel to destroy it,55,27
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,not for everyone but it works for me i have 10 dogs most are trained to stay in the back two will get in the back and immediately run through to the front this prevents them from doing that could they jump over could they destroy it yes to both but my dogs just are not motivated to do that this is doing exactly what i needed it to do it all depends onl your dogs,75,28
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this was made nicely but it did not fit my car very well also i wasted a lot of time because there had been a design change that was not reflected in the instructions in the box or on the web,41,29
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift to my husband and he is very pleased with it,15,30
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,a big help keeping our labradoodle out of the front seat on long trips,14,31
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,worked in our 2014 toyota highlander to keep our boxer in the back and separate from the kids she only tried to get over once when we stopped but was not able to get over all the way great price and good value for what we needed it for,48,32
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,difficult to install not all of the items described in the instructions are actually on the unit that said once it is installed it is the only device i have found that keeps my 80 lb dog off my lap while i am driving,44,33
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,easy to install after a while we did not need it anymore,11,34
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,yes my dog can jump over the top no i do not let him but for the price this can save a never ending car struggle if you are working to train you dog to stay in the back seat,40,35
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,excellent mother is so glad keeping her dog in the backseat,11,36
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,the only way to secure it up higher in an suv or any car is to remove the headrest to get the barrier to secure the straps do not have a buckle to remove and snap in to head rest my head rests are not designed to be removed therefore the barrier can not sit high up my dogs are still jumping over the barrier and sitting up front very disapointed,69,37
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,even tho it says it is for our car the dogs who are small medium size goes right over the top of it does not work at all,24,38
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,do not waste your money it is flimsy and loose not to mention bulky all the straps and buckles are a pain as well,22,39
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i always have my dogs with me in the car and am very pleased with this barrier it is super easy to install unlike other barriers i have used in the past and because of it is fabric design it is silent I have had the more elaborate barrier that had bars but that one tended to always come loose and then would rub on the seat or jiggle noisily none of my dogs have jumped over the barrier and they seem content with the see-through design at the top so they can look out the front window i do have a golden retriever german shepherd and a springer spaniel the barrier may not deter a dog that is determined to ride shotgun however we also foster dogs and i bring the fosters along to the dog park the two foster dogs that we have had since i purchased the kurgo did not attempt to jump over it either,157,40
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we really love this pet barrier we have had several others in the past and this is by far the best the last one was metal and looked like a cage or the back of a police car it was hard to install and take out and would not stay in place we just returned from a trip from florida to virginia and back and the kurgo worked perfectly it is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers the price is less then any other we have bought and is really worth the it the kurgo arrived even earlier then we were expecting overall you will love it and you we highly recommend it,131,41
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,while it does the trick it is a little too high it blocks my vision a bit when i am backing up well made however and worth it,28,42
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,I am sure it would have been fine if it were complete i did not even get a receipt invoice in the box very surprising had to go out and purchase a bar barrier at the last minute,35,43
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we definitely need this pet barrier our dogs jump back and forth all the time this seemed to help but only 3 days after installation one of the dogs tunneled through and broke a strap straps need to be stronger otherwise it is a good investment,46,44
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,works well however very difficult to install the directions are not very clear it should install in a few minutes however because of the lack of direction it takes awhile,30,45
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this does not work in our suv it does not stay up in the postion needed to keep our big dog in the back it does keep groceries from rolling forward,31,46
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,if you have 1/2 a brain you can install without directions contains up to 3 dogs in the car at least that is how many are in this family good quality does the job as detailed very satisfied,37,47
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier will make my dog safer as we travel it was easy to install and is very sturdy,20,48
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,buyer beware the pictures shown are not what you get you do get a kurgo backseat barrier but it is the one on their website i have yet to install it so i do not know if it works for me yet,41,49
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i bought this because it said it could seprate the back seat well it does not i went to kurgo actual site and they do not claim to have a model like that complete waste of my time installing and money i reccomend doing more research before purchaseing this,48,50
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we needed something to contain our new 1yr 8mo old 67 lb rescue puppy i searched the web to find something reasonably priced that would fit in our lincoln navigator our car has the 7 seat option and we often use them all i found it easy to install and high enough to keep our big boy in the back we also ordered the solvit 62316 waterproof suv cargo liner could not be happier with prime shipping,75,51
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we have a golden retriever / aussie shepherd mix she is just about ocd about going back and forth from the front to the back seats when driving our murano suvs the kurgo has been installed pretty easily and does a good job of keeping her in the back while the car is in motion if i park and leave her in the car in appropriate weather she will get to the front seat by squeezing between the doorpost and the front drivers seat no problem the only thing i wish was different is that there was more of the see-through mesh instead of the black nylon canvas blocking hers and our view between the seats,114,52
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the barrier gets the job done for our 9 month old golden retriever it keeps her in the back seat and much less of a distraction while driving both traveling and local driving has become much more enjoyable for all of us we can still see her and give her a pat now and then she loves to ride with her chin resting on the top of the barrier however according to my husband it is not very easy to install and remove and takes some time so ours remains in my car all the time which I am not very excited about,102,53
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,my dog jumped right over the top we have a very active shelty did not use till we went on a trip too late to return,25,54
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,let me add my voice to those who say that these things are worthless it took my three month old puppy less time to run over this barrier than it took me to install it what a ripoff,38,55
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i first tried this product on our pickup however the seats were too high and the barrier did not stop our dog for a second then i installed it in our suv and it is working well it is a little confusing to install but taking the directionsbyworked ok and it took me about 45 minutes all in all i think it is a good product and does help keep the dog in the back seat,79,56
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting this to stay in place my dog jumped right over it it may have worked better on a vehicle with larger seats,28,57
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,19,58
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,subaru forrester with sunroof when the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down they like to take turns leaning on the center console and would slide forward when stopping she sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the giant and he tries to escape to the front not good nor safe the metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof they would hit the glass of sunroof those seem to be semi-permanent whether that is because take up to much room to store or to hard to install and remove i do not know all do not buy decision makers for me when i discovered kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs it does easy to install and remove even folds and slides back into storage bag easily dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we are all riding safer we are happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot,162,59
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this product is not only difficult to install it also does not work my lab jumped over it with no problem it just makes it harder to get him back in the back seat,33,60
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,we take our terrier everywhere in our grand cherokee when we leave him in the car to job or eat he hops in the front seat he is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose this device was difficult to attach it took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts biggest problem however was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car it worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving,104,61
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i received the backseat pet barrier and could not figure out how to install it finally figured it out and it works pretty good on the expensive side but nice product,31,62
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier works great for our dogs they do not even try to come through it fit perfect in my dodge calliber our dogs are not small one is 110 lbs and the other is 80 lbs i think for the price it works great,45,63
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i put this behind the front seats in my xtended cab pickup truck my standard poodle just climbed right over it since then the material is tearing where the metal stays are poking through might work for a small dog but not mine,43,64
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the kurgo backseat pet barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound very enthusiastic portuguese water dog out of the front seat this was critical to me because my car a saab has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as i was driving a rather unnerving experience as soon as she saw the barrier my dog did not even try to wiggle through it sent a clear message and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet the barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat while simultaneously barring access to the front seat one caveat the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror so I am planning to remove it it unfastens easily this product is a great value and will probably last a very long time owing to it is sturdy construction and strong materials I have owned it for about a month and could not be happier,182,65
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my girlfriend was able to install it in no time and it works great although her dog does not like it,20,66
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i have a 100 lb lab mix who likes to play co-pilot while i drive and cuddle he likes standing between my seats which is dangerous for me and him and we have bumped heads too many times so I have been shopping for a barrier i have a 4 door sedan and therefore i can not install one of those big metal barriers which are very unattractive my only complaint is the installation it was a pain and difficult to understand and I am not sure if it is installed correctly instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat other then that it is not as tall as i had expected / hoped my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive but at least he has contained to the back seat,145,67
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,this scratching post is useless unless you modify it like i did my cat would not touch it i ordered sisal rope and some catnip spray i wrapped the sisal rope around the entire cat tree and secured the rope with a hot glue gun here and there then i sprayed the rope with a very strong catnip spray and now my cat loves it cats are naturally attracted to sisal rope and i hated of theof wasting my money since the cat was not using it prior to adding rope another bad thing is that this scratching post is very lightweight if you use it in the upright position when the cat scratches it will fall right over so i only use mine in the laying down position so unless plan on modifying this do not waste your money,139,0
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,i bought this about a month ago my cat uses it sometimes but not as much as her cardboard scratcher i will occasionally put a little catnip on it to generate more interest although i have observed her rubbing on it at random times without me adding catnip she does likes it also i think it does better laying on the side rather than standing up,66,1
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,the scratching post broke off of the stand when my cat used it,13,2
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,my cats completely ignore this scratching post in fact they scratch the chair right next to it and behind it,20,3
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,fabulous scratching post my cat loves it subtle and attractive,10,4
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,not good quality at all the post would not even fit in the base,13,5
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,the cats love it as someone else mentioned it will not stand up on it is own if a cat is scratching it it is too lightweight for that and will tip over but my cats love it and we just keep it tipped over they stand on it lay on it or over it and hide things under it they wrestle with it and scratch their chins on the edges of the bottom piece they love it and laying flat there is no problem with them scratching the heck out of it so it may not appear to be as sturdy as a wooden stand up post but if you are creative actually the cats tipped it the way they wanted it and just tip it on it is side it works great i would buy another the carpet is a very tight knit indoor-outdoor type carpet and does not fray like the stand up rug posts my cats do not like the sisal rope scratchers so we are left with the rug posts that fray and they destroy or something like this,181,6
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,i stand it upright with the feet tucked under the chair the cats over the years shredded we then reupholstered in microfiber and weight the feet under there with a couple of dumbells happy cat safe chair happy me,39,7
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,these are pretty much the only scratching post my cat will use i should have never introduced her to it originally they sold these at petco but now i can only find them on amazon they are great and last forever,41,8
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,good price if your cats like it my cat and kittens do not find this scratch-post amusing we got this one as opposed to the big jungle-gym types because we thought it would be more appropriate for the older cat but no one likes it standing up nor lying down they prefer the rugs over this maybe I shall try the jungle-gym,61,9
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,our cat loves the one we purchased for her four years ago buy you can imagine the condition it was in after that amount of time we could not find it in our local stores amazon had a fair price and it was delivered promptly,45,10
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,this post is great for cats who like to scratch the carpet or furniture with the heavy upholstered weave it is not for all i have sisal rope post that cost 75 the best quality made and my cat barely touches it he loves this one it is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch i love the raised curvedas i prop it beneath a chair and it is the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4s to scratch my cat is 17 lbs mostly muscle and has not encountered any issues pulling it out of place when it is secure in that fashion,128,11
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,i got this for my cat a few months ago and he will not even look at it I have tryed showing him what it is and put his paws on it and still nothing I have have nt tried the cat nip stuff but hes never had it so I am not sure if that would help any i would not buy it again,59,12
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,a very nice cat scratching post that was reasonably priced and rather attractive for a piece of carpet on a stick the compact size make it ideal for an apartment and it is nice that it can either stand up or lay down it is a bit wobbly when standing up although my cat loves having it tipped over so she can chase her toys around it,66,13
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,the other reviewer does not seem to like this product maybe it is his computer but I am also using a macbook running snow leopard and i love this software it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per song but that is exactly how long they say it should take this program fixed my 3000 song library really fast and there has only like 50 or so songs that do not have the correct album art but it is way better than before and worth the money if your still unsure about this program there is a trial you can get at their webstite that will clean 100 songs i recommend it,104,2
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,i used it for two windows xp computers one one it worked fine with 2 gb ram and on the other it locked up several times 1 gb ram i suspect you might have issues if you do not have at least 2 gb overall i am very pleased with it i cleaned up a library of over 5000 songs with a high degree of accuracy although a handful of songs were overwritten with titles in foreign alphabets nothings perfect but i feel like i got a lot of value out of it,92,3
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not purchase tuneup does not work do not waist your money not worth it company does not care no product support likely to be going out of business soon,30,4
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this program works great does what it says it will do and is easy to use i would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean up their music library it does what itunes will not do,37,5
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product delivers as advertised it does a good job of straightening out tags and filling in all the information to test it first i took 5 songs and changed the tags incorrectly tune-up corrected all of them successfully my only complaint is that it is a little slower than i would like but i have a 9000 song library this is definitely worth the 40 lifetime price,70,6
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this product some time ago and wanted to come on here to warn others against buying this software not only does it incorrectly tag many songs it takes a tremendous time to do so and freezes constantly i have used the program on two different computers including a macbook pro and it has frozen on both it may do an acceptable job of identifying fairly well-known rock songs but good luck if your collection includes hip hop electronic or certain older songs even common rock such as the rolling stones steer clear of this product it will save you a lot of hassle,105,7
Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i actually bought the software in a store and upon installation it promptly downloaded an update this update simply does not recognize my activation code that came with the store software but acts like a free trial version and cheerfully let us me know that i have run out of my free service so i go to the website convinced that this certainly must be a mistake but it is not the new service works as annual or lifetime service for additional fee that is it became a webservice instead of a standalone application but they forgot to notify vendors about this who still sell it as the latter and this makes it a plane rip off the software seems to be a greatbut even when it worked it appeared buggy freezy pathetic you can achieve more by doing everything manually than relying on this piece of s tware,149,10
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,be careful of getting a lifetime membership with tune up because your activation code will only work once or twice i sold my old computer and got a new one and even tech support can not solve my issue of transferring the activation key to my new computer super lame it is as if they are at the mercy of their own slow / glitchy software,62,11
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,this software no longer works with the latest version of itunes it is simply criminal that it is still being sold,21,14
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,my itunes library was a mess this product tuned it up works awesome just as promised now my library is up to date with album artwork found or corrected i highly recommend this product,34,16
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,tuneup does what I have bought it for it has been able to successfully arrange most of my songs and get the right album artwork and this is not limited to american songs alone I had recommend this to anyone anyday,39,18
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,as a bestselling author of non-fiction investigative books i do not have time to keep my itunes library in any kind of order i took a chance on tune up expecting the worst 24 hours later i opened itunes and found it in astonishing order some album covers were still missing but i found only one error mozart by don giovani instead of don giovani by mozart and this was a minimalist version of tune up bravo sterling seagrave,78,19
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,especially if you have a big messy library with lots of different sources like mine tuneup worked wonders making complete sense of my library and making the de-duplication task insanely easy highly recommended,33,20
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product works very well it does a decent job of cleaning up song titles and other information i had a very large 17 gb itunes library and it is now 999 accurate the only tracks tuneup could not fix i was also unable to fix manually so i think that is pretty good my only complaint is that when it finds album titles and artwork the majority of the time it will offer up greatest hits or other compilation albums rather than the original album on which the track was released,91,21
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,I have been using tuneup for a while now and i have to say i love it it does exactly what it is supposed to do it cleans the track info and album art additionally the concerts feature is great for me because i have a giant library and it is tough to keep track of who is in town and when tuneup is amazing for making your music library more presentable which is great for ios devices because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better they also just sent me a coupon code for friends and family for 40 off at their website for anyone interested in a deal the code is friends40 either way i highly recommend this product,121,22
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,this product is excellent for the layperson it uses everyday language and includes estate planning living wills powers of attorney and many other documents you would not think of preparing for yourself or for your family members great job nolo and amazon for carrying it at such a low price i will purchase from you anytime,55,0
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,there are very few options for anything but the simplest will or trust did not suit my needs could not return opened software to amazon but nolo maker of product gave me a full refund after i emailed them with my problem,40,1
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,we are very pleased with willmaker we look forward to having all our wishes located in one place written on our computer,22,2
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,we purchased the 2011 quicken / nolo will and living trust software to set up a will / revocable living trust for our dad my wife and i already had a will and trust set up by our attorney back in 1996 which cost us over 600 i was able to set up a very similar will / trust package for our dad with this product at a fraction of the cost the software is easy to understand and the built-in legal guide is very helpful i would recommend this product to anyone that does not already have a will or that wishes to change an existing will the basic revocable living trust software that comes with this product is also very good this product does what it says it will do,125,3
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,i bought it mainly for the trust software only to find out that it was for windows xp whereas the willmaker could be used with windows 7 which i have therefore it was a waste of money for me,39,4
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,this is what i needed it was made for 2011 but was still current data for what i needed to do,21,5
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,scam basically i got it intending to use the living trust all i got was a notice that 2011 version is no longer supported and a whole bunch of buy this buy that popand the 2011 version is still being sold at amazon today 7/24/14 with the same misleading with living trust maker software the living trust software is not on the disk only online and there is no online support so you get squat very disappointed with quicken for miserable lack of support and amazon for facilitating this misleading scam,93,6
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,my wife and i were married two weeks ago we decided to create wills before leaving on our honeymoon well it took a little over a half hour to answer questions and print out copies of the will to get notarized no lawyer required,44,7
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,when youit quicken will not allow registration books and forms promised from online are not available to user,20,8
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,the willmaker had absolutely everything i needed then and will need in the future the crochet books were for a friend and she loves them the levis were for my husband they fit as they should accidentally ordered regular 501s once and they were snug in waist but he wears them anyway the shrink to fit are his levis for sure on the book have not even had a chance to start it but I am sure I shall love it,79,9
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,arrived guickly in great new condition easy directions not complicated glad to have to have final wishes in writing can star and finish later can go in and change or edit recommend purchasing,33,10
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,i really purchased this software to review what i wanted to do and thus reducing my cost when i visit an attorney i was able to produce a living trust then visit an attorney i actually saved money by being organized the attorney actually thought what i did was a greatand policy,54,11
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i bought this program a couple of months ago and just installed it when i registered the program i was informed that it is no longer supported and that i can get the update by paying for a new program at a discount i bought the program because the description implies that it contains all the common forms needed for the average person first thing i tried to do was a general power of attorney it is not in the program this seems to be the modern standard of conduct for so many businesses today devious and deceptive i wasted my money on this program be sure you read all the descriptions before you buy and find that you have been sucker-punched,124,12
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i have not had the opportunity to examine all of the software in this package deal from quicken i bought this primarily interested in the living trust maker that comes bundled in this package after successfully installing the willmaker premium 2012 software onto my vista machine i put the living trust maker disk in my pc but i did not get the welcome screen that should appear automatically therefore i followed the instructions that were given on the disk and on the nolo quicken web site when you run into this issue apparently i am not the first i wento to start accessories run and entered d autorun but nothing happened i also tried e autorun and f autorun to no avail i went to the nolo quicken support site for further assistance but found none i am just a bit frustrated i guess i will have to see if there is a quicken technical phone number that i can call for further assistance i will come back and revise this review should i have success installing the disk and after i have had the opportunity to use the software,185,13
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i actually purchased the 2012 version of this product from costco and it is a junk i used to have a 2004 version that did a joint living trust for me and thinking it is time for me to update the software after i install the software i found out it only supports a basic living trust for single people not married couple when it detects my old living trust file it told me to go back to 2004 version for any change on living trust can you believe this what kind of company do this i was hoping this new version will give me more feature than my 2004 version but it actually supports less than the old one i am very upset i stick with this software instead of purchasing another cheaper software like willcreator deluxe that let us you create joint living trust i will not buy another single software from this company ever do not waste your money if you are married,166,14
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,i bought this so i could update our wills living wills and power of attorneys so far it looks like it leads you to sites where you can purchase these documents maybe I am just doing this wrong but i still have no new will,45,15
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,quicken willmaker premium 2011 is a very friendly product to use explanations for each section are clear updates available each state is in the select box you will have the right information for the state in which you reside,39,16
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,i was able to software used but it worked fine the software is easy to understand and the built-in legal elp secdtions that very helpful i would recommend this product to anyone that does not already have a will or that wishes to change an existing will the basic revocable living trust software that comes with this product is also decent this product will get you were you need to go in terms of producting a legal will that will hold up in court we purchased the 2011 two months ago this is much cheaper than paying a lawyer,98,17
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,made wills for my wife and i very quickly have not looked at the living trust maker yet but i trust it must be as easy to use great price,29,18
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,an easy to use program that wants you to upgrade it,11,19
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,not very descriptive at all difficult to work with and ended up not using it at all wish i did not buy it,22,20
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,did not use it went to a lawyer did not want to take the chance that something might go wrong,20,21
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,save yourself some money and use this older version of willmaker the laws simply do not change significantly enough to make any difference your will will certainly be valid using this ignore the no longer supported messages from quicken the key thing is legal validity and for that this product works fine,52,22
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,you must use a current version with up to date laws,11,23
Software,B004DLCQZ4,4.0,positive,have not used it all but as of know it is good,10,24
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i like this program a bunch and it has truly helped me redesign my entire first floor before i start my project this way i have no regrets when we actually start i just wish the terrain and roof lines for vaulted ceilings was not so hard to add or modify but overall great for rooms and additions and decking,59,0
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,the reads all my old files from 3d home architect and works much better with more features,17,1
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,not user friendly did not even work at first because of something with the graphics card and needing to download a different version by the time i got it working our project was almost over and the software was so difficult to use i want my money back,47,2
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,i like it it has a learning curve but works well i am trying to figure out how to make the roof go over the porch but i think it is because i added the porch after i built the house still working on it,45,3
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,does everything you would expect for this price i have trouble getting it to do roofs with add on porches that are a different pitch from the main roof makes great floor plans i have used it for a house remodel and a workshop and am very satisfied,48,4
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,unless you have used this sort of app before plan to put in some time viewing the tutorials and learn how to search the knowledge base when you run into a snag it is a great piece of software for creating a home design I have run into a few snags with some of the features but their resources for resolving them are quite good overall I am happy with the purchase and feel it was well worth the money just to be able to see the design in 3d,86,5
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,this software is not user-friendly at all it is insanely tedious because you have to click back and forth between the different ways to view your plans the tool bars is really confusing to use and i could not even find a function where you could have a grid showing in the background as you created your design i am disappointed in myself for not reading the fine print because after a couple of hours using this software i wanted a refund buyer beware this software is for ridiculously patient people,90,6
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i really like this design program easy enough to use after watching a few videos and not overly expensive,19,7
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,this program is somewhat limited but if you are trying layout a new home or look at how finishes will look then this is a good program i gave it 4 stars because it does not calculate roof lines correctly and the landscaping does not allow for contours,48,8
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,this is not a good program and does not offer functions needed for basic architectural design i have used other programs that offered a ton more in the way of variables for less money i am so mad i fell for the sales video pitch maybe the pro line offers more but i will not take another chance i uninstalled it about 15 minutes after installing what a waste of money but i new immediately it was crap and need the space to buy something else,86,9
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,I have had others this ones is not that great,9,10
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,the software only works on newest computers so it does not work on mine there is apparently no way to return it so I am out 50 save your money and do not buy this software unless your computer is less than 6 months old,43,11
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,this software is awesome i ended up upgrading to the next higher version although as i did not realize until afterwards that you are unable to do sloped terrains for walk out basements and such with the essentials version i wish i would have known this but they give you the ability to upgrade for essentially the same cost as if you bought it up front so no big deal,70,12
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,not the most user friendly version but it is downright cheap compared to others or even newer versions,17,13
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,can not do corner cabinets like with lazy susan i fully expected that it would at least come with the basics for your floor plan ie toilets tubs sinks counterops n flooring needless to say for 63 and change with tax very dissapointed,42,14
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,this product is definitely not user friendly it is only good if you are used to a high tech program this is not for an average user,26,15
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i used this to remodel a house i owned and was very impressed i had tried several other house design software programs both online and over the counter and was very disappointed with them this is the only one i could use without any difficulty at all i was great to be able to give my builder an exact drawing and layout of what i wanted without having to use an architect or sketching something up on paper then when he was done it looked exactly like it did on the computer inside and out it was almost anti-climactic the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because you will probably find out that the standard program is a little lacking and you will need to upgrade for extra of course to a better version still it is well worth the money and a ton cheaper then hiring someone,151,16
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,pretty easy to use if you are familiar with the previous version takes a while to find all the available details not enough patio options so far,27,17
Software,B01COADLXG,2.0,negative,hard to use not happy with it but can not return,10,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,bad product just took a week of use and it began to crack in the front very bad quality,20,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,at the price i paid for these i really have no complaints they are beautiful out of the box and the leather and canvas is what one would expect from the pictures tread is deep and great if anything although they wear much more quickly than i would like after a couple of weeks worth of wear there are deep creases in the toebox and the insoles come out again fine for the price,74,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,great boot bought it for my daughter but the sizing was a little larger than we expected so ended up wearing them myself,23,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,i would like to point out that they run large so order a size smaller i had to return mine before i even got to wear them for this reason otherwise my first impression is that this is a definite improvement over the jungle boots that served me in my 10 years in the usmc,55,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,these boots fit amazingly and go here two days before they were supposed to they are a really good weight and are well ventilated i have not done any training in them yet but they are not bad to walk in the boots run big on the sizing so buy a size smaller than what you wear for a tennis running shoe there was no problem with mine when i received them and the packaging was normal cardboard shoe box inside a normal cardboard shipping box I shall write another review after a go through some training with them on and let anyone interested know how they are right now the boots are at 5/5 edit okay so I have gone through some training now and these boots are pretty good they are comfortable breathable and the weight is definitely not an issue i wore them all day and there was not any discomfort for me these boots are great still 5/5,158,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,these boots were purchased for my son who is bigger than average for his age and extremely hard on shoes when i was his age thanks to my grandfather being retired military i was given my first pair of boots similar to these because i too was very hard on shoes having this experience already i figured to do the same for my son he has worn them for a eleven months now which for him is amazing the leather is still in good condition the nylon has held and there is not a single stitch that has been worn out by constant use however I am a bit disappointed with the soles because they have worn quickly when compared with other brands i myself have been wearing the same pair of wellco jungle boots for 3 years every day and the soles of mine although worn do not look anything like his his literally have gouges missing on the heel and the toe is almost worn smooth still for an active child whose hard on shoes when considering the price I have got to give 5 stars,185,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,i am pleased with the seller and the boots i received them early viathe other reviews are correct you should order them one size smaller than you normally wear i did not and am having to return them when i contacted the seller they replied promptly and with courtesy i will be buying other merchandise from this seller in the future the boots did look like they would need insoles however all military boots i have owned for work needed extra insoles to be comfortable for 12 hour shifts,91,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,if you need a sturdy combat ready pair of speed-lace boots these boots are an unbeatable value tip soak em in hot water for 15 - 20 minutes then wear them as you go about your business after two hours they will feel like you spent a year breaking them in they take a pretty good shine too,56,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,i normally wear the tan acu boots for my army jrotc battalion for mondays and pt and let me say very good for running hiking anything physical and they are super comfortable they hold up great and overall excellent performance 10/5 for these boots and for all of those people who are a little overweight let me say i weigh 350 pounds and beat my mile run by 10 minutes simply from having comfortable boots 20 - 23 minutes last year in work boots 10 - 13 minutes in these very good excellent way to help loose weight fast if you like the outdoors like me ps they are the same as acu tan combat boots boots only black,116,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2.0,negative,normally wear size 13 and was too small maybe order next size up,13,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,they suck they lasted one month of rather sedentary kitchen work and walking home before the insole was starting to wear through showing my sock i had other panama lug soles that my father had from the army in the 70s and 80s that lasted me five years of daily wear rothco is crap chinese crap that is the purposeful surplus market real surplus is overrun of actual mil spec gear that hits the market not this crap,78,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,the boot was well made and just what we needed unfortunately it runs about a size too large,18,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,good price for this boot very comfortable i like it very much,12,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,purchased not even 6 months ago and the soles developed cracks and within a week of that the soles started to come off i expected a better quality from the company that purchased wellco the company that once provided high quality boots to the fine men and women in our armed forces never will i purchase a rothco product again,60,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,only reason why i put somewhat large was because some dingus said that they ran a size small so i ordered a 13 but they do not run small besides that the boots are fine a tad tall and pretty crappy laces but nonetheless good boots m8 go buy em,49,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,the feet inside pads suck but overall not bad and holding up,12,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2.0,negative,the price is good and the quality is not bad but i must say that they feel somewhat hard there is not any cushion in the inside like the first boots that i received from the army nor does it have resilience in the rain / puddle,43,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,girl no i was wearing cardboard and it gave me tendonitis that price tag is worth it as long as you are not doing anything tactical in them,28,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,bought these they were s t did not last a week of basic and it clearly has false advertising saying they are something and then you get something else at least they have the right picture now,35,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,add clearly states with zipper yet order came in with boots that do not same boots are sold on line cheaper and of same garbage quality also boots run roughly 15 sizes large,34,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,alternate use with other boots excellent fit and use for camping trip,12,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,not the best made boot not the worst made boot a good value value being what you get for the price paid they are comfy with a bit of break in they get very soft and really do not offer much protection against rough and tumble environments but they are a pleasure to walk in fairly light give fairly good wear ie they last ok I have had boots that were top shelf costing several times the price of the rothco boots they lasted longer they were a bit tougher no lighter as i recall i can not say the top of the line boots were as good a value I am rather rough on my footwear doing outdoor / jobsite work most of the time i can use these not worry about my expensive boots and they pretty much take the abuse until the soles wear thin I shall re-order when i need another set no problem,151,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,very pleased with this fit well very comfortable priced well enought i may even buy a spare pair before their gone,21,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,i love the boots unfortunately my feet swim in these boots my buddy who wears a 12 1/2 is buying them off of me they fit him great I am going to reorder in 10w,36,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,i am a veteran so i knew my size but they are good boots,14,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,while these are not the genuine gi boots i was hoping for they are good lightweight solid boots that fit as expected i tossed the cheap liner that comes in the bottom and replaced them with some dr scholls sports liners with arch support now it is like wearing sneakers and can be worn all day right out of the box breaking was minimal,64,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2.0,negative,they are just too big i wear size 11 in combat boots and those fit perfectly but these ones are way to big for me,25,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,one seam on the side is ripped but not to bad,11,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,they run big so get a size smaller,8,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,very descent boots well molded to shape of foot especially in the heal great souls except that they are rubber and leave black streaks on hard surfaces made in china require padded insouls as the insouls are leather but for the price they are a great pair of and kickers i recome d them,54,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,used them all summer out in the woods just make sure to break them in correctly and maybe pick up a good set of gel insoles,26,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,i have had these boots for over three years and worn them all over definitely one of my better investments,20,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,i like them a lot they are very comfortable and let my feet breathe they fit like a glove i love them they remind me of when i was in the united states marine corps,35,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,this boot arrived quickly and in good condition it is a good looking boot but was too big for my son who wears a size 8 the treads look sturdy the only thing i was not excited about was the lacing system it appears that there are hook / loop type lacing abover the regular laces however they are closed hooks so they also have to be threaded through holes but some people could see this as a plus i guess as they loosen quickly for easy removal and then do not have to be rehooked just tightened,94,33
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,as far as size they are good they are just a bit narrow hopefully that will change with use other than that i like them,25,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,the size was not what was advertised and after a month and a half of use the tread is worn off on both boots,24,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4.0,positive,thanks to reading the other helpful reviews we ordered accordingly he wears a size 7 sneaker and we ordered a size 7 boot also taking growth into account the wearer is a fast-growing fifteen year old we have about half a shoe size wiggle room with thick socks it is fine especially when breaking them in-that is definitely needed to prevent blisters as we have had these in the past and they lasted a year and a half i am expecting similar use from these,85,36
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,ok so i bought the whole family good milspec boots for our camping and bob needs force entry and these jungle boots i can say with out a doubt that these jungle boots are sub par out of 3 that were ordered my sons cracked in the first week mine cracked the second time i wore them thankfully my son has a second pair and i have a pair of force entrys as these will not last the month,79,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,the boots are labled as size 10 but the are over an inch longer than another pair of rothco jungle boots i own and look huge my feet are swimming in these boots if these are size 10 i am a monkeys uncle they look like they are probably 12 now i have to deal with trying to send them back and get my money back i can not even image what size would be an actually size 10 now that i have sent the boots back and spent another 1130 the company is not giving me a full refund nor paying my shipping costs the company is defrauding me out of 25 of the original cost plus shipping beware of buying from this company update amazon did the right thing and refunded me the shipping costs i do not think it came from the shipping company but from amazon nice move amazon,152,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2.0,negative,these boots do not come in half-sizes so they were too big for me and they have already developed massive cracks on the toe area after only a few weeks of use still they were cheap and kept my feet dry not the worst thing ever but these are definitely throw-away boots the boot equivalent of a paperback book when compared to a hardcover which in this case would be a reliable brand like bates,75,39
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,these boots are just like they are pictured fit great sizes are what they say they are and the are worth the price were shipped to me fast,28,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,ordered on september 232013 it is now october 7th still have not seen them if you need a pair hunting boots go to big 5 sporting goods at least you will have them this is the worst company to deal with i will never order anything from them againmailed them no response they just do not care order from another company,65,41
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,price was good construction was not i wore these boots for less than 12 hours total before the heel on the toe started to peel upon inspection both had started to separate leaving abetween the heel and the boot i actually noticed the heel separation because the front of the heel caught on ai am a tactical officer you do not want to trip on a situation because your heel peels off,75,42
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5.0,positive,the boot is a bit different from what i already had but it is very similar also the fit is exact although we thought it was going to be too small very happy with the purchase,36,43
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1.0,negative,came apart at the base in a week not a good product at all cheep glue was smeared all over the cheep leather save your do not buy,28,44
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,i was looking for a good stopwatch to help me with my training and figured i would give this inexpensive product a go it was fairly simple to set and it worked well until i noticed that the clock was falling behind i reset it and slowly it fell behind again i went and bought a new battery and it still fell behind i am looking at it right now after reseting it for the last time a couple of weeks ago and it is almost 15 minutes behind with the clock being so off it makes me wonder how accurate the other modes are i either recieved a shody stopwatch or some reconfiguring needs to be done by the manufacturer update 09/02/2006 was cleaning out my desk and came upon my stopwatch do not ask me why i still have it i was delt another hard blow when i looked at the clock again it has not fallen behind this time no instead it is twenty minutes fast i am incredibly disturbed by this i believe i will go lie down and try to forget about this oh so traumatic experience,189,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,good stopwatch for the price it does feel like plastic and it does basic functions however feels that it can break easily,22,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,great for track and field these timers work great and are a bargain actually found they will work for several seasons on the same battery,25,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,works great no problems for our use not a professional stopwatch but good for everyday use would recommend good price,20,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought the sportline 240 stopwatch about 8 months ago it has always been a little funky specifically not responding when i hit one of the buttons now it periodically has the display go out it will come back on about 5 minutes later i have reseated the battery and ultimately replaced the battery but it still does not work consistently bottom line is that i can not recommend this watch to anyone,72,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought this product sportline econosport 240 as an impulse buy when checking out at a local sport store had i read the reviews on amazon i would have known better the very brief instructions which are printed on the container are unintelligible as reported by other reviewers the alarm seems to go off at random times and there is no obvious way to stop it i was hoping that the sportline website might have a manual with better instructions the web site says that the manual can be found on the website but i can not find it overall i think that the combination of a poor user interface and poor instructions is the worst i have ever seen on any product,122,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,super annoying beeping that you could not turn off until i disassembled the product and snipped cables inside to turn it off it worked well until it died just a few months after i got it waste of money,39,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,the stopwatch works seems accurate anyway but i can not set the time of day on this thing I have done exactly what the instructions are telling me i can switch between hours and minutes but i can not select anything to make the watch begin i really think there is something wrong with the watch i guess it does not matter but the watch should work,63,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i do not know how a company can sell such utter crap hit a button and it clicks twice starts and stops now i have to bang it against something hard to get the led to display this company does not deserve a penny of ours,45,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the first one i received had a defective left reset button no way to reset the count-up time i returned it and got a replacement which functioned perfectly i love amazon they even refunded the postage required to send back the defective unit,43,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,i use the stopwatch primarily for timing student presentations i have not had to change the battery once in over 5 years amazing,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,this one attempts to be a stopwatch clock alarm and calendar it can not do any of these functions well every one of these functions get messed up because of the haphazard mode button to switch between the clock and the stopwatch you have to go through the alarm set mode then the clock setting mode this causes you to set the alarm for 100am and to reprogram the time moreover it is not rugged enough to survive a long jog without getting messed up very annoying inaccurate and worthless,89,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,product is excellent and exceeded my expectations i would definately suggest recommend this product to anyone,16,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,in the instruction manual for this stopwatch it says chime is on when dashes appear above display chime is off when no dashes appear unfortunately the instructions are lying the alarm on this watch will go off regardless of dash situation there is absolutely no way to turn off the alarm if you are there to turn the alarm off at the same time every day then this watch is a decent purchase everything else on it works well,79,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the stopwatches lost their battery life within 1 - 2 weeks they constantly went off for no reason and it was not very easy to use the ones that did not die served their purpose,32,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,now that my elementary school aged girls are taking timed tests this has been great for timing their homework it is easy to use and seems to take a lot of abuse,32,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,this is such a great stopwatch it is so much fun to play with the timing is incredible and has features such as a clock and a calender it is a very easy using stopwatch and i love it,39,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,i love these i label them with silver marker and the kids love all the events they can participate in at the birthday parties,24,0

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,size of trophy in photo was very misleading actual product was very small,13,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,they are exactly how they look in the pic awesome,10,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,they worked great for the prizes we needed one arrived broken thus the 4 star but was easily glued back together as the top had separated from the base would purchase again if needed for prizes,36,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,they did what they were supposed to do we gave them out as joke awards at my daughters 5th grade picnic the base will hold an address label very nicely so you can print out a name good price the kids seemed to like them it is been a few months and my daughters has not broken yet a few did arrive broken although hence the missing star so buy more than you need although super glue will fix them,78,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,there were many broken trophies it was a good thing i ordered extras i ordered 6 packages and there were 10 broken ones i had to repair a couple with a glue gun in order to have enough for the group,41,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the description made it seem like the main part of the trophy was 4 instead of the total height being 4,32,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,trophies themselves were nice downside a third of them arrived broken i had to use hot glue to put them back together as i needed to use them better packaging is suggested esp at the cost,36,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,they are super cute only 11 came in the pack i thought it was 12 then out of the 11 4 came broken i took a picture but for whatever reason it will not let me upload the picture disappointed,40,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,great little trophy decently made did not fall apart or arrive broken used for an ugly christmas sweater contest perfect for it is use,22,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,definitely a noveltyexactly what i wanted,8,11

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,just as stated arrived in time no problems,8,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,the trophies were exactly what i expected when buying a dozen for 5 bucks except that out of the 12 only 7 of them were still intact by the time they got to me five of them had been completely snapped at the neck where the cup meets theif i needed more than 5 of them i would return them for refund or replacement of the 7 that did make it in one piece they are what you would expect for being so inexpensive plastic throughout with some inconsistencies in the manufacturing process so there are little blemishes here and there and the necks do seem solid for something so small / cheap so it is kind of surprising that 5 of them came broken my recommendation is that if you need 12 of them order 2 dozen or find a different option,142,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i am very upset with this product do to the fact that i purchased 7 dozen and 20 of the trophys are broken now i am trying to find additional items due to poor product,37,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,the trophies work for what i needed them for unfortunately i ordered 4 packages and a total of 5 of them were broken when they arrived,26,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,as many others state many of the trophies arrived broken we chose to order these mainly since we only needed a few and knew some would arrive damaged now some would say if we knew that then we can not rate it down well just because you know something is poor quality does not make it less so this is mainly to keep letting people know problems have not been fixed expect many of them to arrive broken if you only need a few you are good if you need them all pick them up at a local party store,97,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i ordered the 12 piece and only 8 were in one piece an additional one broke after being set upright i ordered for my 6 year old and he was disappointed will not suggest this to anyone yes i can glue back together but i should not have to for a paid product should have gone to the dollar store,59,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,every single trophy was broken and they were so cheap and ugly that i could not even fix them i hated this product and i hope no one ever buys these small awful plastic pieces of junk,36,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,good small 3 inch tall trophies perfect for rewarding toddlers after they finish a race or clean up their room and more excellent value,23,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,cheap plastic trophies perfect for birthday parties and more if you are looking for high quality and durability these are not what you are looking for but served my needs perfectly one arrived broken so plan accordingly if you need the exact amount in the package by ordering in time to get replacements if necessary,53,21
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i bought this for my sons cars inspired birthday and out of the box 4 were broken during the party more broke dissapointed in the quality,26,22
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,four out of 12 arrived broken they will not last my students receiving them as i intended to use them they are going back,23,23
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,after reading some of the reviews i was hesitant to order these however all of my trophies arrived in perfect shape and they look great i added a gold foil label to them for the award and they were perfect for our class reunionawards,46,24
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,i got 12 very small trophies they break very easily i broke couple of them right after i opened the package,21,25
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,i like these little trophy replicas quite clever a swell way to grant a kudo and friends can start a collection add a touch of the i am the winner to the one who receives this for performance above and beyond,40,26
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,these little trophies were a perfect reward for timed tests in math i just printed an aavery label and stuck it on the kids loved them,26,27
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,ordered a set to give out themed trophies at a party i was hosting were a big hit make sure you have a label maker of some kind to mark the trophies sharpie did not turn out great,37,28
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,2.0,negative,these arrived on time but half of them were broken off the base and one was completely broken there were exactly 12 in the package made in china,28,29
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,5.0,positive,these little gifts are corny but fun i may buy more and pass them out to other students in my classes,21,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,1.0,negative,i ordered these for my sons 3rd birthday party i did not expect them to be high quality but at least not break or arrive broken in my bag of 12 there were at least two broken and the rest seemed like they would easily break once in a kids hand returning and buying a better quality,57,31
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000OD5TNG,4.0,positive,threw an award ceremony for work and ordered 2 dozen of these they are small-ish but really fit my needs printed labels for the award categories and placed them on the base only one broke during shipment which was better than i expected i would get these again if the situation called for a trophy,55,32
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,i love the design of this lighter it is built solid enough to use as a weapon holds lots of butane and points an led light at whatever you are trying to light at night perfect for campfires the dual flame type for wind resistance also burns the fuel more efficiently so it does not leave black smudges on glass or metal surfaces it would be a great lighter if it worked 1 worked for about a week before the led light quit working the switch stopped clicking i did not send it back for repair instead i cut back the rubber to jam the safety button to make it light easier then ordered a new one 2 arrived empty and 4 attempts to fill it failed with a hissing sound at the refill valve this one i sent back to zippo for warranty repair 3 arrived today they sent me a brand new one but the led switch does not click at all so the light does not work I am right back where i started 3 out of 3 have been defective disgraceful for a company like zippo especially at 3200 retail,191,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4.0,positive,got one for christmas works well although it does require a little effort to hit the 2 buttons in sequence to get it lit i got it down but my wife hates that part which probably makes it child and accident-proof the instructions mention that this is a windproof lighter at least if you keep blowing it out it will relight that does not mean it will stay lit in high winds but it will relight when the wind dies down as long as you are still holding the buttons the windproof-effect has something to do with 2 flame outlets the main orifice has a small glowing grille next to it is a tiny hole where another flame comes out the flame itself is not a jet but like that of a candle the built-in led light works ok and the button for that is easy to operate the black rubber handle only seems to add bulk but it will not slip out of your hands the carabiner clip is probably useful I had give it 5 stars if it were not for the double-button push required to light,185,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5.0,positive,i received the zippo oul as a gift about a week and a half ago i comes filled and with batteries it is a wonderful gadget to have around the house for lighting candles and citronella torches on thethe tiny light is great for outdoor lighting in the dark,51,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5.0,positive,my male relatives have everything and consequently are difficult to buy for i found this lighter quite by accident and am glad i did my brother is hard to impress but this did the trick he immediately took it camping and was very pleased with it is performance i followed up by purchasing three more for other members of the family I am next,62,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,for 3400 bucks i expected a tourch i get a stronger and longer flame from a 500 throw away lighter you get at the hardware store apparently i can not return them so i got stuck with 2 of them i would never buy from affordable luxury,46,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5.0,positive,unit came very quickly works perfectly out of the package is a little larger than i expected better for lighting propane appliances and wood fires seems like it will be easy to refill,33,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,purchased from amazon and it worked ok for about 6 weeks followed filling instructions and use instructions zippo warranties it but you must pay shipping and send 10 do the math i stick with throw away bbq lighters now,39,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5.0,positive,although i sympathize with the button-safety haters fixing the problem took all of five minutes and i listened to mozart so it was quite pleasant complain all you want but it is better to do something is my philosophy whenever I am complaining about something the reason I am bestowing five stars on this tool is the combination of quality and price I am biased toward zippos anyway because they are simple and they work 999 of the time most things in life work 75 of the time and not always that for what i paid in plastic refillables with triggers in the winter of 1999 i could have bought two of these so I am going to buy another now and another one yet for a gift buy this tool leave the safety alone if you have little kids fix it if you do not with a tiny phillips screwdriver and it will last for years,150,7
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,functional but not very practical it is a lot bigger and clunkier than it looks online and very heavy i would be better off just with a candle lighter,28,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,i should have read the reviews i bought this thing thinking it would be a really useful addition to my emergency kit i can not figure out how to make it light you have to destroy the package to get it open and cut through the instructions in the process instructions are cleverly hidden on the inside of the cardboard cover the fine print says it will not work at altitudes over 5000 feet i live at 8000 feet i can not see in the fuel gauge whether it has any fuel or not i would be sending it back except it says you can not do that,104,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,the product is okay it is pictured with having an attached cover / top however it did not come with one perhaps that is why it was considerabley less expensive i find that very misleading and i would not buy from that vendor again,42,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,this product is difficult to light hard to see the refill line and adjust the flame the high setting not enough and if you turn it down to low the flame goes out the flame goes out easily at other times probably would work indoors but matches or a inexpensive candle lighter would work just as well,57,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4.0,positive,i was looking for aburner lighter for my camp stove most that you buy are disposable and i hate throwing things away comes with a nice key ring for hanging it up the drawbacks are 1 the fuel level window is so small and does not go through to the other side of the lighter so i can not see the level and 2 you have to push two buttons at once child proofing to turn on the flame they are quit stiff because they are covered with a rubber shield and hard to depress together they recommend that zippo fuel only be used so i bought a can at the same time,113,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4.0,positive,this is a great lighter for camping or around the house it has a good design for an all purpose lighter one thing that really was a pain was the paper warning sticker that they placed over one of the fuel windows this is one of those stickers that tears into a thousand little pieces when you try to remove it have they heard of removable plastic stickers or removable glue like on post-it notes,75,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,has good design but flame is weak and easy to blow out ignition switches are very difficult to press,19,14
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4.0,positive,only problem I have had is hitting the the light switch accidently when lighting the flame and killing the batteries and will not work at all wish they put the light switch somewhere else or safety switch for it other than that i love it,43,15
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,i purchased the zippos mpl line worthless too and thought this outdoor model would be better i had the same problem it takes about 3 attempts to get this going if you try hard enough you can probably can it going on the first attempt but good luck they way over do it with the safety feature it is so good that nobody can get it working wish they would just do away with the safety button bottom line is that it looks cool but when i reach into the drawer to get the bbq going i get my 4 bic to get the fire going,104,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,i was very excited to get this product because i am tired of the cheap 5 lighters that you get from the supermarket however when i got this i was horrified by the performance the first thing i noticed when i tried to light it is that the flame is pitiful it barely comes out the end yes i adjusted the knob at the bottom all the way up the flame is also very easy to blow out i was trying to show my kids that it would relight so i let them blow on it but it would go out with even the smallest puff from my 2 year old and it would never come back the led light also takes stupid watch batteries so beware of that i am very disappointed and i am going to be sending this back as soon as possible,146,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,this lighter is certainly child-proof in fact it is so hard to ignite that you will likely need two hands and a couple of attempts it looks cool but must not have gone through any usability testing i bought this lighter because i associate zippo with quality products this product changed that perception,54,18
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,this lighter was essentially dead on arrival i read all instructions before attempting to use it after a dozen or so futile attempts to get it to light i read the instructions again i topped it off with butane set the flame adjust to maximum and double checked that the batteries were installed properly still nothing after many more frustrated attempts to engage the very difficult to use safety and ignition buttons at the same time it finally produced a flame about an 1/8th of an inch high wind resistant a baby could blow out this flame by the way it is not actually manufactured by zippo in bradford pennsylvania according to the package thisis manufactured in china to zippo quality standards zippo should be ashamed of itself this is an expensive piece of junk with their name on it,142,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2.0,negative,in my last dive trip 3 eco flares only last 1 or 2 dives because a bad seal let water get into bat compartment,24,0

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2.0,negative,i am a kayaker it worked for about 2 years no leaks it just quit for no visible reason it looks all dry and clean inside new batteries or replacing bulb does not help disappointed in what i thought was my trusty eco flare,43,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5.0,positive,love these flares for cylinder attachment great for seeing buddy in low viz situations would recommend to others great battery life,21,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2.0,negative,i purchased this to put in my bike pack for use as a back signal to oncoming traffic and also to have an extra light if i need with the interchangeable bulb out of the box i thought i had a defective product the batteries that the product came with were dead when i put my own batteries in i had to spend a while switching them around and rotating the bulb assembly when it finally lit up so if you think your light does not work just fiddle with it for a little while longer so with brand new high output batteries this light is barely brighter than a 7w bulb in my oven i do not feel safe using this as a signal light on my back for riding my bike on the road at night i would not recommend people use this for that purpose at all at this price point their are other options i will keep it around as a back up for backcountry riding just as a emergency signal because they claim it has 500 hours of light which is much more than any other light system i have,194,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1.0,negative,cheap junk very poor design you think they would make a better quality light i do not trust this light not good,21,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5.0,positive,nice little reliable marker light i attach it to my tank by the lanyard for night diving it is nice and visible but does not give off a light that you could read by so it will not blind your buddy but your buddy will know where you are the light came with a blinking red led installed and a spare white constant on led that can be swapped for the blinker so you can use this as a navigation flare,79,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1.0,negative,changed batteries changed bulb never could get it to turn on total waste of time and money i guess i can use it to store matches in,27,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4.0,positive,compact size and easy to use twist the lens cover to turn led off and on includes a solid burn white led bulb and a red led that flashes great for night dives or lowdives to identify you buddy or group,43,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5.0,positive,small lightweight reliable what more need be said the led uses very little battery power and provides a good way to find your dive buddy,25,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4.0,positive,could be brighter probably plenty at night but not as bright as i had hoped for monterey green water diving,20,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,2.0,negative,the package is so simple there is no users manual or anything to specify how to use this light i installed the battery then seal the white top then nothing happen the light did not turn on and there is no controler or anything on the body i do not know what happened i suppose that light will be on after i installed the battery,62,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1.0,negative,just received it thought it looked like good quality saw it was made in the united states and was even impressed that it had duracell batteries instead of some no name cheap ones i put the batteries in and nothing swapped out for the red bulb nothing tried different aaa batteries nothing i am returning this faulty one and a new one is supposedly on the way from amazon will update if the 2nd try is better 2nd try failure i received the 2nd unit quickly amazon return process is quite easy however this unit did not work either incredibly disappointed,104,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5.0,positive,i purchased this beacon in a three light set to date it has been on three dives and doing fine for the flooded compartment review i recommend using a silicone lube to grease the o ring and threads it makes it easier to turn and water tight i use silicone lube available from ikelite with all my flashlights also check the batteries mine arrived doa and had to be replaced my beacon is specific to which direction the light module goes in and will not work if reversed the flashing red beacon stands out and is not a throw away light like the chem lights two thumbs up for eco friendly hope this helps happy diving my friends,117,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4.0,positive,i got this to put on my dog collar for night time walks and when i let him out in the yard at night by himself it is water proof and it turns on with a twist the best selling point is the 500 hour burn time on the red flashing bulb it would be nice if it was a bit smaller but considering the price and battery it users it is not that bad because i have a large dog he does not complain only gripe i have was swapping the bulb from white to red flashing it comes with a little package that has the two bulbs in it you need to pull the one in the flash light out and push the new one in took me a good 15 minutes to get the bulb out and the new one in,142,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,4.0,positive,this is a nice little light the blinking red bulb burns bright and i use it as a safety light for my bicycle,23,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,1.0,negative,i just received this today it does not work neither bulb checked batteries they are fine i needed this light for a special project and am now very frustrated i will just buy one of those dollar store things and modify it I shall be back to let you know about how the return went rate light 0 stars amazon took care of the return in an instant kudos to amazoncom amazoncom gets 5 stars for their prompt and seamless customer service for this,83,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B0002YRLI8,5.0,positive,i have used this light for two years now i use it mounted to a rack on my mountain bike i like the simplicity in just tightening it to turn it on and off i commute a lot and use it daily i have replaced the batteries only once and that was just to be safe i am still on the same original bulb holds up great in the rain and can take the punishment of being knocked around on a bike i ordered two more so cars can see me even better not one complaint,96,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,original shipping envelope allowed stone to be broken in shipment amazon immediately replacedno charge only with my notification by e-mail i am very happy with sharpener and with buying from amazon js,34,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the only instructions are diagrams no words on the back of the package and it took me a couple minutes to figure out how to adjust the blade holder once set up the tool and supplied stones did a great job on my plane blades and an old chisel very pleased,51,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this product worked well when used to sharpen several wood chisels and a blade for a small block plane the device used to hold the end of the chisel / blade at the proper attitude relative to the sharpening stone worked really well,41,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone itself has several spots where it protrudes out in a significant bump forcing me to avoid that area when sharpening in addition the fine grit side did not come flat so when using the sharpening jig i can not get continuous flat contact,44,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I have used this product a few times i have to say is cery badly made plastic rollers are drilled of center so it wobbles so bad the degrees guide is just as bad made of plastic and can not even find a flat spot on the jig to make your chisel parallel to the jig worse jig i have purchased the cheaper one are better than this one do not get started with the oil stone completely garbage made my chesils and planes so much worse,84,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i have tried to hand sharpen my chisels that was a mistake and this system fixed them and now can use chisels in the way they were meant to be used never put water on the stone made a mess that was my fault and am still working on it to get the rust out but the system is pretty darn good and will use it till the stone is a nub,72,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,seems to work ok identification buy another bottle of oil if you do not have any the stone soaked up the entire bottle that is provided before i could sharpen anything the angle gauge is flimsy it is just a piece of plastic that you flip over it does work but i know that I am going to lose it rendering the entire thing useless update i used this thing with different stones and it worked pretty well i put in a plane iron and spent about 5 minutes on about 3 different stones it definitely does a better job at angles than i can I am leaving at 4 stars due to the wiggly plastic angle gauge,115,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the sharpening stone seems decent and the sharpening oil usable the problem is the sharpening guide it could have been good if the wheels on the sharpening guide were made of something other than cheap plastic aside from the fact that they are plastic the wheels also seem to wobble a bit i was excited about getting a new sharpening guide but this was disappointing,65,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,does a good job but the directions were a little unclear as how to set it up the way i needed,21,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,verry disappointed with this buy the stone looks like a banana and the guide is worthless can not tighten the screws to hold a chisel in place and the plastic angle guide is so sloppy is useless,36,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone and the jig are fine but the oil bottle was empty very disappointed,15,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great got my stanley jack plane honed to perfection,10,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i love this product it is easy to understand and use and i get consistency with every time i sharpen my chisels on plane blades,24,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this thing is as cheap as can be it does hold the chisel or plane blade securly but had to use a metal ruler to get it straight in the clamp it comes with a guide to do this but it is plastic and moves all of the place so you can not trust it the wheels on the jig are made of plastic and horrible the oil stone it comes with acts like every other oil stone and clogs up and it is worthless 5 seconds into the sharpening process i used the jig on sandpaper and water stones to get my plane blade sharp threw the rest away,107,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,really did not like using the oil otherwise it is ok,9,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,it is everything that i expected it to be,9,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,everything needed to keep my chisels sharp i recommend,9,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,excelletn quality and just right for my favorite chisels and bench planners,12,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,there are way better options out there for under 25 the guide is loose sloppy and make it very difficult to square your blade due to it being a top clamp style the stone is bottom of the barrel it might make a good edging stone for landscaping although oil is good although but then again a glass of tap water will work as well so,66,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very good it met all of my expect ions thanks,10,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the stone had a big divot in the middle of the fine side the angle guide works although,18,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great deal all works as expected at half the cost of a local store,14,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the stone and oil were fine but the actual tool is sloppy and not well made,16,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not great guide is garbage no way to reliably repeat grinds with any accuracy will not buy again stone not marked and grits feel same total waste of money,28,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the rollers on the guide wobble this also arrived damaged and leaking in the package i know that is not applicable to every single unit sold but that is what happened to mine I shall use the sharpening stone to sharpen blunt force tools like axes but this is not going to be used for chisels and plane irons,55,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,there has better ones out there harbor freight amigos,8,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great love that you can lock down the chisel and sharpen it,13,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i use it many times a tear and it works great evry time,13,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,got to buy a different one do not like it at all like my dad used to say sometimes cheap is expensive live and learn,28,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,sharpen all of my planes and chisels the day i got this kit great for my wood shop,18,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone was not flat and the guide was very difficult to set properly getting the chisel or plane blade set square was too tedious i would not recommend this product at all,33,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,cheap poor construction plastic wheels finger tight locking only sloppy angle gauge and the list goes on if you just want something to sharpen and take the chips out of your beater chisels you do not care about this is a good choice if you want a decent guide for your work chisels that you count on keep looking,58,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,sub par was looking for a cheaper solution to sharpen my plane irons but i should have just gone with the japanese water stones they do not even tell you which stone is which if you need to sharpen stones go get a good set of water stones and save yourself the hassle,51,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the hone broke on the first day of use the plastic bushings keeps coming out and it is all very flimsy,19,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,love it great for the mature home carpenter,8,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this was quite a disappointment my first order arrived with the stone broken in three pieces this was not a big deal as amazon was awesome and replaced it with no trouble when i received the replacement and started trying to use it however it is kind of a piece of garbage the stone has inconsistencies that because audible clicks while sharpening and has a visible bow to it from the factory causing grinds to be slightly convex on the rough side and concave on the fine side which increases the work of sharpening by a lot and reduces control of the angles there is also a raised burr on one end of the stone on the fine side which you run the risk of slamming your freshly honed blade into if you are not attentive and careful the honing guide has a flat spot on one of it is wheels causing the blade to wobble while grinding in the end I am going to have to replace everything here with better products except for the oil which I have already mostly used on the stone I had recommend you skip this and go for something better this one does not even do the job as a cheaper entry level sharpening stone,204,35
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i bought this as a cheap way to get around buying diamond plates and it was definitely a shortcut i would not take again i just started restoring an old plane and although this would be an easy way to get started the honing guide is very inaccurate as the plastic piece that helps determine the angle is quite loose and not precise you could hone two different times and start honing a different angle from the initial time the stone also go clogged easily and soaked up quite a bit of the oil on the first use it is also a bit too narrow for a plane it will work but a larger surface would be much easier spend a little bit more money and do not waste your time on this product it might be good for other projects like small knife sharpening but the honing guide is a paperweight now,151,36
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,no directions had no clue what i was supposed to do or on which side to start the process soaked up all the oil did not sharpen as needed should have returned,30,37
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,instructions are not very helpful but once you figure out which sides of the stone are course and fine it does do a good job on chisels if they are simply dull this is what you need if they are in bad shape you will need to have them professionally re-cut,47,38
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i bought this as spare kit to keep as i got one in use it may not as the pro but if you pay more attention to try it you may find this is a fine tool for sharpening your knife chisel or plane blade,45,39
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,everything is sharp now just hope we do not cut ourselves,11,40
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,very good my chisels have never been sharper and square i could sharpen my chisel but the points were not square and this made it real easy,27,41
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,bought some used wood planes for a great price i needed a sharpener to keep them sharp thanks to businesses who sell on amazon i was able to get a sharpener,31,42
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,bought this a month ago to sharpen chisels it does not clamp the steel as solidly as i would have liked and it is slightly difficult to ensure the object it is truly square in the gig i bought a less expensive guide from a fine woodworking company and have no issues with the new purchase,54,43
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,my first impression when i received this was it looked like a cheap quality especially the plastics on top of it which guide the angle length of the blade being sharpened but i guess what has more you could expect from the already such a low price in use it does the job pretty well with two issues one is to check alignment of the blade being sharpened the other is to keep the blade locked in position i have to re-tightened both knob tight as he shall just to keep the blade from sliding and misaligned,95,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this is a truly remarkable peice of junk got it and the stone was severely crooked and the guide is absolutely subpar the oil i did not use as i sent it back come on stanley you used to be a decent manufacturer,43,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,works ok but is hard to keep parallel adjustment screws are hard to turn,14,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,my husband is very happy with the sharpening system,9,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works very well however i did need to look online for a video on how to use it graphical instructions were useless,23,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great product instructions pretty well suck but the device and stone are top notch anyone with some experience working with their hands should be able to figure it out i would buy it again,34,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not very good flimsy and inaccurate the stone is also under any expectations the simple made-in-china ebay items are much better,21,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the guide will get you out of square and the stones need too much lapping because the guide makes a dent down the middle the oil is great buy a super cheap diamond sharpening box for 15 and vice style honing guide for 12 you can get very sharp that way this system is frustrating and makes you think you are doing something wrong,64,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works great but it takes a little practice,8,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this is a well-made product at a good price shipment arrived on schedule,13,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,just as described good product at a good price highly recommend,11,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very handy I am just getting into sharpening and this has helped tremendously I shall probably upgrade to something else in the future but I am glad i bought this,28,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this has worked well for me for it is intended purpose it is not the best quality but it is good as a carpenter I have used it to keep my chisels and plane blades sharp for the last 4 years using the guide seems like a hassle in the middle of a job it can be a little tedious to square but it really does give you a better cuttingwhen you can keep the blade angle perfectly straight the only improvement I had like to see on this is a guide to help square what ever blade you are putting in it if you are not sharping blades all the time you really do not need the guide but what i paid for this was about the same as the price of a decent stone and small bottle of oil anyways so i basically got the guide for free i consider that to be a good value but do your own pricing research before you buy if cost is an issue for you,169,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great i really like the way it holds the chisels so tightly i have used numerous sharpening systems for my chisels and planes and this one works the best so far but what else would you expect from stanley good buy for a great price,46,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the real way to sharpen things to a razors,10,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,got this as a gift for the holidays not great it does not tell you which side is a finer grit and it is hard to tell by just feeling it the gauge i do not use as it seems clunky and just seems easier to do by hand the oil soaks straight into the stone so it provides very little lubrication i ended up getting wet / dry sandpaper of varying grits and wrapping it around the stone to sharpen my chisels the surface is flat which is the only thing i really like about it but i could have gotten the same effect from an old piece of glass so overall I had save your money and get something different,116,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,nice good material and build quality looks feels solid i like so far,13,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,while certainly cheaper than some of the other honing jigs out there I have noticed a tendency of most chisels to skew as I am sharpening i notice this even although i try to make it really tight i did not notice this as much with my hand plane blades i do like the built in angle measuring function it is really handy and makes changing your angle easy that is kind of put to the side although if things shift too easily there are markings that are supposed to help you keep things straight but they are not incremental enough for the common chisels that i put in 1/4 1/2 3/4 and 1 - 1/2 i am admittedly new at this with a honing jig so perhaps i just need more practice i spent a couple of afternoons cleaning up some old blades and there is a large improvement in sharpness i do wish there was a way to ensure that the blade is hitting the stone more flat so that it does not create an angled bevel,172,61
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,nice system and it works guide for proper angle of sharpening chisels,12,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i could not wait for this product to arrive sharpening planes and chisels can be a pain and if you do not do it correctly those tools will not work very well as soon as it got here i put it to the test it performed flawlessly i sharpened several planes and chisels and they are sharp as razors what a great product,60,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I am not one who writes negative reviews very often but in this case this guide is not worth the money the stone is cheap and i was ok with that but the guide is darn near useless you can not get the blades to site square and forget about a chisel for something as important as keeping hand tools sharp spend the extra money and get a better quality i can not stress enough how useless the guide is might as well do it freehand,83,64
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i love this product it makes my tools nice and sharp i would totally recommended,15,65
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,could not be cheaper find a better quality one than this,11,66
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it works great slow as any hand operation would be but you control things and this jig lelps,18,67
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i purchased thissometime ago i had several chisels that needed touched up so i decide to open this up and try it i will tell you the quality of the stone is terrible the stone started to dish within a dozen passes across it the jig seems to have a good design by the appearance but it is awful it does not apply enough pressure to keep a chisel tight i could freehand on a bench grinder and have a better finish i would not recommend this to anyone i usually use a good stone and do it by hand and that is what i will be doing in the future,112,68
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,do not waste your money the only redeeming thing about this set is you can use the stone for something else,21,69
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great product and explains how to use it so well a middle school kid can use it,17,70
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,why do i love it for 10 i get a stone some oil and a simple jig hard to find a place to go and eat for less than 10 i have some simple chisel i use every blue moon they are dull but i do not throw things away i used the jig yesterday and they are sharp now professional sharp i do not think so 100 square nope but way better than it was before there is not enough oil to soak the stone i used simple air tool oil i had around and it worked fine some of the reviews here i do not understand professional wood worker implies that he spend hundreds of for good chisel and buys a simple jig for 10 to sharpen them give me a break i saved 5 chisel yesterday even when i buy new ones from the chinese tool store i pay way more and they are still not as sharp as mine now for the money I am happy,167,71
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,a bit difficult to set up the instructions on setting the angle of the blade is poor could use a more cutting oil a lot more for the stone drinks up huge amounts of oil leaving little on the surface i used up half the bottle with one small plane blade and one spokeshave blade once set up it does and ok job,64,72
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i was long over due on the purchase of this it is a must have tool if you have wood cutting tools most of the newer tools are made outside of this country and tend to dull faster than normal so far so good,42,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,works as advertised with a little learning curve oil is not enough for much more than a few sharpenings as the stone really soaks it up fast die cast tool guide is a bit cheap with the plastic angle indicater price is rite,43,74
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,big stone bigger than i wanted but not complaining about getting more than i paid for,16,75
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,save your money this sharpening jig is crap it is nearly impossible to square your blade in the jig and one of the plastic rollers that helps the jig slide across the stone was lopsided and caused the blade to wobble side to side when i tried to sharpen it,50,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,would not call this a sharpening system more like a sharpening gadget dont waste your money,15,77
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,if you are looking at this system you are probably a low-budget entry-level woodworker the tool holder is fine but the stone is junk just buy a good diamond stone the dmt and you will end your suffering trying to sharpen chisels and plane blades,43,78
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,in order to post a rating you have to give it a star well i over rated it,18,79
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,makes sharpening my chisels and hand planers really easy,9,80
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,pros cheap does the job quite well cons plastic parts seem flimsy but non have broken it is kind of hard to set it up correctly but you will get the hang of it you will quickly run out of oil,38,81
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i received mine with a broken stone but i already had others so i did not care about that i mainly just wanted the angleand was extremely dissapointed with the quality of it the oil is fine but the angle guide fell apart after about the third chisel i sharpend,51,82
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the honing guide is really flimsy the stones are not very flat the oil is not any better than water I had look for something just a little more expensive i did buy the cheap diamond honing set about 9 and they worked much better than this stone on the look out for a better honing guide now,56,83
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,stone came gouged on one side the guide is cheesed quality and there were no decent instructions,17,84
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,works great got a finefrom the start as long as you do not bite into the stone and use the oil you will get great results,27,85
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,my stone came with a crown on the course side and cupped on the fine side and the angle guide is not accurate time after time very disappointing,28,86
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i do handy jobs around the house this is a good addition to your tool set not expensive no need to deal with blunt knives and chisel anymore,28,87
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,not very useful because the stone is too small it is not capable of taking the widths of chisels advertised without major gymnastics and with the loss of any straightaccuracy ok for very narrow chisels I am glad i did not pay full price for what i received,48,88
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,the stone keeps clogging up with the oil that came with the kit at this point the stone is unusable the holder is difficult to get the correct angle needed to sharpen properly all-in-all a waste of money i had to go to a local hardware store and get another stone and honing oil that one worker flawlessly a total piece of junk,63,89
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,waste of time and money you can not ensure you are installing the blade square to the holder / stone not worth the cost to send it back headed to the metal recycling bin,31,90
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,it holds firmly and rolls smoothly it takes some trial and error to a blade for a plane nice and square but once you get it right it holds tightly the stone is a good size and holds up to heavy use but the edges were not very smooth when i got it it had kind of a crown going a round it a few seconds with a cheap diamond plate solved that,72,91
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,it is not well made the stone can be dressed but there is no hope for the clamp it wobbles very badly because the rollers are very out of round,29,92
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this sharpening system is a waste of money received the stone broken in half and the part to clamp the blade in is very hard to adjust and falls apart save your money i expected better of stanley,38,93
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great but watchout for stone breaking during shipment,8,94
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,a little complicated but worked as advertised as long as you know how to use the stone,17,95
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,it works but only after fiddling around with the 2 adjustment knobs that move the piece that secures your blade to the guide then there has the let us save and use low quality plastic parts on critical areas like the nuts that the adjustment screws screw into and the hones wheels the part that actually rolls back and forth across your stone plastic cmon like most things now days quality is on the decline while prices go up just another sign that americas end is near,85,96
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,great stone hones anything you put to it this is a nice kit and easy to use the angle guide is helpful but not perfect I have ended up going freehand most of the time,34,97
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i received this sharpening system today and quickly went to the chisels the first thing i noticed was that it does not tighten to the sides of the blade causing you to take great care in order ensure that the blade is square and true to the stone the stone seems to be of decent quality and i think the system will work okay i believe you will be much happier with the robert larson honing guide for 12 here on amazon although it does not come with a stone it is still the better buy,94,98
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,for me this works really well i just use it for sharpening chisels with a little patience and a sharpie the plastic piece that flips out works well to set the angle i just draw a line across the micro-bevel to make sure that I am sharpening evenly my chisels come out really sharp,53,99
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,we get about a 1/2 day between sharpening of the stanley chisels which i do with a stanley sharpening tool with wheels which i spite of some unproductive negative reviews works quite well i also use the 1200 grit eze-lap 61sf as the stone i also use various 300 - 1000 grit wet or dry sandpaper for the coarse adjustments in the beginning of a lap as we use then we hold a chisel vertical and either drag it towards or away from ones self good boat guys learn to push it away but i lack the acquired strength and drag it towards this can be done with or without heat if the varnish or cetol is thick heat it with the cheap harbor freight heat shrink gun until it bubbles a little and quickly drag the chisel and it comes right off easily,142,100
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,the stanley honing guide is wonderful there is no rocking no guessing about whether the wheel is level on the stone i am getting perfect edges and my woodworking is much better as a result,35,101
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my father retired contractor he loved it and wants another one for back up,19,102
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,something that keeps chisels and plane blades sharp,9,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,great for sharpening plane blades and chisels the holder accurately holds the tool in place and let us you get a real good,23,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,angle guide is a little stiff so take your time and work adjusting screws evenly when fitting a blade used it to put a niceon 3 old plane irons and seems to work well for my needs,39,105
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this product is incredibly cheap and you get what you pay for the sharpening stone is warped / distorted one side has a crown and a cup on the other side so one side contacts the out side edges of the blade and when you flip it for the finer grit it only contacts the center i will try and flatten it before i throw it in the trash now the honing guide looks pretty cheap and parts are stamped out of thin metal but is fairly easy to use and some what sturdy then it appears to be although i could easily imagine most people having aligning and squaring up the blade issues i would not recommend this product and plan to replace i do find it very intriguing that all of the amazon verified reviewers rated it 5 stars would be surprised if they ever laid eyes on the product or removed it from package,155,106
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,if you truly use hand planes and you take pride in your work and tools for work or hobby you would never use this product garbage,25,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,nice sharpening stone and holder set used it to sharpen 2 wood chisels and 2 block planes worked very good on all 4 different tools and had no problem making them all sharp would buy again as it is a very good tool set at a very good price,49,108
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,nice sharpening stone will work great for planer blades,9,109
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,good value for the kit for sharpening tools,8,110
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,worked well the guide is not the best but for the price does the job,15,111
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i have another less expensive sharpening guide that has worked well but when i needed a second guide i thought I had try the stanley i have any number of stanley tools old and more recent although more recent examples exhibit declining quality i find with this guide accurate angles are impossible to acquire and reliably adjust and when trying to extract a spoke shave iron for example the tool came to pieces I am done with it I shall try to return this for a refund or else pitch it i urge prospective buyers to beware,93,112
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,just received this piece of junk what happened to stanley tool works silly thing comes with pictures on how it is supposed to work could not make heads or tails from the pictures pieces fell off the stone is to course for fine tools in general i will be returning for a refund total junk made in the country that is supplying most of our junk,61,113
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,I have been hesitated when i bought this product i found a lot more choices out there with a lot more good reviews but when the delivery came all the doubts were answered got fine honed and sharp plane blades 4 and 5 and chisels with scary sharp method throw the oil stone for kitchen knives and always have the true surface and fresh grit let the jig works and it pays beautiful flat and square bevel I have just started in woodworking for hobby andprojects this jig have reasonable price and become my entry point to sharpen my blade i never have confident nor satisfaction on my hands free sharpening this jig helps me a lot like it,119,114
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,it is a lot of work to sharpen one plane iron be prepared to be at this for quite awhile be patient getting it adjusted right is going to take some tinkering re-check that you have that right angle and that your blade is in there straight after you have been grinding a little while you do not want to have ground halfway there and then find out you are doing it on an angle you will be able to see what you have done on the iron still a lot easier than freehanded,91,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this stone is good for sharpening a camping knife but i used the jig with a japanese water stone and it is way sharper,23,116
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,there is a small learning curve to use this but i have found it to work as it should and have had no problems with it i carry it in my tool bucket and use it as needed,38,117
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the instructions are worthless you basically have to already know or figure out how to use it it is not clear which side of the stone is which it worked fine for sharpening the blade for the stanley plane i just bought but only because the plane came with detailed instructions for sharpening it,53,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i returned this piece of junk for a refund does not hold chisels at all and it is impossible to square plane irons blades with thumb screw clamp plastic wheels are not true and round and probably would not last stone is a cheap 3 stone like harbor freight purchased a stanley combination square that was not square and took it back too walmart stanley tools chinese made are junk like every other imported pos sold with aj american name shame on stanley,80,119
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i bought this to give my chisels a quick hone between jobs and it works good for that price was right quality is a bit mickey mouse will see how it stands up for the quickon a already fairly sharp tool it works good but is a little labor intensive if you try refurbishing a rough blade,59,120
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,the price was right and that i did like the rolling holder for the chisels which i did not intent to use does not look like it would work and in fiddling with it it fell into small pieces the stone itself is fine to put a roughon a camping knife and it is small enough to throw in a backpack pouch and forget about til you need it,70,121
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this is a good sharpening system i have and prefer the veritas system however because it is easier to set up otherwise this works just as well,27,122
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i purchased this product to sharpen chisels and plane irons the guide is so-so the irons move side to side in the carriage while sharpening and there has too much slop in the built in angle gauge to be useful the stones that come with the guide are horrible they are not even flat one end of the fine side of the stone is curved up like the grinder stopped in that spot are no instructions about how to condition the stone or use the guide all-in-all i can sharpen better without this product i definitely do not recommend buying this,100,123
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,mediocre at best very light duty and will wear out fast i think i will replace it with the work sharp ws3000 wood tool sharpener in the near future b000pvhimw,33,124
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,impossible to accurately set the bevel on plane irons and difficult to properly set-up for chisel blade sharpening i only use the stone and oil from the set,28,125
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,very clear directions very effective honing the planer knife i wanted it to use it for identification you have a hand planer it is a valuable tool,27,126
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,holding the blade only by the front and back face leaves no way to square the90 degrees to the sides other than just eye-balling it,27,127
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i hate to say it but this is a very low-quality product and not worthy of the stanley name the main body is made of stamped and bent sheet metal the fit and finish are rough and there is only one low-tolerance roller resulting in wobbling blades and chisels are also not held firmly resulting in rounded corners finally the stone itself is adequate for rough sharpening only and blades will require finishing on a much finer stone to be usuable bottom line what appears to be a good value is a waste of money for anyone who desires finely and accurately sharpened blades if you can afford it save your money for something better,115,128
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,i got the system to clean up my chisels and planes and worked fine i would recommend to anyone who wants to clean up their tools,26,129
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,meets expectations i had problems to place a chisel 1 but i think a good tool sorry for the bad english,22,130
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i managed to get two damaged chisels through my medium 1000grit stone before i noticed that cheep plastic wheels had developed flat spots which began causing the guide to skip drift or oscillate depending on pressure rendering it useless the combination stones grits feels to me to be in the neighborhood of a 250/600 but I am just guessing since there was no nomenclature defining grits provided in the kit the white oil leaking slightly on-arrival and worked fine for it is part in the sharpening process there is probably enough to recover three to five significantly damaged 1 chisels but i did not buy this kit for the stone or oil i bought it for the guide which for me was a waste of my time and money especially since i built a simple jig similar to the one in kwbs posted pictures pros cheep includes oil and a stone cons requires modification to work correctly easily broken poorbottom line this tool does not perform satisfactorily i would not buy it again,170,131
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,for under 20 this is worth buying but if you want a good stone make the investment there has a reason sharpening stones are so expensive i sharpened 2 chisels making sure to vary strokes so i would not form a groove and the stone still wore very unevenly the guide is worth 20 itself just what i needed and pretty easy to set I am still pretty disappointed I am about to go shop for a new stone,75,132
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this kit is perfect for wood workers who like to keep sharp tools it has everything you need to perform a profession job of sharpening your tools and is easy to use,32,133
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,I am a beginning wood worker and bought some planes second hand and wanted to sharpen them before using i bough this kit because it had the stone and oil included and i generally think of the stanley brand as being of decent quality for someone that is not going to be using daily them for professional purposes I have read articles and watched videos on sharpening plane blades i tried to use this guide but as stated in many other reviews it is virtually impossible to get the blade square in the guide then once i got the blade into the guide it was a huge pain in the a to get it out of the guide the cheap plastic pieces that the adjustment screws go into are horrible the rollers are cheap plastic as well I shall chock this one up to my own idiocy of not reading all the reviews of others who bought this before ordering and i will be purchasing a clamp type guide in the very near future and it will not have the name stanley on it,180,134
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,there is no better engineered and constructed wood working tools than those made by stanley they are consistantly of the highest quality,22,135
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,theis poorly machined and fitting the chisle in the guide especially since clear directions were non-existant very disappointed with the,23,136
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,i got this kit to sharpen my woodworking chisels and plane blades it is worked quite well so far the honing guide requires careful adjustment to get the blade square but it is not that hard to do so the stone is a bit gritty but that is fine with me if you are looking for a decent cheap sharpening kit this one is a solid choice you might also check rockler for the irwin / marple equivalent of this which a friend of mine bought and is happy with,84,137
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,this sharpening system is constructed very poorly from the cheap loose adjustment screws to the plastic angle adjustment gauge i would not recommend this product the stone even had voids in the surface on the fine side poor quality all the way around,43,138
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,this is a reasonably cheap and good little sharpening guide it is not fantastically robust the plastic guide on mine broke making selecting the correct angle difficult but not impossible but for someone who sharpens his tools only a few times a year it is perfectly adequate it works well on my stanley plane blade easily taking out a notch caused by a hidden metal fragment and it cleaned up and sharpened my chisels extremely well it takes a little care to set it up properly but all in all it is excellent value for money,96,139
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,i initially rated this stone highly but after using it for a few weeks i have found it to be too soft and dusty to be much use for chisels or blades the size is awesome and i am able to sharpen blades fairly well but it is difficult and spews powder residue all over on the rough side the fine side is useless i really wanted it to be good american quality it is not stanley should drop any poor suppliers as soon as possible while their name still has some shine on it their tools so far are still good this stone is not,102,140
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,excellent sharpening tool for plane blades got my stanley block plane razor sharp you just have to be careful and adjust the angle of the blade oil the stone and sharpen away i got the blade sharp enough to cut paper easily after sharpening the block plane never worked better get it sharpen your blades but take your time to adjust it and put the blade back in the plane correctly,71,141
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,5.0,positive,this simple sharpening set is worth every penny paid sure it could be better be more precise better made larger stones and it could also have cost 3 or 4 times as much too for the price this is the best thing i have found and it does with careful use do a good job i wish it had been made a touch more precise for setup and adjustment to keep the blade set just right centered and perfectly aligned but with a little extra care this does an excellent job i have not seen any better that you can afford to buy and use i did my first chizle this week and you could shave with it when done i would still buy it again,126,142
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,do not waste your money on this product the sharpening stone is extremely warped and spending the time to flatten the stone would take days the gauge is terribly cheap and it is very difficult to keep your iron or chisel square there are better gauges out there for similar cost,51,143
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,if you need a decent way to sharpen your 10 set of chisels and your 15 block plane this is the kit for you it is not real elegant but so what do you really need perfectly square tips to clean up notches you made with a circular saw this thing is good enough for your utility chisels and block planes both of which work a lot better sharp you will see if you need something better than this you probably know it if you just like having quality gear get a veritas,91,144
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,i consider this a total waste of money for the very simple reason that it is imposible to clamp a chisel or plane blade squarely there is no straightto register theof the blade on also the wheels are remarkably cheap plastic i am going to buy one of the standerdstyle guides,57,145
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,great product fits right into my sink awesome product stop food for going down and the sink yes i would recommend,21,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,believe it or not i ordered three versions of this strainer from different manufacturers i knew from experience that they tend to be cheap and poorly designed so i wanted to see which was the least poorly made this one is the best the post is made of plastic of course but unlike the others it remains in the open position when set and blocks the drain well I am buying a few more because it will wear out sooner than later,81,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,does not consistently set properly in the sink drain,9,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i use this on one side of my sink the side that is tyipcally empty and even although it has been relatively unexposed to most dishes it is broken after having it just a few months the center pin fell out and can not be put back in I shall have to try a different one now,54,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,i was worried that it would not fit my stainless steel sink that is quite old no problem it fit fine and it works fine,25,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,much better than the one i bought at the dollar store you get what you pay for,17,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,not exact oem quality but works well enough definitely does the job,12,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,does not fit all standard sinks measure your old stopper and the push pin was too short unhappy,18,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,about the only thing negative i can mention is that it does not fit 100 in the initial part of the drain hole of the sink and that there is not adjustment to open and close it also known as you have to pull it out to open the sink the rubber fits perfectly it is a lot easier to plug and unplug the grip does not hurt the hand even with a lot of water pressure to fight against and it is decent quality minor issues aside i recommend it if you are having problems finding a good one as i was,98,8
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,keeps stopping water flow even in the up position a real pain,11,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,best sink basket i tried worked perfect for 9 months broke after that ordering new one not sure how long sink basket should work but it is acceptable for me to change once in a year,36,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,original 5 star review fits and works perfectly much better design materials and construction than i expected for the price updated review purchased august 23 2014 center part separated from strainer basket november 18 2014 rendering the strainer useless this is what happened to the cheap one i bought from home depot except that one lasted 2 1/2 years this one only lasted 2 months this good looking piece of junk is not worth anything all it did is cost me it is price plus the cost of a better one and time and energy to first buy it and then replace it,101,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,my last review under rated this it appears flimsy when you get it but surprisingly it is sturdy and light weight cleans easily and this is the first sink basket I have had that actually holds water got to love it since i use it every day when doing dishes and it makes cleaning the sink a lot easier,57,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,total junk plastic and does not even fit can buy the same at wal mart for 097 cents save your money,20,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,it does not fit my sink i have a blanco double sink and the basket had to be returned because it was not just the basket but the entire parts that need a plumber the basket need not cost 2000 i do not see a phone number to speak to someone at blanco,53,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,cheaply made and overpriced better to go to home depot or lowes and spend a few bucks for a better sink basket,22,15
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,great price great product i love how the product works when you push the button to stop up the sink it is a spring type of action and really works no leaking no kidding,31,16
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,i should have listened to all the negative reviews of thisbut it seems as if none of the baskets are very good this basket is so light weight that as soon as water runs into it the rubber stopper drops from the open position it works fine to stop the water but is a constant nuisance to keep in the open position,64,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i encourage you not to waste your money no matter how much they sell this thing for the basket is metal but the thinnest cheapest stuff you have ever seen the post must be plastic at least it looks and feels like plastic the rubber gasket seemed to fit into my sink but it would not stay down would not lock and basically was useless i felt that if i pushed very hard on the stopper it would break pick one up at your local hardware store and you will be much better off,92,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,it stops the water from leaving the sink which is what i wanted as the others did not work well for me the reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it comes apart unexpectedly and i have to fish out the 3 parts and put them back together it still is the best water stopper ever,59,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,the quality is good but does not quite fit my sink right I am disappointed in this product i expected it to fit,22,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,all my other sink baskets that i bought at ace hardware and home depot lasted less than a week so I am encouraged that this will stay together i would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it is pretty light weight i do wish some company would make a sturdier product,54,21
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,one of my kitchen sinks is very fussy when it comes to a plug i have tried half a dozen different plugs and this is the only one that keeps all the water in even when left overnight,38,22
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,i have a standard size sink this stopper did not fit tightly enough to keep the water in it drained away slowly but drained out it is very light weight and cheap,34,23
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,we have had to buy 4 strainers in the last year for our sinks finally this one is made of good materials and we think it will last and do the job,32,24
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,this did not fit my standard size sink i should of purchased a banana slicer instead three inches is standard right,21,25
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,returned it it does not fit a insinkerator drain so the claim that it fits most sinks stretches the description a little,21,26
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,thought i would have to replace my double stainless-steel sink when my little strainer basket fell apart what a relief to find one of these on amazon for so cheap and free shipping we are sure the whole new double sink would have cost a bit more,46,27
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,every place I have lived there has been a sink basket with the option of letting it drain or using it as a stopper to collect dishwater in sink this does not act as a plug only let us water drain if i went to a dollar store to buy one i feel sure it would have the two options that i could use it as a stopper i do not get it why make one that does not,75,28
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,it fits my kitchen sink when i got it i had this very weird smell to it so whatever workshop it comes from must smell weird but it works great,30,29
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,1.0,negative,i bought this from reliable retailer it had a chemical odor the stainless steel sink basket does not look like the image the middle part is plastic,26,30
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,replaced old basket but the hole is much wider as i have a garbage disposable so it does not stop the water i do not need that feature anyways i keep my bucket in my sink when I am soaking dishes,38,31
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,2.0,negative,unfortunately it did not fit and keep the water from draining out of the sink i had hoped it would fit well,22,32
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,4.0,positive,good strainer works as advertised however there is a strong rubber smell the smell seems to lesson after each washing,20,33
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,this kind of sink basket is hard to find it is made in a special way at the bottom and is much more effective than other sink baskets,27,34
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001EES1LQ,5.0,positive,my local big box store has decided that it is better to sell fancy sink baskets and tail pipe assembly as a kit for about 30 dollars a lot less work when you just need to replace the stopper,39,35
