137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i love this case it is adorable but I have had it less than 12 hours and the tail has already come off if i could figure out how to fix it that would be great but otherwise everything has stayed glued on pretty well buttons are easy to push,49,2
138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,2.0,negative,fits my phone very well however i expected the design to be black and gray as pictured instead it is black and an orange radishif i would have known it was going to look like this i would not have bought it,41,3
139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made and does not fit my phone very well to short all the way around not giving the phone any protection fur coming off and it is brand new save your money and buy something somewhere else took way to long to ship from china and this is not a united states company,49,4
140,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,5.0,positive,i love it and i get all kinds of compliments on it,12,5
141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i saw this case and thought it was so cute i got the case and was disappointed be a use the quality it aweful the main part of the case is not soft at all the tail is soft hut feels like a feather the ears were horrible because they were put on and bow in the middle and art completely bent over which i hate the case is only worth what you pay really,75,6
142,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,5.0,positive,this is the cutest case i have purchased this is for sure a unique case that will catch peoples attention like mine did i especially love the tail it is soo soft and securely attached the fabric is attached pretty good and there has not been a problem with the ears falling off yet so I am very happy,56,7
143,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,4.0,positive,i got so many compliments on it it is so adorable only problem was one of the ears fell off after a couple of weeks of having it but that is easily fixable with some hot glue,36,8

145,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,5.0,positive,it came much sooner than the estimated arrival date it was packaged well it provides very little protection for the phone itself but i did not particularly expect it to it is absolutely adorable i love it is precious little ears and fluffy little tail so darn cute,45,10

147,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,4.0,positive,i heard so many mixed reviews about this case a lot of people saying parts were coming off and so on but i still gave it a shot because of the super low price i have to say that it completely met my expectations i adore it it looks just like the picture it is made out of really fuzzy material and the cat tale is simply adorable the only small complain i have is that the case makes it is a little hard to press the side volume buttons and the power one nothing you do not get used to but other than that it is a great case,106,12
148,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,thistook a long time to arrive which was expected the case was really cute but after only a few weeks of use the ear fell off it looked like it had been held on with glue so i tried myself to repair it but it did not hold i really wanted it to last because it was so cute,60,13
149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,i waited forever for my case and did not receive it then they wanted me to wait the same amount of time to get a new one but i did get a refund very fast although which was a good,40,14

229,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,i do not know what else to expect from short stories they are more like a summary of a longer book but it helped me pass some time,27,4
230,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,i loved these short stories it was a treat to get to read a bit of different stories and not be involved in one long one with the same characters a nice change and the writers did a great job dee madore,41,5
231,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,if you are looking for a quick romantic read with a few tantalizing tales this is a good book to pick up what a better way to spend the holidays than to sit by a cozy fire and read something hot and spicy you will enjoy these four short stories each one with a different femalei enjoyed the third story the most simons letter because it was fun trying to guess who was elizabeths secret admirer,78,6
232,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,2.0,negative,i downloaded this for free otherwise i would not have picked it the stories were short and very formulaic the emotion and intention were good however,26,7
233,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,1.0,negative,you know how you will sit through a bad movie thinking the ending wil make it better i was hopeful on this too and realized it was never going to get better these stories are like the teeny stories my friends and i would entertain ourselves with in 7th grade only not rated for young audiences sorry abbie,57,8
234,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,4.0,positive,not much to these in the way of substance or length but they helped me to fall asleep a couple of nights as i like to read a bit before bed,31,9
235,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,too short to develop characters plot backstorythe stories are easy to read although and fairly enjoyable good choice for a quick 30minute read,26,10
236,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,4.0,positive,stories were decent and extremely short i would have preferred two longer stories to four extremely short stories did not notice any spelling issues just did not like the brevity,28,11
237,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,a short but satisfying collection of four romantic stories with holidays themes female protagonists in these stories are either meeting new flames or getting reacquainted with old ones in rather steamy way my favorite story was rekindling the fire middle-aged couple that lost the spark so to speak is stranded in the mountain cabin by heavy snow and while waiting for the rescue they rediscover their passion for each other prose is simple yet tasteful love making is described in a sinfully polite way four sensual stories just in time for the holidays recommended,95,12
238,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,who does not love a good romance i know i do these short stories were just the right length each of the four stories entertained me thoroughly and left me with a smile on my face i was waiting in the doctors office for about 10 minutes and found this book the other patients must have thought i was a little strange there staring and smiling at my phone but i guess in todays day and age that is pretty standard loved it and recommend,84,13
239,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,was pretty average reading but i was not expecting too much the description was fair and the price low so can not complain o,22,14
270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,1.0,negative,it is a piece of s and did not even work huge waste of money i do not recommend anyone buy this product,20,0
271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,it is pretty cool only few things i do not like do not sync to music lights up randomly and the light up port it a little to big,26,1
272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,4.0,positive,this case actually has a piece that allows it to light up such a fun case i like to use it at concerts,24,2
273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,lights do not move they flash this is a still picture that lights up add over sells the product extremely,20,3
274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,this case does not provide much in the way of protection as it is just a thin plastic cover it is mostly a cool case to look at i recieved a lot of comments on the case while using it but it is not very functional being that the light for the case has to plug into the charger port on the phone it has a small cord that can be plugged into the light piece to charge the phone but it seems to take a long time to charge the phone this way and the light made my phone die somewhat quickly i found myself unplugging the light bar to charge my phone and this resulted in me losing the light so this is a fun colorful case to use on occasion but it is not very good for long term use or protection,144,4
275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,1.0,negative,does not light up like it shows it does,9,5
276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,i received it in a timely manner but some of the lights do not work on it also the charger was so cheap that it broke within a few weeks should not have bought it,35,6
277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,not really what i expected it only lights up when u turn it on i thought it would light up when i would get a call or a text other than that it is kinda pretty when it is doing it is thing,40,7
278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,4.0,positive,bright light up it is good had plenty of people comment on it that is an awesome case must have but the flaw about it kinda take up the battery the only thing,31,8
279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,this is a fun concept that actually works my kids love it as well as me just becareful not to lose the base piece,24,9
280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,it goes off even when there is no call or text not worth it really consider another light up device,20,10
281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,i love the phone case looking for a lot ore products like this there good price and great as gifts,20,11

283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,i so love this case everyone who has seen this always asks me where i got it slow shipping needs to charge moreuses battery,24,13
284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,well I am impressed with the fact it comes with everything it says it does the description is thorough and accurate the only thing i am in concern about is what battery does it take or how to replace it but overall it is a decent product very popular with the family since they like light up things,57,14
450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,this case fits my new verizon iphone like a glove looks pretty too the case keeps my iphone safe and very easy to use all buttons on the phone great purchase and price,33,0
451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,i received my case mate case and it had obviously been used and was black not pink and gray there were numerous scratches on the back and signs of general wear i toyed with the notion of sending it back but it was not so that bad and i am far too busy to deal with the hassle that being said it is a fine case very sturdy good shock resistance and easy to get in and out of pockets i wish there was more front protection but the slim design outweighs that minor flaw over a good product,97,1
452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,i have had this case for a little over a week it is a wonderful case slides easily into my pocket easy to grip and more my one complaint is that the rubber on the sides of the case is beginning to show some wear it will not affect the usefulness but it does look a little worn the pinkis a little more bubblegum pink than in the picture but in my opinion it is a prettyand looks nice with the grey i would recommend this cover,84,2
453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,the case is very durable the silicon stops the phone from sliding and the hard case protects the phone really well,21,3
454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,i have had a couple of otterbox cases and this one by far is much better i love this case it protects my phone is not too bulky is not difficult to put on the phone and i like the look,39,4
455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,so i love the case it is comfortable and looks nice all the buttons and plug-in areas are easy to access however part of the case split after three months of gentle use i did not drop it pull on it and i never took it off after putting it on I am not happy about that I shall buy one more and hope i got a defective one the first time we will see,69,5
456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,4.0,positive,the case lives up to the description and is much cheaper online than in stores protective yet smooth enough to go in and out of my pocket easily,28,6
457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,when i received the case i was disappointed to see that it did not come with the advertised screen protection kit i contacted the seller and they advised that they never received the kits from case-mate they then offered a small partial refund i received thein good time from the seller unfortunately this is one of the sellers that requires you to pay shipping even when purchased through amazon the case itself is very nice and i am very pleased with it the case is not at all bulky the rubber sides have a nice feel and the pink is very pretty the case is made for the verizon iphone 4 and fits the verizon buttons perfectly after two days of use the back of the case does have a few scratches but that may be common among all the hard plastic cases with this case just know that you will have to order your own screen protector,160,7
458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,this is an excellent case it is not too bulky and fits the verizon iphone 4 well the only problem is that the screen protection kit was not included with mine purchased from daydeals via amazoncom as described in the product description i contacted the seller and they said that case-mate must not have included it in the package and offered to send me a generic one i received the generic one and it was crap cutouts for front camera and more did not match the iphone 4 update i recently purchased another one this time directly from amazoncom and the screen protection kit was included,104,8
459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,the side switch does not match up with the att iphone but i still like it and use it i bought it based off the colors,25,9
460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,3.0,neutral,the case itself is very nice but in the picture it appears to be light pink with a light grey grip on the side which is indeed false it is more of a hot barbie kind of pink and the grip looks more black still a nice case just watch the advertising,52,10
461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,1.0,negative,when i saw this case online the grey looks much lighter and the pink looks really cute and pale and i have the line green and grey case of this brand and loved it so i ordered it upon receiving it however the pink was more of a hot bright pink and the grey was practically black i was not all that satisfied and it did not even fit my phone properly at the silencing switch even although it was ment for the iphone i have,86,11
462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,love this case the grippers on the side are wonderful so i do not feel like I am going to drop my phone the only problem i have had is if i try to plug it into ait is not able to because it can not get in far enough because of the case but not a big deal in my case,60,12
463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,5.0,positive,it is a great case i had a white one before took good care of my phone when i got my new phone they gave me top price for the old one this case does it is job they rubber grips on the side are a bonus i just really like this case it will not be my last one,58,13
464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004JZFWVO,1.0,negative,side switch is out of reach for iphone 4s it is hard to get in to turn switch on or off as hole in case is not aligned with phone,30,14
1095,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,the cover comes off all the time while in pocket clearly it is not a good fit would not refer it at any price,23,0
1096,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,cell phone case falls off too much was not what i expected did help my phone when i dropped it although,20,1
1097,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,thought it was a hard case i misread no worries although he loves and thankfully we have not had anymore accidents so far,21,2
1098,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,case fits really loose i do not see how it would protect your phone you can literally squeeze the phone out of the case without much effort no stiffness sort of like it is made of a worn our rubberband i will be returning this case I am not sure how it was rated this high being such an inferior product,59,3
1099,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,4.0,positive,i like the case but it does not fit snug like i expected it would still love it tho and using it,21,4

1103,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,i am just giving it 3 stars because the quality is not that great and i do not think my phone will survive if i drop it,26,8
1104,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,our model of this case did not fit the droid dna well it came off several times in the end we bought a case from verizon apart from that the design is good,33,9
1105,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,this case easily falls off phone it is bad enough that just by picking up the phone you have to put the case back on to even use it also the buttons are hard to find in the dark,38,10
1106,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,seemed stretched out did not stay on to well kept falling off and would collect dirt behind the case hard to use in a pocket,24,11
1107,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,when buying a case for my phone i would like it to fit snug with no gaps i do like the ease of pressing the buttons although i do not use it,32,12
1108,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,good material quality however it does not fit i used a heat gun to shrink it so it can snug but still comes off,24,13
1109,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,the case does not fit the phone correctly it keeps falling off and getting snagged when i put it in my pocket it might be fine for those who do not put their phones in pants pockets,37,14
1125,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,3.0,neutral,too much about bill and did not really get into understanding her,11,0
1126,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,the only thing i enjoyed in the book was what was written about her childhood she is a smart woman but sure likes to tell the world no humility there would not recommend it,33,1
1127,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,4.0,positive,not finished reading yet but enjoy what i have read,10,2
1128,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,it took me back for a second look at bill clintons presidency then it gave me an insightful view of hillary she is an amazing woman she was definitely eclipsed by president obamas campaign in 2008 but i do not think we have heard the last of her the dems could do a lot worse in nominating someone else for the next presidential candidate,63,3
1129,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,nothing but battlespace prep for 2016 all propoganda ignores the facts crimes malignant personality and utter incompetance of this horrible person utterly out of touch with america in every way shape form,32,4
1130,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,not a review if you really want to get to know the real hillary read edward kleins book the truth about hillary i see some of the reviews seem to sympathize with her just as you will get people to side with stalin and hitler I am being to the popint here this woman is evil,53,5
1131,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,1.0,negative,this read like it was a propaganda pamphlet for hillary i am not political at all but the yeah me quality was so overwhelming that i became disgusted and simply never finished the horrible piece who wants to read a book about someone patting themselves on the back all the time,51,6
1132,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,i am a fan of hillary so i knew i would like this book it was very interesting and made me like her even more,25,7
1133,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,2.0,negative,a somewhat disjointed look at the life of hillary clinton quick read the writer obviously admires her and occasionally gets side tracked by talking about events during the clinton presidency,30,8
1134,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,i chose this title because of my sincere interest in this being hillarys time to become president of these united states of america marshall has given us a work with a personable and satisfying journal-like approach you are certain to enjoy this insightful look at our next president hillary rodham clinton,51,9

1138,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,2.0,negative,was not impressed glad that i did not purchase it at a big book store,13,13
1139,Kindle_Store,B00KFAT4QG,5.0,positive,as so many things clinton opinions veer to the extreme i like to make up my own mind so it was a pleasure to read this book that while it certainly discusses politics does so without indulging in politics this is a well-written portrait of a woman who has embodied and defined our times it sticks to the facts which from this reader and follower of all things political is high praise,73,14

1263,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,3.0,neutral,good riddles but old language i really enjoyed reading this and showing it off to may friends they got stumped also,21,3
1264,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,3.0,neutral,the riddles are definitely interesting but it will probably take me a while to get used to them I am all new to the whole kindle thing but I am definitely hopeful,29,4
1265,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,4.0,positive,this book really makes you think a lot when i am board i read this book for brain problems this book has made me think more when i am not reading it it really helps me with work,38,5
1266,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,4.0,positive,this book is very good for teenagers or adults but not for children this book is full of cute humorous and down right stupid riddles and that is not supposed to be offensive,31,6
1267,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,1.0,negative,um it is very hard to understand most of the jokes at ed hard to understand i do not really like it at all,24,7

1270,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,3.0,neutral,great mind game had a lot of fun with it telling them to the family good brain exercise it is pretty challenging,22,10
1271,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,4.0,positive,they were good riddles but there were not many of them and i had a hard time reaching the final answer,20,11
1272,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,1.0,negative,it was a terrible book i did not understand any of it it was stupid terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible,20,12
1273,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,2.0,negative,it is a nice book if you are into old english and old age riddles i honestly enjoyed it but it was not that great,22,13
1274,Kindle_Store,B005AMUTJ0,5.0,positive,i like the riddles and the questions 8i also liked the way the riddles are stated in the text thanks,20,14
1440,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,yes the final shot is similar to the hathcock shot but this a short story with good descriptive writing that shows both the frustrations and emotions of dealing with an enemy sniper and the patience needed to deal with a worthy enemy it is worth the price,46,0
1441,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,there should have been two beginnings and two middle parts of the story to go along with the two endings just think of the number of combinations of a mediocre short story there could have been,36,1
1442,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,an interesting story with an optional ending for the reader to prefer i prefer version 2except that it is the bad-guy who wins in the end but having the bad-guy win is a great twist and does a great job of making the story that much more memorable and emotional i feel it also makes the story more complete in that it answers a question about a character mentioned earlier and honestly the story spends more time proclaiming the expertise of ma and less so that of our guy so why should our guy end up the victor over one who seems the more expert sniper having ma win this encounter also alludes to the fact that the vc did defeat the united states in vietnam in the end,127,2
1443,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,5.0,positive,this short story was beautifully written it was a quick and engaging story i could not put it down once i started to read it choosing an ending was an interesting option the first one i chose i did not like i read the alternative which is the one i should have chosen in the first place based on the details and descriptions i could tell the author has first-hand knowledge about his subject i do not usually like war stories but would recommend this to any one as a human story,92,3
1444,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,i remember going off hill 55 south of danang looking for a sniper that was shooting marines back in 1966 and this story takes me right back to that dreadful time the sounds the smells the rot and the damn bugs,41,4
1445,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very easy short read 10 minutes or so it is almost like a chapter from the many exploits of carlos hathcock,21,5
1446,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very short story characters were not developed as well as they could have been the ending was weird as you get to choose between two different endings,27,6
1447,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,the shirt story was interesting but very familiar if the name of the sniper was changed to carlos you would have a true account of one of the many great shots made by an actual marine corps sniper sgt carlos hathcock known as white feather was a marine sniper in vietnam and had more confirmed kills than any sniper in country this definitely seems like a case of plagarism to me,71,7
1448,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this is a re-telling of carlos hathcocks story without any mention of sargent hathcock of the marines i think it is shameful to do this and it is not very well written anyway not worth the time to download and read it is only a few pages and of almost no value to anyone if you want to read about hathcocks exploits search for other books on amazon but avoid this one completely,71,8
1449,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this was a very poorly written short story which i thought was misrepresented as a book,16,9
1450,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,this book is different in the way it is written and presented but we will written the book was enjoyable however i wished it was more in depth,27,10
1451,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,kinda short but was interesting wish it was longer and we could learn more about the characters in the story,20,11
1452,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,good story some fact some fiction not what white feather would have done but makes for good reading for a short story,22,12
1453,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,5.0,positive,ghost sniper is a great story and i hope there is a sequel i also really enjoyed winter sniper but i can not say which book was the best they were good in different ways,34,13
1454,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,this is a story that is a retelling of other stories save your money and time do not waste it on this waste of ink,23,14

1504,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,5.0,positive,have read up to 7 in the series and like the books i enjoyed reading this one the most mainly because it had far less errors overlooked during proof reading hope they continue to be better so i can add jaden skye books to my list of favorite authors,49,4
1505,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,fun fast read i figured out the killer from the beginning but not the final twist the one less star comes from the poor editing of the e-book names were mixed up making it a bit difficult but all in all give this a read I am going to read book 1 next,53,5
1506,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed this little mystery lots of interesting characters twists and turns what i did not like about the book grammatical errors and misspelled words,24,6
1507,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,same excitement as i experienced when reading the entire series of books on the caribbean murder series i relax on the hotel and surroundings from jadens description the serenity painted of the beach scenes and cliffs and waves beating against the shore whisks me away to aruba and the fact that i can not help but wonder as i read who did the dastardly deed now i will move on to the last book in the series anxious for my next journey ticket in hand ready to board book 8,90,7
1508,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,i like this series each book makes you feel like you have experienced the island yourself without having to actually leave the comforts of your home,26,8

1510,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,2.0,negative,i could not find a single character to like in the entire book not even the detectives are all these books the same,22,10
1511,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,this was one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long while not only were there numerous typos and errors some of major importance such as using the wrong characters name but the language was elementary and stilted in addition the romantic subplot between the principle characters was so negative my most frequent thought was just dump this loser,62,11
1512,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,this book captured my attention immediately i was drawn to the characters there was also a love story intertwined into the mystery this book had all the ingredients for a very good novel,33,12
1513,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,3.0,neutral,good story line poor grammar enjoyed the story line but many missing words or incorrect words made for a hard to read experience would like to read more of this author and see if there has better editing in other books,40,13
1514,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,books set near bodies of water always tempt me to read them i am usually somewhat generous in my reviews but this time i can not do it this book was so disappointing on a number of levels that i stopped before even reading halfway through it there were many typos the dialogue was juvenile i did not care about the characters at all they were not real they were very shallow,69,14

2025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i purchased this as a friend has one and i read the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a good bluetooth device well it is not working the way it is intended this is the first bluetooth device i have tried to own i originally bought this from amazon and after charging it up completely i could only get less than 24 hours on it in standby i contacted cardo and they told me that it could be the coupling to the phone and asked which phone i have after another email to them they said it sounds like a defective headset and i can send it back which i did i received a replacement one very quickly and it has the same problem and people tell me it has too much static for them to talk comfortably to me with it i could live with the battery life as i only use it in the car while driving but can not live with the static so it is useless I am going to i will say that cardo was extremely customer oriented and amazons customer service was great as well but this device does not live up to what i was hoping for i would not recommend it,205,0
2026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i have my cardo scala paired with a sanyo katana ii cell phone people say they can hear me fine but on my end voices sound a bit hollow also when i hear my cell phone ring it takes about five rings before the scala picks up the signal those are my issues with it for the price i can live with it because i only use it for a few minutes a day during my short commute to work but if you are someone uses a bluetooth all day i would look at a different one,96,1
2027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,I have owned a scala 500 a 700 and now the 700lx in addition to a few models of motorola headsets the scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity and handle wind noise far better than any motorola I have used i only recently replaced my 500 battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it would not hold a charge with a 700 which i loved until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine the 700lx is nearly identical to the 700 with one added improvement the earpiece on the 700lx unlike the base 700 has a much stiffer wire for custom fit this way when you get it to fit it is more likely to fit after you mash it around in your pocket another great feature is turning off the blue blinky led so you can be a bit more disreet when calling it has a bunch of other features too many to list but most are useful I am surprised this brand is not more commonly availabe in stores it works outside in the wind it has great sound and is tiny what more can you ask for,189,2
2028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this is the second scala 700 set that I have owned the first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use i did not drop it i tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working overall the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly it will crack however we all want a lightweight headset so maybe i should not complain the scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the on your cell phone however you have to press the button on the scala after picking up incoming calls this results in a 2 - 3 second delay an eternity if you have got another person on the line saying hello hello it is got it is drawbacks but it is the only headset that works consistently with my treo 650,142,3
2029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,after evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range i choose this one based on features and reviews unfortunately the first one recieved was defective and would not hold a charge amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well it has an automatic answer feature so you do not have to take your hands off the wheel to anawer incoming calls you can turn this feature on or off overall it appears to be a very good unit,80,4
2030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device it is almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket even comes with a carrying case battery life is very good and speaker volume was actually too high at times but easily adjusted when speaking with other people they were able to hear me very clearly occasionally the noise canceling would cut off my voice if i was too quiet when driving in a car this happened rather frequently in short this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments the jawbone may be better at managing noise but it is far more expensive get this if you are looking for a deal,124,5
2031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,i got the cardo scala 700lx to replace my cardo scala500 which i really liked but unfortunately lost i also had a motorola which had terrible range and no volume so i decided to go for another cardo headset i looked at the original scala 500 and 700lx and decided to get the upscaled model it is smaller than the 500 works just as well has a few more features like bluetooth 20 includes ac and car charger works perfectly with the iphone,83,6
2032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,the 700 was better than the 500 but less comfortable however the sound quality was so good my wife also bought one the biggest problem we had at first was bending the ear piece to be at least moderately comfortable my wifes headset fell apart literally one day she still uses it but holds it together with rubber bands a couple months later mine also fell apart unfortunately mine hit the ground after breaking in two and stopped working neither of us dropped our headsets they just came apart at the seam if it did not have such good sound and work well for voice dialing the discomfort and flimsiness would have me lowering it another star or two,118,7
2033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,2.0,negative,this headset was a bit of a disappointment as it has a lot of background noise sounds a little fuzzy and does not stay snug to the ear,27,8
2034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,i have never used an ear piece before but i am impressed with this one so far,17,9
2035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i ordered this as i have had the cardo 500 and found it to be good value my 700 lx arrived and would not take a charge returned it and got another same problem cardo says send it back to them and pay my own postage and they will send me a working one I am thinking maybe i will just get something else fed up with wasting money on postage and time going to post office,76,10
2036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i bought this headset mainly because it was ranked as having really good loud incoming volume it does i can hear people in the car now it is great from that point the only slight problem i have is the microphone volume people i speak to often hear echoes and i can not adjust anything to get rid of them still it was a worthwhile purchase,65,11
2037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,this is a great headset it works well comfortable easy to use and the price is right i would recomend this to anyone looking to buy a headset,28,12
2038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,it did not work for me it would only link to my phone when it was plugged up,17,13
2039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,original unit was defective asked for replacement which works perfectly returning original unit for credit,15,14
2220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,cheap has a very negative connotation here I am trying to use it in a fair manner this adapter set is cheap in every sense of the word it costs next to nothing it is also made from some low grade plastics and the cable is pretty thin and very short however it works and i have had much success charging my phone in my car the down side is that the car adapter gets very hot over prolonged use i primarily use it on a vector y adapter which has pretty long extension cables i have to ensure that the car charger does not come into contact with anything flammable while in use i do not honestly think it gets hot enough to combust materials but it makes me a little uneasy if there has loose paper nearby i can not comment on the wall plug because i have not used it this is a 2 star product but it gets an extra star for a ridiculously low price point beware the overly hot adapter but enjoy the savings,174,0
2221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,1.0,negative,bought this charger for my best friend as a gift for his birthday and he told me that once he connected his palm pre to the charger the phone would go craze and the screen would turn on and off by itself do not buy go get a palm charger and save your phone from messing up,56,1
2222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,people say you get what you pay for and with this combos low price against what you would normally pay i was a little worried I am happy to say my worries were unfounded the items came quickly and they charge the phone just fine i found myself wishing the kit came with 2 cables so i had 2 individual chargers instead of running the cable from one to the other when i want to use it but the cable is just a standard micro usb cable which can be found for a couple of dollars online if you look around it is worth the purchase just to have a car charger but get yourself an extra micro usb and you suddenly have 2 new completely independent chargers i highly recommend this combo for any pre owners,135,2
2223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,i recently purchased a usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone i received my purchase in a timely manner my only problem with this purchase is that in order to get it to work you have to wiggle the cord for it to start charging my phone but it will work,61,3
2224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this was an affordable package and works great as a back up to the charging accessories provided with the palm pre,21,4
2225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone works good enough for the price and not being sprint brand,31,5
2226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i use this to charge my phone in the car on my commute back and forth to work because i listen to music from the pre during the drive mp3s or pandora the car charger works but it takes a moment for the phone to realize it is plugged in i thought it was an issue with the usb cord but i have plugged it into the computer and the wall charger and both because the phone to start charging immediately the flexibility of this combo is great i now have an extra wall charger a car charger and an extra cord to charge and sync from the computer i would recommend this for any palm pre owner,118,6
2227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,bought it for my son he has not complained or commented on it so it worked,16,7
2228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,2.0,negative,my phone would charge when i first used this charger but have since stop when i plug it into my 12v adapter the led is on and my phone chimes as if it is getting juice but the battery does not charge up i will be troubleshooting later,46,8
2229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,the car charger and cable portionthe order work great and are more than worth the coast i was dissapointed withthe wall charger thoug because even when the light is on it will not charge the pre,38,9
2230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,both of the chargers worked ok for me but the usb to micro-usb cable i got is only 14 long which makes it pretty much useless for connecting anything to the chargers the pictured cable is much longer also the picture of the ac charger shows a rating label of 1000 ma but the one i got is labeled 800 ma which is not a bit deal but do not trust the pictures,72,10
2231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,in all fairness i have only used the car charger part of this trio i already have a home charger and usb mini cord so they are tucked away as backthe car charger has worked beautifully and i have yet to encounter any problems with it it is not pretty but it works super cheap so i was a little hesitant to purchase glad i did although overall very happy with it,72,11
2232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i received the product and my wall adapter did not charge my phone and i emailed the company and they emailed me back the same day saying that they would ship me a new one and they and it works so over all i was pleased with the product and customer service,51,12
2233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this bundle was not only a deal for the price but works great thank you,15,13
2234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,2.0,negative,the cord i recieved was less than a foot long but the picture shows it as much longer this is a big problem as i am unable to use the phone as it is plugged in at home or in the car without using speaker in which i do not prefer i tried to email them 3 times providing the info requested with no response,65,14
2325,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,1.0,negative,it is like they took a book and divided it is chapters into mini books annoying and ridiculous do not bother with this one,21,0

2328,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,2.0,negative,good storyline but i can not stand the way that every time an amish word is said it is italicized maybe the first time so the reader knows it is not just a typo but not every time the story line did not really pick up although until the very end of the book until the last 2 pages i could not wait for this book to be over now I am curious as to what will happen in the next book but not curious enough to read it with the irritating italicized amish words throughout,90,3
2329,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,4.0,positive,i enjoyed reading this book i recommend this book to others that love to read amish fiction a good read,20,4
2330,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,5.0,positive,i do not usually like shorter books and would rather read one long novella or novel but i found this one interesting and hard to put down i think it is one of her best and if the remainder of this series is as good as this one you will not want to miss them i enjoy reading about the simple life style although i am not amish I am a christian author who enjoys reading a variety of different types of books this one has great description and you can visualize the scenes as well as the feelings of the characters,98,5
2331,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,4.0,positive,this is the basis for a great book it has developed a strong line of characters and looks very promising,20,6
2332,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,1.0,negative,this book cut off just as it was getting into the plot very disappointed you can purchase the remainder however i would not waste my money on this sequels maybe they all end in the start of the plot,39,7
2333,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,5.0,positive,would like to find out what happens later on story kind of leaves you wanting more it is written very well,21,8

2336,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,2.0,negative,i do not care to pay 99 for one chapter of a book,12,11
2337,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,1.0,negative,was not well written it was confusing at times just not a good book the writer jumped around to much,20,12
2338,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,1.0,negative,this is the first of a series and sadly this short volume bounced all over the place heres a nice amish boy who leaves for a biker gang really i managed to finish the volume but only because it was short i will not be reading the rest of the series this was a free kindle book I have deleted it,58,13
2339,Kindle_Store,B00B3MSD2G,4.0,positive,very good story short leaves you wanting the answer at the end need to buy the other volumes to find the true end,23,14
2415,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,this book published on february 29 2012 that is before mr arpaio released the results of his investigation does nothing more than provide yet another piece of evidence that the investigation was a sham of course it makes sense that the book could be published before the investigation results were released to the public since the results are nothing more than a rehash of wnds unsubstantiated claims made back in april 2011 and soundly repudiated by august 2011 before arpaio even started his wild west show what a joke what a sham what a shame,98,0
2416,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,i only have the sample download and knowing the credentials of the author jerome corsi of this book i was dumbfounded to read i was approached on this issue because i dislike of the standard on page 2 of the introduction followed on the next page page 3 with i instructed them to go at this investigation with no preconceivedthat and i personally i quit if i am to pay 10 for a book i want to buy one without obvious errors in the first 3 pages not worth the money having seen the hour plus news conference and read the report released thereafter both freebies I am sure this effort may be worth reading however not on my dime,125,1
2417,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,it seems the birthers are still trying to convince the world of the presidents ineligibility after reading it i am more sure that the whole movement is in serious need of facts it seems that they do not understand the constitution or any of the rulings that touched on citizenship i recommend that this book never gets purchased again and all remaining copies get sent to the fiction section of the library,72,2
2418,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,you will all notice that the obots realize they have totally lost their position when you read their reviews of this blockbuster e-book their reviews are all about personally insulting the readers and the authors of this book the obots have nothing to offer but gutter name-calling insults and the typical saul alinsky tactics of ridicule and slander to lay upon decent patriotic americans who only want the truth revealed about barack obama this book by dr corsi and posse member michael zullo reveals thebyprocess of honestly investigating and forensically evaluating the various documents that mr obama swears are true and accurate documents the authors of this book reveal that these documents are forgeries and frauds this book is not about race religion or national origin it is about finding the truth and facts honestly there is no name-calling or racial attacks in this book,148,3
2419,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,no one but the extremely uninformed could possibly spend money for this trash this subject has been resolved and it is not what these two goofballs speculate,26,4
2420,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,no really are you people really real nobody could be this deluded and silly right nobody could hate a president this much right so the answer is you are not really americans you should move really,36,5

2422,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,very well researched and well written this should be required reading for all united states constitution loving americans the next thing to be investigated will be his fraudulent selective service card which is also a forgery more will be revealed to those who take the time to do just a little investigation and have an open mind to the truth,59,7
2423,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,this should not even be called a book that is an insult to real books this so called book is not even worth 10 cents let alone 10 dollars it is a scam plain and simple i gave it 1 star because 0 is not a selectable option,48,8
2424,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,sheriff joe arpaio was asked to investigate a possible problem with the long form birth certificate of president obama he assembled a team to investigate he used no tax payer money and this is a report of what they found he has no political agenda and only facts have been presented no accusations no threats of arrest no theatrics there will be those that want to sensationalize this because they do not like the information it contains,77,9
2425,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,this book is a scam to sucker in clueless regressives and racists no it is not five stars it is zero star do not waste your money,25,10
2426,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,unbelievable to me to see how many fools still support and defend this imposter in charge of the strongest country in the world it is because of fools like this that we quite possibly will be destroyed as a free nation there are so many questions about the presidents eligibility not just the falsified documents in question if people can not see the corruption of this administration we are in deeper trouble than i suspected god be with us all,78,11
2427,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,and this time he brings joe arpaio to help spread the same old birther lies and delusions is joe really this much of a sick sad senile old man and it is an e book only release not good as this prevents the reader from using the book as toilet paper which is all gnome corsis work is good for,59,12
2428,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,thank you jerome corsi for your tireless energy for publishing the truth it is my hope that others will come to learn about the person who fraudulently holds the position of president of the united states,36,13

2460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,this is the only bluetoothe handsfree that works great with my new iphone 3 g people tell me that it sounds as if i have the phone up to my mouth and it does not drop calls i can not believe i was able to buy it for such a low price awesome,51,0
2461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,1.0,negative,i bought this for use with skype I am using windows 7 64bit on a laptop with a blue tooth adapter the headset would pair fine but that is it i could not change setting and no other program on my computer would recognize it for use plantronics forum offered no help blaming the problem on microsoft many other users there had similar issues with their devices from plantronics i will try another brand,72,1
2462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,very good clarity so much so that you have to turn the volume down with other ear pieces at maximum still could not hear convenient car charger stays in the ear perfectly 3 sizes to choose from to fit everyone,44,2
2463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,4.0,positive,this headset delivers everything as advertised by plantronics i purchased this model because it is compatible with the iphone i really love that it is so lightweight definitely the lightest of all headsets I have seen the one feature that i find most outstanding is that the headset stores in a clip-on tube that you can keep in your shirt pocket for easy access also this storage tube helps to protect the headset when it is in your pocketmy only critique is that the ear bud gets dirty very quickly and needs to be washed often it is made out of a plastic material that is very soft to help hold the headset in your ear but that type of material picks up dirt and dust i liked this headset so much that i also bought one from a friends birthday he has a motorola razr and this headset also works great with that cellphone,157,3
2464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,very good sound quality but people can not seem to hear too well when the car window is down does not drop it is signal as much as the older model actually I have had this for 2 months now and i can only remember losing signal only 2 times all in all it is a very good value and worth it is price,58,4
2465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,3.0,neutral,my complaint is mostly with the charger the bluetooth itself fit comfortably in my ear with some adjusting no problem with sound quality on either end the only issue i have is the unique charger it is a nice carrier to put in your pocket to protect your bluetooth but if you lose it or it breaks you are hosed you can not charge without it the other chargers listed with the product are attachments to the housing unit i preferred my older plantronics explorer 220 because i was able to switch between my phone and the headset for my car one less cord it says there is an accessory for the mini usb charger but I have yet to find it here or the plantronic website hope this helps if you do not want another cord to worry about check the products website to see what connection it uses,146,5
2466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,1.0,negative,i have had this plantronics discovery 665 bluetooth headset for two days and everyone i call tells me i sound very muffled i can hear them fine but they can not understand me they can hear me but can not understand what i am saying most of the time i am returning this,52,6
2467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,1.0,negative,got it for my girlfriend about 6 month ago since then only problems mostly mechanical the ear piece falls easily and she ended up loosing all 3 ear pieces and then the part that goes around the ear cheap plastic no wire inside broke as well do not even think about it,51,7

2469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,4.0,positive,great form factor comfortable excellent sound quality and noise cancellation 35 to 4 hours talk time might not be enough portable charging station is cool car charger included also cool highly recommend this,37,9
2470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,4.0,positive,I have tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I have had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise the plantronics 665 is great in fact i actually had to turn down the volume a bit i also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old motorolla had a slight delay i would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line overall a very clean design other than the road noise people on the other end did not know i was using a wireless headset nice small design fit my ear well the dc charging stationfor the car is great charges as well from your pc usb I am using this with my palm treo 755p,139,10
2471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,2.0,negative,the product arrived within days of the order and it was sleek in it is appearance yet that is where the excitement ended call volume was low and the amount of static was unbearable i really expected more from plantronics too say the least this product was returned due to poor sound quality,51,11
2472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,5.0,positive,this headset is the best I have ever had people actually hear me and i hear them better when I am using the headset than when I am on the handset what more can i say it is great even the people that use to complain and tell me to stop using my bt have stopped nagging me very pleased with this one finally a good bt headset,64,12
2473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000M92GLK,2.0,negative,this headset is fine as long as you do not use it inside the car if you do the hum road noise wind noise and more is almost unacceptable on the listeners side,31,13

2496,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,2.0,negative,the story was intriguing to call it a book is ridiculous this is a sexy hot short short short story i was disappointed the story line could have expanded into awonderful tale of an empowered intelligent woman,36,6
2497,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,1.0,negative,should be very explicitly billed as a short story my mistake for not checking the number of pages really disappointing,20,7
2498,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,2.0,negative,not beleivable too short it just did not do it for me not one of sylvias best works the sex scenes although were hot,24,8
2499,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,4.0,positive,very passionate and detailed just when I am completely enthralled it ends i loved it but I am left hanging let me wipe the drool from my chin and find another one to read,32,9

2503,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,4.0,positive,i feel cheated because this tasty little sample jumped right into a hot sex scene then left me hanging after the climax well clearly i must purchase the book to see what the young lady chooses so far so good the title gives nothing away,45,13
2504,Kindle_Store,B00EDYL3FU,1.0,negative,was a complete waste of time and money fortunately it did not even waste an hour of my time,18,14
2565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,2.0,negative,I have had my droid for 8 months the first cover was hard plastic and cracked when i dropped it the phone store sold me this case in april 2010 telling me it was the best protector for my phone on that i would agree I have dropped it several times and the screen has not even changed however my case is now hanging off my phone in pieces long thin strips come off regularly there has not much left of the top or bottom it started peeling about two months ago so I had say this cover lasted intact for about four months I am currently shopping for a new case and will not purchase another body glove,114,0
2566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,when i recieved this product it was not new it was used top part of body glove did not fit properly it was missing the attachment for the belt loop package was opened not sealed,35,1
2567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,my husband got this for his phone and loves it it is hard to get off and on but he loves to be able to clip it on his pants,29,2
2568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,this is the only case that makes sense for this device i only rated it a 4 because the front casing can become detached or crack with some wear this is because the on / off switch is close to the top of it i do not think they could have done much more protects the phone I have dropped mine on concrete more than once and the case saved me,67,3
2569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,2.0,negative,this was a nice cover while it lasted the clips that hold the covers on the droid eventually become worn the face cover was the first to go started falling off after about two months three months after purchase the large back cover started falling off as the holding clips simply break off or become worn i will not buy another one as it is too costly and has to be taken off if you plan to use the,77,4
2570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,i thought the case was great the only thing was the thin top piece came loose and fell off while the case was attached to my belt i was unable to find this piece but i am still using the bottom piece with the clip thank you rich gibian,49,5
2571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,i purchased this case with my phone in the july yesterday i went to slide my phone open and the bottom of the cover fell off the clasps broke on one side i also noticed when i tried to get it back on that it made the plastic on my droid pop up out of place it seems very I shall fitted to this phone i do not recommend it,69,6
2572,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,very pleased with this case i love the clip and the rubberized case i can sit it on my dash in the car to view the gps without it sliding around great buy for anyone looking for a droid case,40,7
2573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,i have owned the droid and this case for about 5 months now it has saved my phone several times i use the belt clip which works well make sure the tab is seated properly in the case before putting it over the droid my children are constantly climbing on my back and kicking it knocking it off and more but through several months of this the phone itself does not have a scratch on it i also use the clear screen protectors a must the case is a different story it looks like it is been through a war in fact it finally broke the other day the little tabs that go over the front part of the phone finally snapped off and that is why i am here ordering a new one actually i think I shall get two the drawbacks are that getting the case off and on is a chore and as others have noted the battery occasionally needs to be removed for a cold reboot the other drawback is the design of the little tabs could have been a bit better although i admit i am very hard on it overall a good product and one i would recommend,201,8
2574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,do not order thisit does not fit the droid properly as in the front piece comes off regularly and there is no way to securely attach it it was not worth the s and h to return it,39,9
2575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,i have had several body glove brand phone cases in the past all of my lg phone brand cases were great the droid case is cheaply made at the same body glove price i have had 2 of the droid cases and both have broken at the tabs that hold the front cover on my friend has had the same issue the case is very difficult to remove from the back but that is not really a big deal i was really hoping for more from this product that is why i paid the premium price it is on sale now but i would go to the many droid forums and look into the experiences of other to find a case that will work,123,10
2576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,1.0,negative,do not buy this case leather cover is coming off of the plastic started falling apart after 2 months i expected more,21,11
2577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,4.0,positive,easy to install and does a great job of protecting the droid body i bought a separate screen protector because one is not included with this product i recommend to keep your droid looking new,35,12
2578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,this is my 3rd bodyglove for 3 different phones it is hard with a little give making it very good protection for the phone but also light i love this case,31,13
2579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002WC7RKA,5.0,positive,the case came in a timely manner it fit snugly into my new droid it does a great job of protecting my phone also able to use it to stand up on desktop only thing there is no cover for the screen however i do not feel it is necessary highly recommended as it gets the job done,57,14
2835,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i recently got my samsung galaxy s3 a couple of months ago i love the phone however i wanted an option to use a keyboard instead of the touchscreen so i immediately jumped at this sliding keyboard when i seen it the keyboard looks pretty much like the photo but the manufacturers accidentally printed an additional p on the key that serves as the delete button it took me a few minutes to figure that out overall the keyboard is ok if it would have been more than the cost that is listed i probably would have sent it back the option i like the most about the keyboard is the tilting screen other reviews mention how loud the keys are when typing but in all honesty it is not that bad sounds about the same as if you were typing on a laptop one other note phone cases will not fit on this keyboard it is a little wider than the phone itself i will probably keep this sliding keyboard,165,0
2836,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,the good comes in nice packaging and even included a usb cable to charge it the phone fits into a rubberized case that case easily slides and attaches onto the keyboard detaching the phone from the keyboard is fairly simple so if you need to put the phone into a caror deskthat should be as simple as sliding the phone off the keyboard the phone case is flat on the back it might not fit in some docks it still fits in my i-bolt carok pairing was simple just follow the included instructions there are some holes in the keyboard to allow the sound from the rear speaker to get out the volume seems the same with or without the keyboard attached the bad the whole unit with phone is about 7/8 thick with a better design it could be much thinner if you slide the keyboard down it still blocks the camera just a tiny bit either tilt the keyboard 90 degrees or just detach the keyboard when taking pictures / videos,177,1
2837,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,love this case but the clasp where the case comes apart broke i glued it together i guess we will see if it works if it does then i will up my rating,32,2
2838,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,do not buy this product was broken before i even got a chance to try it so i can not speak to it is functionality if you happen to get a working one,31,3
2839,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,5.0,positive,bought the wife galaxy iii which does not have an external keyboard becuase she wanted to retain an ext keyboard function she loves this keyboard it attaches as advertised and works great for her i would recommend it,38,4
2840,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i love touchscreen but sometimes i miss buttons this product is perfect but it makes the phone so fat i love it but it is just so big it makes the s3 literally an inch thick overall it is a really good product but it just needs to loose some un-needed thickness,50,5
2841,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,not very useful do not even use it anymore the screen does not rotate to face the keyboard or at list i could not do it,23,6
2842,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,it is good i love it the best one i ever seen some of my others packages have got yet can not,21,7
2843,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,2.0,negative,number keys are not separate kind of kills the point of having a keyboard,14,8
2844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,the description states it is thin and light but is quite the opposite very heavy and made the phone twice as big could not get in or out of my pocket very well and i wear loose fitting mens jeans also when you type the buttons are very loud so everyone around you can hear that you are typing this is not a big deal if you are not trying to be quiet overall i would not purchase this product again and i returned the one i bought the only good thing was how easy amazons returns and refunds are love them,98,9
2845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,i did not want to believe the other reviews and decided to order it anyways i was very displeased with the quality of the keyboard not only did the shift key not work properly the backlight was very dim and it was difficult to see the letters on the keyboard the keys are made of a hard plastic which makes it difficult to push down and loud while typing unfortunately i used the keyboard for less than 3 hours and sent it back very displeased heed all the warning and resist the purchase of this,96,10
2846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,4.0,positive,i recived the case brand new shiped very fast love the case works very well takes a little while to get use to the keyboard but is a really great case you can turn the phone on amd off by the case it also has alot of other great features,50,11
2847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,3.0,neutral,i found the cover a little bulky but it did work i ended up buying a different one that was a lot lighter,23,12
2848,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,i got thre case in the mail put it on my phone to use for about 2 hour at night i went to charge it and the female charger was pushed to far down in case i can not charge it waste of money,43,13
2849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AEEEUMQ,1.0,negative,phone is heated too much and the quality is zero percent plastic itself underground to break into pieces because of overheating otherwise looks preeliko and not convenient for carrying,29,14
2940,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,not complete protection front plate cover will not stay on 3rd cover i purchased in last 4 months from 3 different people,21,0
2941,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,i never leave reviews but i can not figure out how to contact the seller and am extremely unhappy i have now purchased two of this the first one broke after about a month but i figured it was because i was rough with it and took the case on and off a lot i decided to buy another one this one broke within a week i was sure to use extra care with it which i should not have to it is a case i wish i could find a way to contact the seller and get a refund poor quality for the price paid,103,1
2942,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic case I have dropped my phone countless times and it is never broken also it keeps your phone safe from scratches and cosmetic damages i love this case plus it is pink I have never had a more protective case for a cheap price too at the at t store they wanted 6999 for this same case in black i paid 25 on amazoncom,64,2
2943,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i bought this case because i had heard nothing but great things about them however i had mine for a couple months and i dropped it 5 inches onto a workout gym floor which are padded the top portion flew off and the bottom portion cracked i then called otterbox and they replaced it i had the second one for maybe a week before the top portion broke in the same spot the last one did so therefor i say this product is not worth the 30 bucks it cost,90,3
2944,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,this case fits to the torch like a glove and does not hinder slider operation at all offers solid protection to the phone and looks great too am very glad i bought it and would recommend to anyone,38,4
2945,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,i bought this case for my new blackberry torch i bought this case because it came highly recommended from the reps at the store i had it for less than a week when the top portion cracked completely in two and it is not like i dropped my phone or something like that it cracked after just carrying it in my purse this case is a cheap piece of crap that is not worth the money,75,5
2946,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,1.0,negative,we have had this case less than 2 weeks yesterday my daughter dropped her phone and the faceplate part snapped i will not purchase it again nor recommend anyone else purchase it,32,6
2947,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i have read countless reviews knocking this case because supposedly the top cover breaks off easily as for myself i usually only use the touch screen not keyboard so this is not a problem for me as i hardly ever open the slide phone torch the few times i have although i can see how it is very fragile so i take precaution honestly for a case that is supposed to protect this should be an issue but i love thelook of it so i shrug it off overall the aesthetics are great but protection is subpar also the back is hard plastic which is not safe for gripping and can easily slip out of your hand,114,7
2948,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,the product came as expected everything is fine the service is fast and satisfying nothing that i can complain about but thethenot as bright as it shows in the picture quite a disappointment,37,8
2949,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i had to replace my previous cover because it was too smooth and i would drop my phone regularly this cover has a texture on the edges making it easier to hold on to when i am multi-tasking the cover makes the phone a bit bulkier but it seems necessary to have some protection on the phone i would rather a bulky cover than having to pay to replace my broken blackberry the hot pink girlyis pretty great too o,82,9
2950,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i purchased this case in hopes to protect my precious new phone from my general clumsiness and constant exposure to hairspray however my hopes were promptly dashed a few days later when i put this case into full use i was unable to remove the tab-sticker from the screen protecting film and it 1 left tons of air bubbles under the film 2 left a ton of glue / paper from the useless peel tab sticker the next day my phone endured it is first drop and the tiny piece of plastic holding the cases faceplate to the front of the phone was snapped and no longer would hold on the following day the film peeled right off the screen and i was left with half a case and the most vulnerable part of the phone exposed sad day i wish something silicone could accommodate this style phone,146,10
2951,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,2.0,negative,i have to treat this otter box with as much care as i treat my phone i purchased this otter box with the intentions of being a little bit more care free with my phone i knew that otter box carried that reputation because my mother has one for her iphone it is just not the same quality i giving it 2 stars because it is pink and looks good on my phone the back cover is sturdy and when the front piece of my case broke i got another sent to me with no hassle,94,11
2952,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,i purchased this product for my daughter and she has been very pleased with it i was very satisfied with how my order was processed and mailed out quickly i would very much reccommend the blackberry torch otterbox,38,12
2953,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,4.0,positive,i read several negative reviews about this case and how the front does not stay on i have had mine for over a month now with no problems what so ever i drop my phone a lot and am really glad i got this case the only reason i gave it a 4star instead of 5 is because there is no perfect product to protect a slider phone,68,13
2954,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043RTJEY,5.0,positive,i am a big fan of otterbox cases and i like that they have come out with a slimmer version in different colors this case was easy to install thanks to the how to video on otterboxcom and i love the screen protector the pink / white case looks great with my white blackberry torch thanks otterbox,55,14

3076,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,looks great and has a nice snug fit on the phone great buy and i will be looking to purchase more colors in the future,25,1
3077,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,this is a beautiful case but it did not fit my apple iphone at t i will have to give it away it was a good price but i was very disappointed i actually have a 3 with 4 capability which they should not have given me when i renewed last year stupid me did not know any better what to look for so i was taken for a ride i hate that casecrown exo case for apple iphone 4 and 4s at t sprint and verizon compatible silver / black,88,2
3078,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,this thing fits great really sturdy will buy again in differentmy wife loves it and she is really picky,21,3
3079,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,3.0,neutral,as is everyone else i was looking for that perfect case for my iphone 4s i wanted something to protect the glass from getting scratched front and back while being slim enough to still fit in my pocket and have some grip this does that however there are two things that keep me from really liking this case one is the back has a peak down the center which prevents it from laying flat on a table or desk this will allow the phone to move around if you try and use it while laying on it is back the second problem and the bigger of the two is the flash back when using the camera with the flash there is a lot of pick up that really washes out the picture forcing you to have to remove the case if you want to have good pics the case is ok and some may not mind these issues but i have already ordered another case in hopes of getting what i want out of one,174,4
3080,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,2.0,negative,the plastic around the volume buttons broke off do not drop it because then the clips inside the case will break and the case will not stay on not very protective for your phone if you take a picture with flash remove the case or your pictures will not turn out good,49,5
3081,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,i love this case this is my 3rd one and i always go with this one i am very hard on my cases i drop my phone often which is why i am on my 3rd one and the phone still looks brand new the corners of the case chip and scratch but take a hard beating it eventually will chip off a whole piece and does not click together to stay on but they have lasted me many months each i do not like the otter box because it is too bulky this is slim and very protective,101,6
3082,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,2.0,negative,I have had case crown covers on my 3gs for years and got great results then i got this one for my 4gs i broken the bar on the front bottom so i ordered one more needless to say that one broken right away also so i broke down and got the new otter box,54,7
3083,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,5.0,positive,i love this case I have had it on my phone for about 2 - 3 months and i always get compliments on how nice it looks it is very sturdy I have dropped it a few times i would definitely recommend this case,39,8
3084,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,3.0,neutral,this was a cheap case i purchased for someone else they seemed to like it a lot it is better than not having any protection,24,9
3085,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,i had this case since early november of 2011 since then my phone has gone through lot of traumas falling on an asphalt dropping on my desk dropping on living room wood flooring and more every time these traumas occurred this case did it is job and it did it well the case took the impact on every fall and my phone especially the screen was never damaged just a heads up this case is not perfect as other reviewers mentioned after awhile and few drops left-top corner does not snap in 100 paint fades here and therebut i consider those as normal wear and tear left-corner not snapping in 100 will not compromise the integrity / sturdiness of the case so after 8 months of use and abuse I am happy with this case and glad that i bought it [ watch out for those cheap generics ],142,10
3086,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,i returned this case it was very flimsy i was afraid to even use it in fear it would not protect my new phone,24,11
3087,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,good slim case for my iphone 4s does not add too much bulk and has good access to all ports and buttons the case also has a rubbery feel to it and slips in and out of the pocket easily multiple colors are available to suit your taste,48,12
3088,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,4.0,positive,there are millions of case options these days and this one does a great job of protecting the phone when dropped I have dropped it with this case at least 5 times and it never came apart or cracked it is also pretty thick which I am not a huge fan of i prefer cases that are slim and have a bit of a rubberized coating to prevent it from slipping out of my hand in the first place overall if you like the looks of it then it is a great buy,89,13
3089,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004CMIB8K,1.0,negative,i bought this case because it looks really cool but within days of using it the bottom piece broke off in my pocket and couple of days later the side broke while i was trying to remove it to take a picture because the flash reflects from the case and flushes out the photo do not waste your money on this case,61,14
