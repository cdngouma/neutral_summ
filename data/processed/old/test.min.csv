137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i love this case it is adorable but I have had it less than 12 hours and the tail has already come off if i could figure out how to fix it that would be great but otherwise everything has stayed glued on pretty well buttons are easy to push,49,2
138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,2.0,negative,fits my phone very well however i expected the design to be black and gray as pictured instead it is black and an orange radishif i would have known it was going to look like this i would not have bought it,41,3
139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,very cheaply made and does not fit my phone very well to short all the way around not giving the phone any protection fur coming off and it is brand new save your money and buy something somewhere else took way to long to ship from china and this is not a united states company,49,4

141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,i saw this case and thought it was so cute i got the case and was disappointed be a use the quality it aweful the main part of the case is not soft at all the tail is soft hut feels like a feather the ears were horrible because they were put on and bow in the middle and art completely bent over which i hate the case is only worth what you pay really,75,6

145,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,5.0,positive,it came much sooner than the estimated arrival date it was packaged well it provides very little protection for the phone itself but i did not particularly expect it to it is absolutely adorable i love it is precious little ears and fluffy little tail so darn cute,45,10

147,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,4.0,positive,i heard so many mixed reviews about this case a lot of people saying parts were coming off and so on but i still gave it a shot because of the super low price i have to say that it completely met my expectations i adore it it looks just like the picture it is made out of really fuzzy material and the cat tale is simply adorable the only small complain i have is that the case makes it is a little hard to press the side volume buttons and the power one nothing you do not get used to but other than that it is a great case,106,12
148,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,3.0,neutral,thistook a long time to arrive which was expected the case was really cute but after only a few weeks of use the ear fell off it looked like it had been held on with glue so i tried myself to repair it but it did not hold i really wanted it to last because it was so cute,60,13
149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00DZG2XK6,1.0,negative,i waited forever for my case and did not receive it then they wanted me to wait the same amount of time to get a new one but i did get a refund very fast although which was a good,40,14

228,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,1.0,negative,i should have guessed by the title that it was pure filth if you are into erotica this ones for you i read the first installment and prompty deleted from my kindle,31,3
229,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,i do not know what else to expect from short stories they are more like a summary of a longer book but it helped me pass some time,27,4
230,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,i loved these short stories it was a treat to get to read a bit of different stories and not be involved in one long one with the same characters a nice change and the writers did a great job dee madore,41,5
231,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,if you are looking for a quick romantic read with a few tantalizing tales this is a good book to pick up what a better way to spend the holidays than to sit by a cozy fire and read something hot and spicy you will enjoy these four short stories each one with a different femalei enjoyed the third story the most simons letter because it was fun trying to guess who was elizabeths secret admirer,78,6
232,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,2.0,negative,i downloaded this for free otherwise i would not have picked it the stories were short and very formulaic the emotion and intention were good however,26,7
233,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,1.0,negative,you know how you will sit through a bad movie thinking the ending wil make it better i was hopeful on this too and realized it was never going to get better these stories are like the teeny stories my friends and i would entertain ourselves with in 7th grade only not rated for young audiences sorry abbie,57,8
234,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,4.0,positive,not much to these in the way of substance or length but they helped me to fall asleep a couple of nights as i like to read a bit before bed,31,9
235,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,too short to develop characters plot backstorythe stories are easy to read although and fairly enjoyable good choice for a quick 30minute read,26,10
236,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,4.0,positive,stories were decent and extremely short i would have preferred two longer stories to four extremely short stories did not notice any spelling issues just did not like the brevity,28,11
237,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,a short but satisfying collection of four romantic stories with holidays themes female protagonists in these stories are either meeting new flames or getting reacquainted with old ones in rather steamy way my favorite story was rekindling the fire middle-aged couple that lost the spark so to speak is stranded in the mountain cabin by heavy snow and while waiting for the rescue they rediscover their passion for each other prose is simple yet tasteful love making is described in a sinfully polite way four sensual stories just in time for the holidays recommended,95,12
238,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,5.0,positive,who does not love a good romance i know i do these short stories were just the right length each of the four stories entertained me thoroughly and left me with a smile on my face i was waiting in the doctors office for about 10 minutes and found this book the other patients must have thought i was a little strange there staring and smiling at my phone but i guess in todays day and age that is pretty standard loved it and recommend,84,13
239,Kindle_Store,B00A6SNTW2,3.0,neutral,was pretty average reading but i was not expecting too much the description was fair and the price low so can not complain o,22,14
270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,1.0,negative,it is a piece of s and did not even work huge waste of money i do not recommend anyone buy this product,20,0
271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,it is pretty cool only few things i do not like do not sync to music lights up randomly and the light up port it a little to big,26,1
272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,4.0,positive,this case actually has a piece that allows it to light up such a fun case i like to use it at concerts,24,2
273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,lights do not move they flash this is a still picture that lights up add over sells the product extremely,20,3
274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,this case does not provide much in the way of protection as it is just a thin plastic cover it is mostly a cool case to look at i recieved a lot of comments on the case while using it but it is not very functional being that the light for the case has to plug into the charger port on the phone it has a small cord that can be plugged into the light piece to charge the phone but it seems to take a long time to charge the phone this way and the light made my phone die somewhat quickly i found myself unplugging the light bar to charge my phone and this resulted in me losing the light so this is a fun colorful case to use on occasion but it is not very good for long term use or protection,144,4
275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,1.0,negative,does not light up like it shows it does,9,5
276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,i received it in a timely manner but some of the lights do not work on it also the charger was so cheap that it broke within a few weeks should not have bought it,35,6
277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,3.0,neutral,not really what i expected it only lights up when u turn it on i thought it would light up when i would get a call or a text other than that it is kinda pretty when it is doing it is thing,40,7
278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,4.0,positive,bright light up it is good had plenty of people comment on it that is an awesome case must have but the flaw about it kinda take up the battery the only thing,31,8
279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,this is a fun concept that actually works my kids love it as well as me just becareful not to lose the base piece,24,9
280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,2.0,negative,it goes off even when there is no call or text not worth it really consider another light up device,20,10
281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,i love the phone case looking for a lot ore products like this there good price and great as gifts,20,11

283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,i so love this case everyone who has seen this always asks me where i got it slow shipping needs to charge moreuses battery,24,13
284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B009Y39ORY,5.0,positive,well I am impressed with the fact it comes with everything it says it does the description is thorough and accurate the only thing i am in concern about is what battery does it take or how to replace it but overall it is a decent product very popular with the family since they like light up things,57,14
1095,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,the cover comes off all the time while in pocket clearly it is not a good fit would not refer it at any price,23,0
1096,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,cell phone case falls off too much was not what i expected did help my phone when i dropped it although,20,1
1097,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,thought it was a hard case i misread no worries although he loves and thankfully we have not had anymore accidents so far,21,2
1098,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,case fits really loose i do not see how it would protect your phone you can literally squeeze the phone out of the case without much effort no stiffness sort of like it is made of a worn our rubberband i will be returning this case I am not sure how it was rated this high being such an inferior product,59,3
1099,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,4.0,positive,i like the case but it does not fit snug like i expected it would still love it tho and using it,21,4
1100,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,5.0,positive,using this as a backup for the otter box and it is very nice smooth and fits as hoped i would buy again,23,5
1101,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,5.0,positive,i would highly recommend this to anyone great purchase choice thiswill aid in the protection of your mobile device,21,6
1102,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,4.0,positive,it was good and easy to use came off a little more then i wanted bit did the trick,20,7
1103,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,i am just giving it 3 stars because the quality is not that great and i do not think my phone will survive if i drop it,26,8
1104,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,our model of this case did not fit the droid dna well it came off several times in the end we bought a case from verizon apart from that the design is good,33,9
1105,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,this case easily falls off phone it is bad enough that just by picking up the phone you have to put the case back on to even use it also the buttons are hard to find in the dark,38,10
1106,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,seemed stretched out did not stay on to well kept falling off and would collect dirt behind the case hard to use in a pocket,24,11
1107,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,3.0,neutral,when buying a case for my phone i would like it to fit snug with no gaps i do like the ease of pressing the buttons although i do not use it,32,12
1108,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,1.0,negative,good material quality however it does not fit i used a heat gun to shrink it so it can snug but still comes off,24,13
1109,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00AMRSNTQ,2.0,negative,the case does not fit the phone correctly it keeps falling off and getting snagged when i put it in my pocket it might be fine for those who do not put their phones in pants pockets,37,14
1440,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,yes the final shot is similar to the hathcock shot but this a short story with good descriptive writing that shows both the frustrations and emotions of dealing with an enemy sniper and the patience needed to deal with a worthy enemy it is worth the price,46,0
1441,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,there should have been two beginnings and two middle parts of the story to go along with the two endings just think of the number of combinations of a mediocre short story there could have been,36,1
1442,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,an interesting story with an optional ending for the reader to prefer i prefer version 2except that it is the bad-guy who wins in the end but having the bad-guy win is a great twist and does a great job of making the story that much more memorable and emotional i feel it also makes the story more complete in that it answers a question about a character mentioned earlier and honestly the story spends more time proclaiming the expertise of ma and less so that of our guy so why should our guy end up the victor over one who seems the more expert sniper having ma win this encounter also alludes to the fact that the vc did defeat the united states in vietnam in the end,127,2
1443,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,5.0,positive,this short story was beautifully written it was a quick and engaging story i could not put it down once i started to read it choosing an ending was an interesting option the first one i chose i did not like i read the alternative which is the one i should have chosen in the first place based on the details and descriptions i could tell the author has first-hand knowledge about his subject i do not usually like war stories but would recommend this to any one as a human story,92,3
1444,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,i remember going off hill 55 south of danang looking for a sniper that was shooting marines back in 1966 and this story takes me right back to that dreadful time the sounds the smells the rot and the damn bugs,41,4
1445,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very easy short read 10 minutes or so it is almost like a chapter from the many exploits of carlos hathcock,21,5
1446,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,very short story characters were not developed as well as they could have been the ending was weird as you get to choose between two different endings,27,6
1447,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,the shirt story was interesting but very familiar if the name of the sniper was changed to carlos you would have a true account of one of the many great shots made by an actual marine corps sniper sgt carlos hathcock known as white feather was a marine sniper in vietnam and had more confirmed kills than any sniper in country this definitely seems like a case of plagarism to me,71,7
1448,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this is a re-telling of carlos hathcocks story without any mention of sargent hathcock of the marines i think it is shameful to do this and it is not very well written anyway not worth the time to download and read it is only a few pages and of almost no value to anyone if you want to read about hathcocks exploits search for other books on amazon but avoid this one completely,71,8
1449,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,1.0,negative,this was a very poorly written short story which i thought was misrepresented as a book,16,9
1450,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,this book is different in the way it is written and presented but we will written the book was enjoyable however i wished it was more in depth,27,10
1451,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,3.0,neutral,kinda short but was interesting wish it was longer and we could learn more about the characters in the story,20,11
1452,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,4.0,positive,good story some fact some fiction not what white feather would have done but makes for good reading for a short story,22,12
1453,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,5.0,positive,ghost sniper is a great story and i hope there is a sequel i also really enjoyed winter sniper but i can not say which book was the best they were good in different ways,34,13
1454,Kindle_Store,B00IDNLAOQ,2.0,negative,this is a story that is a retelling of other stories save your money and time do not waste it on this waste of ink,23,14
1500,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,5.0,positive,wonderful and exciting book love cindy and mattheus can not wait to read the new book,15,0
1501,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the typos in this kindle book the story was too convoluted to enjoy i kept waiting for it to get better but it did not,28,1
1502,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,story was okay but editing left something to be desired a littler hard to follow with grammatical and character errors,20,2
1503,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,5.0,positive,i am enjoying this series however they seem to b running the same story line fianc wedding murder more curious if cindy matheius work out,21,3
1504,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,5.0,positive,have read up to 7 in the series and like the books i enjoyed reading this one the most mainly because it had far less errors overlooked during proof reading hope they continue to be better so i can add jaden skye books to my list of favorite authors,49,4
1505,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,fun fast read i figured out the killer from the beginning but not the final twist the one less star comes from the poor editing of the e-book names were mixed up making it a bit difficult but all in all give this a read I am going to read book 1 next,53,5
1506,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed this little mystery lots of interesting characters twists and turns what i did not like about the book grammatical errors and misspelled words,24,6
1507,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,same excitement as i experienced when reading the entire series of books on the caribbean murder series i relax on the hotel and surroundings from jadens description the serenity painted of the beach scenes and cliffs and waves beating against the shore whisks me away to aruba and the fact that i can not help but wonder as i read who did the dastardly deed now i will move on to the last book in the series anxious for my next journey ticket in hand ready to board book 8,90,7
1508,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,i like this series each book makes you feel like you have experienced the island yourself without having to actually leave the comforts of your home,26,8
1509,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,i wish i had read the reviews before i downloaded this today i wasted precious sunday reading time with a book filled with errors,24,9
1510,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,2.0,negative,i could not find a single character to like in the entire book not even the detectives are all these books the same,22,10
1511,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,this was one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long while not only were there numerous typos and errors some of major importance such as using the wrong characters name but the language was elementary and stilted in addition the romantic subplot between the principle characters was so negative my most frequent thought was just dump this loser,62,11
1512,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,4.0,positive,this book captured my attention immediately i was drawn to the characters there was also a love story intertwined into the mystery this book had all the ingredients for a very good novel,33,12
1513,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,3.0,neutral,good story line poor grammar enjoyed the story line but many missing words or incorrect words made for a hard to read experience would like to read more of this author and see if there has better editing in other books,40,13
1514,Kindle_Store,B00EHSUFD8,1.0,negative,books set near bodies of water always tempt me to read them i am usually somewhat generous in my reviews but this time i can not do it this book was so disappointing on a number of levels that i stopped before even reading halfway through it there were many typos the dialogue was juvenile i did not care about the characters at all they were not real they were very shallow,69,14
2025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i purchased this as a friend has one and i read the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a good bluetooth device well it is not working the way it is intended this is the first bluetooth device i have tried to own i originally bought this from amazon and after charging it up completely i could only get less than 24 hours on it in standby i contacted cardo and they told me that it could be the coupling to the phone and asked which phone i have after another email to them they said it sounds like a defective headset and i can send it back which i did i received a replacement one very quickly and it has the same problem and people tell me it has too much static for them to talk comfortably to me with it i could live with the battery life as i only use it in the car while driving but can not live with the static so it is useless I am going to i will say that cardo was extremely customer oriented and amazons customer service was great as well but this device does not live up to what i was hoping for i would not recommend it,205,0
2026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i have my cardo scala paired with a sanyo katana ii cell phone people say they can hear me fine but on my end voices sound a bit hollow also when i hear my cell phone ring it takes about five rings before the scala picks up the signal those are my issues with it for the price i can live with it because i only use it for a few minutes a day during my short commute to work but if you are someone uses a bluetooth all day i would look at a different one,96,1
2027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,I have owned a scala 500 a 700 and now the 700lx in addition to a few models of motorola headsets the scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity and handle wind noise far better than any motorola I have used i only recently replaced my 500 battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it would not hold a charge with a 700 which i loved until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine the 700lx is nearly identical to the 700 with one added improvement the earpiece on the 700lx unlike the base 700 has a much stiffer wire for custom fit this way when you get it to fit it is more likely to fit after you mash it around in your pocket another great feature is turning off the blue blinky led so you can be a bit more disreet when calling it has a bunch of other features too many to list but most are useful I am surprised this brand is not more commonly availabe in stores it works outside in the wind it has great sound and is tiny what more can you ask for,189,2
2028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this is the second scala 700 set that I have owned the first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use i did not drop it i tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working overall the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly it will crack however we all want a lightweight headset so maybe i should not complain the scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the on your cell phone however you have to press the button on the scala after picking up incoming calls this results in a 2 - 3 second delay an eternity if you have got another person on the line saying hello hello it is got it is drawbacks but it is the only headset that works consistently with my treo 650,142,3
2029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,after evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range i choose this one based on features and reviews unfortunately the first one recieved was defective and would not hold a charge amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well it has an automatic answer feature so you do not have to take your hands off the wheel to anawer incoming calls you can turn this feature on or off overall it appears to be a very good unit,80,4
2030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,this headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device it is almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket even comes with a carrying case battery life is very good and speaker volume was actually too high at times but easily adjusted when speaking with other people they were able to hear me very clearly occasionally the noise canceling would cut off my voice if i was too quiet when driving in a car this happened rather frequently in short this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments the jawbone may be better at managing noise but it is far more expensive get this if you are looking for a deal,124,5
2031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,i got the cardo scala 700lx to replace my cardo scala500 which i really liked but unfortunately lost i also had a motorola which had terrible range and no volume so i decided to go for another cardo headset i looked at the original scala 500 and 700lx and decided to get the upscaled model it is smaller than the 500 works just as well has a few more features like bluetooth 20 includes ac and car charger works perfectly with the iphone,83,6
2032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,the 700 was better than the 500 but less comfortable however the sound quality was so good my wife also bought one the biggest problem we had at first was bending the ear piece to be at least moderately comfortable my wifes headset fell apart literally one day she still uses it but holds it together with rubber bands a couple months later mine also fell apart unfortunately mine hit the ground after breaking in two and stopped working neither of us dropped our headsets they just came apart at the seam if it did not have such good sound and work well for voice dialing the discomfort and flimsiness would have me lowering it another star or two,118,7
2033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,2.0,negative,this headset was a bit of a disappointment as it has a lot of background noise sounds a little fuzzy and does not stay snug to the ear,27,8
2034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,i have never used an ear piece before but i am impressed with this one so far,17,9
2035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,i ordered this as i have had the cardo 500 and found it to be good value my 700 lx arrived and would not take a charge returned it and got another same problem cardo says send it back to them and pay my own postage and they will send me a working one I am thinking maybe i will just get something else fed up with wasting money on postage and time going to post office,76,10
2036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,3.0,neutral,i bought this headset mainly because it was ranked as having really good loud incoming volume it does i can hear people in the car now it is great from that point the only slight problem i have is the microphone volume people i speak to often hear echoes and i can not adjust anything to get rid of them still it was a worthwhile purchase,65,11
2037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,5.0,positive,this is a great headset it works well comfortable easy to use and the price is right i would recomend this to anyone looking to buy a headset,28,12
2038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,1.0,negative,it did not work for me it would only link to my phone when it was plugged up,17,13
2039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000Q5J2M6,4.0,positive,original unit was defective asked for replacement which works perfectly returning original unit for credit,15,14
2220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,cheap has a very negative connotation here I am trying to use it in a fair manner this adapter set is cheap in every sense of the word it costs next to nothing it is also made from some low grade plastics and the cable is pretty thin and very short however it works and i have had much success charging my phone in my car the down side is that the car adapter gets very hot over prolonged use i primarily use it on a vector y adapter which has pretty long extension cables i have to ensure that the car charger does not come into contact with anything flammable while in use i do not honestly think it gets hot enough to combust materials but it makes me a little uneasy if there has loose paper nearby i can not comment on the wall plug because i have not used it this is a 2 star product but it gets an extra star for a ridiculously low price point beware the overly hot adapter but enjoy the savings,174,0
2221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,1.0,negative,bought this charger for my best friend as a gift for his birthday and he told me that once he connected his palm pre to the charger the phone would go craze and the screen would turn on and off by itself do not buy go get a palm charger and save your phone from messing up,56,1
2222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,people say you get what you pay for and with this combos low price against what you would normally pay i was a little worried I am happy to say my worries were unfounded the items came quickly and they charge the phone just fine i found myself wishing the kit came with 2 cables so i had 2 individual chargers instead of running the cable from one to the other when i want to use it but the cable is just a standard micro usb cable which can be found for a couple of dollars online if you look around it is worth the purchase just to have a car charger but get yourself an extra micro usb and you suddenly have 2 new completely independent chargers i highly recommend this combo for any pre owners,135,2
2223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,i recently purchased a usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone i received my purchase in a timely manner my only problem with this purchase is that in order to get it to work you have to wiggle the cord for it to start charging my phone but it will work,61,3
2224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this was an affordable package and works great as a back up to the charging accessories provided with the palm pre,21,4
2225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,usb data cable usb car charger usb home travel charger for sprint palm pre smartphone works good enough for the price and not being sprint brand,31,5
2226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i use this to charge my phone in the car on my commute back and forth to work because i listen to music from the pre during the drive mp3s or pandora the car charger works but it takes a moment for the phone to realize it is plugged in i thought it was an issue with the usb cord but i have plugged it into the computer and the wall charger and both because the phone to start charging immediately the flexibility of this combo is great i now have an extra wall charger a car charger and an extra cord to charge and sync from the computer i would recommend this for any palm pre owner,118,6
2227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,bought it for my son he has not complained or commented on it so it worked,16,7
2228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,2.0,negative,my phone would charge when i first used this charger but have since stop when i plug it into my 12v adapter the led is on and my phone chimes as if it is getting juice but the battery does not charge up i will be troubleshooting later,46,8
2229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,the car charger and cable portionthe order work great and are more than worth the coast i was dissapointed withthe wall charger thoug because even when the light is on it will not charge the pre,38,9
2230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,3.0,neutral,both of the chargers worked ok for me but the usb to micro-usb cable i got is only 14 long which makes it pretty much useless for connecting anything to the chargers the pictured cable is much longer also the picture of the ac charger shows a rating label of 1000 ma but the one i got is labeled 800 ma which is not a bit deal but do not trust the pictures,72,10
2231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,in all fairness i have only used the car charger part of this trio i already have a home charger and usb mini cord so they are tucked away as backthe car charger has worked beautifully and i have yet to encounter any problems with it it is not pretty but it works super cheap so i was a little hesitant to purchase glad i did although overall very happy with it,72,11
2232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,4.0,positive,i received the product and my wall adapter did not charge my phone and i emailed the company and they emailed me back the same day saying that they would ship me a new one and they and it works so over all i was pleased with the product and customer service,51,12
2233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,5.0,positive,this bundle was not only a deal for the price but works great thank you,15,13
2234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002DRMPMY,2.0,negative,the cord i recieved was less than a foot long but the picture shows it as much longer this is a big problem as i am unable to use the phone as it is plugged in at home or in the car without using speaker in which i do not prefer i tried to email them 3 times providing the info requested with no response,65,14
2415,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,this book published on february 29 2012 that is before mr arpaio released the results of his investigation does nothing more than provide yet another piece of evidence that the investigation was a sham of course it makes sense that the book could be published before the investigation results were released to the public since the results are nothing more than a rehash of wnds unsubstantiated claims made back in april 2011 and soundly repudiated by august 2011 before arpaio even started his wild west show what a joke what a sham what a shame,98,0
2416,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,i only have the sample download and knowing the credentials of the author jerome corsi of this book i was dumbfounded to read i was approached on this issue because i dislike of the standard on page 2 of the introduction followed on the next page page 3 with i instructed them to go at this investigation with no preconceivedthat and i personally i quit if i am to pay 10 for a book i want to buy one without obvious errors in the first 3 pages not worth the money having seen the hour plus news conference and read the report released thereafter both freebies I am sure this effort may be worth reading however not on my dime,125,1
2417,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,it seems the birthers are still trying to convince the world of the presidents ineligibility after reading it i am more sure that the whole movement is in serious need of facts it seems that they do not understand the constitution or any of the rulings that touched on citizenship i recommend that this book never gets purchased again and all remaining copies get sent to the fiction section of the library,72,2
2418,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,you will all notice that the obots realize they have totally lost their position when you read their reviews of this blockbuster e-book their reviews are all about personally insulting the readers and the authors of this book the obots have nothing to offer but gutter name-calling insults and the typical saul alinsky tactics of ridicule and slander to lay upon decent patriotic americans who only want the truth revealed about barack obama this book by dr corsi and posse member michael zullo reveals thebyprocess of honestly investigating and forensically evaluating the various documents that mr obama swears are true and accurate documents the authors of this book reveal that these documents are forgeries and frauds this book is not about race religion or national origin it is about finding the truth and facts honestly there is no name-calling or racial attacks in this book,148,3
2419,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,no one but the extremely uninformed could possibly spend money for this trash this subject has been resolved and it is not what these two goofballs speculate,26,4

2423,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,this should not even be called a book that is an insult to real books this so called book is not even worth 10 cents let alone 10 dollars it is a scam plain and simple i gave it 1 star because 0 is not a selectable option,48,8
2424,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,sheriff joe arpaio was asked to investigate a possible problem with the long form birth certificate of president obama he assembled a team to investigate he used no tax payer money and this is a report of what they found he has no political agenda and only facts have been presented no accusations no threats of arrest no theatrics there will be those that want to sensationalize this because they do not like the information it contains,77,9

2426,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,unbelievable to me to see how many fools still support and defend this imposter in charge of the strongest country in the world it is because of fools like this that we quite possibly will be destroyed as a free nation there are so many questions about the presidents eligibility not just the falsified documents in question if people can not see the corruption of this administration we are in deeper trouble than i suspected god be with us all,78,11
2427,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,1.0,negative,and this time he brings joe arpaio to help spread the same old birther lies and delusions is joe really this much of a sick sad senile old man and it is an e book only release not good as this prevents the reader from using the book as toilet paper which is all gnome corsis work is good for,59,12
2428,Kindle_Store,B007FWO19W,5.0,positive,thank you jerome corsi for your tireless energy for publishing the truth it is my hope that others will come to learn about the person who fraudulently holds the position of president of the united states,36,13
