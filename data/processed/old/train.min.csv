597,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,sleep with this every single night not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs oh my god so fricking painful anyways since becoming pregnant i want to sleep on my side a lot and so i am worried about wrinkles too i guess but the pain dear lord it is so bad i tried using a pillow but this just slides in place and stays better i mean it does not even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom score,87,7

604,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i bought this bear on another website the other reviewers are right this would only work well for very large boobs i bought the isima breast pillow and that has straps that secure it in place sometimes i put a comfy bra on too over the pillow to secure it even more so and also i like sleeping in comfort bras i would recommend the isima breast pillow i have size c implants,73,14
605,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,this works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place my primary complaint is it does not rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts I shall wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still need a tight sports bra to hold it in place at least for me I am 58 tall slim build with breast augmentation might work better for natural breasts still use it although i do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place,116,15
606,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product works as advertised according to her she finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place,39,16

610,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,might work for some but was too thick for me natural 34ddd the bear design is adorable but i went with the bosom buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me,36,20
611,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,i have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all not worth the money,18,21
612,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,well damn i missed the return window by a few days i have dds and this thing is too big it has to be for someone with fffs or someone with nat geo tits,34,22
613,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it is pretty useless unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this does not stay put at all,32,23
614,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,love it after researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles i saw this and thought ah ha it is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 ddd breast from smushing together i notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place h m has great long stretchy tanks i use,77,24
615,All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,i had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed it is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place even with wearing a sports bra to sleep ultimately it does not do well what it is advertising to do,51,25

928,All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,the quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming / thinning / styling there is a lot of hair evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease it was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk the write up clearly states themay be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting the wig i see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights the wig i received is theof the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown if you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights you may be disappointed i like to play with different wig colors and styles and i am ok with theat this price you are getting a quality product and really can not go wrong unless you are not willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different,186,0

1131,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i was very happy with these buttons for crafting thank you for having these buttons available when i needed them,20,0
1132,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,i bought these buttons to add to a cardigan I am making they are a good size for womens or childrens clothes there was a sticker on the package that said 279 so I am not sure why they cost a dollar more than that if you have a good craft store around where you could get buttons for cheap you could probably find a comparable product i bought these online because the local craft store has pretty high prices and these were a better value,84,1
1133,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,great for little projects especially baby items there were two different sizes of white two different sizes of black and one size of clear i ordered these not know what size they would be because i did not see it anywhere on the description i would order them again,48,2
1134,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,more buttons for every need great value for cost,9,3
1135,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,too small i needed to sew some new buttons onto my winter jacket but these certainly were not the buttons for the job the sucked poor enterprise,27,4
1136,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,nice mix of black and white buttons sizes are pretty standard and just what i was looking for delivery was a little slow,23,5
1137,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this purchase i had ordered these in 7 different colors thinking i could do a lot of crafts with them after arriving 3 days after they were supposed to i was not happy to see how small the amount of buttons was and how many of those few came already cracked and broken what bothered me the most is that i paid over 6 for each package then saw that it has 229 printed on the label you are better off getting a better deal at the dollar store,93,6
1138,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,i have nothing bad to say i ordered 130 black and white buttons and got 130 black and white buttons,20,7
1139,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,5.0,positive,it is really hard to find basic buttons at a good price these days but as usual found it at amazoncom used a lot and still have plenty more in the pack than it looks like in the picture,38,8
1140,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,they will work very well for a the need i have for them without a doubt,16,9
1141,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,i received these today and instantly did a product refund they are smaller than what i need and to make sure i did not miss something i went back to the post to see if there was a size and there was not one listed it did say mini i guess i just missed it in the detailed description then the package it came in says 229 for the price if you are going to sell something to make profit from it maybe take the original price off since i paid 536 what a waste of my time waiting for these to arrive now i need to go to the store to find better buttons boo,113,10
1142,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,buttons are very very small not many matches disappointed,9,11
1143,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,1.0,negative,the buttons are mostly very thin and no traditioal hour hole buttons were included only two hole very disappointing,19,12
1278,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this thing is the size of a quarter you are better off buying the larger roll which is for some reason cheaper,22,0
1279,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it never peeled off not even the openon top some tapes the topdoes not stick but I have never had that problem with this tape it sticks and stays tight,32,1
1280,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,my granddaughter ordered this for hertape crafts and she absolutely loves this the colors are awesome and it is exactly what she wanted,24,2
1281,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love these rolls of minitape the width 3/4 is great for crafting and small fixes around the house or on-the-go perhaps use it like you might use washi tape and get creative it comes in basic black and silver plus some colors / patterns there is not quite the same selection of patterns as the originaltape line yet but perhaps after being on the market for a while they will expand the options available i recently made my dad an emergency car kit for christmas and i made sure to include one of these rolls as a mini version of a very useful tool,106,3
1282,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this is going to be more expensive than regulartape per square foot but if you do not want to split tape or want a thinner width for a project these are great the tape is good quality and sticks well with burnishing rubbing down firmly and the width makes it perfect for trims or small fixes the finish is the same as regular blacktape glossy water-resistant and thick enough to be strong plus i just love the size of these rolls they are incredibly cute the inner core is printed it does not have the logo like the full size rolls do but it is clearly a mini roll oftape it is also labeled as made in the united states,121,4
1283,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it works well and stays glowing for a long time but if you put it on some thing that your hands are going to be on such as a controller or a door nob then it wears down really fast,40,5
1284,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,I am not sure how this ended up being mislabeled as 15 yards when it is actually on 72 inches 2 yards i contacted amazon to let them know of the mistake and to return thebut seeing as how it still says 15 yards i figured I had put this out there for anyone else who might end up ordering this and getting a much smaller roll of tape than expected the tape itself does glow but i never took it out of the package since i returned it so i can not say much else about it otherbrand tape I have used has been great i imagine this would be the same i would have kept it if it did not cost so much for such a tiny roll,128,6
1285,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,make sure you understand the length / width of this product before purchasing it is a very small roll despite the picture looking like a normal sized roll the tape does function well however glows bright and adhesive holds well,38,7
1286,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this does actually glow pretty good i did not read the description very well although and was surprised how small it was,21,8
1287,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i wish i could give this product 50 stars compared to old school glo tape where you had to peel the backing this is a joy,26,9
1288,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this tape is very cool glows so bright it literally lights up my daughters room at night so no need for night lights anymore,25,10
1289,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,pick is extremely misleading this roll is smaller than a roll of scotch tape it did glow but there was not much of it,24,11
1290,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,worked very well and glows in the dark as promised,10,12
1291,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,tape was easy to cut off the roll but i used it on light switches in the hallway to be able to see them to click on to be able to see down the hallway you could see the piece if you stood right in front of it not any longer and just did not work,56,13
1292,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i obviously misread the size see picture so far i have not seen it glow at all I have had it on the floor with lights on for days and when the lights are out there is no green luminousfrom the tape very disappointed in this,46,14
1293,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,used on my flashlight in my basement that i have placed near my breaker box if the power goes out I shall be able to find it going to put some on the front of breaker box too it glows well in dark too,43,15
1294,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,this is extremely tiny i thought it was going to be a big roll oftape from the pic and name but admit i should have studied the measurements more closely it also does not glow very brightly,38,16
1295,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i love this tape it does the job of what i purchased it for it is just too small not only do i recommend it i suggest you buy 2,29,17
1296,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,roll is really small but it worked great for my project,11,18
1297,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this roll is tiny but it works great to cover several 10 disc golf discs,15,19
1298,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is my own lack of reading up on the product but when i purchased i did not realized it was going to be so tiny it is smaller than a normal roll of scotch tape i thought it was going to be as large as a regular roll oftape i feel that i could have read more into it but the way the pictures made the product look were a bit misleading because you can not tell how small it actually is,81,20
1299,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,be aware that this is smaller than a roll of electrical tape,12,21

1301,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,even with the comments about how small this is i was surprised when i received it,16,23
1302,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i read the reviews so i knew this is a small roll of tape no surprises it is the size of a fifty cent piece that was perfect for the project i needed it for and i did not have to pay for a large roll i did not need i found that it glows seven to eight hours you do not necessarily have to put it under light to get it to glow i found that the tv in a dark room also works i am very satisfied with this product,89,24
1303,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,why is that tape so small it should be 25 cents,11,25
1304,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,ok ha ha you got me my bad you have to put it in the sun or light,18,26
1305,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,if i was in the movie downsizing it would be perfect as the whole roll is not much bigger than a quarter haha thank goodness i have a great sense of humor because i was very amused and like miniature things but do not buy it if you think y ou are getting a standard roll they should tell you it is miniature,64,27

1310,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,should have looked at the size more closely if they could title this mini tape or something that would help a lot it is tiny it glows okay not great,30,32

1312,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,do not know how else to say this but it is tape that glows in the dark i have charged the tape with a black light and seen it hold a charge for a minimum of 4 hours works as expected,40,34
1313,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,absolutely useless it looks like a roll oftape but it is the size of a roll of electrical tape the dimensions are clearly readable in the picture so it is my own fault i guess but i had noduct tape came in such a small useless size,49,35
1314,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,adhesive did not stick at all ducks products usually sticks quite well but this was not even as sticky as masking tape lasted less than a day,25,36
1315,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,ordered assuming it is the same size as every other roll oftape since there is nothing in the picture that shows scale i give 2 stars,27,37

1317,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,reasonable value took a bit to be actively glowing at night,11,39
1318,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,worked out well for my needs i needed to mark a bathroom door knob so i could find it in the middle of the night without turning on lights i cut a very small 2 strip of this tape put it on door frame next to handle and it works great for me without any sun or room light after 7 pm it is still visible and glowing 8 hours later in the middle of the night as others have noted roll is small in length and width but it worked out great for me,96,40
1319,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this works for what i bought it for as a marker in my garage for backing my car in price is right,23,41
1320,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i was surprised that it was a super small roll,10,42
1321,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i bought this tape after buying the glow in the dark stars i liked how well they stick the brightness and how long they glow since i bought this to decorate my scetch books it is the perfect size for me yes this is the same size as washi tape but longer than some of those i have boughten and it also sticks better i would love to see them come out in other colors but very happy with this tape,81,43
1322,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,kinda tiny but it works used it along the side of stairs so we do not trip at night the roll is very small although,24,44
1323,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,pay careful attention to the dimensions this is a ridiculously small roll of tape that as other reviewers have noted is virtually useless,23,45
1324,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,thistape is microscopic it roughly 1 tenth the size of a real roll oftape see picture attached,21,46
1325,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,it is not small it tiny do not think this is a regular size roll oftape only shorter because it is not this is tiny a little large than a quarter in diameter and only 3/4 of an inch wide never saw a roll this small before,47,47
1326,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i will never buy it again it does not glow in the dark as advertised wasted my money,18,48
1327,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,poor quality and not worth the price in my opinion these rolls are truly mini sized the roll i received seems to have been stored in an extremely hot environment because the tape adhesive is so melted that it is very difficult to pull the tape off the roll to even use it do not bother purchasing thisgo to your nearest craft store or walmart and get a full roll of patternedtape for the same price quite disappointed with this purchase,83,49
1328,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this it is a goodtape to use for safety it is only 6 feet and only one little roll and only 3/4 wide but it will glow when the lights go out it lasts only a short while depends on how much and how long of light it gets to charge it so times very for how long it glows,61,50
1329,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,very small amount of tape and barely glowed,8,51
1330,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,yes i can read 3/4x72 but it is still shocking to see how tiny this room of tape is a roll of frogtape would be something like 45 if sold at a similar price per foot at this price you should be able to see it glowing from space,48,52
1331,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,it glows it istape but the photo is decpetive because never in my life have i seen a roll oftape that is not the size of a roll oftape,33,53
1332,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i was expecting a typical size never would i imagine something this small i guess the camera really does give it a bigger look,24,54
1333,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,i thought i ordered a lip gloss by mistake it is tiny but i just used it on my tiny remote control so i can find it it seems fine i really did not notice any glow in the dark,38,55
1334,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,just a 1 inch thing of tape what a ripoff i knew i should have read the reviews,18,56
1335,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the pictures did not depict that this was a very small role of tape i was extremely disappointed with the size and wish this detail was amplified a little more,30,57
1336,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,okay yes it is small other reviewers who gave it a poor review based on that need to read product descriptions more carefully that being said this is great tape bonds to itself well and seems to be extremely tough it has a rough cloth-like surface as opposed to a more traditionaltape plasticy-ness and it is rather thick it glows a bright strong green and does so for a long time it will not shine super bright for very long if you hold it up to a light but it does have a low glow that lasts for an hour or more which is totally perceptible in the dark would highly recommend they also sell a regular sized version if that is what you need,123,58
1337,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,did not like the glow feature of the tape because the glow was not that strong did not bother to return the product since s / h was pricey,27,59
1338,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i did not read the full details was blown away when i saw how small this was not much bigger than a quarter so if you want tiny to maybe put on your phone then it is for you i was just shocked i guess i should have read all the reviews my bad but not worth the money I shall go to walmart next time for this product normally i am a big fan of amazon i get all my sewing and quilting from amazon with no problems hope this helps someone,90,60
1339,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,good tape just watch out for the size of the roll it is smaller than you think it is about the size of a roll of washi tape,26,61
1340,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the photo makes this look as although it is regular sizetape when it arrived it was tiny smaller than scotch tape but about 1/4 do not recommend if you are going to sell a product why put a deceptive photo up put an actual photo up and let people judge if they want to spend money on your product as it actually is,65,62
1341,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,tape did not glow as expected was a bit disappointed not sure why either the light was dim and not bright,20,63
1342,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,very small in size i would not reorder for the price,11,64
1343,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,as many people mentioned in reviews this is a very small roll of tape almost comical in size but it is just what i was looking for i needed to put a tiny bit of glow in the dark tape on a light switch just inside the rv to know which to turn on for the inside lights i literally cut a piece about 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch for this purpose it does glow in the dark as advertised the tape has almost the feel of that white bandage tape that comes in a first aid kit not the feel of slick regulartape if that matters to anyone,109,65
1344,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,pay attention to the size this is a very tiny roll of tape works great,15,66
1345,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i am so happy with this tape my 1 use for this genius invention i use it to mark the corners of tables in my screened-in porch i do not always want to turn on my patio light but i like to sit outside after dark just a couple little strips that you can barely see in the daylight and no more stumbling into things the uses are endless that is just my own quirky fave,73,67
1346,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,love this tape for projects using cardboard like the vibrant design,11,68
1347,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it is a tiny roll but perfect for our purposes we used it to mark the rungs on my sons new bunk bed so he could find them in the dark it is been on the ladder for two months now and has not come up at all,45,69
1348,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,although it was very clear i did not realize it was so tiny check the size,15,70
1349,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this is a small role but works well still stuck down well and still glowing brightly 6 weeks later,19,71
1350,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,super tiny and maybe 2 feet long however it does glow in the dark,14,72
1351,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,smaller than expected but as far as the glow in the dark property it worked from what i was using it for,22,73
1352,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,beware this tape is sooooo small pay attention to the dimensions not the picture i wish that i had,19,74
1353,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,i do not really hate this tape but i hate the perspective it is listed as in the list of differenttapes it had the exact same size in the picture i makes it look like a regular rolls but it is tiny more like a roll of electrical tape,48,75
1354,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,worked very well for me for marking camping gear and outdoors on my property the pic is from a peace i put on my she had two years ago it is been in direct sun / wind / rain / snow for both years it is a bit dirty but still glowing,43,76
1355,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,speedy delivery great product and condition exactly as described we have enjoyed using this would recommend seller to everyone and will buy from seller again,25,77

1357,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,sucks very thin barely glows extremely small amount nottape do not be fooled,14,79
1358,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this roll is tiny about half the size of standard scotch tape roll but only 6 feet of tape do not buy this i put it on my remote controls to be able to find them at night better but it is not very bright,44,80
1359,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this roll is about the size of a large coin much smaller than i was expecting,16,81

1363,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,we bought this for a halloween costume and it worked great it really does glow especially if you give it a good charge with sunlight,25,85
1364,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the glow-in-the-darktape glows for a while then stop not worth buying,13,86
1365,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,look at product description very small picture makes it look large tape needs extensive time in light for very little time of glowing,23,87
1366,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this tape is sooooo tiny it looks big in the pic but it is not,14,88
1367,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,itsy bitsy it defense of the listing it does say the size on defense of the consumer we most likely would not look because who has ever seen such a smalltap i automatically assumed it looked the same as every other sizetape especially at this price,48,89
1368,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i did not know thattape made these micro rolls glows in the dark well but this roll cost almost as much as the full size glow in the darktape at lowes wish i had read the reviews,41,90
1369,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,do not waste your money if you read it is only 72 inches by 3/4 wide too pricey for so little roll is barely bigger than a half dollar in size buy paint instead,32,91
1370,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this comes on a tiny little roll but it does exactly what it claims to do it glows in the dark expose this to some light and it will glow like crazy and it adheres like crazy too i bought some glow in the dark paint at the same time i bought this and i bought the best glow in the dark paint there was based on ratings thistape glows just as brightly as does the paint so for whatever reason you may need this do not hesitate because it really does work but this is a very small roll about the size of a half dollar but you can buy bigger sized rolls,115,92
1371,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i should have read the reviews this roll of tape is tiny,12,93
1372,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,the one time i do not read the reviews,8,94
1373,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,had a project requiring smaller sized tape this worked of limited value otherwise,13,95
1374,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,what i wanted tho thought the roll was bigger than it was for the price,15,96
1375,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this is a very misleading product i did not think i needed to read the dimensions but obviously i did when it arrived it was tiny see pics to compare to standardtape i will be returning it shortly,38,97
1376,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,works nice but very small and small roll,8,98
1377,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,for the price i suggest getting the bigger one unless you do not need much,14,99
1378,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,i bought this to put on my sons drumsticks for use with black lights it really makes them stand out under that kind of lighting,25,100
1379,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,glows well lost a star although because this is a tiny roll not your regular size roll oftape should be called out more specifically in listing,28,101
1380,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,this stuff is great i use it on all my remotes so i could find it easily in the dark a little smaller than expected make sure you pay attention to the dimensions that are listed on the page other than that it is a great product I shall probably be looking to buy more because it runs out quick,58,102
1381,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this product is inferior it does not glow in the dark and it is a waste of money,18,103
1382,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,very very tiny roll maybe 15 feet of the stuff in a 1/4inch wide section does not glow very well would not buy again,23,104
1383,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,tiniest tape roll ever and was damaged will be returning,10,105
1384,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,works great it is just as sticky as othertape and it is small width makes it good for precision fixes i used it to fix a broken bike pedal and it fit through each crack nicely and blended in seamlessly with the surrounding colors i rode for the next week through rain and over speed bumps and it held together through all of it,64,106
1385,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,i put this alongside a light switch to help find it in low light situations without my glasses it pretty much is useless ambient daylight is not enough to charge this tape you really need some sustained bright light to make this work there might be situations where it is useful but mine was not one of them i ended up putting in a new illuminated switch which was about the same price as this stuff,73,107
1386,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,the picture of the product makes it seem like it is a decent size roll this roll is tiny and i would not have paid this much money for such a tiny roll i also ordered 3 other rolls oftape and the pictures all appear to be the same size,52,108
1387,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,how disappointing shame on me for now reading details this roll oftape is slightly larger than a quarter,20,109
1388,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,probably my own fault for not looking more closely at the dimensions but this is not a full size roll oftape it is literally the size of a silver dollar terribly disappointed in the small quantity for a relatively high price over 5 / roll,45,110
1389,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,picture for this product is very misleading this is a tiny overpriced roll oftape while the description does clearly specify the dimensions the photo is misleading,28,111
1390,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,check the size i can not believe i paid this much for such a tiny roll of tape absolutely ridiculous,19,112
1391,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,it does exactly what it says it will do glow in the dark and stick to stuff,17,113

1393,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this stuff really sticks especially to your fingers and itself as for anything else maybe-maybe not the most frustrating thing about this brand is that it does not tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll this is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this you are far better off with something like 3 m of some other generic at the hardware stores this junk is just not worth the frustration,80,115
1394,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,read description carefully this is a tiny roll oftape i misread the description,16,116
1395,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,if you have miniature / petite ducks this is the tape you are looking for i have a full team of ducks that used to wander where they pleased now they stay where i put them can you hear them clarice the quaking of the ducks,44,117

1397,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,too narrow and short to be of much use it is a nice toy nothing more,15,119
1398,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,1.0,negative,this is a very small roll of tape this product is not what i expected,14,120
1399,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this was perfect for repairing the cording on a vinyl / pleather love seat,12,121
1400,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,good tape has the size of electrical tape,8,122
1401,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,5.0,positive,this was a smaller roll than i expected i should have more carefully read the description it is about the size of a scotch tape refill,26,123
1402,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,thought it was the regular sized ones not the value i thought i was getting,15,124
1403,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,4.0,positive,colorful tape it could be stickier but it gets the job done,12,125

1405,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00CH9PWF0,2.0,negative,not reallytape at all it is more like masking tape that does not stick when it gets wet it does glow nicely tho,23,127
1836,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it works it fits but the double sided tape that came with it sucks just replace it with something better and it does what it says,26,0
1837,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,a great product holds my mic and do not fall off dash in rough and bumpy construction roads i would tell my friends about this product,24,1
1838,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,got this to hold my cobra cb radio the sticky tape does not hold more than a few paperclips before it falls off i had to use a 3 m yellow weatherstrip adhesive glue to affix it to my dash i did not want to drill holes now I shall probably have to scrape glue off if i ever want to move it,59,2
1839,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,after two days it fell off the tape was still on the truck but the holder was not on the tape any more i put a few drops of superglue on the holder and put it back on two days later the adhesive tape came loose from the truck i was hoping to have a mic holder without drilling holes in the truck but this product did not fit the bill it is pretty much worthless if it falls off i would not buy this,81,3
1840,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i like the product works well i have not used the adhesive part of it yet so can not comment on the stickyness of it from the way my dash is in my truck it worked better to gorilla glue it from the side so did not use the adhesive part but it fits perfectly with what i wanted to hang on it the only reason it is 4 star is because i have not used the adhesive part but it is a sturdy piece,80,4
1841,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,came with an adhesive tape for mounting on the back my mic fit perfect inside and seems to hold strong i like that it is black and blends in,28,5
1842,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,bought this because i did not want to drill holes in the interior of my truck to hang my ham mic reading all the past negative reviews about the tape being cheap and not sticking l went ahead and bought some 3 m heavy duty double sided tape and replaced it with the one that came with the holder over 6 months with now it is still holding with no signs of it coming off awesome holder you shall just have to upgrade the tape yourself,83,6
1843,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,junk actually all of these adhesive mike holders are junk cheaply built the adhesive is worthless and all of these adhesive mike holders use the same 3 m adhesive use this and no matter how well you clean the surface it sticks to your mike will soon be on the floor along with the adhesive mike holder this one worked just as well as the rest of them mike on the floor use the supplied mike holder and screws that come with your mike instead threw this in the trash not worth returning,90,7
1844,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,ok had to put new tape on back,8,8
1845,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,these work well for holding the yaesu button type microphones models like the feet-891 feet-7800 and more the included adhesive pad is garbage and did not even last a day scrape it off and use some good 3 m double sided tape,39,9
1846,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,it works well and looks nice does not have a lock on it like most metal ones but i knew that as other reviews said i had to replace the double stick tape it did not even last a day with the tape it came with,44,10
1847,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,purchased this to hold the control for my hospital bed so that i am not always dropping it on the floor,21,11
1848,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the tape does not work it keeps falling off,8,12
1849,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,depends on what you attach it to I have moved it three times on my car 2009 cadillac cts to find a place where the adhesive will stick without loosening suffice to say I have replaced the double-stick tape a couple times before i found a good attachment point,47,13
1850,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,it is a piece of plastic with tape on it it gets the job done but it is overpriced also make sure you know where you are going to stick it before you do because you only get one shot this thing probably cost a penny to produce,46,14
1851,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not work at all i installed and it fell off within seconds i bought this so that i would not drill holes in my dash luckily amazon gave me credit for the 2 that i bought i like thebut beyond that,48,15
1852,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,works a treat until it does not very light mic it might hold for a day then the whole things winds up on the floor i re-stick the black plastic to the sticky back and it stays for maybe another few hours then again the whole thing winds up on the floor going to try the sticky back from 3 m command hooks and see if that works if this were just a hanger type mic i would already have used the 3 m product,82,16
1853,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,adhesive does not hold replaced with gorilla tape mic fits clip well,11,17
1854,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,do not waste your money the glue on the pad will not hold the holder and the mic it holds the holder just fine but as soon as you put your mic in it the holder separates from the sticky pad it is not sticky enough,43,18
1855,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i installed this carefully after cleaning my fjs smooth dash panel and left it overnight to bond on properly as soon as the fairly light handset of my cb radio was placed in it the adhesive failed and it fell off the dash,43,19
1856,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,just what u needed for the limited space in my jeep holds very well,14,20
1857,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i had a place for this thank you,8,21
1858,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,hooks great but the double sided tape did not take nothing some glue can not fix,14,22
1859,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it did not stay stuck on clean plastic and in the shade longer than a day,16,23
1860,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the double stick tape was not strong enough to hold my michadto add a screw,16,24
1861,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,as others have stated the adhesive is not strong enough to support a mic i immediately replaced with some 3 m auto double-sided foam adhesive that i already had this holder works perfectly with my yaesu mh-48 mic in my car can not beat the price,44,25
1862,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,i bought this knowing that i would need to purchase better tape although i did test the provided tape first it did not stay up more than 5 minutes after a trip to the hardware store and spending more on 3 m tape than i spent on this holder everything is in place and holding minus 2 stars for worthless tape 1 star back for still providing me with an alternative to drilling into my dash,74,26
1863,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,it was an add-onso I am not terribly disappointed but it tried i guess the adhesive backing is not strong enough to do anyone any good mine fell off before i even attempted to stick a microphone into it,39,27
1864,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off within a few hours the truck never moved from it is spot either,14,28
1865,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i used some super glue and fixed it to my dash next to my steering column and it fits my mic perfect and has worked for me for 2 years,30,29

1867,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,terrible will not stick do not waste,8,31
1868,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,even after cleaning the mounting surface the cheap tape on mic holder will not hold for very long had to purchase 3 m tape which has worked so far this product is not worth the money because you have to spend more money to buy 3 m tape to make this product work,50,32
1869,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,this is so i inexpensive but absolutely great i attached this to my rear view mirror and love it you must buy this,23,33
1870,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,overpriced but it does what it is supposed to the included adhesive tape is sketchy,14,34
1871,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,fell off my plexiglass boat windshield after 3 days in the backyard under a cover glued it back on with marine adhesive hope it works,25,35
1872,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,bought this exact hook in a truck stop what a piece i held firm for about an hour then flop ford my microphone and this thing down into the floor under my feet and looking at where it was on the dash it left a ridiculous residue took me close to 30 minutes to clean a 11 inch square if i could give zero stars i would,67,36
1873,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,does the job very well looks better in my truck than those shiny chrome holders and you can not beat the price,21,37
1874,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,looks good because its black adhesive does not work should come with a screw so it works,16,38
1875,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,fell off every surface in my car the adhesive on this is a joke,14,39
1876,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the double sided tape is crap old news but goop glue and a few seconds and it will never move again this thing is like a rock and works great in my van even with the kids climbing all around it with the mic is on it,47,40
1877,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,the adhesive does not work very well do not waste your money,10,41
1878,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,although it arrived on time and in good condition the quality of the product is poor the double sided tape failed after less than 20 minutes and i found my mike on the floor of my truck the tape stayed where i had mounted it but the holder fell off i replaced the original tape with a 3 m product and everything is where it should be for the price i expected better,72,42
1879,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,i had ended up purchasing 2 of these the first one fell off not through amazon when i bought a second thinking maybe it was a bad batch of adhesive nope they all suck i did get the product a little cheaper although at a truck stop so buying 2 was not so bad 250 ea i ended up buying some 3 m double stick tape and now works great with the modified tape i would give it a 5 star but as sold defiantly a 1 star as no stars is not an option,93,43
1880,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,there is not much to say it is a very simple solid piece of plastic but it holds my midland cb 75 - 822 perfectly the tape provided did not hold up very long so expect to buy something stronger and be sure to clean the surface well first alternatively you could also drill it into your dash if you do not mind altering your vehicle,61,44
1881,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,cheap plastic and the mic does not fit very well i mounted it with velcro so it did not spoil my dash,20,45
1882,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i thought this would look nicer than an aluminum one the adhesive is very cheap it will not support my mic and fell off after about 60 seconds certainly would not hold up off road might work better with some quality 3 m adhesive strips,42,46
1883,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,i bought this for my jeep a few warm summer days and the adhesive backing gives way with out any weight on it i keep my mic in the glove box while not in use so the mount has only it is weight and it still falls,46,47
1884,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,the product was fine but i found a different the filled my needs better the size was fine adios adios,20,48
1885,Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,I am recommending against this holder back in the olden days you could almost never count on backing-adhesives doing the job but I have been surprised over the years how much better those products have become unfortunately this product does not exhibit those improved characteristics even although i carefully cleaned the surface to which this product would adhere the adhesive failed hold almost instantly the adhesive fell apart at two points amazon did refund my account also thisshould have costs 49 cents not 379 it is just a tiny piece of plastic,91,49
1886,Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,the self stick tape lasted less than one hour in my car before this thing fell off of the dash to make it works i had to by a better double back tape,33,50
1887,Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,perfect fit for a typical cb handset but will require either a screw or some real tape the surface material included is just plain poor i ultimately just drilled a small screw into my dash works perfect,37,51
1888,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the slot is just a hair tight for the mic but I am sure it will loosen up after time looks great in my new car,24,52
1889,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,i lost my cb radio mic mount so i bought this one i read the reviews saying that the adhesive is weak no problem right away i tore off the old adhesive tape and replaced it with scotch extreme mounting tape which claims to hold 20 lbs got it at home depot the tape is insanely strong i used to have my mic velcrod to my dash and so i would always pull it straight off I have accidentally tried doing that several times with this mount instead of pulling up first and it has held with no problems good stuff,100,53
1890,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,the adhesive is very strong and can withstand the excessive use my little sister puts on it when she rides with me i really can not complain looks nice in black interior of vehicle as well,35,54
1891,Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,my husband wanted a holder to put in his car to hold his microphone for his ham radio system his old one kept falling off the dashboard this one really did the trick,33,55

1897,Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,the worst part was figuring out how not to damage the cover and remove the old switch after that it was simple i saved at least a hundred dollars not too difficult,33,5

1905,Automotive,B001O01C4I,1.0,negative,i have had this switch for just a bit over a year and it has been not working 100 right for several months the buttons simply work when they want and one failed to the point of me unplugging the power connector to the window motor to keep from getting stuck with it down very frustrating two of the four switches are junk in less than a year cmon i paid 36 38 ish something for it much less than a dealer for sure but i just replaced it with another that i got delivered for 2299 off e-bay much cheaper price probably about the same quality buyer be warned read the other reviews and as for trying to warranty a piece of crap my philosophy is this if the first one is not good why in the world would i want the same aggravation again even for free under warranty I shall take my chances on another imported brand,156,13
1906,Automotive,B001O01C4I,5.0,positive,first the warranty dorman limited lifetime warranty at dorman we take pride in the quality of our products and your satisfaction with their performance thus dorman warrants it is products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service as your exclusive remedy dorman will replace free of charge any dorman product that in dormans reasonable determination does not comply with the foregoing warranty this warranty is voided by non-recommended use improper installation or physical damage in addition dorman will not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages and your exclusive remedy shall be replacement of the product that did not comply with this limited warranty i replaced both the regulator / motor and this switch on my 1997 buick century the switch is working properly but i just put it in the form factor was exact and i had no installation or fit problems if there is a problem i will addendum this review,158,14

2556,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,1.0,negative,got you where i want you is by far the only song worth listening to every other songs sound like an entirely different band most of the time the signer uses so many effect on his voice that it sounds like he has singing through a tin can under a bridge while being backed up by a few highschool kids in a band it is just plain aweful,66,2
2557,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,fantastic cd it is not in stores anymore use to listen to it in highschool it is alternative 90s experimental rock,19,3
2558,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,before they were the flys most of the members of this band were in a band mozart i was really impressed with the music mozart made and when i found out they had morphed into the flys i was really intrigued to hear what their sound would be like i admit that i did really like the song got you where i want you when i heard it on the radio but did not recognize them as the band i formerly enjoyed after listening carefully to this song i definitely hear the old sound mixed in and enjoy it even more now that i know it is derived from the band i really missed i am starting to enjoy the rest of the album also but slowly I shall admit my next favorite song is sexual sandwich i am sure the rest of the album will grow on me as i listen to it more because of the talent and uniqueness of this band i am rating it a 5 and giving 4 of the stars because of their talent and how much i enjoy got you where i want you and 1 star for how much i am anticipating enjoying the album in the future,205,4
2559,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,2.0,negative,wel i was turned on to this song at a strip club when 2 lipstick lesbian dancers were doing what they do best to each other i got you where i want you was the best piece on this cd the rest of the songs did not strike a buzz with me although i listen to it with fond memories of those two hot chicks that night at the bar so i gave it 2 stars for the girls and the songthis is a one hit wonder cd or a good beer drinking cd at a frat party in collage,99,5

2562,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,4.0,positive,this is california rock no doubt and a great rock party cd at that the 70s party rock band was van halen the 80s brought us janes addiction and the 90s delivers the flys speaking of janes addiction this cd sort of instills the image that their little surfer brothers all formed a band and this is what came out this is a fairly nice mixture of todays popular genres all mixed into ato be served on modern rock instruments they even include subtle tributes to sly stone and barry white along with the nearly hidden recurrence of the elements of surf music from days gone by another pleasantry within is a consistently positive although sometimes sarcastic message regarding the female persuasion that is very little of the break-up-song you broke my heart mentality all in all a great rock album with tasty songs and recording techniques rock lovers will appreciate,153,8
2563,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000009S42,5.0,positive,after hearing adam paskowitzsinger perform on the bathead soup ozzy osbourne tribute a few months ago i decided to give the flys a try so i bought their latest cd outta my way i really liked this cd so i soon picked up holiday man after hearing holiday man i can now say that the flys are one of my favorite bands this cd is great and i like all but one song still eleven out of twelve is pretty good this cd mixes a lot of types of music from slow songs like girls are the cruelest to more upbeat songs such as holiday man some of my favorite tracks include got you where i want you afraid holiday man and groove is where you find it if you like the flys or want to try something new you should check out this cd,147,9

2856,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,for my 4th baby i wanted nursing bras that i could wear out of the house that were as supportive as my normal bras this one is perfect it is lined so you can not see nursing pads through it and it is comfortable and easy to nurse in the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the sizing is a bit off the band around the middle is smaller than usual and the cup size seems bigger than usual i had to try on a few before i found the right fit but once i did i was good to go and believe me i have tried many nursing bras this one has been great,118,0
2857,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i really like this bra the only problem that i have with it is the side wire pieces are uncomfortable one of them is trying to poke through the fabric already so this could use more padding and reinforcement other than that this is a good bra,47,1
2858,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i do not know who sizes these products but the cup size is too big by at least 2 i ordered the 36d and it was massively too big even for the 2 days when my milk came in that i was very engorged it is useless order small and return it if you need to,54,2
2859,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the bra could have been made better without the elastic staps that surround the breast it is uncomfortable,18,3

2861,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i loved this bra i was looking everywhere for a molded nursing bra and was very excited when i found this one it works great and for only 26 it is a steal so far it is holding up well with washing too,43,5
2862,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,very comfortable and functional a little hard to operate with one hand while holding a squirming infant cup is a little too cone shaped for my liking but otherwise i am happy with the product,35,6
2863,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,the best underwire nursing bra I have found it is a bit firm but it gives really good support and although very full coverage is not bulky under clothes it is nice to have something i can wear under nicer clothes without looking lumpy it is not my favorite i have a softer non-underwire leading lady bra that i prefer for everday all day but this one works for special occasions,68,7
2864,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my wife loved this bra while she was nursing our daughter she said it fit perfectly and was comfortable,19,8

2868,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,to small and to pointy would not recommend buying this,9,12
2869,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i have owned these bras for 3 and a half months and the under wire broke on both of them i wear the bras roughly once a week wash in gentle cycle and line dry poor quality,37,13
2870,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,when i first got this i was a bit weary because the cups had a kind of molded shape it seemed unnatural to me as i thought it looked funny to me i was wrong i ended up loving / getting used to this i love this nursing bra it has support with the underwire it is super comfy and it serves it is purpose very well so easy to clip on and off for nursing purposes and holds shape even if you are not in properly laughing out loud i would definitely recommend this i wish i had gotten this from the start,97,14
2871,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my boobs have been up in size and all around so i own pretty much every bra size now this pregnancy my breasts decided to settle on 36ddd or gargantuan as i like to refer to them 36ddd is hard to find and different companies fit slightly differently so i originally bought the 36dd but returned and got the 38dd which is working so far my cup doth not spillath over anymore and no side boob which is also a plus the band fits well on the middle hooks and gives good support straps feel soft against the skin but strong and thank god not rediculously wide so they are not noticeable under clothing the price is pretty awesome too for the quality i have spent up to 60 on one nursing bra thinking this will be the bra that changes my life and i like this one better for way less money I am giving a 5 star for all these reasons oh and the girls profile view is nicely rounded and natural looking not pointed weird or sad looking wahoo,181,15
2872,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is amazing it fits prefect holds the girls up so well is super comfortable and very soft i want to buy like a million more,27,16
2873,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is the last one i reach for in my arsenal of nursing bras the padding is stiff and very difficult to fold down to nurse when folded down it does not remain down so i have to tuck in under the underwire to be held in place which by the way tucking the padding is a chore in itself this is very frustrating especially when in public and trying to ready myself to feed my crying and squirmy hungry infant I have had people ask me if i were okay and if i needed help with something augh,99,17
2874,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the support is great the cup shape is a little too pointy for my liking although update yeah i do not like this bra the rubbery material on the band going around my chest is not breathable and digs into me why not leave it cotton I am about 140lbs and somewhat fit but this bra fits so terribly that it gives me back fat rolls I am convinced that it is that rubbery material added to the strap going around my chest i assume that it is to keep the bra in place but not being able to move with my body makes for unflattering rolls of skin popping out it is awful and i can not wait to get this bra off at the end of the day especially on hot days when that rubbery band just makes me sweat,134,18
2875,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,have used these since having my son 2 1/2 years ago continued to wear them even after he weaned after a year of nursing now still using them nursing my second son i recommend them to anyone who asks what to use for a comfortable nursing bra with underwire love the coverage of the bra the amount of padding is just enough not too much and the nudedoes not show through white or other light colored shirts i wear these all day sometimes 18 hours and they never get uncomfortable at the end of the day i only take them off to sleep and shower they do start to wear a bit on the top inside of the bra just below the nursing clasp since that part folds down each time you nurse this eventually causes the seam to give but even then they still work well these are a great product and value considering most other underwire nursing bras cost far more and are far less comfortable not super stylish but they do the job they are intended for,180,19
2876,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits well but material wrinkles under clothing a bit like too much material just at the nipple part however very comfortable and functional,23,20
2877,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,worst nursing bra ever sizes are not true to measurement save your money and get a motherhood bra,18,21
2878,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,unfortunately this bra is too small around the chest the cups are also way too small and inflexible which would not allow enough give for engorged breasts,27,22
2879,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,another awful fitting bra pointy cups rides up in back returned this,12,23
2880,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i wish this came in a 36ddd but i make this work it is my far the best support and coverage that i have been able to find in a nursing bra,32,24
2881,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,overall i like this bra so far I have had it a couple weeks and it fits well my only complaint is that sometimes it does itch / rub where the hook is for the cups but otherwise it is been very comfortable i like that it is slightly padded although it is not too thick i am currently pregnant so have not tried it for nursing yet but the cups are a bit harder to fold down due to being a bit thicker i think they will still work fine although i would buy again update i am now 6 weeks postpartum and still really like this bra and have ordered another it is a little harder to flip down when nursing but i can still make it work best of all it provides great support and does not cost a fortune,138,25
2882,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very confortable and support bra easy fot breast feeding,9,26
2883,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the band was much smaller than expected the cups although that is what made me return it they are not at all rounded like the picture they are pointy too pointy for any kind of natural look,36,27
2884,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,bought this in size bra pre pregnacy to big will try to send back for right size,17,28
2885,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,I am nursing my 3rd baby and finally found a great nursing bra i got a size 38d and it seems true to size i got a 16 bra at target and should have just thrown that money away that bra fit so terribly I shall gladly spend a little more for another one of these it is comfortable and has just the right amount of padding to feel covered and supported while out and about it will be good for pumping in as well when i go back to work I shall be buying at least one more of these i have not washed it yet so i can not comment on how it holds up,112,29
2886,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,size runs small order at least 1 size larger than normal,11,30
2887,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it was ok but the underwire poked out within a short amount of time,14,31
2888,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,normally 36dd ordered 36d / e it is a little snug but i feel this is a good bra for out and about feel like it is a normal bra not a saggy nursing bra just should have considered supply and demand and gone up a size,42,32
2889,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i did not really like the comfort of this bra i only wore it a few times,16,33
2890,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,could not even wear it once width waaaayyyy tooooo small cups waaaayyyyy tooooo big not as listed at all i purchased a 34d and it fit like it was a 30e,30,34
2891,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,best fitting nursing bra and well bra in general fits great comfortable and easy to use,16,35
2892,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,other reviewers were right it is a tad too small in the band and it gives you torpedo boobs very noticeable torpedo boobs it also says it is padded but the padding is so light that you can still see your nipples through it not a good buy i will be returning it,51,36
2893,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,so disappointed i thought i finally found what I have been searching for for the past four years it was going to be a supportive padded underwire comfortable bra that i just happen to be able to nurse in i read the reviews and they all said that the band ran small and the cups ran large I am a 36dd so i ordered a 38d when it came i was so excited i immediately opened it and tried it on the band fit perfectly the cups were padded and supportive it was so comfortable but the cups were still way too big like ridiculously i thought maybe i can still wear it and get away with it so i tried on a few shirts to see how they looked and they were awful it looked like my nipples were I shall shaped and wavy from the ridiculous amount of unnecessary extra fabric so mad,152,37
2894,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,most comfortable breast-feeding bra i have ever tried,8,38
2895,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love this nursing bra i have always worn victorias secret bras with underwire and this is the most comparable nursing bra i have been able to find it is very supportive and i like the center support when pumping,40,39
2896,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,washed it twice and it fell apart fits good although,10,40
2897,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,cup size was accurate but it fit snug around the back and the spine on either side of the band poked into my skin the cups did not fold down far enough for easy breastfeeding,35,41
2898,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,both band and cup were tighter than other bras that i own that are the same size should have trusted other reviewers comments regarding sizing order up at least a size,31,42
2899,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,after nursing for 2 years i really wanted a molded cup padded underwire bra to give a better shape and make me feel a little more normal again i searched for a while and am glad i purchased this one the price is great for a nursing bra and i have seen much more expensive ones at specialty stores and online the underwire is comfortable and although i wish it was slightly more padded i was happy with this it looks great under any garment but the sides do come a little higher than some of my other bras so i have to make sure that the shirt i choose covers it under my arms it is easy to nurse in and once the top is clipped back up it does not take long for the padding to smooth out again I have worn it out after about a year as the underwire is starting to poke through the fabric so it is time for a new one and i would definitely purchase this again,172,43
2900,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,too tight the cups do not stay down scratched the babys face,11,44
2901,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i wore this bra twice the strap broke on the second wear i contacted customer service and they will not work with me on an exchange 30 is not dirt cheap for a bra and i would have hoped i could have worn it more than 2 times had it for about 34 days as a new mother what the heck a busy newborn i was unable to contact them within the 30 day time frame so there is nothing they can do horrible custo merge service search for la isla brandon instead much better construction,92,45
2902,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wish i had read the reviews first price is great but band is too small and material is rough and the cups do not fold down enough,26,46
2903,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the clasp broke as i was trying it on for the very first time,14,47
2904,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,love this bra it is my go to bra for nursing,10,48
2905,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,best nursing bras i bought nice shape good fit comfortable and easy to use,14,49
2906,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,great bra as others have said it runs a little small in band size and a little big in cup size but it covers well and keeps my boobs from looking pointed,32,50
2907,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i thought this bra would be amazing but the boning on the sides is too long so it digs in even when I am not nursing it hurts and i do not know how making a bra like this is considered acceptable,40,51
2908,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered one size up from my regular size and the bra still fits a bit small the material is great and it does give good support,27,52
2909,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,best nursing bra i have found this was my third baby and never found one i liked with my last two,21,53
2910,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the perfect mixture between a regular bra and nursing bra lifts you up so you look nice but with the snap of a clasp you are ready to nurse i love this one,32,54
2911,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i ordered this nursing bra 2x in 2 different sizes and had to return them both from being too small i believe they run small but other then that the bra it is self was what i was looking for little padding and small underwire i may order this bra again in another size because it is what I am looking for,60,55
2912,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered a 34 c I am still pregnant and have been wearing a 34 b normal bra but i am needing a larger size this however was too big the cups were dented and a bit cone like on me maybe i need one size smaller either way i need to return this one,54,56
2913,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,wore it the full year i nursed and loved it,10,57
2914,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the plastic boning in the side is horrible removed it,10,58
2915,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,too large too bulky the worst and most unconfortable nursing bra i ever tried,14,59
2916,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,had to return because it did not fit me right,10,60
2917,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,not comfy at all lamaze brand worked better for me,10,61
2918,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i ordered two of these one tan that i liked so i ordered one in white after wearing this a few times the underwire began to jam into my side the tan I am still wearing today and does not it does not even seem to have the underwire in the same place not sure why the two are different when they were supposed to be the same very disappointed in this one,71,62
2919,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,extremely uncomfortable to me it is a scratchy material around the seams and in order to get it to be supportive it ends up digging into my sides under my arms and I am not a large woman on top of that the cups are a bit larger than expected especially in comparison to the size of the band and then trying to get my breast uncovered is a whole other mission i have to fold the covering a few times and literally tuck it under my breast for it not to be in the way so my baby can eat the only reason i did not click i hate it is because the feature of having underwire which is what attracted me to the product is nice but the rest is very badly designed in my opinion,135,63
2920,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it sooooo comfortable I am going to buy an other one,10,64
2921,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i was looking all over for a soft cup underwire nursing bra and I am so happy i found these they give me a great shape great support and are really comfortable,31,65
2922,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,looks like a bra my 85 year old grandmother would wear,11,66
2923,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,not a lot of padding and runs small,8,67
2924,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,not easy to use not any different that just use your regular bra plus makes your boobs look pointy,19,68
2925,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love leading lady bras as they offer good support for me and come in a variety of colors they always fit perfectly,23,69
2926,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is been nearly six years since i needed a nursing bra and the playtex style i once enjoyed and found most uplifting was no longer available i really debated purchasing this bra but i am so glad i did it is extremely supportive a rarity in nursing bras go figure and very comfortable the cups are not too thick and easily hide nursing pads yes they do fold down with a little more effort but the support is well worth it the band size does seem a little small too as others have noted but the size i needed did fit if you need support this is an excellent nursing bra,112,70
2927,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wire in the sides constantly pokes the skin and the cup does not fold down far enough to nurse easily,20,71
2928,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,comfortable the cups are a little loose but it is a good bra,12,72
2929,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the width was way too small and the cup size was way too big i usually wear a 34d but sized up to a 36dd since i am 6 months pregnant this definitely did not work for me the quality seemed good just not the fit,46,73
2930,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,was like putting on a coney pointy bra ick i returned it,12,74
2931,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,fits as far as general bra size i like the strap extender and it is helpful bra for inserting breast pads however it does not work at all for nursing the flip down flap sits up to high still covering a lot of the breast and the underwire impedes feeding altogether it is very supportive however a little too supportive for a breast feeding mom that does not want to restrict flow,72,75
2932,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i like this bra and brand however i ordered an underwire style to replace the one i currently have been wearing and was shipped the same bra style only with no underwire i wore it a few times before realized why it fit differently it is comfortable so i wear it around house but it does not support and lift like the underwire bra does i think i was just shipped the wrongi like that they have larger cup size with smaller waist sizes it is hard to find 34d in maternity bras,95,76
2933,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the band is very uncomfortable i tried 2 sizes,9,77
2934,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this is the most uncomfortable bra i have ever owned it is ok if you wear it for less than an hour after that it is like you are wearing a cactus,29,78
2935,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits a litte tight around but hoping it gives a little as i wear it these are my favorite nursing bras great support this is my third child and i have used them with all of them i started out with a different brand and hated them,47,79
2936,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,I have always worn a 34 with no problem this bra is a tight 34,14,80
2937,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,does not give a nice rounded shape as pictured it actually flattens your breasts in the front and pushes your nipples out toward your armpits it looks awful and is very unflattering,32,81
2938,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,pretty good for a nursing bra fits well,8,82
2939,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,returned this product too much fabric and did not fit at all like any other 34c I have ever worn,19,83
2940,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the size of the bra fits really well but it is annoying when you are nursing because the flaps do not stay down like my other nursing bras would not recommend,28,84
2941,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,when i received it it was damaged and the fit was all wrong,13,85
2942,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra i have found with my first child i had an awful time finding a supportive bra for a 38dd they would get so stretched out after constant use they looked terrible under anything close fitting and the cups would bulge near the underarms but this bra holds it is shape even after constant use it did seem small at first but after 3 months it has worn in and stretched out a bit it also looks normal under a shirt or sweater i recommend this one and it is reasonably priced,96,86
2943,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the underwire gets in the way of nursing and the size is bigger than expected,15,87
2944,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great easy to use nursing bra the sides both clip down for easy access bra also seems to have a little extra room for the disposable nursing pads the bra is of hefty construction it is not light weight material very durable,42,88
2945,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,so good so comfortable pretty it does not seem a maternity bra,12,89
2946,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,bra was super awkward and way too small although i measured before purchase it was tight on the band cups were too big would have been fine since my milk has not come in yet but the weirdest thing was the straps were too short even full extended my boons would have to be at my clavicle for this to be a comfortable bra returned and not bothering to reorder,69,90
2947,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable bra can not wait to start using this once my baby is born,14,91
2948,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i had to return it because it did not fit properly even although i ordered my size,17,92
2949,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is extremely uncomfortable the underwire digs very harshly into your sides and the nursing panel does not fold down the way it should in order to nurse it would keep pushing up into my daughters face the bra in general would be fine if it was not considered a nursing bra but with the main design to be for nursing mothers it is painful to wear and very difficult to feed so i do not recommend this bra a very large waist of money,84,93
2950,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the fit was smaller than i expected and stiff i would not recommend it i had to return it,18,94
2951,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra it is true to size and supportive and comfortable,15,95
2952,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,while functional i could not wear this bra for more than an hour the band was too small even although i ordered a size up after reading reviews the cups were too large not by much but they were cone shaped and looked awful under a shirt since my breasts are not cone shaped the band was also very uncomfortable on the sides there is a vertical wire or thick seam under the armpit that digs into my rib cage i wish i had not washed it before i wore it for a longer period of time i would have returned it,100,96
2953,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this full coverage bra keeps the girls in no spilling over the cups it makes my cest look perky not saggy i do not find it the easiest to nurse in but it will be my go to bra once back at work,42,97
2954,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,love the bra i can wash it and it doest lump or come apart one handed clip make it easy for night time nursing or if i want to sleep in it it looks great under all my clothes highly recommend this bra i will be buying more as for how far it comes down to nurse ladies try rolling it under your breast works wonderfully,65,98
2955,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,absolutely love this product i will not buy any other version this is a must have,15,99
2956,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the bra was a little small i ordered a 34b it would still be wearable except that the front part of the bra does not fold down far enough to fit the pump,32,100
2957,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i oredeted two bras from this company and at first was happy with them shortly after wearing them the wire on the side started poking out of the material stabbing my underarm on both bras now the lining is ripping i am very disappointed,44,101
2958,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the size all around on this bra is off horrible fit and the pic is deceiving not that much padding on the cups,23,102
2959,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i have been looking for a nursing bra that does not give me a saggy sports-bra look under clothing and finally one that fits and actually looks decent under a t-shirt i am usually a 34 f on the loosest hooks in other brands but this fits really well,48,103
2960,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i know you only wear nursing bras for a few months but there are way better brands out there the cup felt not right too big in the center of the cup and too tight on thewhere it gives you a visible dent in your chest under t-shirts i hated the inner lining too i prefer just an outer lining that connects to the bra strap when you roll down the cup to nurse this bra has a complete circle inner lining with a circle cut-out for nursing it was uncomfortable and awkward for nursing using pads wearing undergarments if you do and using with other nursing tops and camis just do not,113,104
2961,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this is a sturdy well supporting nursing bra has lightly molded cups like a t-shirt bra to keep a good shape and hide the wrinkles and bulk of nursing pads for me it seems that it fit a little small in the cup size and it is a little stiff out of the packaging it does soften up as you wash it but other than that it is a great nursing bra i have used the leading lady brand for all 4 of my kids while nursing and they are the best for the price amazons prices were half of what i paid at a leading department store previously,108,105
2962,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is amazing it fits very true to size and on me had more coverage than the girl in the photo i do not think the way the flap comes down creates any sort of problem with my sons latch like some others have said it does the straps feel great and i like the ticket band this offers so much support i was a 3rd before pregnancy and i do not know if this compensates for the aimed increase in size but that is what i ordered and it fits great i can not wait for my white one to come in if you missed underwire like i did this bra is worth it especially for how great the price is,120,106
2963,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,order a couple sizes larger than you think you need especially the girth size after reading other ppls comment i ordered 34 in because i am normally 32 but they were still too tight think i need a bra extender to wear them comfortably,44,107
2964,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra I have ever purchased and I have purchased a lot this was purchased after having my 10th baby the padding is perfect it hides well also if i forget to put nursing pads on the milk does notthrough to the shirt usually great bra the band size runs a bit small,56,108
2965,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,too small in the band and too big in the cup i would not purchase again,16,109
2966,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,nice fabricator true to size i have several bras in the same size from other companies and the fit perfect or too big this was so small i could not fit it tooooooooo small,33,110
2967,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cups on this bra were way too big,9,111
2968,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,works fine was a little small around the chest i had to purchase a bra extender cup size fits as expected,21,112
2969,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup size was true but the chest size was much too small a good two inches off i measured it,21,113
2970,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am returning this bra the band is smaller them the listed size while the cups are a bit big also the flap that folds down does not fold down far enough and interferes with my little ones feeding the material is stiff and rough and overall it is very uncomfortable not something anyone wants in a nursing bra this is my first time ordering this brand i will not be doing it again,72,114
2971,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am currently nursing our 7 month old son before pregnancy i was a 34d after pregnancy and throughout nursing i have been a 36dd this bra is inexpensive and is sturdy enough to hold my ladys in place,39,115
2972,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this is an awful bra it is too large and too small at the same timeit is so padded that it will not fold down to make enough space for my baby to nurse it pushes my nipple down and outthe bra is cone shaped around the nipplesin addition to all of that the thread on the snap broke before i put it on i had to sew it back on,68,116
2973,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,pointy boobs are not cute this bra makes boobs appear pointy I am so bummed as i was very happy with my other leading lady purchase,25,117
2974,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i usually wear a 38d but ordered a 40d and it was ridiculously tight tighter than any 38 I have ever owned i sent them back,25,118
2975,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,I am a ftm so I am not sure if this is a brand-thing or what but the bra was about a half-cup to a cup size bigger than the other two 34b nursing bras I have gotten I am going to keep it in hopes that maybe I shall swell up large enough to be able to fit into it the bra unclips and only folds halfway down right across the nipple not sure if that is because the inside straps attach to both sides of the cup or not but i see myself having to fight with it in order to pull it out of the way so my kid can nurse the other bras I have bought when unhooked fold all the way down without being attached to the center of the bra on either side so like i said i am a ftm but the design does not seem as practical as other bras I have bought and it runs much much larger than those other bras as well i hope it ends up getting used because ill be sad to just throw away 20,180,119
2976,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,it arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition but while the cup size was too big the band was far too small it could be my particular body however i have been buying that same size in other brands and finding the fit to be just right,49,120
2977,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,perfect amount of padding not like regular nursing bras that are granny like with no support i have 2 of these and alternate wearing them everyday,26,121
2978,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,very uncomfortable and stiff bra the underwire stabs me on the side of my boob,15,122
2979,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very uncomfortable bra did not like the underwire,8,123
2980,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it is fine bra until you use it to nurse then it is awful the flap does not flap down far enough for my baby to get a good latch without holding or folding the flap in such a way that it is out of the way i went off of another experienced mothers review and certainly did not have the same experience that she did this is my third baby to nurse so i know what I am doing and what i like and what works well and i am not a fan of this bra at all,95,124
2981,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i was disappointed with these bras i bought 2 for the great price that they were they felt cheap and i got a c 34 and felt way too tight the wire was digging into my ribs oh well this is what i get from ordering clothing over the internet,50,125
2982,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this was much smaller than i expected i ended up going to a retail store and trying ones on and returning this one,23,126
2983,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,uncomfortable unflattering size was not accurate i returned it as soon as it arrived,14,127
2984,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i purchased the 38d and had to put a bra extender on the clasp because it was too tight i did not want to exchange for a 40 because the cups are always further apart then it now fits nicely and the bra as a whole is very comfortable and gives the support that is needed that the other non wire or padded bras give,65,128
2985,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wires on the sides slid down first wear and dig into / cut rib-cage sides not an ideal nursing bra,18,129
2986,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the wires popped out almost immediately it was all around uncomfortable,11,130
2987,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bars on the outsides of the bra dig into my flesh very uncomfortable it is not a defect either i bought two of these bras and both have the same problem,31,131
2988,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered the same size as all my other nursing bras they are all of varying brands and fit great this particular brand does not fit as well and is actually too big i would recommend buying this bra one size smaller,42,132
2989,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits as expected and gives great shape which is what i was looking for after nursing two for a combined 28 months the padding is very light and definitely not victorias secret type padding but that would be difficult to fold down for easy nursing the padding slightly creases after nursing but goes back to shape after a while the underwire digs / rubs a little under bust but overall I am happy with the purchase,73,133
2990,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i love underwire bras and typically wear them nursing or not but this bras underwire really poked into my breast very painful wore it twice and each time i got clogged ducts where the wire was i bought the right size 36f but the wire was just very tight and uncomfortable,49,134
2991,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i got professionally measured ordered correctly and way way way too big so disappointed,13,135
2992,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was way too small i would have needed to go up at least a band size,18,136
2993,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the fit is okay but very uncomfortable has plastic rods along the side that are sharp and dig into my ribs,21,137
2994,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,runs smalls uncomfortable as with what everyone else says the metal digs into your skin would not recommend,17,138
2995,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,I am supposed to wear 38c but it is too snug 40c was just nice one of the cups were a little pointy but it was not too noticeable when i put it on i barely managed to latch my baby on and the underwire digs into my ribs not painful but not comfortable luckily my baby finishes her drink within 5 - 10 mins or else I shall get a bruise ok for pumping,70,139
2996,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is so uncomfortable it digs into ur skin and is hard to keep folded down so you can nurse your baby it also has a weird shape to the cup of the bra i would not reccommend it to anyone,42,140
2997,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the sizes run too small this bra feels uncomfortable and the opening is not big enough for breasfeeding perhaps only for pumping,22,141
2998,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the material it is great but it does not fit me at all I am normally a b cup but since been pregnant made my breast larger I have been able to use a c cup now this one it is way large on me i love the material that it is made from very soft and stretchy i will change it for a smaller size since it is great quality,64,142
2999,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,how do i send this back cups are big and pointy the sizes are wrong,15,143
3000,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,wire is too stiff digs into my sides and the cups do not fold down well enough for nursing,18,144
3001,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,most uncomfortable nursing bra for me the pad that folds down so you can nurse is thick and stiff making it uncomfortable and not so easy to use i am a 40d and this bra it is way too tight for me wasted my money,44,145
3002,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is little difficult to pull down to nurse like everyone says but my baby is older so it is not a big deal,23,146
3003,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra fits great and actually looks good under clothes the only disappointing thing is that it does not fold down very well for nursing but with a little adjusting it is fine also after wearing it all day the under wires start to dig in i just snipped the sides and pulled them out and now it is one of my favorite bras great support and very smooth look with nursing pads,70,147
3004,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the wife said the wires started poking out immediately in the sides and it was painful to wear,18,148
3005,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable very supportive and hides breast pads well,9,149
3006,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very pointy and not very pretty at all it fits very very tight and i usually wear a 40ddd well i bought a 42 dd and it still fits wayyy too small I am researching on how to return thethis is my 2nd purchase on amazon and i do not like the bra at all,54,150
3007,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,for the price it was a good bra for nursing,10,151
3008,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i like this bra so much that i may wear it even when I am done nursing it offers great support and easy access to the ladies when needed I have shopped around for nursing bras and this one is my favorite,40,152
3009,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great support in the cup sides and back i have been through plenty of nursing bras with two very hungry boys to no avail i pump and feed all the time and this bra stands up to the constant use it not only maintains it is shape and form but it is comfortable i have seriously struggled to find a nursing bra to maintain shape fit in all areas side boob or 4 boob is not a good look and neither is sagging all that is gone with this bra,89,153
3010,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,wire broke first time i wore it and it fit a little small,13,154
3011,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it was just that i expected it is perfect,9,155
3012,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,loved the bra but ordered the wrong size already have two more of the correct size on the way,19,156
3013,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra is soft and not scratchy but the band size does not seem to fit like my other 36s do it is too tight and makes it hard to breathe i have recently purchased other bras in the same size that fit fine this one was just not a good fit,51,157
3014,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is comfortable but for me without wire it is easy for breast,11,158
3015,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,too small does not fold down baby can not get good latch waist of money in my opinion,16,159
3016,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,a little off on size if you ask me,9,160
3017,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,not the right bra for me just did not like it at all so it went back,16,161
3018,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,the band runs small order one size up great full coverage no boob spillage awesome for an 18 nursing bra and I have had many nursing 3 kids over the last 4 years and still going holds the girls up high unlike other nursing bras I have had,46,162
3019,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i purchased this bra in a size larger than i normally wear and it was way too small the top also gave the impression of unattractive torpedo boobs not something i enjoyed i will be returning this today,38,163
3020,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i have now bought 5 of these bras i searched high and low for a supportive nursing bra with my first baby and never found one i can not go without underwire and finding an underwire nursing bra is really hard i took a gamble on this one and it paid off it is very supportive and comfortable to wear if often forget to hook it back after nursing and realize it much later that is a testament as to how supportive it is i am normally a 36c when not nursing but found this bra in a 36 dd fit best,100,164
3021,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,so i like the bra and the fact that it is smooth and cupped nothing worse than the perfect circle you can see through your shirt from your breast pads right i would definately have to say that it runs a little bit small for sure although i am usually a 34 around and i am smaller now than i was when i got pregnant however the bra is definately running on the snug side in the band width so go up maybe 2 sizes the return process is pretty easy if you need to send something back although,99,165
3022,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra does not have a good fit will not be able to wear this ever again it is very uncomfortable it also shows at the top of your dress or top,32,166
3023,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra fit me perfectly and is comfortable it did have a rubbery smell but that did not bother me,20,167
3024,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,the size seemed a little small but it will stretch with time i think great bra overall will serve it is purpose,21,168
3025,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love this brought it is so comfortable and it is so easy to nurse in i have nursed five children and i always buy this bra,27,169
3026,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra fit very well it gives good coverage and gives me a nice shape it is a little bulky when nursing but not uncomfortable,24,170
3027,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,bras in my size 38dd are sooo expensive this bra was about 15 bucks and fits and feels great i bought 2 of them this was the second one because i liked it so much,35,171
3028,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this nursing bra works well for me i am exclusively pumping and larger chested so it provides adequate access and support i wish they had a 36 ddd but since they do not i am making the 38 dd work,39,172
3029,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i like the shape that the bra gives my bust and i like the overall look of the bra however i hate the cups they are impossible to pump in and they do not fold down far enough to give my baby easy access i will keep it to wear when i want to look nice but do not plan on nursing much i would not recommend this bra,67,173
3030,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra might have been nice if i was able to use it 36 d is the smallest I have found rib size i find that 36 is still too large around the ribs but the cups fit i was excited to find an inexpensive bra with 34 size unfortunately this bra fit way too tightly more like a 32 plus as other reviews reported it does not fold down very far for nursing it might work for pumping only maybe it will fit better after some baby weight starts to drop off being that it has only been a few weeks,101,174
3031,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was extremely loose where the nipple is so it looks weird so i returned it because i would not wear it,23,175
3032,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i was a lil skeptic about buying my size online but it fits perfectly i would recommend the product to others,21,176
3033,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,band was a little small cups were a little large i do not see how i could have b-fed wearing it as the other reviews stated you could no pull down the front and get it out of the way of little ones face had to return unfortunately will have to spring for the more expensive ones,56,177
3034,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,' even if you are full with milk the cups are way larger than expected they dent in and do not stay out the material is so bad it is like the equivalent of memory foam so when it dent in it stays that way until you push out the cup again which is embarrassing no one wants a dented in chest look take the cup size down a notch when ordering this one also this tends to cut off my supply 10 fold with the underwire so if you really need an underwire try this but I had go down a cup size for sure,103,178
3035,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,after nursing for 11 months and beginning the process of weaning i was looking for a bra that had a little bit more support and an underwire as i am a larger chested girl this bra is very comfortable the straps do not dig into the shoulders on the 38 dd there are four hook-and-eye in the back some people have said that it is hard with the way the cups flip down but that has not been an issue for me again this is a very comfortable bra I am very happy with my purchase i bought one in nude and one in black exactly the same fit,105,179
3036,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am a 34 dd and it was so hard to find a nursing bra in that size for a good price it holds my breasts up so well i forgot what it felt like great product,37,180
3037,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i own more of these but apparently the girls are much bigger than i accounted for but otherwise these are great bras,21,181
3038,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup size is too big and the band size is too small the molding of the cup makes your boobs look pointy,23,182
3039,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,band size was smaller and tight cups were tight too hard to nurse in as well disappointed and hurting by the end of the day,25,183
3040,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this is a size bigger than i actually wear could barely get it around me i was looking forward to having a wired bra this just did not work for me also it seemed like pulling the cups down would have been in the way for nursing,46,184
3041,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i read so many reviews and had high hopes for this nursing bra i was willing to overlook the cups not folding down well but the boning in the sides is absolutely painful i ended up cutting out the boning but bra is still not comfortable would not recommend,48,185
3042,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,got the bra and it was way too small i recommend getting an extra size bigger than what you normally would get,22,186
3043,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i discovered this bra at walmart and they only carried it in nudei bought it and loved it so much i wanted to have another one in black walmart did not carry it so i found it here on amazon the black bra did not fit the same way as the nude bra at first the strap that went around my torso felt stiff fit too snug and also curled under and dug into my skin even although it hurt i put up with this for days until it was time to wash it that did the trick once washed it felt so soft fit perfect and i never felt uncomfortable again,112,187
3044,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,very awkwardly made the cup size is giant and the straps are super wide would be completely impossible to wear with a tank top very disappointing,26,188
3045,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very comfortable very soft and great fit is the second time I have purchased them is my favorite nursing bra and I have bought a quite a few,26,189
3046,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,wanted to like this nursing bra for the price but the fit is just awful the underwire comes up so high in between the cups that you can only flip the cup down half way right to the middle of your nipple and because the cup material is not stretchy there has not much you can do about it obviously this is not at all conducive to being able to breastfeed or even pump the cup itself in the size i ordered 34dd was too small as well so that the underwire would not even sit down flat on my torso returned this bra the very next day,105,190
3047,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is seriously the best nursing bra out there i nursed twins to 11 months and it is the most supportive bra nicely shaped easy to snap on and off looks great under clothing i bought 2 of these and am so glad i did,45,191
3048,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,everything seems well made and i like the style i usually wear victorias secret bras and this bra is larger than their sizing so it does not fit great hopefully it will be perfect when my milk comes in,39,192
3049,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is difficult to size yourself for an appropriate fit after the baby comes so sizing issues are not really applicable needed to break in a bit but otherwise nice underwire support,32,193
3050,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,first the band size runs small you should go up a size if you decide to order this product I am normally a 36 - 38 and the 38 felt incredibly tight and uncomfortable second the material is stiff and scratchy it is akin to wearing sandpaper on already chafed nipples i do not recommend this torture device let us face it we are breastfeeding we are sleep deprived the last thing we need is to star as a leading lady in his horror save yourself some grief and pay more for the bravada bra i had to learn the hard way i hope you will not have to now if you will excuse me i need to attend to my nipples,116,194
3051,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i got this for my daughter and she did not complain she said it fit comfortably she said it will do the job,23,195
3052,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,thai was somewhat large for me but that is how full coverage can be for me so that is not why i gave it 2 stars it got two stars because i could not return them if you are not sure of your size do not buy them,44,196
3053,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am seriously so upset about this bra the cup size would be fine but the overall width is clearly too small and I am not talking just a bit snug I am talking it is the right size but will not stretch half way around my back i can only imagine that there was some serious mistake made when they were putting this together because there is no way that anyone would be happy with a bra that fits this badly,78,197
3054,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,impossibly this bra is both too large and too small at the same time while the straps barely fit over your shoulders the size of the cups and the width of the band are larger than life the sheer volume of material used is daunting I am not a large person but wear a 34d in motherhood nursing bras which may not be the highest quality but at least do not cover your entire torso seriously ladies you can tuck this thing into your jeans and it will still rest just below your chin hence the spartan breastplate reference do not buy this,101,198
3055,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,did not realize that it was going to be a little on the small size maybe if i loss weight it will fit,22,199
3056,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,my wife needed something comfortable during our last pregnancy she would recommend this bra it was a perfect fit and gives good support,23,200
3057,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great value after wearing the first one i bought two more the cup size runs a little small but the shape is great I am in36ddd the full inner sling is a must-have for nursing moms with larger breasts i can bend over again highly recommended,45,201
3058,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,good shaping separation and support comparable to much more expensive padded nursing bras underwire is still comfortable after six hours of wear,23,202
3059,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,as a well-endowed woman for much of my life i have really struggled to find affordable bras in my size unfortunately this one was a diappointment fits like a 34dd on the largest band setting,35,203
3060,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,a pretty good bra just fit a little too snug but overall it is great and other than being snug fits just right,22,204
3061,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the fit is great and it actually has full coverage gilligan omalley nursing bras from target call thier nursing bra a full coverage bra but my nursing breasts always fell out of the cup to the point that i could not wear the bra without wearing a cami to hold myself together this bra is great i feel fully supported and the 3-hook design really adds to making the bra feel very secure this is a fabulous nursing bra for a very reasonable price,84,205
3062,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it is comfortable it does not come down as far as i would like it to when I am nursing but overall it is a good fit,23,206
3063,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,1 great value 2 comfortable but had to order one size bigger in both strap and cup i looked at a ton of nursing bras online and in the stores this one had all the features i was looking for full coverage underwire straps adjust from the front and double sided attachment where the cup folds down i originally ordered the 38d because that is what all my other bras are and i measured myself to double check i wore it for a few weeks and decided it was just too small there was no cleavage separation and the band was leaving an imprint by the end of the day so i ordered the 40dd much better fit and fine for daily wear i have been wearing this one daily to work for a few weeks now and i am perfectly happy looks good under my clothes but if i wear my thicker reusable nursing pads you can sometimes see the outline no issue with disposable pads,167,207
3064,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the flap will not go down far enough while nursing and not comfortable very disappointed since that is main purpose of the bra,23,208
3065,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,ended up returning not a good bra did not fit right size was off and was uncomfortable cups felt like cardboard would not recommend,22,209
3066,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i got this bra in the mail and was really excited to try it on i got my typical size of a 34b and the band was way too small it barely clasped in the back and the cups were really big also i do not recommend getting a nursing bra with underwire it does not fold down very efficiently and is just overall awkward,64,210
3067,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,fits well thank you i am using a nursing bra for the first time it is a little hard to get used to,22,211
3068,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the band runs small and the cups run big when the bra is unhooked to nurse the cup does not fold down enough so it is difficult to nurse in terrible bra,31,212
3069,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i returned this bra the cups are pointed and do not fit right it is impossible to breastfeed because the flaps only come down half way,24,213
3070,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,feels like it runs a size smaller then it is supposed to be if i had known i would not have bought looks like great material,25,214
3071,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i was disappointed this was not even close to true size i was afraid to order the next size up for fear it would not fit either also the material is very rough,31,215
3072,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i loved this nursing bra it held up great and i washed well i would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality nursing bra,26,216
3073,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i had another bra from leading lady and hoped this one would be just as nice even although it was a different model the bra fit much tighter than the one i had even although they are the same size i also wore it only twice and the top strap broke off the plastic ring snapped i am really disappointed,60,217
3074,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,was a nice quality and function but the circumference at the ribs was much too small for a 34 even on loosest hook,23,218
3075,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i bought this because of the good reviews but found it to be a bad choice this bra squeaked when i moved my arms and was very uncomfortable the strap snapped when i was on a walk with my friend and was not able to be fixed i would not by this bra again,54,219
3076,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i ordered this bra because it was one of the few i could find in a 34d however the cup size was very odd plus the underwires came up so high that it was nearly impossible to breastfeed in i have another underwire nursing bra that is not this way and had hoped this one would work out not for me,61,220
3077,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this was by far the best fitting under-wire nursing bra i have tried 4 brackets in the back for closure,20,221
3078,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra may be better for longer waist larger bust it fits awful on me short waist 32c the cups do not fold down enough to nurse making the bra useless I am wondering why a good nursing bra is so hard to find,43,222
3079,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is great for a heavy chestedlike me keeps the girls where they belong even when my daughter goes awhile between feedings the boning in the sides hurt me but i simply removed it and have loved this bra ever since,44,223
3080,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,it is way to tight i could barely get one clasp done i normally wear a 36 but opted to go a size bigger also the straps did not seem to have a lot of adjustment in it,37,224
3081,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,very firm padding even after a wash it has not sagged like other nursing bras i had purchased a bit tight for me it maybe i selected the wrong size otherwise it is worth the purchase,35,225
3082,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,nursing bras were not comfortable but i have to say this one surprised me with the comfort it provided and support,21,226
3083,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,first time wearing this and the underwire is poking me on the side already very disappointed will have to cut it out,22,227
3084,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,this bra was smaller than the expected size but then also had a weird pucker in the middle of both cups that stuck out too far,26,228
3085,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra is very stiff and uncomfortable it did not size to what size bra i normally get cup size was fine but the size around runs small,28,229
3086,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this product fits well and is very comfortable it is easy to manipulate and it is very sturdy with repeated washings,21,230
3087,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i am normally a size 38 ddd but 2 sizes bigger when nursing i got the largest size which was my normal size which worked out alright it started falling apart the 4 t h time being worn i only wore it for 3 or 4 hour long stretches for church the foam padding was showing because of the stitches coming undone if it had stayed together i would of bought more as it makes me look good and feel good it was hard to get my breast out to nurse and difficult to clasp together,95,231
3088,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this is a heavy-duty bra that gives good support and a nice shape i said somewhat small for the fit but i do not mean the cups those i find true to size i do find that the frame of it is narrower than i like meaning i guess the space between the cups the motherhood maternity bras work better there for me as others have said the cups are stiff also because the inner support the part that remains when you fold the cup down encircles the breast i just find it a bit harder to get everything where i need it even for pumping but it is doable not my first choice for nursing but it is a good bra if you will be pumping finally this is a pretty old school bra in terms of coverage so you will not want to wear low necklines with it,147,232
3089,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,very supportive bra keeps the girls from sagging padded cups provide modesty for overly sensitive nipples i wear this to work when I shall be pumping the padded cups do make nursing the baby a little more complicated but still doable definitely the best nursing bra I have tried for work and outings complicated,52,233
3090,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i tried this bra on when it first got here and it felt fantastic i finally had the support i was wishing for when i purchased it i would have loved everything about it but it made my chest look super pointy if you do not mind having the pointy my breasts are looking at the sky look then this is the bra for you it has everything you could want in a nursing bra really good support i was able to return it for free with no hassle if you do not like this one but are desperate for a good bra look into the bali womens concealers back smoothing underwire bra i purchased it next and although it is not for nursing it was only 13 and an absolute dream come true,130,234
3091,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra feels so stiff when nursing it dosent fold down easily so it is uncomfortable for mom and baby i would not buy this one again,26,235
3092,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first child and she really liked it the quality seemed to be really nice and the price was really affordable compared to other nursing bras hopefully this will work well for her,42,236
3093,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,horrible bra do not buy the wires popped out during the first wear tight and uncomfortable hard to unclasp wish i could go back in time and buy another rebecca,30,237
3094,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,broke before i could wear it i threw it away not realizing i could send it back very unsatisfied,20,238
3095,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,a good product that fits well it is a little bit tight at the back i will recommend it,20,239

3097,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this is the best nursing bra on the market i love the fit the quality the underwire and the durability this bra is comfortable and holds up well through the day,31,241
3098,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i took a gamble on the size and i got it right however the way this bra is constructed it gives you pointy cone boobs that will appear under your clothing i am returning it in exchange for the bravado silk seamless nursing bra which is super comfortable and has sufficient padding to cover my lady bits but looks natural,60,242
3099,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,I am very happy with this nursing bra it is very supporting and it fits as expected to my normal bra size i would buy again,25,243
3100,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i like the design of the bra it lifts but my boobs spill out on the size and the fabric is stiff it does not stretch,26,244
3101,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i am rating this 5 out of 5 because shipping was fast and on time also because the product fit good and was comfortable i would recommend this for anyone looking for a good nursing bra it is very supportive without pinching,42,245
3102,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought this bra because now i will be a mother in october and as soon as i arrived i experienced it is firm comfortable her breasts are firm feel good was not left was on the measure,38,246
3103,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i really liked the shape and fit of this bra unfortunately the nursing snap piece broke in half when i was unlatching it i had used the bra twice i tried to superglue it back together but to no avail disappointing,41,247
3104,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,fits awkwardly the part where the cups clip comes way up high almost to my collar bone also pinches under my arms,22,248
3105,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,i am size 34 pre-pregnancy my nursing bras are size 36 and they fit right this bra fits a little bit tight it does not feel like it is size 36 but it is okay the cup size is a bit big but over all it works serves it is purpose to give me support,51,249
3106,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,i am incredibly disappointed in this bra i wore it once and it was awful there was a plastic piece sticking out on the right side that dug into me the entire day i would have complained and asked for my money back but they will not do that unless you send the product back well i have a newborn so it is not easy to get out so they win they have my money and i had to throw the bra out i went to target and bought one that is much more comfortable,93,250
3107,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,it s just iike i expect it is a great protection foor my wife and very confortable the desing is just what she expect,23,251
3108,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,make sure that you get fitted properly by a professional after giving birth otherwise you will be waisting time and money,20,252
3109,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the bra does not fold down enough to allow for nursing immediately returned it i do not recommend this bra,20,253
3110,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,this bra fits like a tanker it is very stiff heavy and uncomfortable i wish i had not taken the tags off before i tried on usually i can buy a 34d without trying on i prefer the motherhood brand of nursing bras they are light weight and true to size i just wanted the convenience of amazon to deliver a nursing bra but this did not work out,69,254
3111,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,the size is completely off and it is too thick so in summer time you will be sweating i did not like it at all,24,255
3112,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,these are great nursing bras with lots of support especially if you are a larger breasted woman they also run true to size,23,256
3113,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,so I have bought at least 8 nursing bras in the 7 months since I have had my son this one is my favorite so far i have rather large breast and it provides good support and shape but is still comfortable it lost a star just because it is full coverage and i can not wear with some tops,56,257
3114,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i have had a hard time finding a nursing bra with underwire for bigger busts and this one is perfect i have two of them and they are the only ones i will wear it seems a little tight at first but does loosen up some as it is worn a bit which was perfect because it seemed a little small for the size i needed when the outer cups pop down the inner holsters around the breast are complete rather than just one sided and are great for nursing only downfall of this set up is it is not particularly easy to get your breast back into the cup with one hand in any position that looks even slightly normal a little awkward for nursing in public but can be done overall i love it and recommend it edit and star change after years of using these bras exclusively something changed i do not know if they changed manufacturers or what but the new bras I have ordered this year have been horrible they are tight in weird places the cups do not hold they dig and are insanely stiff i no longer recommend this product,192,258
3115,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,the cup folds down right at nipple level so this may work for pumping but it is terrible for breastfeeding because the baby can not get a latch on anything more than the nipple it teaches a bad latch in my opinion I am keeping it only for pumping,46,259
3116,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,tried it on and there were weird dimples in the middle of the cups openings for nursing the cup and band size seemed to be correct for me but the bra cups were just terrible i returned this immediately and would not recommend this product to anyone unless you like looking like you have deflated boobs,56,260
3117,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,been having a hard time finding a nursing bra that gave me good support and made my boobs look normal I am a dd and almost an e and most nursing bras are horribly unsupportive i bought this based on the reviews i like it gives good support comfortable and a nice shape closet thing to a normal bra that i have found it has molded cups so it hides the nursing pads well the snaps are good an sturdy so far it is been a great bra and reasonably priced I have always worn underwire bras as have never found a bra without underwires that gave me support it is a great bra for daytime under your normal clothes the only thing that is kind of annoying is the molded cups while i like them for hiding nursing pads and such it is a bit annoying to have to push the molded cup down out of the way to nurse or pump that is the reason i have 4 stars and not 5 other than that definitely worth the purchase fits pretty true to size,181,261
3118,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra has a great shape that stays it fits great and i would recommend this for any nursing mother i will buy this again,25,262
3119,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,overall the bra fits great and allows for great mobility i love the support of the inside the design is especially great for larger chested women,26,263
3120,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,the perfect nursing bra for out of the house i have other sleeping nursing bras but i would not wear them out of the house this one looks and feels just like a regular bra only with great quick nursing access,40,264
3121,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,it fits well but the wire is poking out I have been washin it on delicate that is the only dissapoint as i was hoping that this bra would last the last three months of nursing,35,265
3122,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,this bra is perfect and comfortable this is the second one and i love them both perfect for nursing and durable,21,266
3123,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,1.0,negative,maybe it is just me-but this bra is not only the most uncomfortable bra ever it is not true to size and I have been around the block or two when it comes to nursing bras and regular bras and not ergonomically designed what so ever,43,267
3124,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,first i have to say that this is comfortable moreso than i was expecting from an underwire and it does have great support I am currently an e / f cup and i was definitely pleased with the support however the cups are a little on the thin side and so it does not exactly hide nursing nipples not great for under fitted t-shirts but it works great with thicker shirts,67,268
3125,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i bought these in 42dd i normally wear 40 f / ddd and it fit okay and worked okay and the underwires did not poke me or come out it was supportive enough for full breasts and i nursed my babe for 18 mos using this bra rotating every week with 2 other bras of course,53,269
3126,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,2.0,negative,i bought this bra based on it is good reviews i bought it just a little over a month ago it is true to size and i found it to be very comfortable my problem with it is that it is ripping and fraying just after a month of wearing it i am very disappointed in the poor quality of the bra,60,270
3127,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,great fit true to size gives great support comfy one hand clip works perfectly fine will definitely buy another after looping months of trying to find the perfect bra for nursing,31,271
3128,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i went to victoria secret and had them measure me so i knew my size then i ordered this bra it gives good support so you look nice and opens easily for it is job the cups have retained their shape over time as well better than the bras i bought at motherhood and jc penny in the past,58,272
3129,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i really like this product and i would recomend everyone to get this it is great good and efficient product,20,273
3130,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,4.0,positive,this bra is great i am very glad i made this purchase i am rather large and this bra gives great support it does have an underwire but i have not noticed it affecting my milk production at all i used the sizing suggestions given by others and it fits perfectly the only problem with it that i have had is that after only about a month the underwire started popping out of the bra so i had to sew it back in place other than that i must say that i really do love this bra and would highly recommend it,101,274
3131,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,i love this bra i was searching high and wide for a nice neutral t shirt nursing bra that gave good support and was high enough on the middle and sides to contain my breasts i am a 34d and it can be hard to find a decent full coverage nursing bra that lifts and seperates my breasts that seem to be made ofthese days this bra really does the trick it is extremely supportive without looking so the underwire and the inner sling that resembles a triangle with an opening for your areola really keeps your breasts in place and that is with running around a bending over to pick up after a 4 year old all day even with it being so supportive the straps are not ugly and thick and the bra looks normal it is also really cheap yet made well the snap is easily undone with one hand it is so comfortable that i literally slept in it the first night i got it and wore it the entire next day-and it left no red marks or chafing in any areas most bras always irritate me at night highly reccommend,193,275
3152,Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i am a musician i found these speakers to be very limited in range i bought them because of the raving reviews by customers they are very high ended lacking in mid-range and have no low end sound,39,0
3153,Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,wow these babies are smaller than i imagined i put them in a cd bag with 10 cds my mp3 player and still had room stereo in a pack the speakers are crisp and the surround sound is phenomenal give me more of this for my travel lifestyle thanks,49,1
3154,Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,for 20 these are very impressive little speakers they look a lot chaper than they sound the cardboard-like grill did not impress me but give them a chance they impressed me a lot once i truned them on and i am an audiophile the mid bass and the highs are much cleaner than i expected there is no deep bass but i expected that also the surround effect is nice especially when you have the spakers placed on your work table at near-ear level great for travel as they are very compact however if you want pounding bass you should maybe look into a subwoofer design but then again those will not be so compact and inexpensive good job sonic,121,2
3155,Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,just spent the last month checking the internet for portable speakers to take on vacation i wanted something as small as possible good sound and a modest price when i first saw the price of the si-5 i thought they can not sound very good for that price but after reading all the reviews on amazoncom and a few other sites i decided to purchase these if they turned out not so great sounding i could return them and start my quest all over again i bought them this past saturday at bestbuy and hooked them up almost immediately to my sony md walkman all i can say is what a surprise i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for compactness good sound and an incredibly great price in travel speakers i only regret not waiting another day because circuit city here had them on sale for 1799 and i also had a 500 off coupon which would have brought the price down to 1299 that would have been an even more incredible bargain for what you are getting for the little bit of money being spent,187,3
3156,Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,these speakers are well designed and give a good but not great sound highs are bright and crisp but slightly wobbly midrange is fine and bass is present but somewhat weak sounds best at moderate volume one of the key things for me is portability and here is where this system shines the speaker / amp package is great for travel or just toting about town to start with it is very light the form is also also thoughtfully designed the two speakers clip togeather to form a package slightly thicker than a standard cd jewel case this also protects the papery speaker fabric the tiny amp is sculpted so that it fits your hand and the wires are plugged at poth ends and detachable be sure to have a clip or rubberband around to keep the wires together after you dissassemble i can not belive how inexpensive it is you will not be sorry if you buy this but even if by some odd chance you were it is not much dough out of your pocket,173,4
3157,Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,i bought these to use with my ipod i just could not see spending the 100 - 150 for the high end altec lansing and creativ speaker units especially given the fact that reviews seem to be love em or hate em for those models as well i quite like these speakers the sound quality is good and reasonably full with jazz classical or rock music true given the rather limited output these would not be suitable for a display at a convention or a raging party but they are perfect for a hotel room quiet dorm or office yes there are three wires 2 for the speakers the other from the music source ipod mp3 but the advantage is that you can space the speakers farther apart then with other speakers I have seen the unit does not come with a power adaptor but has an input for one which can be purchased on the manufacturers website [ ] otherwise it uses 4 aaa batteries,161,5
3158,Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i read mixed reviews so i rolled theand bought these absolute garbage in their little bag they are 3 thick they sound very quiet no bass expected and no mid-range not expected the front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet they certainly are 360 degree speakers they sound equally bad from all directions even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables my original comment to my wife was twenty bucks how can i go wrong well my answer now is i could have still had my 20 now i just have to find someone to give them to as they are not worth the space they take up i know you get what you pay for but if that was the case here then should have been on sale for half off at the 99 cent store,144,6
3159,Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i got this for my frequent backpacking trips with my buddies and the quality of these speakers blew everyone including myself away every time i turn this on i still get amaze with how some 4 oz speakers could sound so rich and loud relative to it is size and weight if you are a outdoor freak and weight on your back is away an issue go for this and prepare to amaze your friends when they hear a live concerto streaming out from inside your tent total weight with batteries 1 pound 4 oz carry it on my 38 pound bag not an issue battery-share with my walkie eating real food and listening to a live concert while your friends are having problem trying to start a fire to cook instant noodle priceless,137,7
3160,Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,when you look at their size they are the size of a cd jewel case you would think they can not be that good but these speakers are great the sound is awesome of course you would not expect a great sound in a large room but for a small office or bedroom they are fantastic the only problem is the unit which connects the 2 speakers this contains the on switch and batteries if you forget to shut the switch off you drain your batteries rather quickly and it is easy to do this at first otherwise the speakers are great and quite portable,103,8
3161,Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,i bought these speakers to take on vacations with my mp3 player and they actually have pretty good sound for their size however after only two uses one of the speakers lost it is sound unless you press on the face of it i would suggest buying any other speakers but these,51,9
3162,Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers are the worst that i have ever come across and broke down a week after i got them the sound is decent in the beginning but nothing around above average standards no way i would ever recommend any one buy one of these just are not worth the dough looks decent but that is where the good stuff ends,59,10
3163,Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,these speakers are the best the best for your money the best for sound quality and the best for dvd portable players if you are looking for bass spend more money and get good advice as to what you need for what you are buying for thoughs who under rate these speakers go get a job and put your sound system in the garbage,62,11
3164,Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,i bought these speakers to use with my toshiba satelite 2805-s402 laptop unfortunately i found that these speakers were not a significant improvement over my laptop speakers they are very small and they snap together handily making them great for traveling but i would only buy them for use with a discman mp3 player or something similar that has no speaker function,62,12
3165,Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,yes these are small and light now the bad news the separate amplifier and all the wires going everywhere makes the connected assembly look like a science lab project especially if you opt for the usb power connector yes the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my ibm thinkpad but not nearly as good as your typical 19 desktop computer speakers the problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange bass is nonexistent it is like listening to a pair of big tweeters the enthusiastic reviews are a mystery to me,100,13
3166,Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,i enjoy watching dvds on my laptop but lugging my desktop speakers in a bag did not appeal to me now i literally slip these speakers into my laptop cases outer pocket and I am on my way they snap together and are one and a half inches at their thickest i show off these speakers every chance i get and the reaction is always one of amazement now while they are not the equal of my desktop speakers they are 25 times better than my laptop the surround sound effect makes a real difference when heard for the very first time while a bit pricey for most people if you own a portable dvd player or a laptop you will increase the value of your product and your audio-visual experience many times over i also use them with my mini disc unit in new york city where things have to be just a little bit louder to be heard these speakers impress,150,14
3167,Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,easily the best portable speakers out there and probably the only portable speakers that are not more then glorified headphones the sound is rich and full although the bass will hardly rattle your teeth the speakers are incrediably compact about the size of a double cd jewel case the i-mac-esquescheme is an aquired taste am i the only one that misses the days when computers and electronics only came in black silver and putty for a pair of speakers to throw in with your laptop mp3 player or portable cd player there has nothing better pros superior sound very compact easy to set up fairly long battery life cons [ light ] plasic and cardboard construction somewhat pricy weak bass questionable looks seperate amplifier this is a very good effort and i hope sonic impact tries again make it with heavier plastic integrate the amplifier into one or both of the speakers raise the bass a tad bundle it with a compact dc adapter or better yet a usb power option and lower the price into the sub-50 dollar range and this would be a breakthrough product,194,15
3168,Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,the unit works well after sorting through all the wires thefrom the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity the biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling also the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and i found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss a neat gadget for the price sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness,81,16
3169,Electronics,B00005LOIP,1.0,negative,these speakers would have been a perfect compliment to my portable dvd player due to their size and portability however the volumn was minimal even after purchasing new batteries these speakers were beautiful in appearance but wiring could be more substantial speakers should be shipped with dc power supply to improve performance,52,17
3466,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,i bought this for my grandson to watch dvds and tapes and it still works great he has only 4 so i do not imagine he is very gentle with it the people that are not satisfied expected more out of a low priced unit i bought the cheapest unit i could find and for the money it does exactly what i expected it to do it has great sound great picture and is easy to use and set up,78,0
3467,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i bought two of these units exactly one week apart i liked the first one so much i bought a second one for the family room 6 months later almost to the day the dvd drive on the first unit stopped working i had to take the thing apart to extract the trapped dvd one week later on the second unit thetray began seeing a tape even although none was loaded which meant i could nota real tape so 6 months after buying two combo units i now have one dvd player and one vcr,98,1
3468,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,as advertised works fine shipping was inexpensive but took forever,10,2
3469,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,thewas cleaned and pulled apart and had hair and discs stuck inside the product not as was described,20,3
3470,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was replacing the same unit i had for 15 years already the new one was used and worked just fine arrived as promised by vendor matt larue,28,4
3471,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,press a button or use the remote flip back and forth betweenplayer and dvd easy hookquick and fast loading looks nice front aux port if your lazy just a great buy,36,5
3472,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,this is a good combo player and have used it to record and watch movies both it works very well and i would highly recommend it if you like movies and also has the vcr recorder / player so for any of you with the older movies you will be able to watch also i love it and sure you will too,59,6
3473,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,i recieved a product from chicagadgets that was defective i ordered a refurbished toshiba dvd / vcr and when i tried to set it up in my tv system it was nonfunctional i happen to have had the exact same toshiba dvd / vcr and i was trying to replace that older dvd / vcr with the refurbished one they sent from chicagogadgets i reinserted my older dvd / vcr back into my tv system and it worked fine chicagogadgets would not replace the defective product they sent me you have only 15 days to return their products and they charge a reshelfing fee of 15 chicagogadgets should test their products before they send them out to make sure they function properly,114,7
3474,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i was looking for a second vcr / dvd for an extra tv we have and chose this unit as it seemed to have good divx support which i was interested in playing with well the divx support has turned out to be rock-solid playing everything I have thrown at it in countless formats burned on dvd-r cd-rw and cd-r it is never failed to decode a file I have moved the unit to our video room and we have been enjoying it ever since it is true the quality of playback of the vcr is not great but it is good enough for my childs videos in addition the remote is not too fancy but the unit has excellent controls accessible from the remote for controlling things like picture size jpeg playback and more,125,8
3475,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,we have been very pleased with our purchase i found reading the previous reviews to be accurate and very helpful very easy to hook-up will work on old television sets dvd andwork wellis more noisy when rewinding we bought this for our children to watch movies and just use the most basic features so it has suited our needs well if looking for all bells and whistles would probably choose higher end model but if looking to stay simple and basic i would choose this model,90,9
3476,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,1.0,negative,after less than a year of limited use the picture changes fromto black and white the problem occurs intermittently and it is completely random i did not purchase an extended warranty plan because for something less than 100 it seemed silly but after limited use for something like this to happen just screams out junk to me,59,10
3477,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,i really have not had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product for me it was somewhat difficult to set up however i have always had problems setting up vcrs throughout my vcr buying history after consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear the unit appears to work very nicely once you understand the total setup it is quite easy and simple to operate i gave this a 4 star rating because i believe this vcr / dvd combo will do just fine the only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching for the price however i can live with that,116,11
3478,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,i bought this product to replace my old sony slv-d300p dvd / vcr combo thinking that it would be more compatible with my toshiba tv than the sony this was not the case as the remote that comes with this dvd / vcr combo does not control the tv at all there is no way to program the remote to control anything other than the dvd / vcr player if you buy this product be ready to use your tv remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote in addition the user interface of the player is horrible much worse than my old sony i returned this the day after i bought it and exchanged it for the sony slv-d370p which includes a remote to control the tv and has a great user interface i gave this 2 stars because for the few minutes i used it the audio / video quality was fine and the product has divx playback compatibility which was one of the reasons i bought it in the first place,171,12
3479,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,5.0,positive,great product and well worth the price if you hook up the component video outlet your dvds look almost like hd,21,13
3480,Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,the vcr was broke after 1 week of owning it the company did replace it and i did not have to pat for shipping it back,25,14
3839,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,5.0,positive,not cheap but it is tasty so i like it and keep ordering this one,14,0
3840,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,i took a chance on these considering the mixed reviews and found the grapes to be a solid product yes they are a bit more tart than some green grapes but i personally enjoy a grape that is not completely sweet i would have given it the highest rating except that about a third of the grapes were borderline miniature in my particular package regardless of taste i prefer them to be large and plump i queued them up for purchase again in my amazon fresh cart and will likely make my ultimate determination based on the two orders increasing my sample size,103,1
3841,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,i ordered the organic and the regular green seedless grapes to compare for my own curiosity the organic were way more flavorful and i would not have considered them at all tart as stated in another review and I am guessing it may be the time of year and these were more in the peak of the season but for sure the organic were full of flavor and firm,68,2
3842,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,i like tart but these are too tart no one will eat them threw them outside for the birds,19,3
3843,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,5.0,positive,these were great for the price sweetest green organic grapes I have had and I have bought others in retail stores,19,4
3844,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,5.0,positive,if you have never eaten a grape in your life then i highly recommend that you do it was a life changing spiritual experience for me and I am sure it will be for you my fourth eye nope not third eye was pried open immediately after eating just one of these delicious grapes you can only imagine how much insight i had on the nature of human life and it is purpose after eating an entire bowl of them that is just what grapes do specifically green grapes please do not ask about red purple or black grapes zen master reviewer seattle has no business with such unenlightened talk excuse me while i go live with a group of monks in lhasa for the next five years to share these delicious grapes with them namaste,133,5
3845,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,dry i can not eat them kids spat them out so out to the birds they go waste of money,19,6
3846,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,i like it but wish it was less expensive,9,7
3847,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,2.0,negative,the first time i ordered them they were good flavorful grapes my second order i received tasteless grape that i ended up throwing away not sure if i want to try ordering again,33,8
3848,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,5.0,positive,sweet and crunchy grapes what more could you ask for,10,9
3849,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,2.0,negative,these were really tasteless i bought them because they were actually cheaper than the regular grapes but it was not worth it they are a lot firmer than regular grapes so i wonder if they are just unripe i do not think i know what an unripe grape looks like anyway i do not recommend it is a waste of your money,57,10
3850,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,4.0,positive,very good very sweet but i may have received the wrong ones since it has tons of seeds either way tasted good,22,11
3851,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,2.0,negative,these were huge and crispy but had absolutely no flavor,10,12
3852,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,organic green seedless grapes 2 lb came with moldy produce,13,13
3853,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,2.0,negative,arrived clean in good shape healthy looking unfortunately they taste like water,12,14
3854,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,i have been buying a lot of grapes lately every week so in trying amazon fresh for the first time i ordered 3 of these apporximately 16 of my 50 order so these were a big deal to me they initially looked really good big round plump juicy however i discovered a majority of them had huge black spots on them then in eating them i found the flavor to range from tasteless to dirt and yes i washed them well i can hardly bring myself to eat them and think it was a horrible waste of money i am canceling amazon fresh extremely disappointed,105,15
3855,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,5.0,positive,great deal for organic grapes will purchase again next week,10,16
3856,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000RGZNAO,1.0,negative,there were spider webs and a bug in this package nope,11,17
3901,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,4.0,positive,i am on the ideal protein diet and there are not too many things outside of the program that i can eat walden farm products are hit or miss and this is a hit it is a delicious addition to the veggies that i must eat everyday i can have as much of this as i want 0 carbs/0 sugar/0 fat/0 calories/0 gluten/0 carbs this is awesome on celery and a lifesaver in a world my world where there is no flavor,83,0
3902,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,4.0,positive,do not expect real ranch but i would use this over the ranch dressing anyday but just add a splash of water i would cheat a bit and add 2 tbsp of low-fat buttermilk with 2 tbsp of the ranch dip and boom good ranch dressing,45,1
3903,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,4.0,positive,i am now searching all over for walden farms products and i have had good and bad experiences the salad dressings and dips so far have been good but the sweeter products choc dip marshmallow dips are awful this bacon dip is nice good to dip carrots / veg,43,2
3904,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,5.0,positive,nice to have a dip that meets my need to add something special to my diet great for ideal protein,20,3
3905,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,5.0,positive,i tried to get a local grocer to carry this but i would have to purchase a case n order to do this i am actually considering this if it is cheaper than amazon seriously i used it on everything u tul the jar was gone celery sticks and this dip on salad on an omelet for breakfast in stead of sour cream even took it to a restaurant it is that good that i will be looking t buy more i bought 2 jars and i am on my last one if you are the only person using t it can last you 2 weeks if you only use a teaspoon or so per serving i do not use a lot as i am used to lemon and some seating on salads so this is a real treat did mention no calories you could use more if you want it just will not last long,155,4
3906,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,5.0,positive,this is a great dip and makes plain old carrots and celery taste decadent and marvelous congratulations to whoever came up with this product and recipe,26,5
3907,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,2.0,negative,i really like the walden farms ranch salad dressing so i thought i would like this dip i used it with a rice chip and the first taste was ok however after about 5 seconds there was a strong pepper bite on the back of my tongue since i am not overly fond of pepper i found this to be a huge drawback also the dip had an oily consistency i wound up throwing this product out i would only recommend it to someone who likes a pepper burn from now on I shall stick to the walden farm salad dressing and make my own low cal dip,107,6
3908,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,2.0,negative,good enough taste and consistency replicates a ranch dip pretty well but then the aftertaste hits you it is got some kind of a fertilizer / chemical-y note on the back end that is off-putting enough to make me and my wife not eat any after the first few trial tastes not their best product for sure,53,7
3909,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,4.0,positive,every one of these products are perfect for competition training and meal preps,13,8
3910,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,1.0,negative,the consistency is not what i would call creamy and the flavor is not what i would call bacon a bit more like a film prop than an actual food,30,9
3911,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,1.0,negative,it tastes too artificial did not like the flavor at all,11,10
3912,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,1.0,negative,pretty dreadful i like my other walden farms products although,11,11
3913,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B002FW4WFK,2.0,negative,not exactly ranch flavored but not terrible meh,8,12
3964,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,1.0,negative,i was hopeful this would work in my keurig k-cup reusable filter it did not i had coffee and coffee grounds everywhere now i have yet another batch of coffee i can not use i do not even know how it tastes i did not want to clean up the mess so i did not try to make a 2nd cup,56,0
3965,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,the sumatra coffee is my favorite of the ekojava blends [ I have tried french roast and honduras house ] it has a nice bold flavor and the packet size is great for the re-usable k-cups [ solofill or my k-cup type ] I shall purchase again,41,1
3966,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,i found the grind too fine for my solo refillable / reusable cup it clogs the mesh and only brews about 1/3 of a cup when i use a regular k cup disposable it brews a full cup also if i use my solo refillable with regular grind maxwell house for example it brews a full cup so i can not use my ekojava except tearing open several and putting in my regular coffee make not happy ekojava sumatra single serve coffee for solofill cup 25-count solofill cup refillable k-cup for keurig k-cup brewers,94,2
3967,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,it is so hard to find a quality grade one single origin coffee i got the product and immediately tried it the flavor was incredible and the stick packs were nice but i hope they will come out with a bulk not in stick packs pre-ground coffee option in the near future other than that i could not be more impressed or pleased with the product,65,3
3968,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,very good coffee i like bold strong coffee and this very nearly fills the bill i brew 12-ounce cups and it is good 10 or 8-ounce cups even better for my taste no mess nice canister good coffee the price is decent when it is on sale for 10 i think the list price is too steep i brew it in a solo cup with an ez filter less mess less waste of water i do not like the amount of water i waste rinsing away coffee grounds I had like to see them come up with a stronger blend a variety pack and a refill option to cut down on price and packaging even more,112,4
3969,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,great product good tase and convienent to use however using the eco basket is cheaper and use your own coffee,20,5
3970,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,sorry to say this but i found the ekojava single serve coffee to be too bitter for my taste i used the single-serve canister in our keureg but after two cups i gave up,35,6
3971,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,i ordered this along with the french roast the taste is off as someone else stated brewed using the ecobrew with my keurig and had sludge at the bottom of the cup gave it a 2 instead of a 1 due to packaging guess I shall stick to my current brand,50,7
3972,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,2.0,negative,my review is impacted by the use of this coffee and brew method not on the sole quality of the taste we bought two ekobrew baskets a can of the sumatran and one of the honduran when the sumatran refused to brew a full cup we contacted the company received a nice email that explained the grind was pre ekobrew and they admit to it not working well with their single serve basket that being said they apologized and suggested for us to use less coffee with a smaller cup setting as well as offering us a refund for the inconvenience so I am not sure if the taste is fantastic enough for more than two stars since i can not brew a proper cup with their own product i gave them an extra star for customer service,138,8
3973,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,coffee is a good medium roast however i am about halfway through the canister and have run across a couple of packages that had a much smaller amount of coffee in them,32,9
3974,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,1.0,negative,i ordered this to go with the new plastic solo k-cups i will never drink it and will probably throw it away,22,10
3975,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,4.0,positive,mighty great coffee awesome one day sale pricing and cool old fashion packaging one problem liked to never of broken into the goods that top was really glued on not good for old farts with bad hands a rusty knife may work but i sure do not want to cut some precious coffee packets some kind of pull string like on those old dog food bags or a ductape seal would do the trick well shiver me timbers i just learned via another old fart that there is a secret passage into the ekojava coffee chest by golly there has a hidden perforation under the label no signs or maps about two inches down from the top that opens the goods real smart just run a fingernail around the perforation and twist the top right off who would of ever guessed now more java for me mates,145,11
3976,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,i have tried 3 different blends of this coffee and think they are great i use the solofill but am thinking of buying ekobrew cup even with the solofill or ekobrew cup this is a good buy and your not putting all those kcups in the landfill,47,12
3977,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B004LL46Y0,5.0,positive,this is the perfect measuring of coffee for the keurig tastes great nice bold but not too strong coffee you can not beat the price,24,13
4145,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,first impression stila sounds more like a medicine name than the name of a cookie bar the taste was fair at first not enough fruit filling and then a strange after taste probably from the sorbitol sugar substitute sorbitol is not an ingredient that i prefer in my foods as it does have some side effects sorbitol can be used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema as with other sugar alcohols gastrointestinal distress may result when food products that contain sorbitol are consumed sorbitol exerts it is laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine thereby stimulating bowel movements[3 ] sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly although it is not recommended without consultation with a clinician the crust or cookie portion is very dry and crisp to the point of being difficult to eat without creating a mess the moniker cookie bar is a bit misleading as my resident expert on cookies my 4 1/2 year old grandson tried one bite and promptly gave the stila bar back to me exclaiming that it was yucky there are better treats out there in this calorie range so i would not recommend this,199,0
4146,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised at how these 100 calorie bars tasted I have tried a lot of whole grain cardboard tasting health snacks and these are some of the first that had good taste and low calories while not making me feel i was eating something mixed with sawdust the berry filling is fine no complaints but what really sets this apart is the crunch you get when biting into it I am tired of eating oat bars that are soft or that have to have 300 calories of chocolate or sugar to get you to eat it this bar has neither but still tastes pretty good recommended,106,1
4147,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,the photo of this product is soooo enticing after i took a bite i read the ingredients list ouch instead of healthy organic ingredients there has a laundry list of commercial foodstuffs of questionable origin please keep in mind that i am a food purist someone else might find this product delicious,51,2
4148,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,hmmmm as a child i grew up eating flat bread raisin cookies that sunshine bakery use to make they were very different from anything else on the market at that time i loved them they were chewey and low fat at that point in time low fat was never an issue they were not low calorie anyway i use to get them as a special treat unfortunately they disappeared from the market place recently i found these they were like the ones i had way back in the 1960s i was delighted to find them in blueberry which is something i love they have a texture more like an oat cracker with a bit of fruit jam on them very nice combination from the other reviews i believe folks today are very use to softer cookie bars if you like jam and hearty crackers you will like these just do not expect a cookie bar these are lighter the other varieties are good too,164,3
4149,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,when i tried my first bar i threw most of it away my first thought was that it tasted like and felt like card board crispy is an understatment these things are crunchy on the outside with a semi soft middle now that i have had a few days to adjust to the texture i can say that they are not bad tasting in fact they have very little flavor period there is a light spread of filling in the middle which is the only thing that gives the bar flavor and by light spread i mean that the bar is actually hollow with some filling spread on the inside overall it is not a bad light snack i will finish off the box that i bought but i do not think i will be buying any more for the additional 20 calories and a dollar less in cost i will stick to the much better tasting nutrigrain bars from here on out,163,4
4150,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,i really love these little cookie bars mine were better then yours i bought them at the 99 cent store,20,5
4151,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,i do not tend to like these kinds of products but I am always looking for something that is a quick and easy breakfast on the run for me and my kids this particular product does not stand out in any way it does not taste better than the other types of products that it mimics it does not feel like I am eating real oats or strawberries it is a lot like a pop-tart to me ick the ingredients do not seem to be particularly nutritious either what has the point my kids ate them but did not ask me to buy more which means they were not blown away either I am going to stick with real granola bars instead at least they taste like oats,117,6
4152,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,chinese newspaper must be the main ingredient terrible buy 1 get one free never tasted so bad i hope their product development team wait that is a threat 1 star is overstated,30,7
4153,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,the quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar was not what i expected at all it has a crispy outside and strawberry filling on the inside there was not much filling on the inside and had kind of a grainy taste the outside was too crispy for my taste it was so crispy i could not break it in half with my hands,61,8
4154,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,the quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar was not what i expected at all it has a crispy outside and blueberry filling on the inside there was not much filling on the inside and had kind of a grainy taste the outside was too crispy for my taste it was so crispy i could not break it in half with my hands,61,9
4155,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,these cookie bars were delightful a great combination of chewy sweetness and oatsy crisp nicely balanced between dry and mushy and a good size for a quick pick-me-up when i get tired of yogurt for my work lunch pack I shall keep these in mind for something new,47,10
4156,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,the quaker stila blueberry cookie bars are quite tasty as a snack they are of snack size 100 calories per bar very little fat and sugar yet are satisfying easy to carry and something a little different for those who are trying to eat consciously a good product,48,11
4157,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,i love cereal bars i really really do but the nutrigrain which has been the staple for the world is just too most special ks cereal crisps are okay but a little too crisp where has the middle ground right here these oat cookies are the perfect blend of crisp oaty and moist to satisfy the most discerning connosieur what i loved the most although is that the blueberry flavor is not overpowering obviously there has some artificiality to it but the blueberry is not too much nor too little makes a great snack or lunch compliment,95,12
4158,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,i do not really understand this product or why I had want to eat it for one thing the texture is very cardboard like it is thin like the old school ipod nanos and tastes like eating a thin slice of dry bread with a meager amount of jam so flavor wise it definitely did not win me over nutritionally meh sure it is low-calorie and it does have oats in it but i do not think there are enough oats to make it more worthwhile than just eating some oatmeal or a cup of muesli or some other sort of healthy cereal with a comparable calorie hit although I am only halfway through the box I am not sure how I am going to finish it to be honest that is how much i dislike these bars i considered giving it 2 stars but when i realized that i dread having to eat the rest i figured that warranted just 1 star,152,13
4159,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,these stilia bars are wonderful they taste great are only 100 calories and my whole family loved them especially the rabbits they are quite filling and the juxtoposition of a crunchy outside with a jam-like inside made for an excellent snack the only downside is that we have not been able to find these in our local supermarkets i will say that these are extremely fragile and that sometimes you will end up with some broken bars before you even open the wrapper does not make them taste any less awesome although,89,14
4160,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these were good tasting and it was nice that they had a little more of the daily requirements for fiber however they were dry and really needed something to ease their passage down the throat perhaps if i have them with coffee or tea it would have been better next time,51,15
4161,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,it is the standard complaint i do not want to eat healthier because the healthier food does not taste as good these bars are a welcome change to that complaint very tasty and crave-satisfying texture provide a sensible alternative to the normal snack fare reasonably priced and worth every cent how they got all that crispiness into such a little bar is a puzzler just glad they did,69,16
4162,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,these cookie bars are bland and have virtually no taste i love oats but i can barely taste any oats with these and the fruit filling is almost nonexistent save your money,32,17
4163,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,5.0,positive,title kind of says it all these are really good and tasty a bit different than other snack bars crispy outside with a bit of fruit in the center just right for a small in-between snack love it with coffee could perhaps have a bit more fruit filling but that is picky they are very fresh-tasting and satisfying especially for 100 calories,61,18
4164,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,2.0,negative,love the 100 calorie snacks usually i was really expecting to bite into this and it to have a nice soft fruity center i was sorely disappointed the inside has a texture like a fruit roll-up hard chewy difficult to bite it tasted like the fruit was overly dried out it was not pleasant the outside cookie part was rather dry too i think if the inside had been something similar to a nutri-grain bar or something it would taste a lot better overall the thing is just too stiff and too dry the flavor part is there but when something is that dry you are still not going to want to eat it,113,19
4165,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly if you factor in the weight to calorie ratio they are about the same ratio wise to nature valley bars the amazon or quaker description says 55 ozs however each bar is only 091 ozs the whole package of 6 weigh 55 oz but i did give them 4 stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry one would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious,82,20
4166,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,i liked these cookie bars because they were crispy and i was able to carry them in my backpack without out turning into a crumbed mess like some other nutrition bars the strawberry filling was tasty and hit the spot if i had to complain about something i did not enjoy was the sugar content and the oat flakes that came off and sprinkled onto my lap when i opened it but still an enjoyable treat,75,21
4167,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,these quaker stila crispy oat bars are delicious the perfect cross between a cookie and your traditional nutri grain style granola bar they are a great snack we have been watching our diets recently and these seem to be a better choice than many other granola bars with only 100 calories about 30 less than what we normally eat and they do not seem any less filling,65,22
4168,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,4.0,positive,I have eaten nutri-grain bars on and off for a while usually because I am lazy and do not like to cook in the morning these are a little better than the nutri-grain bars if only because they are crunchy the chewiness of the nutri-grain bars makes them seem even more bland than they usually are whereas with the stila bars the crunchiness livens it up a little making it almost seem like you are eating a pastry instead of something good for you so as long as it is competitively priced I had recommend it that is all,92,23
4190,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,the pineapple cutter does not work at all it is not powerful enough to cut through a regular pineapple without exerting extraordinary force and that makes the fruit mushy i would return the product to the purchaser if not for the hassle and expense of the return itself do not bother with this product it is a complete waste of money,59,0
4191,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it does what it says it does it is not to tough although it deforms when being pushed through the pineapple causing a oval shape design thereby wasting some of the sweet tender meat,34,1
4192,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought this because i love fresh pineapples and i thought this might be a goodwrong this thing has a very small cutting circle and waste a good portion of the fruit worse yet it wastes the good tasting part of the pineapple after using it once i reverted back to manual peeling it costed me 10 and a good tasty portion of a pineapple for this experiment,70,2
4193,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,this tool sounded like a goodbefore i got it however there really needs to be some direction on how specifically to use it i tried to just cut off the top and push this tool down to core the pineapple did not work i then cut off the outer layer of skin and used it but it mangled the fruit i really do not recommend it,69,3
4194,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,thiswas easy once i got the hang of it it saves time and money be patient and it will work,22,4
4195,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,this sort of looked flimsy in the product pictures but it is actually very sturdy the blades are very stiff and sharp and the bars that they are mounted to are very heavy-duty squared aluminum it hardly flexes at all so do not be fooled by the pictures it also makes getting the meat of the pineapple much easier i just cut off the top use this tool and then slice off thin pieces of the bottom until i get past thecore it works very well and gives on big chunk of cored pineapple,95,5
4196,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,good product a little tough on smaller poineapples but great to skin and core and slice to desired thickness,19,6
4197,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the first thing to note is that this does not slice a continuous spiral as some pineapple slicers do it cores and removes the husk resulting in one solid piece which is then perfect for slicing into rings or cutting into chunks i find the solid piece much easier to work with than the continuous spiral this corer will squeeze out some juice so you want the pineapple to be just ripe not over-ripe although it squeezes out much less juice than the plastic spiral kind the corer is made of sturdy metal which is dishwasher safe to use slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple stand upright position the corer in the center and turn clockwise while pushing down the serrated teeth are quite effective at slicing down into the pineapple but it is still easier with two people one to hold the husk with two hands and one to turn the gadget if you are looking to cut the result into rings or chunks this is the one i would recommend,174,7
4198,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,core your pineapple with this handy device far better than the plastic models,13,8
4199,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,cuts perfect and clean with ease saving on precut pineapples,10,9
4200,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,i had one of these already and i wanted another one for a different location so that i did not have to transport that one back and forth works great,30,10
4201,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,it works but you kinda have to be strong to push it all the way through the pineapple,18,11
4202,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works really nice runs rings around the plastic cutter / corer offerings out there the wife can now handle the pineapple coring chore much easier i would like to help but she says it is her kitchen and for me to keep out of there yes mam will do,47,12
4203,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it would not cut through a ripe pineapple darn near broke my hand trying to get it through a waste of money,20,13
4204,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,the diameter is a little small and does not work in large pineapples needs a little more in diameter to make it perfect or they should sell 2 sizes,29,14
4205,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,in theory this thing is great but in practice it is worthless squeezes out all the juices and you are left with pineapple that does not taste good,26,15
4206,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,4.0,positive,i m sure alton brown would not like this since it is a unitasker but it does the job it is better for medium sized pineapples as it is rather small so it loses some meat on big ones,34,16
4207,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,works great used as recommended without any problems saves time makes it quick and easy easy to clean does not rust,21,17
4208,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,5.0,positive,it works great once you know how to use it cut off the top of the pineapple position the saw on top turn the saw counter-clockwise i first tried turning it clockwise and that did not work take my advice this is a great product it will last for many many years to come,53,18
4209,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,it does not work well at all i have put it in the cupboard because i can not get it to cut the pineapple,22,19
4210,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,1.0,negative,i bought thisfor my store to quickly core pineapples for customers who ask for it and it bent pretty badly on the very first use it is not made from a very strong medal and i certainly would not recommend purchasing this,42,20
4211,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,this product just does not work very well by the time it gets to the bottom of the pineapple it is no longer round i was oddly shaped and blow out the side of the pineapple a little the instructions say to twist it as you press down but that does not really work it has two metal supports that make it hard to twist it just did not work very well at all,74,21
4212,Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,i used the pineapple prince pineapple cutter and corer once and wil not use it again it is sturdy but it is a very poor design first the instructions tell you to turn the cutter in a clockwise direction however the serrations on the cutting blades point to the right meaning the tool needs to be turned in a counter-clockwise direction to cut properly second the vertical aluminum parts that form the handle are about 1/8 thick and they are attached to the outside of the cutting blades which means they rip through the pineapple this results in a pineapple that is very difficult to slice this could have been easily avoided if the handle was attached to the inside of the cutting blades,124,22
4228,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,bought this to organize all our wrapping paper we have it hanging on the back of our bedroom door so we can not access the slots for storing bags not a design flaw just in the way we chose to use it if you hang the bag in the closet you will have access to the bag storage slots,58,0
4229,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a superb organizer for storing gift wrap and ribbons packing tissue and tape by hanging this stuff in a closet i have freed up bureau space and eliminated the crushing of wrapping paper and gift cards my only criticism is that i wish it were bigger i bought a second organizer just to hold the christmas season themed stuff it is sturdy and i recommend it,67,1
4230,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i buy way too much wrapping paper i think it is all the pretty colors so my house has been a mess of paper stacked in corners bags stuffed in the back of a closet and boxes of bows thankfully i found this product the organizer is super space-efficient you hang it in your closet and it takes about the same amount of space as a winter coat there are compartments for paper bows ribbon scissors tape bags and flat paper even completely full as mine is it is sturdy and holding up fine however it is not going to hold everything the description says up to 12 rolls but i was only able to fit 8 large size rolls of wrapping paper i still give it five stars although because who really needs more than 8 rolls of wrapping paper bottom line this product is so much better than the plastic organizers you can buy at stores like wal-mart or target i plan to buy some for family members as gifts this christmas,173,2
4231,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the picture is very deceiving it is actually a lot smaller and can hardly hold anything it can maybe hold 3 roles of wrapping paper on each side and one or two bows in each little bag,37,3
4232,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,amazing capacity very sturdy and good quality very happy with purchase,11,4

4238,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,very functional pocket space is amazing kinda cheap and not super sturdy but worth the price,16,10
4239,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,used as christmas presents for my daughters and they find them to be invaluable helps them stay organized,18,11
4240,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,does the job but not as pictured or described cheap material much smaller way smaller than pictured even on the packaging not worth the money priced way too high for the size and quality,34,12
4241,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love this holds so much and tamed my mess,9,13
4242,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the large pockets on this organizer are all on one side so that when it is loaded up with wrapping paper it leans forward from the hanger and not straight up and down as pictured i bought two of these and put them back to back which helps somewhat but it does not balance out on it is own,58,14
4243,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,yeah the jokari was on me what a bunch of garbage it did not have the strength to hold any tube wrapping,21,15

4247,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,this is ok everything kind of falls out of it when it is hanging in the closet with coats I am selling mine at a garage sale and buying something else it seemed like a really goodand it is served it is purposes for a couple years but i want my organized closet back,52,19
4248,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this product is so cheaply made it would not even hold the wrapping paper without flopping over while hanging,23,20
4249,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,product does not hold as much as described and is extremely small only good for half sized rolls of wrapping paper and super tiny bows and ribbons,27,21
4250,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very cheaply made not sure how long it will last holds about 8 - 10 rooms of paper back pockets hold some gift bags and tissue paper front pockets were ok for small rolls of ribbon or small bows I shall keep it just because i do not want the headache of processing a return,52,22
4251,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,please save yourself the time and money and do not bother small small small look again not worth it,19,23
4252,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is great it is got many pockets and seems pretty solid however the ribbon compartments are not very sturdy so sometimes they fall out,25,24
4253,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to hold my christmas wrapping paper and supplies and this did the job i was able to fit 6 or 7 fairly thick rolls of wrapping paper in it as well as all my tags tapes pens tissue paper and scissors,46,25
4254,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,looks much roomier and better maid in the picture i kept it because it does soulve an immediate problem but i will be changing after the first of the year,30,26
4255,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,cheaply made does not hold much does not appear like pictured,9,27
4256,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,we ordered this to organize our wrapping supplies it feels a little flimsy and i hope it holds up it is hard to get the bows to stay in their designated boxes i also can not get some of my longer rolls of wrapping paper mostly from costco to fit overall i like it,53,28
4257,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,so many large pockets no more digging for my gift wrapping supplies,11,29
4258,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,happy i purchased this product i bought command strips to hang this on the back of my closet door i do wish the bags on the front were a bit bigger and had zippers on the tops instead of being open in the front otherwise I am satisfied since it gets the job done,53,30
4259,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,when i read the description of this product i knew i needed to have it due to my love of always having gift wrap and all things related to gift giving this organizer hardly takes any room in my closet and keeps my gift wrap nice and tidy as to where it was everywhere before the pockets are very nice and forgiving with different items i keep my ribbon and tape in the pockets but can keep many things other than that for the price this is a great buy that i highly recommend for all the people who love to organize perfect for christmas time and all year round,110,31
4260,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is the best i have a small apartment and this really helps me save on space and keeps things off my closet floor it is sturdy and has a lot more pockets than i realized awesome product,37,32
4261,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ripped as soon as i opened it very very thin and poorly made returned,15,33
4262,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,put it in and set it up in less that 5 min made out of decent material but i would not put more that 7 - 10 pounds in it if you are really into wrapping you should look for something more durable,39,34
4263,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product is great for holding all of your birthday wrapping paper items i packed it full the hook still holds it everything an looks good,26,35

4265,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,like it a lot does not use floor space in the closet and can hold quite a bit of different wrapping material,21,37
4266,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,awful this does not even work do not waste your time or money,11,38
4267,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,only fits smaller rolls of wrapping paper so not very practical for what it is intended to do,17,39
4268,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,great organized for the money will probably purchase another one,10,40
4269,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this thing i had a whole dresser full of ribbons bows cards gift bags and wrapping paper that i packed into this thing minus one bag of bows but seriously i had waaaaay too much now everything is easily accessible and visible so i know not to buy any more bows and can easily wrap a present my favorite part are the dedicated scissor and tape pockets on the side because i was always scrambling for these two tools,80,41
4270,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,really like them i used 2 to organize wrapping iarea works well would recommend it,15,42

4272,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this does not work quite as well as i had hoped but it is still a nicefor managing your wrapping,21,44
4273,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,there are soooo many pockets could probably fit close to 8 rolls of wrapping paper in this depending on the size,21,45
4274,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,holds a lot of wrap bags and bows,8,46
4275,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,helps me to organize my wrappers ribbons gift boxes gift cards and small bags in one space hanged behind my door however i do not really like the quality of the sewing and the way the compartments are designed they do not seem to close properly due to the bad fitting and workmanship things may fall out so i would say thisis overpriced due to it is poor workmanship butwise i m sold i love to organize,78,47
4276,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does not hold rolls of wrapping paper well not balanced,10,48
4277,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,it is amazing how much stuff you can get in this organizer and hanging over the door of a spare room closet really makes the best use of your space i will definitely buy another one in the future,39,49
4278,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,does not hang straight up and down with longer rolls of paper great for short rolls i would not recommend,18,50
4279,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i am not crazy out it quite flimsy and does not hold very much,13,51
4280,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,horrible only 6 rolls in and it hangs lopsided the velcro straps do not even come close to holding the rolls in as they are located towards the bottom half poor design and cheaply made even the hanger is cheap so thin waste of money,44,52
4281,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i bought this and it is companion gift bag organizer to get my wrapping out from under my bed and hang it up in a utility closet we have it worked great i do not have a crazy amount of wrapping paper rolls although i would say it maxes out at about 4 - 6 depending on the diameter of your rolls,58,53
4282,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the product arrived on time but there was no built-in hangar even although it is described as such there is a series of snaps at the top where a hangar could be placed and removed but the snaps could not fit around any closetand i do not have a hangar wide enough to fit the whole top width then the compartments shown in the middle of the organizer are just cheap plastic walls with no white finishing stitching / fabric as indicated in the picture the result is a much cheaper design than what is pictured and described when purchasing there is no way to secure those compartments closed and no stiffness to the plastic to remain closed themselves i will likely be returning this product,124,54
4283,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,goodbut it does not hold the longer rolls,10,55
4284,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed with the gift wrap organizer the plastic was cheap and flimsy this product is just poorly designed i placed 6 rolls of paper equally divided and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper i plan on returning it,57,56
4285,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,one thing to note as that depending on how much paper you include the holder does not stand up straight in the closet,23,57
4286,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,works great we needed to clean up the disorganized mess we had,13,58
4287,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,as advertised made my closet more user friendly,8,59
4288,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was terrible and cheap and it did not even come with a hanger to hang it up with it went in the trash easier than shipping it back,29,60
4289,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it ended up in the trash do not waste your money,11,61
4290,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,do not wste your money too small and extremely poor quality,10,62
4291,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,did not hold as much as i was hoping jumbo rolls are too tall but it is nice to have it hanging out if the way,25,63
4292,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it does not come with a hanger we tried using one of our hangers but it was tooheavy hanger would break or bend we tried putting 2 hangers to support the weight but the buttons will not close a sturdy thick metal hanger should be included with this product,47,64
4293,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,once you put wrapping paper rolls in the side pockets they fall forward there needs to be a rigid back to this thing it is really junk and does not work at all,32,65
4294,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does an ok job holding the paper rolls although it is a bit unweilding to get in and out of a closet the pockets on the front are virtually useless pick another product,33,66
4295,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really like this organizer and i really like how little space it takes up it is about as wide as a hanging shoe organizer it sits in the back of my hall closet and i like that when i pull the whole thing out to get what i need it does not dump anything out of it is compartments the compartments are spacious and numerous and i like that i no longer have a crumpled mess of unusable wrapping paper or a hard storage system taking up space under the bed or closet,92,67
4296,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i received another brand as a gift at christmas and could not find it to order another so i ordered this one the snaps constantly unsnap and it falls in the closet from the weight the other one i own does not do this would not buy this one again,50,68
4297,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i love wrapping gifts and making them beautiful for the receiver but i have always disliked having to store wrapping paper and supplies in awkward containers that hide under the bed or in the attic this works well hanging from the door in my home-office where it is easy to get to and out of the way i like having everything i need in one place and not having to worry about the kids getting into it or it taking up valuable office space,84,69
4298,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i wish i would have read the reviews i would not have paid more than 5 for this if I had seen it in a store and here i paid 20 it is so cheap i did not even bother putting anything in it i just just printed out the return receipt other than it being cheap it definitely shows a hanger at the top yet when i took this out of the package i saw it folds down at the top and snaps with nothing to hang it on I am extremely disappointed and mad at myself for buying it,96,70
4299,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not the highest quality product the plastic is very thin and flimsy but still functions and is very useful for getting organized,24,71
4300,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,it was cheap and i returned it there was no way to even hang it and the material was not up to my expectation,24,72
4301,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i have not hung it yet but it appears that it will serve it is purpose well it is smaller than i expected but that was reported by a previous buyer so i was not disappointed,34,73
4302,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this gift wrap organizer there are pouches behind the place where you would stand your tubes of wrapping paper that do not seem to serve a purpose and the front pouches for bows and such would work better if they had velcro to keep them closed but they do not so it all falls out,57,74
4303,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,terrible it fooled me because it looked like it was a pretty awesome product but i put two medium size rolls in it and it fell over it a silly design it would need to have wrapping paper spots on the other side to even it out,47,75
4304,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,at first i really could not tell if it was worth it but to my surpise it holds all my ribbons wrapping paper boxes and more great work horse,30,76
4305,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it is ok for everything but the wrapping paper it leans forward like the paper is going to fall out of it,21,77
4306,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i did not request a refund or return thisin fairness to the seller this does not work at all the pockets do not hold stuff at all and are really terrible it does not sit up-right like it shows and i really wish i had not ordered mine i would never ever had done so and i hope that you will take my advice,63,78
4307,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,thislooks much better in the picture than in person the unit arrived without built-in hanger as advertised or any instructions very disappointed because i specifically purchased to hang in a closet,33,79
4308,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very flimsy cheap material i do not even use it and sadly took too long to return it my bad the picture presents a highly organized tool but the reality is that it barely holds anything and everything droops hideous piece of junk,42,80
4309,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,the description and photograph showed a hanger at the top there was none i returned it and found one elsewhere to meet my needs,24,81
4310,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,there should be a place to put wrapping paper on the other side too for balance but there is not seems common sense how are gift bags supposed to equalize the weight of wrapping paper tubes not very intuitive the areas for storing ribbons and bows are flat and shapeless it does not protrude like the picture if you store this in a full closet your ribbons and bows will probably get crushed or wonky,73,82
4311,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,first of all mine does not have a hanger it has velcro which means it hangs horizontally and takes up way too much space instead of thinking i could slide it in as if it were clothes secondly it is not secure just flimsy open spaces that do not close so things just fall out do not waste your time and effort trying to organize with this it is not functional and costs too much,71,83
4312,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,love love love love this good quality plastic strong enough to hold all my wrapping supplies i am finally organized,20,84
4313,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is actually the second one of these I have owned i do not remember where i purchased the first one and after many years of use it broke the plastic on this one seems a little thinner but i still think I shall get extended use from it the storage is arranged very well there are pockets on the back where i store tissue paper and gift bags there are side pockets just behind the wrapping paper rolls where i store gift tags and shrink wrap bags it even has special pockets for scissors and tape,94,85
4314,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,great to have in the closet for all my present making supplies it actually fits alot inside more than i thought definitely worth it,24,86
4315,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is perfect for all my wrapping paper i liked the back pockets on the unit as well between this and the gift bag organizer from jokari everything has a place now,32,87
4316,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this is a waste of money made with cheap materials when i got this home it was already ripped i should have read the comments before purshasing do not waste your money,31,88
4317,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,i was in such a rush to get the gift wrap supplies organized that i bought the one organizer that i thought would fit the bill i received it today and preceded to fill it up i am surprised that amazon would sell something so flimsy disappointed in the poor quality of the cheapo plastic smaller than the posted photo and does not hold much at all i have a feeling that it may start to rip on it is own as it hangs there i will then return it,89,89
4318,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i does not match up with one i previously had it wore out this one has no place for long rolls of paper and i find those pocikets are about useless for anything,33,90
4319,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love this i only wish there was a larger pocket at the top like the 3 at the bottom i also wish it carried more wrapping paper only 12 rolls,30,91
4320,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this organizer is just right for the average family there has room for multiple rolls and spools of ribbon with slots on one side for bags and small boxes unless you are a real pack-rat this organizer should suit you needs,39,92
4321,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,daughter wanted it for her birthday she had picked it out she has not said that she does not like it nice,20,93
4322,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i was surprised at the quality on this the hanger is not plastic and it swivels easily the compartments are roomy enough for about eight rolls of wrapping paper i love the fact that i can hang it in the back of the closet where it is hidden away i figure if it tears a little over the years I shall just make pretty flowers out of coloredtape to strengthen i think this is perfect for my needs highly recommend,80,94
4323,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer is wonderful i have it hanging in a closet and it is very handy to go to when looking for gift wrap ribbons and more i think I am going to get a couple more for x-mas paper,40,95
4324,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,barely holds anything without squishing it and it leans over taking up more space would not recommend do not waste your money,21,96
4325,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this gift wrap organizer is a little on the flimsy side but there are no tears or rips in it and it is convenient to just being hung up in a closet when minot in use i do love it because all my wrapping needs are placed within this organizer,50,97
4326,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,buyer beware when i finally received this via the mail it was jammed into a mail slot and appeared much smaller than it does in the picture it is very cheaply made and the reinforcements you see on the middle pouches the white strips on the openings are not present i will be inquiring about a full refund for this,61,98
4327,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really use this alot i wish it had more space for tissue paper and gift bags it would be nicer if it had snaps on the ribbon pockets if you do not have everything distributed properly it hangs forward,39,99
4328,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this picture looks great however this is made of the same plastic that the throw away bag it comes in is the best thing i can say for this is that it was returnable even although i lost shipping money,40,100
4329,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it seems sturdy enough so far i like the different pockets it was a little difficult to figure out where everything goes,22,101
4330,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i was not able to put any wrapping paper in this organizer it is mainly meant for gift bags bows and smaller items i was upset since the picture advertises that it can hold wrapping paper again it is made out of cheap plastic but it at least can hold some things,50,102
4331,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i hate it when they send a similari did not get samefirst it was black and second it did not have a hanger built in on top it has 5 button snaps instead annoying,38,103
4332,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,it has enough room for most of my gift wrap materials and it does not take up much space i like it,21,104
4333,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,thisis cheaply made the plastic is very thin and flimsy the opening to the areas to hold ribbon is a cut in the plastic after use i am certain this opening will continue to rip additionally the area to hold the rolls of wrapping paper is not adjustable therefore the rolls fall forward and make the entire organizer fall to one side i would not recommend this product especially at this price point i have since purchased another at half this price and it is made with thick plastic and compartments with zippers,95,105
4334,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,made from really cheap plastic really really cheap plastic the hook hanger head is not curved long enough so when you hang it it may fall off your rod this will work better if hangs flat against a wall if you have tall wrapping paper this will not fit in your regular standard closet it could work on the back of a door,60,106
4335,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it does what it is supposed to do but it is very flimsy and most of the compartments are not as roomy as i was expecting definitely not worth 20 bucks,29,107
4336,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,if you are in the market for a gift wrap organizer i encourage you to move past this low qualitydo not buy i would barely pay 5 for this organizer it was so incredibly cheaply made and nothing like the picture suggested it is tiny and the pockets will not hold anything because they have these gigantic slits in them presumably for easy access but they do not hold ribbons and other wrapping accoutrements well because everything just falls out very poor design and another cheap made in china product,88,108
4337,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I am trying to organize my space and thiswas a very big disappointment it fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging the organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package the retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer the areas for bows allow bows to fall out the area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn actual use of theis difficult replacing items after use tore the assigned compartment even more I am looking for another storage solution this one did not work,129,109
4338,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this product cheaply made and very flimsy i pulled this out last night excited to start organizing and saw that 2 of the front pockets had rips across the plastic would not recommmend wasting money on this,40,110
4339,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i purchased this to organize scattered christmas wrapping supplies unfortunately this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life it also does not work well at all once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it does not flop around the hanger also can not take a lot of weight on it i tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section it would not stay up and hung kind of lopsided right now it is laying down and barely holding it is contents I am going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer i would not recommend this to anyone,128,111
4340,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,very disappointed i bought one of these exact style of organizer over 10 years ago for 1100 it had served me well for this long and just recently the plastic began to tear so i felt that it would be a good value to get another one this one that arrived that i paid twice as much for is so cheap and flimsy that i doubt it will last two years the plastic is so thin that it will not even stand up straight enough to support rolls of wrap and this is while it is hanging i have to tie a scarf around the whole thing to keep the rolls of wrap from hanging in all directions the slide pockets in the back are oddly small and i can not even fit my sheets of gift tags in them this was a complete waste of money and i wish i had not bought it keeping my old one for when this one falls to pieces do not waste your money,166,112
4341,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,maybe i was not realistic purchasing thisfor the price i did not expect it to be attractive or super high quality but i did not expect it to be as cheaply constructed as it was either it is a very thin plastic that rips easily the pockets that are designed to hold bows have the opening on the front sort of like a portable tissue pack so you when you hang it they are not on the top and the bows can fall out plus the weight of the wrapping paper rolls and i only loaded in 5 it was not like i tried to fill it pull the entire thing forward when it is hung so the plastic starts to tear and every time you touch it things fall out greatpoorly designed do not waste your money on this one,136,113
4342,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this is a great thing for getting wrapping paper contained along with all the other things that go with it the organizer is two sided so you can store on both sides and hand it in a closet and access either side such a great,46,114
4343,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,the hanging gift wrap organizer works very nice with everything you would have for wrapping packages very neat and more sturdy then expected you still have to be careful with the plastic compartments they hold just about everything you can think of very well saves space too,47,115
4344,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i just received it today i was able to fit in 5 rolls of wrapping paper that i had all my cards tape lots of bows few rolls of ribbons i had scissors everything there was space for everything it is hanging in my closet and everything is accessible easily since i just got it today i do not know about the longevity when i first opened it i thought the front pockets had tears in them but actually that is the opening to access the pockets,85,116
4345,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i used to have a tall plastic container for my gift wrapping supplies while it was slightly better than storing all of my wrapping items in paper bags it left me more frustrated than anything extra long wrapping paper did not fit bows got squished you get thei have just organized all of my supplies in this hanging organizer and i am so impressed it holds everything even that too tall wrapping paper the mountain of gift bags that i have acquired now have a home on the back of the organizer i used a 3 m hook to hang the organizer on the inside of the coat closet door i plan to check out other organizing items from this company 11914 update looks like the reviews are quite mixed about this product I have had mine since early 2011 and it is still working great i think that hanging it as described in the initial review really helps decrease the wear and tear on thei agree with other reviewers that the materials to make this product could be improved upon maybe something canvas but I am still happy with it as is,192,117
4346,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,i had the previous model it wery well made with fabric netting and i love it needed one more found it is now made only in plastic ordered it amazon sent it quickly the thing looks and feels like a cheap thing i would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape or hang it outside on a hot day but here is the really big problem it is missing the cardboard stiffeners that this cheap version needs to make the plastic compartments have a usable shape yeah assembly is required but the stiffeners are not in the package so i notified amazon i needed a replacement the new one arrived lightning quick it has no stiffeners either theis useless and i have had it so i am just returning it for a refund i can not see re-ordering theobviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces i am not a happy camper,166,118
4347,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,shipped extremely fast greatfor organizing gift wrap stuff which was what i purchased it for would be even better if it could hold more than 1 roll of gift wrap on each side in their respective pouches other than that a great product,48,119
4348,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,this product met all of our needs the storage is extensive for the size of the product and it is organized well the fact that you can place this in a closet and have it take little room is just great all in all this product is recommended to anyone with lots of gift wrapping items and needs to store them in a small space,64,120
4349,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,get rid of the clutter and get this awesome thing i had one of those under-the-bed rubber maid things before buying this and it was awkward and clumsy and everything was always a mess inside i love thisyou can take it out of the closet and lay it out on the table or bed and everything is easily accesible you can take it anywhere you need to or just leave it in the closet where it takes up minimal space and access what you need in a snap there are pockets for everything buy it,97,121
4350,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i bought the jokari gift wrap organizer amid much scorn from my family for my consumer habits but now everyone at my house is so pleased i went ahead and made the investment this organizer is similar to one of those closet shoe organizers only this one works it is flat made mostly of clear plastic and hangs off the integrated hanger to fit in your coat closet the front of the organizer is flat with two long vertical pockets on either side which hold about 4 rolls of wrapping paper each between these two wrapping paper pockets are three small pockets which hold ribbons gift tags cards scissors and more on the back of organizer are three somewhat larger pockets which you can use to hold gift bags and similar larger flattish items all of our christmas and birthday wrapping items are stored hanging flat in an easily accessible closet the translucent plastic ensure that you can easily find what you need if you have a coat closet that can handle one more thin object on a hanger and are looking to store 6 to 8 rolls of wrapping paper and would not mind some related items with them i highly recommend this hanging organizer,203,122
4351,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i love thisit has saved so much space in my closet and made it easier to find wraping paper and more no complaints,24,123
4352,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,this product tore the moment i took it out of the box i read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I had simply be more ginger with it it practically ripped to the touch it was impossible to even unfold it let alone put anything in it without the plastic tearing at the folds or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself it is too small for my purposes as well but that is subject to personal needs i will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them overall the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it did not last a half second upon arrival 20 down the drain,136,124
4353,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i am very pleased with my newly acquired ability to organize all of the stuff that was in bags piles and more i am fortunate to have a perfect spot in my basement to hang the gift wrap organiizer and appreciate it is usefulness great find,44,125
4354,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,purchased this during a recent reorganization of the closets at my home this works much better than the previous organizer i had it saves floor space since it can be hung in a closet and has plenty of room for rolls of paper bags bows tissue paper scissors and more overall I am really happy with this organizer,56,126
4355,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i have had this product for over a month now and it is great it fits really well in my closet and holds a descent amount of wrapping paper it also holds bows and there is even a place on the back to put gift bags and cards i highly recommend this product it definitely helped to free some space,60,127
4356,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,the plastic on this product was ripped when it arrived it is very cheaply made definitely overpriced for the quality,20,128
4357,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,it has a great design but the quality of materials is seriously lacking the clear plastic started ripping in one area as i unfolding it most of the plastic seems just about to rip if given any tension also the velcro does not hold very well,45,129
4358,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,i really love this product and if i could give it 4 and a half stars i would i wish the material was more eco-friendly but i bought it anyway the only real problems are lack of accommodation for large tall rolls of ribbon the tape compartment fits only the smallest tape dispenser does not fit a normal 3 m gift wrap tape dispenser and the card pockets are too small otherwise the design is great and i like it much more than the rubbermaid giftwrap bin we used previously versatile storage options under the bed in the closet free standing are a plus,102,130
4359,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this product is a little flimsy in construction but i can put up with this as it does a nice job of organizing all my wrapping paper and more i am very happy with this,35,131
4360,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,this is not an expensive product but it has held up very well for the low price it does not hold as much as it says it will but what does i have been much more organized since buying it and am planning to buy another since i reuse bows and ribbon and need the storage,56,132
4361,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,i think this is great i love that it hangs up in a closet does the job i need it to do perfectly so glad i bought it,28,133
4362,Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,pay attention to product dimensions appears to be larger than it is the rolls of wrapping paper in picture must be tiny rolls other than it is size it is an ok organizer it sets up easily and is easy to access,42,134
4401,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i bought them to fit a 1956 sunbeam and it said that they would fit but they did not so i had to return them and went and bought a new kitchen-aide wish it would have fit but the shaft was not long enough,42,0
4402,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my grandmother gave me her mixed and I have not used it very much because it was more sentimental then anything I have started using it more and i got a spoon caught in the beaters and the original were ruined i was afraid it would be a search for replacements that would last forever these beaters fit perfect and they arrived quickly and the price was a lot less than what i was expecting these are great grandma will never know,81,1
4403,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the original old beaters had completed worn out i neverthought i would get them working correctly glad these are available the mixer works as if it were new,28,2
4404,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,in spite of the amount of research i did i could not determine if these beaters would fit even a call to the hamilton beach customer line was unhelpful so i ordered them and they did not fit the middle shaft was too long i returned them,46,3
4405,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,it is just like the photo but i thought they were bound together for shipping not the correct part for my hamilton beach mixer how to i return it,29,4
4406,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my mixer was handed down to me from my mom 30 plus years old beaters broke i had such a hard time trying to find replacement ones so happy when i finally did just do not make mixers like that anymore these were perfect fit,44,5
4407,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,my mom got her hamilton beach mixer for her wedding in 1953 it is still a great appliance that she uses regularly she was having a tough time finding a new set of beaters i bought these for her and i am impressed very good quality heres to another 59 years of moms delicious baking,55,6
4408,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,factory services ha-hbg replacement beaters it was new and fit the electric mixer had not found it locally so searched internet,21,7
4409,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,the quality was a bit low considering the quality of items purchased in the past there must be an american factory that could do a bit better allen clark,29,8

4412,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,thisdid not fit at all if i can not find the proper piece i will likely have to purchase a new mixer,23,11
4413,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,these are fine for replacements of the original beaters only bad thing is they are very lightweight metal and bend easily unlike the original beaters which were durable at least they work and i am able to use my old mixer so I am satisfied,44,12
4414,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,work great fit perfect into old sunbeam mixer these beaters are hard to find so if you need these get some,21,13
4415,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,4.0,positive,i have had a hamilton beach mixer for 50 years the only thing i have had to replace are the beaters i am always thrilled to find them,28,14
4416,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,1.0,negative,i told the company what year my machine was old but motor works beautifully these were for the newer version and did not fit,24,15
4417,Home_and_Kitchen,B00063U0YC,5.0,positive,bought this to replace the beaters on a hamilton beach model g mixer i inherited from my parents that had been resting in a box for over a decade my wife is not fond of cooking and what few items we need a mixer for a small hand mixer usually suffices i wanted to mix up a batch of very dry-battered cookies and wanted the nostalgia of mons old 50s-era mixer these perfectly replaced the bent-up beaters on the hb model g also fits many other hamilton beach stand mixer models worked great at whipping up a batch of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies price almost 1/2 of what you would pay elsewhere if you have an old otherwise serviceable hamilton beach mixer and need a replacement set of beaters this is the way to go,135,16
4418,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,absolutely amazed at how well this works we use it all the time,13,0
4419,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,very cheaply made thin metal and easily scratchable,8,1
4420,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i did not use it for about a month after i bought it when i first took it out of the box i noticed a crack in the lid handle washer on the underside of the lid did not look like a problem by the time i went to use it the packaging was long gone the first time i used it i noticed the lid did not fit properly and was deformed when i picked it up by the handles a big piece of the left handle broke off in my hand the function as a skillet was ok but it was literally falling apart in my hands unfortunately i could not return it as all the packaging was gone,117,2
4421,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,beware this is junk knob on lid will not secure consequently lid spins around anytime it is handled dangerous after spending a lot of time i decided this looked like a good deal and wanted this large size so this was very disappointing to say the least it was printed in large letters on outer box china yep disgusting returning for sure so do not bother who needs this aggravation,74,3
4422,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,so far I am very pleased with this product it is large enough that i can cook an entire breakfast in it that is eggs sausage and hash browns i also use it to make casseroles and it is great for that the pan is well balanced and the heat evenly distributed the glass lid is vented which is the main reason i bought it the pan itself can not be washed in the diswasher but the non-stick surface makes it a breeze to clean you can wash the glass lid in the dishwasher if you prefer but it s not that hard to wash by hand either the price is also reasonable and after my nearly 200 electric top name skillet started malfunctioning after less than three years i decided to replace it with this one and I am so glad i did,139,4
4423,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,worked great for all of our needs would buy again if i needed another makes excellent fried chicken nice product,20,5

4428,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,i love this app and it arrived quickly and we use it all the time the non-stick interior coating is holding up wonderfully after months of use,27,10
4429,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,the first time i tried to use the skillet the electric power plug would not stay in the socket even when i held the plug the pan would only heat a little although it was set to 425 the power plug does not have incremental degree numbers so one would never be able to set the exact heat needed since the plug does not fit tightly enough to heat the pan is worthless stay away from this skillet it is a dud,81,11
4430,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i bought thistook it out of box and the lid handle was chipped and the left handle was cracked in half amazon replaced it for more and i received it the next day and the replacement was broken in the same places also the plug did not even fit into the skillet properly it just slid right back out will not ever buy this brand again and i will not recommend this to anyone,76,12
4431,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,the skillet cooks so hot it can only be used on the low setting of 200 degrees,17,13
4432,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,plug did not fit lid did not fit really bad product threw it away,12,14
4433,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,i do not lke this at all the heating element is in the center bottem it burns things the center of pan gets very hot and sides do not,29,15
4434,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,looks like a very nice cooker nicered and easy to use and clean,15,16
4435,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the handle on the top falls off it is not safe at all,12,17
4436,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,teribble product stay away right away it seemed to heat in hot spots and could barely cook over 250 now just one month old it has stopped heating all together terrible product called the company and received an ra but have to pay to ship it back to them i would avoid this product like the plague as cheap as it is made do not really want to spend more to send it back so it cost us 3500 to use it maybe 5 times,86,18
4437,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,absolute junk got about ten uses tops out of it before the cheap element on the bottom burned out and cracked buyer beware went back to using my old 7 year old one made by a reputable company i knew the second i opened it up that it would be garbage by the weight of it this thing was made so cheaply and the longevity shows in the quality of manufacture my old one weighs twice as much and is twice as thick all around,85,19
4438,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,1.0,negative,only used 3 times and it no longer heats very disappointing,11,20
4439,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,i love my electric skillet and what makes it even better i was able to get in theto match my kitchen red,25,21

4441,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,love it took it to a camping event and used to make many dishes when the grill stopped working durable and easy to use and clean a must have for the kitchen or wilderness with electric,36,23
4442,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,4.0,positive,this was great for my classroom i did not want to spend a lot of money for an electric skillet this was large enough for my classroom needs,28,24
4443,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,5.0,positive,this is very big that is a plus it does not cook fries so well but does wonders with chicken big enough to cook 10 chicken legs at a time laughing out loud and i cooked enoughsausage / tater tot covered in cheese dish to feed 9 people and had left overs so i love it the black handle for the lid had a small piece broken on it but did not hurt the way it attached and the legs are kinda rough not smooth and polished so i was disappointed in that especially when it cut my finger but all in all it is good so I am gon na keep it,104,25
4444,Home_and_Kitchen,B0006A2ZWA,2.0,negative,the skillet is nice but the glass lid was broke,10,26
4445,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,this is a great machine it heats up fast and brews fast i read the reviews about the coffee tasting like plastic and i had the same problem at first but i cleaned it with the vinegar solution and after a couple uses the plastic taste went away and now we just have a great machine,56,0
4446,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,coffee maker is working perfectly this is my second proctor-silex coffee pot and the only reason i got a new one is that i broke the carafe on my 10 year old machine which is still working just fine,39,1
4447,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,works great with auto timmer and more-failed after almost 2 years plate does not heat up and water stays in reservoir,19,2
4448,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i was lucky to find this same model of coffee maker that i had i purchased my last coffeemaker at least 15 years ago and it finally slowed down too much even with cleaning all i wanted was a reliable coffeemaker without bells and whistles i do use the timer on occasion when i have to leave early for work i hope that if and when this new maker wears out i can purchase this again maybe i should buy a spare,82,3
4449,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,good simple coffeemaker very easy to thoroughly clean consistently brews a good pot,13,4
4450,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,lasted only 14 months the heating element failed after 14 months of light use half pot daily my previous coffee maker same make and model lasted a decade before the heating element conked out on the plus side easy to pour without dribbling,43,5
4451,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,i could of saved my money and wished i would of water all over counter when pouring out of pot clock button can easily be bumped and change the time also the dial is very hard to see it is hard to open the top to get the coffee bin in or out the power cord is very very short save your money,63,6
4452,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i doubt it is the worlds greatest coffee maker and the numbers on the pot have already mostly worn off after a few months but it makes good enough coffee for us at 7 am we do not have the palettes to justify fancy coffee or machines and it is the one we were used to so it was quite convenient to order the exact same model when i shattered the old one and being able to program it the night before is nice,80,7
4453,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,we have purchased proctor silex coffee makers for over twenty years the coffee is brewed quickly and tastes great,19,8
4454,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,our go to coffeemaker the last 3 times i say 3 times because the carafe will break way before the machine quits and the replacement carafes are almost as expensive as the entire coffeemaker down the hatch,38,9
4455,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,5.0,positive,i used a mr coffee for years this coffee maker makes much better coffee and lasts longer than any mr coffee pot I have had,24,10
4456,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,shipper placed one sheaf of folded paper between product box and shipped carton not good coffee maker was dead on arrival this was not a complicated product while it does have programmable clock brew start it has an on switch that when pressed should heat the water and start to brew on switch lit up red as per instructions but nothing happened did not heat the water amazon really aggravating to have to waste an hour or more of my valuable time dealing with a product that is so simple it should be plug inwith water filter and coffee and press brew have to dry out re-pack go online arrange return and waste more of my time writing a review,121,11
4457,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this product to replace an older model of the same coffeemaker the coffee basket is an improvement but the time display is hard to read unless you bend down to view it straight on it does make tasty coffee,41,12
4458,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,1.0,negative,cheap unit with some nice features while not listed in product description research reveals product has only 180 day warranty from mfgr i can not recommend this unit buyers should be aware that i experienced a total electrical and functional failure after 10 months which nearly caused an electrical and plastic fire while we were sleeping during a programmed brew cycle just before we awoke an internal temperature control module short-circuited overheated and melted a hole in the plastic housing before a slow-acting safety shut-off electrical power to the unit such an pre-mature and catastrophic failure of this simple household appliance indicates an improper and unsafe design,106,13
4459,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,had this for a couple months now and it really is a great coffeemaker with i think could have had a few improvements 1 led is not lighted 2 too easy to accidentally hit the minute and hour set buttons those are the reasons it received a 4 star instead of a 5 other wise for the price it is a bargain it makes a good coffee in a short amount of time and keeps the coffee hot,77,14
4460,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,if you do not care about bells and whistles on a brewer this is perfect after 2 weeks of use it developed some spots on the warmer which in time i think might start peeling off which is why i originally bought this as a replacement for my old one,49,15
4461,Home_and_Kitchen,B000A1FFJ0,4.0,positive,i purchased this coffeemake after reading extensive reviews on amazon and other web-sites for coffemakers at this price range my mother-n-law came to visit me and her son for a week since she is a regular coffee drinker which i am not needed to find one that was reasonably price and functioned well this one did my mother-n-law enjoyed her morning cup i bought the more pricier filter cups so I am sure that plays a part in good coffee the coffee maker does notwater on the countertop like other lower-priced coffee maker i purchased the one in white which I am glad i did instead of the white the clock is not lit but that was ok for me all in all for this price range this is a good one,131,16
4462,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,the best thing about this deep fryer is that all parts could be taken apart and cleaned it works well and is safe but it fills my house with greasy smell it was a lot more than just deep frying on the stove top also it was a little too big for a family of four considering the amount of unusable oil i had to throw down the drain i will still use it for recipes which call for a deep fryer with good ventilation,85,0
4463,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,i liked everything about this cooker but the heat settings i found myself in need of temperatures of 400 degrees and this unit stops at 375 other than that it was beyond easy to clean and left nothing that i could think of it could use other than for folks like me a higher temperature setting good design style and thinking when into producing it,65,1
4464,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,I have only used mine twice and had good experiences both times the food turned out the way it was supposed to clean up is easy it takes little effort to disassemble the fryer but although many parts are dishwasher safe they take up quite a bit of space in my average sized dishwasher so i just wash everything by hand i wish the fry basket were larger although i guess the rest of the appliance would have to be bigger so i guess i wish the whole thing were just a bit bigger but it is still a good size for the price i wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital the timer is antimer type dial and the thermostat is a slider amking for somewhat impercise settings although this is relatively minor it is still a very good deep fryer,143,2
4465,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i like the fact that it is dishwasher safe all parts except for the heating element storing oil in the fryer is an option but if you prefer you can empty the oil pan into a bottle and wash the pan in the dishwasher too no more stinky rancid crumbs in the bottom to deal with i also like the thermostat and timer,63,3
4466,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,i should have taken heed this rival czf630 deep fryer did not have great reviews but i did like the fact that it had a filter and a break away cord hence 1 star rate the filter zero stars we used it 8 times it no longer works and it is out of the return window so we have this plastic covered can the housing for the oil resivour is even garbage impossible to remove oil from the finish of it so at 60 and an 8 time usage it would have been cheaper to go get junk food out save your money on this,107,4
4467,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,this deep fryer is great it heats the oil quickly and i absolutely love the fact that there is no spatter while cooking,22,5
4468,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,purchased this product 3 months ago looks great and easy to clean i tought i would be statisfied big mistake i have used around 3 to 5 times only now thermostat seems to not respond anymore it does not heat at all because thermostat shows that oil is at right temp all the time i am really annoyed about this situation this is a brand newelectric part is totally defective beware,76,6
4469,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,the second time i used this fryer it stopped working in the middle of cooking i cooked one batch of fries and as i removed them i noticed the power light had gone off i did all the trouble-shooting stuff and still no power i allowed it to cool down and still no power i followed the instruction booklet carefully the two times that i used this fryer and it died in the midst of it is second use since there does not seem to be a reasonable explanation it is being returned,89,7
4470,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this rival is my first fryer and i love it it keeps you away from the oils splash and you can remove all the parts and wash them in the dishwasher easy to use and to clean I shall recommend this df to anyone,44,8
4471,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,we purchased this deep fryer two and half weeks ago without warning it stopped working piece of caca this is i would avoid it there are better deep fryers out there because i can not just leave the stars out of this I am giving it one star although i would prefer to give it less than zero,56,9
4472,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,this deep fryer heats up fast and holds it is heat well so far all i fry came out nice and crisp i have not tried chicken yet that will be the big test my last rival i got for christmas lasted a month hope this one last longer by the way this is a up dated fryer from my other one to be all far,65,10
4473,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk within a month the timer knob broke off within two months the basket handle broke so there is now no way to raise or lower the basket today the temperature control slide knob broke in two there is no way to fix these defects either it is obvious that the plastic used is of poor quality for it is the plastic that failed pieces simply snapped in two or connections failed i do not use this for anything other than average home cooking either and then maybe once a week so there was not a heavyon this cooker it is just junk,106,11
4474,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i accidentally over filled the first one of these i bought but i liked it so much i got another one it cooks food well and is very easy to clean the ability to close the lid before putting your food in the oil is a real nice feature this is definitely the best product in this price range,59,12
4475,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i purchased the rival 5 liter cool touch deep fryer and it works great we owned so many different brands over the years and i am very happy with this one the best one yet,33,13
4476,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i spent hours reading deep fryer reviews and i could not make up my mind which was the best one then one day in the wal-mart i saw this fryer and thought that is it I am just buying it well boy I am glad i did this fryer is easy to use cooks perfect and looks great i am so happy with my purchase I have made taquitos apple fritters little apple pies soft crabs fish fillets donuts wings and more the food does not stick to the basket i have no problems with the magnetic safety cord and the outside gets warm but not enough to burn which is important with my 3 kids running around the basket is not too small for this family of 5 i highly recommend this fryer,128,14
4477,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,4.0,positive,first model was dis functional returned and got unit that worked beware cool touch still requires heat resistant gloves to touch while the unit is turned on I have been able to successfully fry anything from fries fish calamari and much more excellent working quality for the price,47,15
4478,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,2.0,negative,i bought thisabout 6 months ago it had all the features i wanted was easy to break down and clean but it looked cheaply constructed now after 6 months the lid does not seal well and the handle on the fryer basket has broken which is a big safety hazard next time i will spend a little more money and buy a cuisinart,64,16
4479,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,1.0,negative,2nd time i used this fryer the timer know twisted off unfortunately the knob is made of plastic and is connected to a metal rod when i twisted the timer the metal rod stripped out the plastic do not buy this fryer,42,17
4480,Home_and_Kitchen,B000ASFZYS,5.0,positive,i must say this is actually my first deep fryer and it is an excellent pick the deep fryer is huge and easy to use i feel safe and comfortable having it on the counter it is cool to touch a great buy,43,18
4723,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i got this at an amazing price so i really can not complain it is light but provides amazing warmth and comfort my only discomfort is that the feathers come out from the comforter so getting a duvet cover would be a good,42,0
4724,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was a little weary when getting this because usually the gold box items are not too great but i am so pleased with this purchase the blanket is warm but not too hot and is so comfy i love the softness of it and the brownis very nice i wish they still had them for sale because i would get another,63,1
4725,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is a very thin and light weight comforter much thinner than expected but the price was right looks very nice on the bed it takes a few weeks for the wrinckles to come out shams are standard size even with the king set good buy,46,2
4726,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was hesitant to buy these at first when i saw it in the gold box but then i said why the heck not my hesitation was due to the fact that i had way too many comforters however these were the first that i ever bought for myself the other ones were given to me as gifts this comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time i still need an extra blanket as usual since i can get very cold but it is a lot better than my old comforter like some other reviews said the pillow shams are pretty small but it is fine for smaller pillows a word of advice most likely your comforter will arrive extremely and i mean extremely staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box the solution i have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity so be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy,187,3
4727,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter in the olive shade and it is gorgeous it is also soft light and very warm n cozy the husband n i love it sadly however the cats at least one of em do not this thing is loaded w / static if you touch it in the middle of the night you can see blue sparks my lil furry guy was acting all weird and did not want to jump up in bed w / us per usual when he finally did he stood at theof the mattress i unknowingly pulled him against me on the blanket welp blue sparks flew off him and he went a-runnin so sadly i can not really use this blanket unless we are purposely trying to keep him outta bed if ya know what i mean laughing out loud o,131,4
4728,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this as a deal of the day special for 39 for that price it is ok but i would never pay full price the pillow shams are too small and the king size is too small for my king size matress i can use it as an individual comforter but then I shall have to dry clean preferred or launder it more frequently the cover does not come off the feather / down insides it is one piece that makes it a pain in my posterior the cover is very soft and the chocolatebeautiful it is nice and warm and very comfy it is quite lovely to look at and touch for that plus the cheap price I shall give it barely 4 stars for the undersize and launder problem i should give it no more than 3 stars,138,5
4729,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,what a great product if you are looking for comfort and warmth without all the weight this is the perfect comforter love it so much i am going to buy 2 more in other colors would have given this product 5 stars if not for one thing that they do not mention in the description the pillow shams for the king comforter are not king shams as most all other king comforters come with to accommodate the width of the bed other than that a great buy,87,6
4730,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,comforter can not hold the feathers had this over a year and i collected enough feathers to make my own pair of wings not to mention the feathers were not clipped so they hurt if they poke you beautiful looking as long as it is not intended to be used to sleep on,50,7
4731,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it was very nice looking until the feathers started coming out they would poke and poke and i had a very thick blanket under it but the feathers were so horrible i only used thisfor about 2 weeks,40,8
4732,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,did not last that long it started to lose it is shape after a short time and the feathers kept coming out alot i would not buy it again,26,9
4733,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was so very nice and more than i even expected for the price the value was excellant it really made the room,23,10
4734,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this in 07 and I have used it every other week since and it now 13 the only complaint I have had is that the pillow cases never stay on an entire night I have washed it numerous times I have never had feathers escape quality may have gone down since i bought it i also got it for under 35 back then,61,11
4735,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,looking at the image and knowing it is microsuede urged me to purchase this comforter but the major problem is feathers keep coming out of it i can probably fill up a coffee mug of feathers in just a week of using this comforter seller should have thought of sealing the inside really good or even trying these before selling 2 thumbs down for this I am guessing in a month this comforter would be featherless,74,12

4737,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers coming out of everywhere was soft but could not sit on the bed without being stuck by a feather threw it away,23,14
4738,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a lot for the moneyvery true easy to care for washes like a dream highly recommend and worth every penny,23,15
4739,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was staging my house to sell and the stager wanted two red bed spreads on the bunk bed i could not find them anywhere so i bought these ones from amazon i am delighted they are very classy in appearance very suede-like my kids like them a lot and they are soft and cozy for sleeping when i eventually wash them i will certainly wash on delicates cycle and line dry to avoid any feather poking issues as mentioned by others i bought them for staging but i am bringing them to the next house no question,98,16
4740,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,all the critical reviews were right the king size not quite big enough for a king size bed the filling is not very thick and the material on the back side is a little crinkly but whadda ya want for fifty bucks if you like microsuede it looks great and anyways how often does the comforter touch your skin with this one preferably never i can not say I am unhappy with the purchase the other reviews were real clear i went in eyes wide open it is a decent value and it serves it is purpose nicely but it is not a comforter you are likely to fall in love with when you pick it up those cost way more,115,17
4741,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought two of these comforters for my boys twin bunk-beds they are cute to look at my boys love them and they are both easily able to make their own beds at 6 years and 4 years their old comforters were had to make and looked messy they look nice and neat even when they are played on i love that they are thinner so if you want a think plush comforter this is not it for you but it is perfect for us,82,18
4742,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,after a week of use feathers began to poke out of the suede like there is no tomorrow they pinch you i would not recommend buying this comforter,28,19
4743,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is warm if you can get past the feathers jabbing you in the neck arm rear end and falling out everywhere sharp tips to the feathers that seem to just fall out thru the material constantly picking up feathers off the floor would not buy this again and to top it off it is noisy must have used outside feathers and not down would not recommend this comforter,67,20
4744,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the only reason this is not getting 5 stars is because it is not as thick as i expected but it gets the job done and keeps me warm thisis what i was looking for and the material feels nice i have not yet had any problems with feathers poking out,50,21
4745,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i received this comforter about a month ago and i love it it is very plush and easy to wash while looking fantastic in my room the only thing i dislike is that when it came in the mail and i opened it i realized the pillow cases are huge looks like they are made for a body pillow as opposed to regular sized head pillows oh well although i just folded the extra fabric inside with the pillow and they are still very comfortable to lay on,85,22
4746,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this microsuede feather king comforter set did not fit a king bed it was far too small in addition the comforter makes an odd sound as it moves a rustling noise that sounds like very cheap quality i was giving this as a gift and now am beyond the return date because it was just given back to me i was very disappointed in both the quality as well as the description this was definitely not as advertised i would give 0 stars if possible,85,23
4747,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,product is nice to look at but that is the only good part when you move it it sounds like there has plastic in the inside layers also little feathers are constantly poking through and falling out of it,37,24
4748,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the comforter would be all right if the feathers would not be poking through the material everyday i pull out 6 to ten feathers that are sticking out of this comforter,30,25
4749,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,we use this thing for our guest bed and in limiting the stay of guests i suppose it does a good job however as a cover for a bed and while asleep it fails spectacularly the first thing you notice with this product is the sound it crinkles and sounds cheap the sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant then you notice the big fault it will not stay stuffed from the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50 of the feathers they are everywhere it makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use i would not buy this again and would indeed refuse it should someone offer it to me free of charge avoid at all costs unless you like a loose feather decor and the feel of amateur acupuncture,152,26
4750,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i guess i do not have to say too much about this comforter set everywhere is feather keep poking my arms legs it is so annoying sometimes i get up and find feathers that stuck my t-shirt or short,37,27
4751,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,looks as true and nice as pic no apparent flaws have not washed it yet but it does the job and reasonably priced,23,28
4752,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,unfortunately in thisyou really do not get what you paid for just about every single feather that was sewn into the comforter has managed to slip out my bedroom at times looks like a chicken coop every time you look at the comforter all you see is little white feathers sticking out no matter how long you spend plucking the feathers out of the comforter there are always more and they hurt too it is not the fluffy side of the feather which sticks through it is the needle-sharp quill that always does manufacturer should have done a better job ensuring that their feather product stayed inside of the comforter,109,29
4753,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is horrible all of the feathers fall out and poke you everywhere do not buy this trust me spend a little more and get down feathers these are the regular feathers and they poke out everywhere unless you buy a duvet cover that is like 4 inches thick do not buy this,52,30
4754,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice comforter if it is not going to be used nice for spare room the feathers have a tendency to poke through the material and poke you if you lay on it just right I have had mine for about 3 weeks and it has lost hundreds of it is feathers do not be fooled into thinking you are getting a great buy because it was marked down from 11000 to 4000because it is not worth the 4000 i gave for it,78,31
4755,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered thisto match thein my room thematched perfectly but i regret to say that this was a waste of 40 why well because after using the comforter for 3 nights the feathers started to come out from the comforter there are no holes in it but the feathers themselves poke thru the fabric and eventually make their way all the way out or they hang out half way and poke you all night if you sleep in the nude like i do horrible product i have no choice but to keep using it and cleaning up a few feathers here and there each morning until enough of them poke out to where it will stop at least that is my hope if not i will have to she shall out real money to buy a quality comforter from sears or macys and chuck this one in the trash where it belongs,156,32
4756,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i got a king size and it looks fantastic but watch out after you wash it the feathers are constantly coming out and poking me it is annoying i would not recommend and it is too bad since it looks so great,39,33
4757,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i have only the comforter for about 2 months the feathers inside are poking through the material on both sides which not only makes it uncomfortable to sleep with due to the quills coming through but makes a mess because of all the feathers on my floor it also becomes very unsightly my comforter is dark brown and the feathers being white causes it to look like there is something all over it the only good thing i can say is it definately keeps you warm,86,34
4758,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,like i said horrible cheap microsuede material and stitching down feathers poke through the microsuede and poke you in your sleep very painful and uncomfortable also the comforter just barely covers a queen sized bed wished i had never bought thisto begin with had to buy a completely different comforter,52,35
4759,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i ordered this comforter because i thought it would be a great comforter and very warm for this winter but i was wrong this comforter has alot of feathers that always she had every night and the ends of the feathers actually stick your skin if you do not pull it out once you see the feathers poking through i wish i had never purchased this comforter,66,36
4760,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,took one wash before the feathers were poking out everywhere and it stunk like wet dog for weeks plural needless to say i donated this to a homeless man just a terrible product overall,34,37
4761,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the most annoying blanket i have ever purchased the feathers seep out from the entire surface of the blanket i will be purchasing a new blanket this week since this brand new blanket is just a mess,39,38
4762,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,I am not really a picky consumer but the feathers thatout of this are a nuisance at first i thought that it would get better after it was broken in but after more than a year it is still bleeding feathers but it is a beautifuland is incredibly warm to boot,54,39
4763,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,I have had thisfor about a week now at first it smelled horrible but i had seen another review on it that stated the same and they suggested to hang it outside over night i did and it worked no more smell there are a few feathers finding their way out but that happens with down filled things for the price it is a good find we will have to see how it holds up over time,76,40
4764,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it leaves a lot to be wished for not the greatest comforter i have ever owned,16,41

4766,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was worried about ordering my bedding on line but was surprised when i recieved it beautifulawesome feel and very warm along with being very soft the only thing i did not care for is every now and then you can feel a feather sticking out of it other wise iam happy with it,55,43

4768,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the one i bought about 2 months ago has barely any feathers left in it due to them falling out on top of that it is a constant battle to keep the feathers cleaned up the ends of the feathers are always poking me the next comforter i buy will most certainly not come from this company the price is cheap but i got what i paid for junk,69,45
4769,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i did not notice that this comforter is filled with feathers while purchasing whole night feathers keep popping out of the comforter causing extreme discomfort i keep sneezing as well and worst thing is when we tried to wash it needless to say but all feathers have started popping out and it smells bad too please please never even think of buying this product if you want to have a good sleep in the night,74,46
4770,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,in case you missed it as i did this comforter is stuffed with feathers not down not batting feathers the kind that have sharp quills that poke through the fabric and scratch your skin the kind that make noise when you turn over this bedding could not be more crackly if they stuffed it with corn chips and you will not want it anywhere near your skin unless you are wearing kevlar pajamas so unless your mattress is stuffed with straw and you drive a covered wagon to work give this one a pass,90,47
4771,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i searched around for quite awhile looking for a red comforter set before deciding to buy this one unfortunently i did not read the reviews well enough or i would have noticed that it was complete junk i wake up every morning looking like a chicken because the slightest movement will because sharp tipped feathers to fall out i really wish i had sent it back but sadly i had taken it out of the bag and endured one night of it before i noticed this faulty manufacturing detail save yourself from a waste of money and many sleepless nights and buy another comforter,103,48
4772,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,at first this product looks pretty good after a couple of days this comforter starter to drop feathers from both sides it was very uncomfortable because these feathers would stick to the pillows and sheets do not buy it,38,49
4773,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i thought theof this blanket would be much brighter than it actually is and i am disappointed with how it turned out,24,50

4776,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought this and i hate it there are feathers sticking out all over through the cover and the duvet cover i was always getting poked by feathers so i had to toss this out what a waste of money now i have to buy another comforter and this time i will not buy down i will get an alternative no more pokey feathers,64,53
4777,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,had this for a month and the feathers started poking out of it and they were sharp like needles horrible,20,54
4778,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,we bought this comforter because it was beautifull and a great price I have had down blankets before and i expect some feathers but this is ridiculous my whole house looks like a scene from witches of eastwick feathers constantly come out a few handfulls a day it is beautifull and warm and cozy i loved it other than the embarrasement of having to pluck feathers off everything i own i have ordered a duvet cover but i doubt that will help much do not waste your money,85,55
4779,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,be aware this is not a down comforter and it is not described as one either we are talking full feathers with calamus if they are not stabbing you on one side are poking through on the other terrible product not worth half the price buy one and you will regret it,51,56
4780,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the blanket is soft and very comfortable but the care was way to much trouble the cost to have this cleaned professionally was the same as buying a new one so i did what i could to clean it myself since the blanket was too big to really get clean in the washer and micro suede will melt / burn in the dryer i washed this in the bath tub and hung it to dry it was so hard to ring most of the water out and so heavy to move to hang the other thing i did not like was the feathers came out of the blanket so constantly that it was never without a lint covered look and there were always feathers everywhere to clean up you live and learn i now have a different blanket that is not filled with feathers,141,57
4781,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,good price bad blanket the blanket has a good look to it but the actual usability is not good the feathers poke out and when under the covers and moving around the blanket sounds like sand paper or plastic bags rustling around it is warm enough but i wonder how long the warm will last with all the feathers coming out i would suggest this blanket for a guest room that is for show and does not get much use,76,58
4782,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is a nightmare to say the least feathers are everywhere the feathers also stab you thru the material and make for a very very very unpleasant experience if you are considering buying this i advise you to think again worse purchase ever made on here people who sell this crap ought to be ashamed of themselves btw the only reason i gave it 1 star was because it would not let me leave it blank or put a negative star,81,59
4783,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was so happy with the initial appearance of this comforter however i awoke in the first night to an eruption of feathers i felt like i was on the set of a horror movie revenge of the chicken feathers it felt like a million needles were sticking me and it was impossible to clean up i had to move to a new apartment and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only there is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again there are just too many feathers everywhere my maid rosario cursed and ran out of the apartment when she saw what had happened this comforter will ruin your life,113,60

4785,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is a complete mess of a comforter i got a great deal on the price and yes it does keep you warm but at a price and the price is feathers everywhere I am not just saying a couple here and there I am saying this thing is a feather factory which puts out a handful of feathers daily if your goal is to make your bedroom look like a chicken coop then you will succeed if you purchase this blanket set if you trim pine branches outside and go to bed without getting all the sap off you will wake up looking like a bird man this blanket is currently in a garbage bag stored away in a closet waiting for an emergency of to annoy an unwanted house guest,130,62
4786,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this about 2 months ago it was very staticky at first i did end up washing it and drying it according to label directions with no problems i am really diappointed in the amount of feathers that are constantly working their way out of this comforter although at night the pointy parts of the feathers stick through the sheets and it feels like needles when i have to take this off to change the sheets the feathers go everywhere and it seriously looks like a goose exploded in the bedroom i would not order this again nor recommend to friends or otherwise,104,63
4787,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this and was happy the way it looked and thebut the first time i used it i hated it it was scratchy itchy and downright pokey and pinchy plus the feathers came out all over where i slept i returned it,45,64

4793,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i purchased thisat more than i see others paid for and one reason i bought it was that it says machine washable i just opened it up and the first thing i see is dry-clean only wow what has the deal i feel cheated i do not do dry cleaning and now I am seeing a lot of complaints about the feathers poking through sigh,64,70
4794,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this sucker has been moulting feathers since i put it on my sons bed also it crackles when you move it around price was cheap but if i would have known about the feather problem i still would not have bought it at the reduced price,45,71

4804,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this cover looks good and keeps you warm but that is the only thing good i can say about it the feathers comes through the material on both sides and constantly stick you and get everywhere this is listed as a comforter but it is uncomfortable just bought it 2 weeks ago and i am already on the market for something new,62,81
4805,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,purchased this for my daughter and my mother as their birthdays are in summer we have only begun to use them these comforters are soft and warm beyond belief theworks well with the sheet sets i purchased at the same time i am very pleased with these comforters and would buy more the price as always from amazon was extremely affordable the only negative is they are supposed to be dry cleaned but i plan to spot clean if necessary however the dogs are not allowed to sleep on them which was disappointing to them,96,82
4806,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,feathers are every where do not buy worst purchase I have made on amazon i do not know why it is still selling this thing should be off the market as soon as possible read the rest of the one star reveiws and take heed,41,83
4807,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theis true to what you see here on the amazon website nice dark chocolate i recommend washing first since it is such a dark hue it can bleed on lighter colored sheets you may sleep with after time i washed as soon as i received it and had no fading issues provides great warmth as it is luxuriously full with feathers and the shams are perfect for regular sized pillows i gave it 4 stars because the feathers come out a little easily i have other microsuede feather comforters and this one definitely sheds more but still a great buy,100,84
4808,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i brought the comforter in may 09 and did open the package until recently do not buy the blanket it bleeds feathers that stick you amazon should take it off the market i can not even return it since the 30 days are over,43,85

4810,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i like it so much that i have been thinking of ordering another one to have as a backup as for this particular amazon page i will never write another review unless amazon ceases at once to virtually dictate yes dictate what the reviewer should do give your customers some credit for intelligence by the way i just previewed what i wrote here and i did not check the box next to receive e-mail when customers comment on your reviews but when the preview page came up i was informed you did not request to be notified when customers comment on your reviews clearly anyone is more intelligent than whoever dreamed up this page,116,87
4811,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,great price great colors but you would be more comfortable actually sleeping in a real bird nest complete with sticks and branches as well as feathers this comforter had the feathers sticking out everywhere pokey and painful and gross no possible comfortable position unless you sleep on it upside down,49,88

4815,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what was i thinking when i ordered a microsuede comforter i think i was thinking affordable down comforter and blanked everything else out it came with two microsuede pillow cases yet which will see the donation box before they see my head upon them the underside of the comforter is a weird material that makes a swooshing noise I have been using it for two weeks and it is already losing feathers but the very worst feature that i did not know before purchase is that it requires dry cleaning if only i had not used it right away i would return it why why why did i have to use it at all be warned unless you like sleeping with suede,118,92
4816,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,awful as others are saying it is a very nice set but the comforter is too cheap and the feathers poke through it is a pita because they are all over the floor and it looks awful with feathers on it let alone sleeping with bird feathers right back to amazon it goes not even worth the 60 for the set,58,93
4817,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,after three months this comforter is a shedding feathers on both sides i will not even let my dog sleep on it waste of money do not buy,26,94
4818,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,if you like having 10 thousand feathers everywhere all the time then buy this comforter the feathersout of the fabric like water through a sieve if i thought it would do any good I had return it and demand my money back if i could submit this review with no stars i would,55,95
4819,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this is the biggest waste of money i purchased it for my sons bed after having redone his bedroom well i found it stuffed in his closet the other day and did not know why well he showed me why it looks fine on the outter side but when you turn it over it has feathers poking out everywhere he said they poked me all night long now this is coming fr a 17 yo who has never cared one way or the other about what his bedding consists of i went to send it back but it was to late do not waste ur money,105,96
4820,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this thing is way too small for my king size mattress it barely covers the top part of the mattress much less hanging over the sides so i will be returning it,32,97
4821,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i bought a king comforter for only 40 despite all the reviews about the feather issue well you get what you paid for the feathers are everywhere in my house because of this comforter every time i wash it i spend 30 - 45 minutes pulling feathers out that are protruding through meaning a trip outside to pull the feathers out you can not sit comfortable on top of it because of the feather poking issue this was an issue straight out of the package I have washed it 11 times now and can not believe how many feathers are still coming out otherwise the microsuede is really nice it is just the feather issue is too much for me to handle and i own several down blankets this is the only one with this bad of an issue,135,98
4822,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter is really pretty but it sheds and while you are trying to sleep the end of the feathers come out and stab you all night everyday i had to pick fethers up all over my bedroom and all over the comforter,43,99
4823,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very upset about this product it is very thin which you would think it would be thick and it crunchs like it is full of plastic but theis really good the size is excellent,38,100
4824,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i thought for the price that it would be something simple and soft was i way wrong i am still shocked at the quality of my comforter the thickness it is the best buy i have ever had and am thinking about getting the one in chocolate too what i love about this is that it stays in place on the bed no matter how my husband and i and our puppy move during the night it does not slide off the sides it is a must have to any bedroom ensemble,90,101
4825,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is very inexpensive but there is a reason the feathers started coming out quill first and poking us from the very first night it is warm although i think we are just going to find a duvet cover to slip over it can not be to disappointed but heads up it is pokey and lot of loose feathers,57,102
4826,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought 2 of these in the full / queen size one for my husband and one for myself we have to have our own blankets because we both like to have control over the blankets haha well when we first got them they were very loud like tissue paper in a way so one of us would move and the other would hear all the noise and vice versa but the noise has quieted down and it is an excellent blanket it is very warm and not too thick very soft i like to sleep with the suede side against my skin and it feels very nice,106,103
4827,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is made pretty poor you get what you pay for i can see why it is marked down so much one side is softer while the other is stiff and crunchy not comfortable at all i decided to use it for the warmth factor and actually have the sueded side facing down because the opposite stiffer side does not feel very good against your skin therfore i have a quilt on top of it the tags read dry clean only i know as a fact i would not go to the expense to have it cleaned that way as the set is not worth it it does have a decent weight to it but other than that if i had actually seen this at a store for sale i would not of purchased it even at the low price,138,104
4828,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought thisand with in a week all the feathers are all coming out of it you can lay with it casue the feather stick you in the morning there all over the bed on me and the floor i threw it away it was a waste of money,54,105
4829,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this the worse thing we have ever bought the feathers are already coming out of it we do not wnat other people making the same mistake we did,28,106
4830,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,the comforter is beautiful it is just what i thought it would be the delivery was prompt and it was a great bargain I am very satisfied with my product,29,107
4831,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the product that i received is very poor in quality after only having it for a few weeks the comforter began to she had feathers daily all over the bed it is so bad that u can literally feel the feathers sticking you when you lying down i have pulled out over 30 feathers during these last few weeks and definitely think this is a total waste of my 50,69,108
4832,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is a very nice looking comforter but the thing can not hold feathers at all i would wake up at night covered in feathers with a bunch more poking into me from inside the comforter,34,109
4833,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,although thisis beautiful when first put on it has some very big downfalls it crinkles because of the filler and it sheds feathers all the time you end up having to vac constantly and make sure to check your cloths in order to ensure you are not walking around with stay feathers on you or in your hair it was really a shame because i have other microsuede comforters and this one was the perfectfor my room but i am at the point where i can not use it because of all the feathers,98,110
4834,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i had two of these for a month you get what you pay for the shafts of the majority of the feathers are all bunching in the corners and constantly poking through the materiel that is us the comforter is very warm for it is weight seems well made except that the feather shafts are very hard and really hurt enough to wake me up,63,111
4835,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,very pretty rich browna little crunchy in terms of down but warm and very attractive for the guest room,21,112
4836,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter looks are deceiving in this good feeling comforter I have used it for two weeks now and already the pointy edges of the feathers are sticking through and poking me there are feathers on the floor and on everything i wear when i sit down on the bed the warmth and weight of this comforter are great but get a duvet cover to keep the feathers inside,71,113
4837,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i read the reviews and still bought this comforter set at my age i could surely take care of a little static and loose feathers this comforter has it is own power source i have used 2 cans of anti-static spray and a bottle of fabric softener / water mix and still have trouble getting out of bed in the morning-I am stuck to it the dogs fear their morning greeting i believe it is a combination of my hair standing on end the dozens on feathers stuck about my body and my newly obtained super power to shoot lightening bolts i also believe the nightmares of aliens with probes are directly associated with all the loose piercing feathers i gave this 2 stars because 1 it is warm and 2 the manufactures ingenious ability to continue selling this product after reviews like mine and yours,141,114
4838,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,theof this was perfect went great with my existing decor but i keep getting feathers poking me in the middle of the night they come thru all sides of the comforter and make a mess when you pull them out because you certainly want a clean looking comforter overall very warm and great for the price,58,115
4839,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this product is great however you do lose a few feathers all and all it feels great,17,116
4840,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,feathers are coming out of the comforter and are everywhere i definately would not have purchased had i known this i have other down / feather duvets and comforters and have not seen feathers come out like this one you usually see the odd one or two it is soft and light and keeps you warm so if you do not mind the feathers everywhere this is a good choice,67,117
4841,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with thiswhen i received it it looked very nice but had a substantial amount of feathers all over it after picking off the feathers the comforter looked great i bought this for my teenage sons room and after he slept with it the next day there were feathers all over it again i have gone through this pruning process almost daily and the feathers never seem to quit coming out of the comforter i am now finding feathers in other parts of the house i recommend spending more money and getting a high-quality comforter i wish i would have,108,118
4842,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i ordered this set to go over an existing coverlet on my bed that had camel and browns in it i fold the comforter down and with the shams it makes a beautiful statement for the bedroom the fabric is quite nice and well worth the price i would recommend this to anyone,53,119
4843,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i was disappointed from the get-go with the comforter when i think down i think fluffy and thick this comforter was neither it is extremely thin also beginning the first hour of use feathers began sticking out they poke into you while sleeping or even just sitting on the bed to watch tv vacuuming had now become an every-other-day activity because of the fleeting feathers needless to say i have already gotten the return labels,74,120
4844,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i am seriously disappointed with the workmanship on this comforter it is been leaking feathers daily through all of the seams while theis nice and I am a big fan of microsuede i would never buy this product again due to how poorly it has been manufactured,47,121
4845,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was made of newspaper and straw unless you need something to put on a bed your child is often wetting this is not a good deal i would only put this on a bed i knew was going to be ruined shortly the poor quality is obvious in the look and the feel do not waste your time or money,61,122
4846,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,just want you to know my nephew was thrilled with his christmas present he loves his warm good looking comforter set thanks amazon,23,123
4847,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,got this comforter for my daughter for christmas and she loves it she is age 17 so usually impossible to please that has to say it all,27,124
4848,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,oh my god we got this for our new king bed and the feathers have not stopped coming out yet it is been over a month when we first got it it was all crinkly and made a plastic like crinkling when it moved then the feathers started breaking up i guess and they are sticking out every where we have it in black so this looks pretty bad not very snugly or comfy for a comforter either more like a sleeping bag feeling,85,125
4849,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks great until you wash it once it is washed it is done for i used to pay my sister to de-feather when it comes out the drier because there are feathers poking out everywhere you do not want a comforter with feathers you want a down comforter to avoid this my husband and i have stopped using it because it is so annoying feathers are everywhere in my house i would wake up with feathers in my hair do yourself a favor and get the down one,86,126
4850,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,love the softness and it is warmis nice and was a good value,14,127
4851,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i received this after adding it to my wedding list and it looked really nice to begin with after a couple of weeks however the white feathers began poking through and scratching my legs when i was in bed i have shaken it had it cleaned and more but i always end up with white feathers showing showing a lot because of the black cover and eventually coming through the cover completely it looks awful when this happens and i have bought a cheaper microfiber cotton comforter which i cover with a nice quilt no more scratches and no more nights where i wake up looking like I have had a fight with a dove in my sleep,116,128
4852,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,what is this thing filled with garbage bags it crinkles like plastic it is as flat as a pancake it is uncomfortable it is not warm it is got a serious static problem the feathers poke through the back lining but it looks good on the bed so i fold it down at night and use my old duvet to sleep under,58,129
4853,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,what a bad product is this stuffed with chicken feathers this is definitely only a comforter to put on an unused bed in your guest room after a very short amount of time feathers began to poke out everywhere and it took on a crunchy feel due to the feather spines inside i am very disappointed with this set because it is really pretty in case you are wondering if careless laundering led to the problem the answer is no since i quit using it even before it needed to be cleaned for the first time do not buy this comforter set,99,130
4854,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i like it it adds warmth without being to heavy but it is a little noisy it also stays on the bed unlike someothers i have had,27,131
4855,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,thisis so comfortable so warm and so awesome that i can not imagine going to bed without it i wish it were machine washer safe although,27,132
4856,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,looked forever for a brown suede feather down comforter finally found it at a great price free shipping and came fast,19,133
4857,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was surprised at how warm this comforter is it looks a little thin at first when you open the box but sleep under it for one night and you will be amazed now i know why birds do not shiver in the cold it is also very soft to the touch due to the micro suede,56,134
4858,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i love this comforter it is soft and warm the only thing i do not like is that it has to be dry cleaned otherwise it is perfect,28,135
4859,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this quilt is great it is a deep rich brown and very soft to the touch it is not as cushy as i thought it would be it holds it shape and looks great on the bed as a topper with bedskirt,41,136
4860,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,blanket is not comfy very thin and stiff ordered a king for a queen sized bed and it just barely fits,21,137
4861,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is so warm and soft we use it on our bed and we have no problem keeping the heat down at night also great for watching tv would recommend it to anyone looking for a light but warm blanket do not let the thinness or weight fool you,49,138
4862,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in this comforter i have only had it on my bed for a month and already it has feathers poking out all over and i have not even had to clean it yet definately not worth the investment,41,139
4863,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i bought this microsuede comforter for my spare room get compliments on it all the time it also looks very rich i liked it so well i got another one,30,140
4864,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter is very very thin a few feathers have already started falling out after a month theis great just as it looks,24,141
4865,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the fabric is soft and theis true to the picture a rich chocolatelike a hershey bar the comforter is not as fluffy as i thought it would be but that worked out for my husband who does not like a heavy blanket it really looks more sophisticated than it is low price i just wish the matching bedskirt was cheaper,62,142
4866,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,microsuede down / feather full / queen comforter set camel i bought this about 9 months ago for 35 when it was on sale at first i was really impressed with the comforter the cover of the comforter microsuede side felt wonderful and it kept me plenty warm after a bit of use and washings i noticed more and more feathers escaping right through the fabric side no holes just right through the fabric also my comforter only has xs and does not have the full sewn boxes like more expensive models to keep the down in place so the down and feathers end up in the edges of the comforter while you lay under the middle i would recommend you save your money and buy a better comforter personally I am tired of having to pluck myself each morning so into the trash this one will go,144,143
4867,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter last spring i was looking for an inexpensive comforter and found this one the microfiber top is nice and soft it is rather light but is good for the warmer months it washes up nicely my only complaint is that it sheds feathers the blanket i have under it usually has feathers all over it i only paid 3500 for the king size it is hard to find any king size comforter for that price if it was not for the feathers coming out i would give it 5 stars for what you get for the money,100,144
4868,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this comforter looks nice but feels cheap it crackles when you move and is already losing feathers after just a few short weeks we used to have a great microsuede down comforter from jc penney but they no longer carry it no one seems to have one that matches the quality i think i am going to get a regular white down comforter and a pretty duvet for it this one is just irritating,74,145
4869,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was everything expected very comfortable lying under the cozy down filling on a cool night great productthanks,18,146
4870,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is not only very warm but is absolutely beautiful i have not had any problems with the feathers moving toward the center or poking out and my husband is a big guy also the only bad thing about it is that it is not that big i bought a king for my queen bed and it barely reaches to the bottom of the frame i may buy a bedskirt to go under it other than that it is so warm and so nice,84,147
4871,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i purchased this set for my teenage son he specifically wanted a black comforter set which hard to find in department stores i came across this one and decided to give it a try the price was really great and this comforter set looked really high quality however within one month my son was complaining about all of the pokey feathers the feathers are coming out all over his comforter and he is no longer happy with it i guess the price was too good to be true,88,148
4872,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i orginally ordered the set thinking that i was not going to like it as soon as the package arrived i openit ans was surprised to find that the comforter was well constructed and the perfect weight for fall weather in maine i am going to order another comforter set for the guest bedroom,53,149
4873,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,light weight it feels soft it would have been helpful for me to know before i purchased it that it required dry cleaning,23,150
4874,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,i bought this because it was cheap and boy is it cheap it is thin as paper and i think it has paper inside it by the feel of it I am tempted to slash it open to see what has inside because i certainly can not use this as a blanket the material inside is actually crinkly and noisy which is not a benefit when you are trying to sleep the blanket is thin uncomfortable noisy not particularly warm and i highly recommend that you avoid it,83,151
4875,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,great quality and price nice weight of fabric cozy texture description is very accurate i would have liked to know the length of the comforter,25,152
4876,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,the price was incomperable 3000 for a king sized micro suede down comforter the only thing i would change is making it more fluffy it is comfortable soft very light and breathes better than you would think i have it on top of one of my very fluffy down comforters and another micro suede comforter a little fluffier than this one so this is almost like the cover of the bed nonetheless it does not matter to me that i have it on the top of the bed it is nice to settle down on the bed and relax into it it is very soothing,101,153
4877,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this comforter set is as plush as advertised and looks wonderful on a bed complete with pillow cases that nestle the head into dreamland,24,154
4878,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,a really nice blanket great price for a down blanket light and airy but warm,15,155
4879,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,for the price i thought this is a great fit for my bedroom not big and bulky but still keeps us warm and looks nice we have a queen size bed and bought the king size comforter and it just barely covers the bed so definitely worth it to buy the size up,53,156
4880,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,very pleased with the quality of this product i would never have been able to find a microsuede down / feather king comforter or any size for that matter at this terrific price,31,157
4881,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is really beautiful and i love it the only thing is it is not as thick a i thought it would be and the feathers keep coming out of the material,31,158
4882,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it luck nice at first but after one week the my room is luking like nest wiht feders i do not like this is weary cheep do not buy this your room gona luck like you have a chickiens in it,43,159
4883,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter was not at all what i expected i have now returned it awaiting my credit back this is not anything like i would ever purchase againthank you,28,160
4884,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is got a plastic liner which makes crinkly sounds when it moves and yes it sheds and it does not really feel as good as you would expect a microfiber to feel i went out and bought a different one paid twice as much but I am a lot happier with it,49,161
4885,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,the feathers in the blanket are always coming out all over and at night you can not cuddle up in the blanket because the feathers are always stabbing you,28,162
4886,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i really liked this when it arrived very soft and warm and thewas perfect but after about 4 months the stitching started coming out i do not lay on it and i have never washed it so i guess you get what you pay for,46,163
4887,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,i did not expect anything amazing the king size is the same size as a queen set i ordered at the same time from a different manufacturer this set was thin barely as thick as a quilt it makes a crackly noise too theis what i consider a true brickdeep red thewas exactly what i wanted so the shams are very useful the comforter itself not so much i have it folded across the foot of my bed forrather than function,88,164
4888,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it is not as thick as i prefer my comforters to be and it is noisy meaning whenever you turn you can hear the cover rustling around not good for very light sleepers,32,165
4889,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was such a great deal and so comfortable not to heavy just right keeps me and husband warm and looks great on our bed the matching pillow cases are a bonus thanks so much,36,166
4890,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,it is very pretty but needs more bulk also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter but the price was cheap you get what you pay for it is okay for spring or early fall but do not expect heavy duty warmth from it,46,167
4891,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i have a ralph lauren down comforter that I have had for a while but needed something a little lighter for the summer this comforter was perfect as a precaution it is pretty thin this is not a winter comforter but it does keep you warm the materials are semi high-quality you get what you pay for my only problem with the comforter is that the feathers tend to come out through the material on occasion but that is expected with a down comforter for the most part overall i was happy with the gold box price i paid for this set and would reccommend it as a good comforter under 100,112,168
4892,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,there are two reasons i did not give this product 5/5 it sheds feathers like crazy and is dry clean only otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter,26,169
4893,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i tried to get every one i knew who was redecorating to snatch up this comforter only a few of my friends took advantage of the sale free shipping and we are all very much satisfied at first i thought the package was kind of light for a comforter but once this puppy got some fluffing it worked out to be very nice,64,170
4894,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,when i first unpacked it i thought it looked like a very nice comforter especially considering what i paid for it i soon realized that looks are not everything a day has not gone by where i have not had to dispose 8 or more feathers at this rate it is going to be nothing more than an empty she shall even at 35 i feel i paid too much for this i would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a donaldcostume you are working on but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds / colors of feathers inside thing only 15 of it is content is actual down,116,171
4895,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,this is not a fluffy down comforter it more like a down bedspread i purchased the king for a queen size as i want that look it does have a nice feel to it however you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede i love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it people have commented that it does look very nice i paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as i did get king size pillow shams with my set,109,172
4896,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i purchased this on a friday special sale price and received it for only 2999 it is very lightweight and comfortable and the pillow shams were king size not standard as in the other reviews i have a queen size bed and ordered the king size glad i did because it just covers the top nicely and has very little on the sides i am diabetic with neuropathy in both legs and feet this lightweight comforter is replacing another that was too heavy on my feet at night i reside in florida where you do not need a heavy comforter but because i also have the microsuede throw that i ordered last winter i can attest to the fact that they are also very warm and comfortable while remaining lightweight there was no bedskirt included in my package which was also fine with me because my bed is adjustable the bedskirts do not work well anyway definitely a 5 star product for the money the microsuede is very soft also,168,173
4897,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,it is soft warm and all you can say but i have feathers all over my room the cover is not strong enough to keep them inside it is a shame because the price is good and the microsuede is soft,39,174
4898,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was so happy about the quality of the comforter i was nervous that thewould be gray but it was not its definately black and when i first opened it it did not look like it would be too thick but it just needed time to air out it seems thin but it is extremely warm and the under part is almost like a vinyl so it keeps you cool also overall very satisfied i recommend this,77,175
4899,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was in the gold box and the customer reviews were very positive so i bought the queen / full set for my guest bedroom I am very pleased it is light weight looks nice it is warm and more i found the range ofchoices kind of icky but the camel is sufficiently bland to blend with any decor additionally it should withstand getting dirty easily it weighs nothing and it does not smell at all apparently people have had odiferous adventures by machine washing it there is a rather prominent tag on it saying dry clean only laughing out loud,95,176
4900,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter it appears to be a little on the thin side but is very warm i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it the pillow shams are only standard instead of king very good price too,56,177
4901,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i got this on a gold box sale and i love the price also love the feel of it and the best thing is that i love there d and this is one of my favorites most of the time i only see maroon items to buy but thiswas better oh i also received it on time and in great condition,64,178
4902,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,this is a nice looking comforter however it lacks in the filling the comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have been to bad they skimped on the filling,37,179
4903,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,this comforter might fit a full size bed but it was way too small for a queen,17,180
4904,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i am so pleased with this product very reasonable price and excellent quality and looks good and feels good i highly recommend this purchase,23,181
4905,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i paid 3499 for this microsuede down comforter set i was thinking i was getting a sheet comforter and pillow cases because of the set but this set does not include the sheet I have been using this for about 2 - 3 weeks and it works well i tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it it is really comfortable soft and has no weird odor coming from it additionally you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it one really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter you contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout the reason this happens is because the squares / pattern on the comforter does not completely enclose the down stuffing so the sides of the squares are open allowing the stuffing to move to the sides and end of the comforter,166,182
4906,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is fantastic it is light so you do not feel weighted down it is very warm cuddly soft and comfortable and seems to be very well made and it looks great on my bed i can not find one thing to complain about i wish i had bought one in everygreat bargain for the money,55,183
4907,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,great value for the money a bit on the thin side but very warm great,16,184
4908,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this comforter is lightweight but very warm i live in the basement of a home where it is cold in the winter i sleep like a baby now,28,185
4909,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,i would only change one thing about this they should use a different material for the inside cover i feel like I am sleeping in a barn with a lot of chickens the feathers are everywhere and sometimes they poke when I am sleeping if the feathers were to stay inside i would totally recommend it btw it is really warm and cozy,61,186
4910,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,it was much thinner than i was expecting and i did not think it would keep me very warm but once i started using it i realized it is very warm and am very pleased with it,36,187
4911,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,the price was great but other than that it was not at all what i thought i would be getting the quality is not great very thin thin comforter for feather down disappointed for sure,34,188
4912,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,you would think when you open it it was thin and would not be very warmactully it is real warm just has some staticlove the feel of this blanket,29,189
4913,Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,while the comforter was not as heavy as I had thought it certainly is a steal for the price and is sufficiently warm when i ordered there was some question as to washability it is machine washable although i have not needed to launder mine yet the oliveis very similar to the picture it is a rich deep olive green i am thrilled with this set,64,190
5285,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,actually pretty decent not or quality but will work in a pinch,12,0
5286,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excelent product i would buy more in the future good grip and excellent suture cut far better than the olders i used before,23,1
5287,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,absolutely the best if you do a lot of suturing and i do these are head and shoulders above stainless steel shears and worth every penny the tungsten carbide blades fly through gutand silk threads the needle drivers also grip fantastic these days i actually get in a bad mood when suturing without this little work of art some people are not big fans of the olsen design but if you pay attention while working you can avoid accidentally cutting your thread prematurely this has cut my suture time down a lot I am one very happy customer,99,2
5288,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these were awful you can not grab anything without having to lock them which is incredibly annoying i guess you get what you pay for,24,3
5289,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,I am a medical student who purchased this needle driver for tying practice and it was such a disappointment the drivers do not open and close smoothly and it does not put a good grip on the suture at all if you were looking for something close to or quality needle drivers do not go with this brand i found that the ones provided in my medical kit i ordered through school worked a lot better,74,4
5290,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,not a good needle holder ok as hemostat clamp,9,5
5291,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,very poor quality product the instrument is not comfortable in ones hands and the it does not move smoothly at all when adjusting the grip would not recommend,28,6
5292,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,they work pretty good but the scissor part is hard to get to you still need to have separate scissors,20,7
5293,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,excellent quality will be using a long timel,8,8
5294,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,this is a good product and is very useful,9,9
5295,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,perfect for practicing my sutures in veterinary school,8,10
5296,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,bought these for my son here is his comment I am a fourth year veterinary student and can honestly say these are fantastic I have had problems with my basic first year needle drivers having the lock pop all the time typically at the worst time or the inserts dull down the lock is very strong on these and the inserts have not dulled or pitted these are probably better for people who wear a size 75 surgical glove or higher as they are a tad long some people may not like the suture scissors incorporated right behind the inserts but i think they are fantastic ok i can not add because i have not the vaguest notion of what he is saying but he did tell me after he had used them for a week that one of his professors asked to borrow them because she thought they looked awesome,144,11
5297,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good heavy duty needle holder I have been building my emergency surgery kit great product at a great price thank you,20,12
5298,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,these are 185 cm long not the 16 cm as described quality and function are good carbide insert surfaces meet uniformly and lock / unlock tabs function perfectly with 185 cm length they are a little larger than i desired but i can make them work while made with german stainless they are manufactured in pakistan according to the stamped imprint on the device,61,13
5299,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,these are cheap garbage they are absolutely not even close to or grade the needle drivers in disposable suture kits are better,22,14
5300,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was fine works pretty well although they were different from the picture,13,15
5301,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,have not had occasion to use yet went in my shtf kit but appears to be a good quality piece of emergency gear,23,16
5302,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,it was shipped quickly they look legit although they are a little stiff maybe they will loosen up with use,20,17
5303,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,good product there is a slight amount of catch when opening the jaws and a very smallis visible that is light streams through but functionally not an issue unlike another reviewer i received exactly what the description says an olsen-hegar driver with scissor function needle holder,47,18
5304,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,it seems to be great quality and durable I am no professional but it seems to do the job ordered on dec 28 and it said would arrive on jan 10 actually arrived on dec 30 if i could change anything maybe dome paper in it with some info would be nice or specifications be aware that the neck is short and i have small hands but it might be uncomfortable for one with longer hands,75,19
5305,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,4.0,positive,although this products works flawlessly I am taking a star off for mislabeling of this product these needle holders are actually called mayo-hagar needle holders olsen-hagar needle holders have an incorporates scissor portion near the tip fyi in case you are wondering these needle holders can be autoclaved without rusting just shows that even although these are generic they are excellent,60,20
5306,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,this product is poor quality easily rusts and turns grayish rust after putting via autoclave,15,21
5307,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,worst pair of needle holders ever can not open with one hand piece of junk,14,22
5308,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,5.0,positive,good s steel no rust from class b scican bravo autoclave,11,23
5309,Industrial_and_Scientific,B00VNSNMKI,1.0,negative,i am picky about surgical instruments regardless of what i use them for given several years of training in general surgery i think I have earned that right I have found that buying german-made instruments has been a reliable guide to quality not these there is no stamp on them to indicate where they were made but they are absolutely unusable another unhappy reviewer said pakistan so i guess now they are not stamping them at all they are very uncomfortable to hold and use I have never had my fingers hurt from a needle driver before the alignment of the jaws is off and closure is for want of a better term lame i now get to delay my project while i look for something i can actually use photos show the pointy ridge inside the handle rings ouch thebetween the jaws at one click of closure are you freaking kidding me and the malalignment of the jaws seriously this has to be a joke,169,24
5511,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,1.0,negative,it was only average at the time of it is release michael j fox was pretty good in this film but the film goes no whereforgettable on a whole,28,0
5512,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good film depicting the darker side of the 1980s the story behind thecharacter in the film portrayed by michael j fox is one that takes a turn for the worse but leaves the viewer with a glimmer of hope this film encapsulates the indifference of the fast-paced professional world as it collides with the toxic indulgences of the 1980s,65,1
5513,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,it has very little of the brilliance of the book but bright lights big city provides a somewhat entertaining look at the decadent 80s most of the merit resides on michael j fox who manages against great odds to make jamie a relatable character on the verge of self-destruction kiefer sutherland is also great as his sleazy enabler and sidekick phoebe cates on the other hand is the movies worst mistake she has pretty enough but not for one second i bought that she was a runway model how tall is she five five or for that matter that she would inspire such passion from fox,104,2
5514,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,some people may think it is difficult to watch a movie where thespends almost the entire film being a jerk and snorting his paycheck but stick with this one and you witness michael j fox reaching his sort of salvation the score is outstanding 80s especially the donald fagen version of the title song and the closing number watch for a great cameo by jason robards and the painful reward given to keefer sutherland,76,3
5515,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,1.0,negative,man they call people today self-absorbed this movie felt so repetitive how many times do we need to see the main character bolt for a bathroom stall to get high and forced i ended up leaving it on as background noise while doing better things with my time than continue watching the only thing powerful about this movie was how powerfully self-important and tedious it was,66,4
5516,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,this movie was so dissapointing fox did a good job but phoebe cates was only in it for 5 minutes if that and so was dianne wiest although the scene between wiest and fox while she is dying is heartbreaking this movie really goes nowhere but at least the soundtrack is great,52,5
5517,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,5.0,positive,this is one of my favorite 80s films set in new york city night culture based on jay mcinerys classic novel this movie i call the less than zero of the east coast break out character for michael j fox the story mj fox plays jamie conway a cocaine addicted journalist for a new york magazine who can not let go of the past his character really struggles with letting go and adversity phoebe cates plays his model wife who leaves him he just recently lost his mother the flashbacks really show how the past haunts him he is struggling with cocaine addiction going out partying at new york city nightclubs his life is spinning out of control you can not help but feel sorry for his character a film about one mans high expectations on himself without letting go of the past great soundtrack and new york city setting essential to collection a great 80s new york city culture film,150,6
5518,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,4.0,positive,this movie was very consistent with the book if you liked the book made this a very good movie having read the book before seeing the moving gave me a bit more insight into the story but even without reading the book first viewers may watch in disbelief wondering how long will it take for michael j foxs character to kill himself or change his ways suffering through this drives home the ending of the film and makes this the moving story that it is a well done film with a strong cast the soundtrack is not bad either,98,7
5519,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,great movie i had it onbut wanted it for dvd but sadly it was not released in widescreen and not having that option kind of bothers me about dvd releases given all that since i got the disk for free at best buy they offered a free dvd from a small set if you bought the sure thing and valley girl together i can live with this format for now maybe they will do a special edition some day although i doubt it as it was not a high profile film sigh,92,8
5520,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,first touchstone home video releases new york stories in full screen only now mgm does the same thing with bright lights big city is this the beginning of a new trend i sincerely hope not at least give the option of selecting full screen or widescreen on the disc really liked this movie but the dvd release could have been better to say the least i give this 2 stars for dvd quality only one star for that the movie got released in a decent transfer even without widescreen the other that at least they bothered to include the theatrical trailer other than that disappointing,105,9
5521,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,2.0,negative,the first time i saw bright lights big city was when i was pretty young and knew nothing about drugs i also only saw michael j fox in comedies like back to the future and i was absolutely shocked to see him in this type of role my innocent childhood hero looked like a horrible person in this movie because he portrayed a horrible person after watching this film i vowed to never touch a drug in my life and i keep that vow jamie conway foxs character is a cocaine snorting selfish scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock bottom it took me years before i was able to accept fox in other roles after being literally taken in by his performance as far as entertainment value this film keeps you interested but it is not for casually viewing because you will be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that state of mind stays with you did i love the movie no did it do a good job scaring me off the night scene and from experimenting with drugs yes show it in any health class,190,10
5522,Movies_and_TV,6304286481,5.0,positive,even if you do not get the storyline how can you not like the music this is like the ultra eighties music track and i thought the story line was excellent this movie is about an innocent guy nice guy who is trying to make the best of a life that should have been more if you do not like this movie than you must not have a heart,69,11
5543,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i plugged this into my computer and pressed record i was in a 12x17 room and no one as more than 9 feet away from me when i played back the audio i could barely hear anyone i have to attach my speakers to my computer and turn every volume way up i have been continually dissapointed with omni-directional microphones,60,0
5544,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,while some people complain about this mic to me if it is connected with mic preamp with enough phantom power it really shines much better than using the battery that comes with it i purchased two of it for stereo recording connected directly via tcc tc-720 stereo microphone / riaa phono pre-amp preamp preamplifier and interconnect the preamp output to the line-in in the pc sound card not to mic-in which provide a very good quality capture from all directions but you will have to record in a quiet room to avoid recording unwanted sounds anyway with these combo you will not be disappointed highly recommended,105,1
5545,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i tried this microphone out and it really was not worth the money it recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones and while that is the point of a uni-directional microphone to dampen out background noise this seemed to be creating some interferance of it is own I am sending mine back,49,2
5546,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i purchasd two of these microphones to record conversations during data gathering meetings using a computer i was using tools such as camtasia and audacity the mics did not pick up enough of the conversation to be useful i tried four different computers with the same result they did not meet our requirements i purchased a more expensive sony ecm-f01 and it works as described great so i am stuck with two mics that do not perform,77,3
5547,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,this mic is surprisingly poor quality for a brand name like audio-technica the sound is distant and thin and basically makes the mic unusable for a speakerphone,27,4
5548,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,1.0,negative,i managed to get sound into my pc only when the recording settings are set close to maximum even then the mic had to be fairly close to my face to record my voice audibly definitely not what you would expect from an omnidirectional condenser boundary microphone a waste of money,50,5
5549,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i bought this mic with the intention to use it in an interview while it does function pretty well when it is about one inch from your mouth audio quality rapidly degrades any further than that the audio it picked up at 3 feet had to be amplified beyond reason everything maximized to get almost normal speech volume and when i did the audio quality was worse than what you would from a cell phone call admittedly I am using a mac to test this on and they have unpowered mic jacks as opposed to pcs typical powered and unpowered varieties since the mic uses a battery i do not think the lack of a powered jack was the issue but since i do not have a pc to test it on i can not say any more than for mac users to stay away from this product the microphone built into your mac is likely far superior I am returning this product,157,6
5550,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,works as well as expected for 3000 picking up non-directional sounds was delivered in or less than the time specified all is well,23,7
5551,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i have been happy with the atr97 for years it captures voice very well it is compact and unobtrusive the one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it and run the battery down and then there has no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result but overall it is a stylish boundary microphone i also like it because it resembles aor more accurately our domestic military industrial complexs arv alien reproduction vehicle enjoy,104,8
5552,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,it is now sometime I have had this product it works fine as i got it i was able to use it even from the room next to the mike as battery goes down the radius of action decrease accordingly battery life depends on how long you use it and other conditions I have already changed battery ones but i do use this mike quite a bit i would not call it a major drawback it works ok and that is what counts,81,9
5553,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i can not beleive the sound that this captures i use it running to a small digital recorder as a backup for main sound at depostitions i could use this for the main sound it is that good last week i placed it on the floor in the middle of a room about 10x14 it picked up every voice perfectly my main sound had a terrible buzz in it from some electrical source and this was perfectly clear plug it into a zoom h2/4 and you have a really nice sound unit conference rooms podiums at conventions you can depend on it,101,10
5554,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,2.0,negative,i purchased this product refurbished from beach camera and within 90 days it stopped working on any computer or amplifier that i used it with no sound came in besides a click when i turned the switch on or off and brief electronic noise when i plugged it in or took it out of the computer i would suggest that if you are thinking about buying this product pay at least 25 for a high quality new one,78,11
5555,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,4.0,positive,i bought this microphone so i could record conversations in a meeting room it is a great improvement over the built-in mic on my digital voice recorder it does not pick up every voice at the far end of the table but it has been sufficient for my needs i wish it had a light on the top as a power-on indicator I have forgotten to turn it on but that is my only complaint overall i think it is a good value,78,12
5556,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,i was doing my videos for national board certification and to my horror found that my students could not be heard audio-technica to the rescue with the included adapter it fit perfectly into the ancient video camera at my school and my problem was solved,45,13
5557,Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3V,5.0,positive,just want to tell everyone that previous to this purchase we had problems in recording and broadcasting the conversation of our clubhouse board meetings which composed of 6 to ten people seated around a long a 20 ft conference table the voices recorded were not very clear and picks up hiss and lot of background noices when learning of this product we bought 2 sets and placed them apart on our conference table to our delight the recording became very loud and clear and devoid of hiss and annoying background noices i give it a 5 star to this wonderful mic,100,14
5997,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,2.0,negative,the clip on the neck strap is too big you have to jam it on the cleaning brush is too thick gets stuck easily the end cap actually broke off inside my clarinet reeds are very low quality,38,0
5998,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,4.0,positive,as per described but would be nicer if had a container of some sort items are just loose,18,1
5999,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,5.0,positive,i purchased thisor my daughter and she uses it daily she has had no issues well worth the price,21,2

6003,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,5.0,positive,exactly as described however i thought that the cleaning cloth would be one of the weighted ones for cleaning the clarinet or any of the woodwinds because the description does not state what type of cleaning cloth i can not hold them responsible,42,6
6004,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,4.0,positive,as described shipped fast good price would buy from again,11,7

6009,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,1.0,negative,i did not receive cork grease it was one of the main reasons i chose this package,16,12
6010,Musical_Instruments,B00VNSU378,1.0,negative,cork grease was missing from the kit certainly not 5-in-1,10,13

6155,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i had this printer for about 1 1/2 years only and it already broke down i was never happy with the software it comes with it is cumbersome overloads your computer with heavy code that is unnecessary freezes all the time and takes a whole lot of time to install and i have a decent 18ghz cpu 1 gb ram computer i just wanted something that allows you to scan and print this is my 2nd hp printer first one was also a multifunctional and was also frustrated with the software i decided to go for another hp to give them another chance but now I am convinced will never buy a hp again,110,4
6156,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i purchased my hp 1410 a few days ago and i am delighted with it i owned an hp 1210 a few years ago and kept it until i wore it out and really liked it so i got the next best thing i like it because the computer is not needed to just make text copies or printing pictures for the money i do not think one can find a better little printer and it does not take up much desk space at all i am so glad i found it and at a less expensive price regards hl ragan greenville texas,102,5
6157,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I have had the printer for some time now and i agree with everyone on here who mentioned how fast the ink goes in bothblack but what really makes me mad is that the printer jammed one time and now it is busted when i went to print in sucked in all the paper and now it does not work thanks for making this in china like everything else that is made there it is junk,73,6
6158,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,when the cartridges are replaced the machine automatically runs a test page fair enough however for some time now it runs the test page every time it is turned on on tech assistance web sites many others report the same problem forget hp tech support this machine is a cartridge-eater avoid,51,7
6159,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,everything is designed to be an inconvenience every time you turn it on a full page test print is done and wastes ink it prints horribly fails consistently and is awkward to use in every respect it jams and does not feed correctly print processes will hang endlessly stay away no matter what,52,8
6160,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,a printer is a printer i am more impressed with the editing of scanned pictures i scanned pictures from 20 years ago and they look like new pictures the image editting software is easy to use i quit using the software that came with my computer and the software that came with my camera i only use hps software now,60,9
6161,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i bought this printer around mid 2005 it worked well printing and scanning my usage is very low i print a few pages a month and maybe scan a few pages a month some time ago the scanner just stopped working all scanned pages came blank i tried to contact hp support but they could not fix it concluding that i should exchange my all-in-one with a new one i bought an hp because i thought it would be a relable printer for a long time now i am stuck with an all-in-one that can print and not scan,102,10
6162,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i have had this piece of garbage for over a year shame on me for keeping it you get what you pay for noisiest clanking and banging back and forth i have used more ink just resetting this so called consumer best buy just try and print out an envelope i have tried to allign after each new cartridge and i get error cartridge stuck or page did not finish printing i hope this machine is outdated and would not recommend this to anyone save the money frustrated in jersey,84,11
6163,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,i have nothing negative to say about this printer it works perfectly and i have had no problems it is quiet and much quicker than my last printer so i am happy my ink runs out fast but that is because my 8 year old seems to think she has to print everything she sees [ ] just wanted to pass this info because i am sure there is someone out there that appreciates saving money as much as i do,80,12
6164,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is easy to set up and use for the person who uses it every now and then,19,13
6165,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the psc 1410 is simple and easy to use but it has the smallest capacity 5 ml print cartridges I have ever seen be prepared to buy new ink cartridges every week,34,14
6166,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,i have not been having any trouble actually using the printer however it goes through ink very quickly the hp site reckons you will get apporximately 150 pages but i do not think it is anywhere near that i would be surprised if you get through 50 pages before running out of ink I am referring to black ink i try not to use the colour too much but it appears to be running out quite fast too if you want a printer that you can use fairly often say 10 pages per week then i would not recommend this,98,15
6167,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,2.0,negative,I am not sure what to say about this it has been a very frustrating product for me after every page i print i get two errors one says that the ink cartridge cradle can not move and the other error says paper jam the paper i have in the tray is not jammed in i have looked repeatedly for any obstruction i even shined a flashlight inside and i am baffled as to what is causing the error no other printer has given me this much frustration i have sought help and even my sisters husband computer repair is his specialty is confused as to what the problem is i would not recommend this printer for anyone,116,16
6168,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviewers comments about the ink cartridges hp has totally scammed their customers by putting so little ink in the cartridges required for this printer I have had this printer about six months and I have already spent more than the cost of the printer on ink and it needs more again my last printer was from hp and i was happy with it i got totally burned on this one guess what brand my next printer will not be,81,17
6169,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,it is very simple to print in black and white and save theink for when you really want to use it pull out theink cartridge when you hit print you will have one button to push to tell the printer to print anyway and that is all there is to it since i print many pages of college level papers i find this printer to be so good that I am ordering a second one i broke the first ones glass by knocking a tv table into it but it still works the cartridges last a long time a person with no technology know-how whatsoever can use it me i admit it and the person who really knows computers will love it too i can not speak highly enough of the quality of the print and photographic work and the cartridges are available everywhere i got a free dell printer with my laptop but i want another hp also i can copy pages from books since the top can accomodate thick hardcover books,172,18
6170,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,past inkjet printer died and i needed a new one fast and at a low price this fit the bill plus i could get rid of my old scanner to boot it seems to be printing and scaning fine and quility is good have not had it long enough to use all the options yet i have had it long enough to find so far the only draw back ink the cost of cartridges are a little steep,77,19
6171,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,I have been using this multi-purpose printer for the past 6 months and i have not had any problems with it yet the print quality is good and scanning is decent but not as quick as some stand alone scanners,38,20
6172,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,this printer is so good it has never let me down it has great graphic quality and will look just like the original if you scan,26,21
6173,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,1.0,negative,the printer is not more than an ordniary inkjet and they changed the ink cartridge size to very small ones so you keep buying them it seems but the worst part of this printer is the software that goes with it if you want to install all the features be ready to let go of 780 mb of space that has to be bloatware incompetent programming if you choose the light version you will only need 384 mb of disk space how can this be i regret having bought this hp printer and it will be my last from them,96,22
6174,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,i got this printer actually the hp 1401 from walmart for 49 bucks a couple of weeks ago when i went on maternity leave since then i have printed over 100 christmas letters 4 lost dog posters including large pictures printed return address labels with graphics scanned my medical release from my doctor and emailed it to my work and printed tons of recipes this thing does it all i bought an extra ink cartridge under 15 bucks and still have not needed it great buy,85,23
6175,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,this was a great buy for an all in one device i needed something at a decent price that could copy scan and print this was definitely it it came quicker than expected in the mail and it prints off copies really fast hooking it up was very easy too i recommend this for anyone looking into all-in-ones,58,24
6176,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,5.0,positive,I am a college student and i mainly use this printer to print out documents and photos so far so good i love the fact that this printer is very compact it is not like those humongous all-in-ones that not only are heavy but take up a lot of space this printer is as wide and as light as a regular desktop and prints pretty quickly i really love it i have absolutely no complaints,73,25
6177,Office_Products,B0009ORG18,4.0,positive,nice to have it all together in one package i will be out of luck if it fails service was excellent from amazon don maxwell,25,26
6193,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,it worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month I am so exasperated a previous panasonic cordless phone i had was muffled for the person i was talking to apparently with this phone they can hear my clearly but i can barely hear a word they are saying sometimes it is really hard to hear and other times it is downright impossible either way terrible it is like having your tv on volume setting 1 you can hear there is some kind of faint noise but you just can not make out anything being said,99,0
6194,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,this phone has every feature i was looking for and alot more too it is very simple to set up and is user friendly i love it,28,1
6195,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,the unit provides crystal clear phone service in conjunction with a dsl and wifi system it does what it says it does it is well worth the price,28,2
6196,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,phones work just like they are supposed to my wife wishes they came with clips so you could carry them around the house or yard while doing other things overall a good value,33,3
6197,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,excellent clarity user friendly for programming does not have capability for receiving messages,13,4
6198,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i used this phone once and put it back in it is annoyingly complex packaging for return to start the handsets are poorly designed on my first call i twice hung up on my callers since the off button is located exactly where you would rest the phone against your cheek besides this two of the three handsets had communication problems with the base even when they were in direct sight of the base such that they could not maintain a constant dial tone and kept cutting out,87,5
6199,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i recently purchased the four handset version of this system and am very pleased with it all of the features are convenient and work well and the voice quality is very good one feature i especially like is that it can store up to 50 names and phone numbers in each handset and once programmed in one handset entries can easily be tranferred to the other handsets if desired another convenient feature is that the system can be used as an intercom with each handset capable of calling each of the other handsets this is the most complete and most convenient phone system I have ever had and i like the quality and reliability of panasonic products note however that this model is just a versatile cordless phone system and does not include an answering system this feature is included in model kx-tg5633 which also has all of the features discussed above,151,6
6200,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,we have always considered panasonic phones and their other gear to be first rate but the volume on these phones even with all possible boost applied is much too low other reviewers on the target website have noted the same we have returned them for a set of well-rated uniden phones from amazon and are hoping for better results it is good that amazon has a fair return policy that makes this kind of disappointment less annoying,75,7
6201,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i can not believe that this panasonic 58 ghz can not hold a candle to the verizon 900 mhz i gave up for this phone i could not hear my party at all buzzing noise horrible stay away from this phone returning today,41,8
6202,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,this phone has it all as far as features as long as you do not want to actually hear the people you are talking to worked good for about a week and then could not hear anyone buzzing and sounded like people were standing next to an electric tower i tried several ways to fix the problem once i went back to my uniden 24 ghz i could hear great save your money,71,9
6203,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,number entry from the handset keypad does not work properly this evidences itself in 2 ways 1 long phone numbers such as international do not dial properly 2 keypad activated programs like prescription refills do not recognize the numbers otherwise the phone worked fine except the handset volume was very weak even with the enhancement turned on but the number entry problem was extremely frustrating and a major issue for me i returned the phone and bought a uniden which seems to work fine,84,10
6204,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,this phone has no back light on the key pad you can not see the key pad if you have to make a call in the middle of the night and or darkness this is a big deal panasonic phones used to have back lit key pads also you can hear a back ground buzz or white noise sound while you are on a call you and your callers will think i can not hear you now poor design,76,11
6205,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,the phones work great no problems at all reception is excellent i would reccommend,14,12
6206,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this phone was exactly what i needed i wanted a phone without an answering machine to put on a wall outlet i wanted at least 1 extra handset that did not need to be plugged into a phone jack with this phone i got an extra one lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones you can even assign different colors and rings to different callers one thing i do not like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from there are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone i have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and have not had a problem with either one the phone is pretty easy to program but i did have to read the instruction booklet,143,13
6207,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,super if you have any type of interference from your computer dial up conection this is the phone to have even if you do not this phone is easy has great options love it absolutly no problems,37,14
6208,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i love my phone it has all of the features i wanted and more the sound is also great i could not be happier,23,15
6209,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,this cordless phone has the best reception of any cordless telephone we have previously owned so far we like the feature of conference calling between three handsets the paging option for the handsets is another great feature to page another handset during a call to include another person in the conversation or to contact another person near one of the other handsets instead of yelling down the stairs the flashing lighted ring around the top of the antenna makes it convenient to locate the handset in the dark when you are receiving a call,94,16
6210,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,you can not go wrong with this phone I have always been a fan of panasonic phones I have still got 3 old panasonic cordless phones that just will not die pros feels solid and comfortable in your hands sound quality is good even at a good distance from the home base speaker phone is clear and callers can hear me well blinking light on antenna for voice messages black and greyis attractive and looks good almost anywhere in house cons i wish the keypad had a backlight when you scroll through calls the name and number are not on the same screen,102,17
6211,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,lots of good featuresunfortunatly the most important feature of a phone is clarity and this phone system does not deliver hard to hear your conversations,25,18
6212,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,after having tried two other systems i found this one really worked well the handsets are very functional and the sound quality is excellent the speakerphone capability has proved handy i did not think i would use the intercom feature much but it turns out to be very handy given it comes with three handets we put all throughout the house,60,19
6213,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,where to begin very difficult to hear even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets programming is not as easy as many other brands those are just a few of my concerns I shall pick a uniden model next time,57,20
6214,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,i have had these phones for a week now and at first they worked great and one week later you can hardly hear the person on the other end this is my second set i returned the first set for the same problem n hopes that it was just bad phones but the second set is just as horrible do not waist your money,63,21
6215,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,overall i really like this phone great features and more however like some of the other reviewers who have posted here my phone began buzzing almost immediately so badly that i could not hear the person on the other end they could hear me fine since i have digital phone service connected to my dsl modem i followed the owners manual tip and bought a noise filter this worked fine for about a week then the buzzing returned i bought another filter thinking the first one had crapped out but the buzzing persisted i even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment which was in perfect working order i was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone so after much frustration I am returning this to amazon today luckily it has not been 30 days since delivery yet beware when considering buying this unit,151,22
6216,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,i bought these phones on the recommedation of a family member and i could not be more thrilled these are the best phones that we have ever used the sound quality is unbelievable and they had all the features we were looking for i have to emphtically disagree with some of the other reviews on this page you will not be sorry with this product,63,23
6217,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,have not had the buzzing problems people have written about very nice range and clarity,14,24
6218,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,1 there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base 2 phone features worked as advertised but the voice enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse 3 it was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset i returned it mainly because of the buzzing,62,25
6219,Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,at first i thought this phone had everything and it is loaded with features and has a good range however after using it for about 5 weeks i now have a very very loud buzzing noise on all the handsets it appears to come from the base and it is so loud i can barely hear the caller i have tested this base on other jacks still same problem and i have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack and they work fine with no buzz I am convinced it is in the base unit of the panasonic phone but after multiple email customer service attempts at panazonic i have not yet heard anything from this company I am scrapping the phone and buying a much cheaper but more highly rated at t,133,26
6411,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,this is perfect for what i was looking for very rich and classy looking i would def look at other produces made by satechi,24,0
6412,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,thought the product itself looked nice but the adhesive holding it together is already separating on day one no way to contact seller except for returningwould be willing to keep it for a discounted cost can glue it myself,40,1
6413,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,a beautiful leather-looking desk pad it was beautifully packed and shipped very well the pad is sturdy and reversible for long life on my desk which is glossy and slippery i needed to purchase some velcro to prevent the pad from sliding when i moved my laptop this is a purchase you will love,54,2
6414,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,i am going to buy another one as soon as i finish this review it is the nicest desk pad i have ever owned,24,3
6415,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,great quality and has a wonderful feel to it only downside is that it is thicker than i would have liked,21,4
6416,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,I have had the pad for roughly 18 months and it is still quite functional i have not had any major problems as i gently use for my keyboard and mouse no mouse pad needed i really like the size on how easy it is to keep clean a simple wipe does the trick another thing i like about it is that it at least in my case is resilient to scratches scuffs and dents however the glue and stitching it poor is some areas especially when the humidity is high that being said it serves it is purpose very nicely,101,5
6417,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,cheaply built filled with cardboard and split at the seams right away glued it back together and serves the purpose but way over priced,24,6
6418,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,product is nice but the shipping packaging allowed one corner to get smashed up fortunately that corned can be hidden under my desktop speaker,24,7
6419,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,for the price this is pretty much what i was expecting it does not look feel or smell like anything more than coated cardboard but serves the purpose just fine,29,8
6420,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,matte black and great oversized option for a desk only complaint was it came bent on one corner i think due to packaging being not the best,27,9
6421,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,the desk pad de-laminated size and surface were nice but the fact that fell apart would certainly prevent me from purchasing thisagain i returned theand purchased something different,32,10
6422,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,5.0,positive,bought this pad along with one by satechi and have been satisfied with both of them nice quality and provides the perfect density for writing support has a simple esthetic quality and just the right size for my needs overall a good purchase and while it seemed a bit expensive at the time in comparison to other products and for the quality of the merchandise i am quite satisfied,69,11
6423,Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,the desk pad delaminated after about two weeks can not recommend it do not buy this desk pad do not buy this desk pad,21,12
7184,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,I am satisfied with this purchase it is true that the screen is hard to read from an angle but i do not find that too inconvenient it has a forecast feature that i do not understand where is it getting that information from the manual does not say anyhow it tells the time temperature and humidity which is why i bought it,60,0
7185,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,i liked the design and style of this product it is also very comfortable to see time and temperature at the same time,22,1
7186,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,made in china unit was missing terminals for batteries to connect had to make terminals out of aluminum foil did not want the hassel of taking back to the post office and returning after buiding terminals got unit to work why can not we make a clock in the united states,48,2
7187,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,plus side it displays the temperature and humidity down side horrible documentation and as other reviewers have said the screen is awful hardly visible except at very specific angles it reminds me of my powerbook 520c from 1994 display technology has come a long way since then but nobody told la crosse also there are little emoticons on the display but it only ever looks like and i have nowhat that means,75,3
7188,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,5.0,positive,a nice and fair priced product i especially like the illumination feature so you can easily read it when the lighting is low seems to be very accurate and responds quickly / well to temperature changes,34,4
7189,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,i wanted a cheap digital humidity gauge for my condo this one works well but has a major flaw the display is only visible from a certain angle above the unit i can not read it on my desk sitting down but if i stand up i can see the numbers i bought two one to mount on the wall but if i did that i would not be able to read it at all anything would be better i know this is a low cost unit but really this is the worst I have seen for viewing angles,96,5
7190,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,can i give it zero stars my needs are simple and i do not even care if it is hard to read but this thing simply does not work it sounds the little beep when batteries are inserted but then does not respond when you press the mode / set thingie or any of the other buttons for that matter I am not an idiot with electronic devices so i assume that it is defective the websites support consists of an email form to contact the company and the manufacturer wants a 5 postage fee for returning it i can probably get a refund from the retailer but this is turning into a lot of work,109,6
7191,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,1.0,negative,whether or not this product provides accurate climate data is academic because you generally have to be an acrobat to read it you must be situated at the precise vertical angle from the display or the screen appears totally blank however since the expense to return it exceeded the price of thewe just use it for a paperweight guess this purchase confirms the old adage about getting what you pay for,73,7
7192,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,this is a nice weather station for a bedroom or other room in your house so far i have not had any problems with it,24,8
7193,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,5.0,positive,amazoncom is always a great source for my purchases the la crosse desk clock is no exception great quality delivered as promised and the bike was in great shape,29,9
7194,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,after owning it a few months the volume stopped working also i was hoping i could still see the time in the dark without the full light displayed which is really bright no dim light so i have to reach over and feel around then pick it up off the floor after i knock it down and figure out where the light button is I am in the market for a new clock,72,10
7195,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,2.0,negative,i was very disappointed thedid not work thisis cheaply madei did not check the reviews before i bought the,24,11
7196,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B003U6YR00,4.0,positive,it has all the features i need date and time temperature and humidity i have used it for the all winter it works fine for me,26,12
7219,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,5.0,positive,this is a great product of high quality and attractiveness it is exactly as advertised and the chrome is thick and well put on there is a clip on the end but for the bottom of the flag we just use a twist to go throught the bottom ringlet of the flag and around the base end of theworks great,62,0
7220,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,4.0,positive,product was what was descripted and it came within 3 days i was happy with this productgood price too,20,1
7221,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,1.0,negative,initially i thought this was fine but it failed after a few weeks of being installed outdoors the problem is that the bearings are not stainless and thus they have rusted once exposed to the rain once rusted the rotating section no longer rotates smoothly and the flag ends up wrapped around the,55,2
7222,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,1.0,negative,how can you send awithout the rings that attach the flags worthless that was not clear when i purchased thewaste of my time,27,3
7223,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,5.0,positive,i love this unbelievably i have probably had 6 wooden flag poles they always rot inside of theholder the flag never wraps around theno matter how windy it is well worth the money,36,4
7224,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,1.0,negative,i received thisas advertised unfortunately but noticed it did not have a revolving hook for the bottom end of the flag then i saw the instructions said to insert the flag from the bottom of themeaning you must have a flag with a sewn loop large enough to accept the entire 1through the short side of the flag never thought about this when buying online i have 3 us flags and none of them have this feature only the standard two brass eyelets this flagpole is useless do not buy this,97,5
7225,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,4.0,positive,nicebut i assumed thewas self correcting would spin on it is own but it requires you to manually turn thebut at least you do not need to flip the flag over or take theout of the bracket i also ordered the wrong flag one with eyelets in 3x5 for theand it did not work with theso i called toland and asked which flag i should have ordered and was told that it requires a toland home garden 101266 united states standard flag 28-inch by 40-inch by toland home garden which slides over theand has a cloth loop inside at the top which attaches to the clip at the top of theit looks great and works great with the,131,6
7226,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,2.0,negative,I am disappointed because the flag just wraps around the,10,7
7227,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,2.0,negative,i bought this flag10 months ago and i now have to replace it the issue is that the plastic ring which allows the flag to spin has become brittle and the pin that is hooked on the the plastic ring had rusted and when i tried to remove the pin from the flags grommet the brittle plastic of the spinner broke off i will have to look for a more dependable flagas this 20did not even last one year i would not buy this product again,92,8
7228,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,4.0,positive,works good but not as good as it said,9,9
7229,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,5.0,positive,my husband and i like to hang banners for all occasions and where our house is situated between the mountains we have a really strange wind pattern our banners were always tangled no matter what kind ofwe used thisnot only looks attractive but it does keep the flag or banner untangled would highly recommend,58,10

7232,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,1.0,negative,after being put up with a new flag this spinningstopped spinning because the bearings rusted i oiled it lightly and got it to start spinning only to have it fall apart within the next month never was there any storm conditions that would have been extreme action on thisit just came apart the chrome plastic finiale was on the ground the spinning portion of theand flag on the ground do not trust thisif you are going to use it outside,88,13
7233,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,2.0,negative,did not last bearings failed after less than one year,10,14

7235,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,4.0,positive,the flagcame in a timely manner and was packaged well the total length of the flagis 411 the top 31 spins so that the flag does not wrap around thein windy situations the maximum flag size for thisto function as it is supposed to is 2 x 3 i had to buy another flag because my flag is 3 x 5 which was probably my error in buying this particular,79,16
7236,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B004AHLV7A,5.0,positive,this flagis sturdy and attractive it fits nicely in a standard bracket i have had it out for about a week and have not experienced any problems with my flag wrapping around thei am hoping that it will last longer than my old wood poles which always ended up rotting,54,17
7348,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,although this is a very very sturdy product and it is as shown it is very heavy but this biggest problem is the taste of it my dogs would not put it in their mouth they would run away every time i got the toy out so i started smelling it and it has a plastic / rubber smell to it and taste yes i tried it if my dogs can put it in their mouth then i want to know what is in it i have kept them because they are just too cute maybe someday i can get a picture but that is about all i will be able to do with them i am sorry because i really wanted them and thought that my dogs would have funhumunga tongue large for medium large xlarge dogs,138,0
7349,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my dog absolutely loves this tongue she literally wore her other one down to a little nub and i could not find one at any stores i found this and was so excited i ordered it and had it within a few days my dog puts it in her mouth and runs around with it she sleeps with it and takes it everywhere she looks so funny worth every penny,69,1
7350,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my scottish terrier loves these toys this is the 4th and 5th ones we have bought and duff plays with them just about every night,25,2
7351,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the rubber feels relatively durable and this is a great toy for photo opportunities however within less than 5 minutes my boxer / hound started chipping away from the tip of the tongue he is pretty hard on toys although my other two dogs probably would have savored it for a few days before focus turned to destroying it,57,3
7352,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,my shepard mix had the ball section of the toy ripped apart in less than 5 minutes it is advertised as durable but it is not do not buy if your dog chews at all if possible i would give it 0 stars,43,4
7353,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this dog toy has packaging that warns that it is not to be chewed with good advice because the rubber merely crumbles apart even in my hands no small choking hazzard and a lousy toy that the dog is not even supposed to play with,44,5
7354,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for my daughters dogs they treated it like any chew toy we did not get the results that were shown in the photo their little mouths do not fit around the ball portion of the tongue if you are purchasing this for photos do not bother huge disappointment,51,6
7355,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,great fun for pet and family and better than all stimulates people to play more often with your pet fantastic,20,7
7356,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i have two small dogs and both love this toy it always gets laughs from on-lookers but it does not float if you plan on using it near water,29,8
7357,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,new puppy is quite the chewing machine she enjoyed this toy a lot and it has lasted quite a long time about a quarter of it is missing but still loved by my dog she does not tend to pick it up by the ball part although so the silliness quotient is lessened,52,9
7358,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,very pleased and so is our dog it is strong enough for him as he is an active chewer,19,10
7359,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for our 60 lb lab mix and although he has enjoying playing with what has left of it it is only taken him about 15 minutes to get it to this point shredded to pieces by my estimate having paid around 15 for the thing this is a 60 / hour toy as you would need four of them to last a full hour as an aside I am a little annoyed at the fancy boutique pet shop that sold it to me it is one thing if i picked it up at kmart or some other discount store where i would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that i was buying a piece of crap but in this case i think it is incumbent upon the owner / operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had to be candid about just how delicate thisis I had be much more inclined to patronize his business if he had done so,165,11
7360,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a cute toy but was not lab tested until yesterday and did not survive as it has a rip in it so it will be going back in the toy box too bad it did not last longer so that we could get a cute picture also picture shows 2 and you only get one,56,12
7361,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it is very cute and funny but my bulldog chewed it up right away thank goodness he did not eat the pieces he chewed off,25,13
7362,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it appears to be a tough toy but it is not great for a photo opportunity,15,14
7363,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,the ball that the dog has to put in it is mouth is way too big and makes the whole thing way too heavy dog just chews on the ends,28,15
7364,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,we gave this to our puppy who is about 17 lbs he does not hold the ball in his mouth because it is too heavy for him but the long tongue is great for distracting him from chewing on the furniture he is satisfied to sit and chew on this for a long time,53,16
7365,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,i have 3 large labs and they were not interested at all too heavy and hard my dogs did not like it,23,17
7366,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this is my dogs favorite toy very sturdy i wish all the other toys this sturdy they last a long time,20,18
7367,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this works great as a fetch toy and it sure does bring a smile to your face when they run around with the large tongue sticking out of their mouth it works great for games such as tug-o-war or fetch but you do have to keep an eye on them if your dog is a chewer i have a boxer / mastiff mix and he is a very powerful chewer i was not paying much attention and he chewed the end of the tongue off in less than 60 seconds so it does not hold up in any way against a chewer so i moved it to an outside toy we have already had many hours of fun with fetch and tug-o-war i totally recommend this product although it was chewed a bit i am very happy with my purchase and plan on buying the smaller size for my small dog the seller also has great customer service so that is just a huge plus if your debating on if you should buy this let me make the decision for you buy it,178,19
7368,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,this is a great toy both our terriers play tug of war with it and love it will buy again,20,20
7369,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i got a bigger kick out of this than the dog did i think the ball part is a little big not really sturdy enough for my pit bull not to destroy either,33,21
7370,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,great toy but i really should have ordered a smaller size i own a corgi which is a big dog in a small body and need to always order big dog toys because she tends to use or abuse them in a big dog way and even although the larger toy might be a bit hard to carry in her mouth i still am satisfied with the purchase,67,22
7371,Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,this is a very tempting buy but do not bother our 60 lb black lab had it in pieces within 3 minutes we then closely read the packaging and it said it is a fetching toy not a chew toy it is a tongue are you serious not a chew toy stick w kongs very sturdy and durable oh and avoid the mustaches too from this company they are thinner and likely the same poor quality rubber,73,23
8124,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,hearty soup with chunks of meat potatoes and carrots,9,0
8125,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,pot roast i expected more from progresso i had to purchase in a multi-pack so now i have cans to donate i suppose nasty flavor,25,1
8126,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,2.0,negative,too much broth not enough meat and potatoes,8,2
8127,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,this is my favorite soup flavor i would buy from seller again,12,3
8128,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,soup has good flavor it is a thinner soup with broth but plenty of meat and veggies in it,19,4
8129,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,2.0,negative,watery broth overaged beef taste will not purchase again even my 18-year-old son does not like it so disappointing to think we cold find a good gluten free option for the cupboard going to donate the rest of the cans to the food bank maybe we are just picky,48,5
8130,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,got this for my boyfriend one of his favorites by progresso never disappoints,13,6
8131,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,this is not a pack of 4 as the description reads i only received 1 individual can 5 for one can is absolutely ridiculous,24,7
8132,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,good soup would recommend and buy again i prefer most of the progresso soups over campbells except for the basic add water chicken noodle when I am not feeling well reminds me of my childhood and how uncomplicated life seemed back then,41,8
8133,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,2.0,negative,normally i buy another brand but decided to go with these guys in a recent order in short after pouring it into a bowl just before heating it up it just seemed like a watered down bowl of nothing just very cheap looking definitely not the rich and hearty experience i was expecting from the labeling did not even waste my time heating it up just ended up just pouring it down the garbage disposal,74,9
8134,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,i only received 1 can it was supposed to be a pack of 4 can,15,10
8135,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,surprisingly good for a soup this cheap has whole onions and everything plus it is quite filling you will not be hungry afterwards,22,11
8136,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,really good soup for those cold days or the days when cooking is out of the question will order again as my local store does not carry this flavor,29,12
8137,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,4.0,positive,this was not for my liking but i put some over some mashed potatoes minus a little liquid for my neighbor along with a salad and she loved it good ratio of broth to veggies to meat i just do not like so much salt other than that it is good,53,13
8138,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,5.0,positive,good mix with dinty moore and you can add some extra stuff if you want to cook some more ingredients with it,22,14
8139,Prime_Pantry,B015Z83BWU,1.0,negative,very weird taste like you wanted a grill taste so you added an artificial flavor that is supposed to imitate a grill taste or something but came out all wrong i threw away the whole can after trying just a bite,41,15
8175,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,very tasty smoked salmon it is just a very small piece for nearly 6,13,0
8176,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,oh wow this is the real deal for smoked salmon small but packed with flavor very juicy not cheap but not cheap tasting either great value,26,1
8177,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,smoked to perfection i pair this with bagels-n-cream cheese for the best breakfast lunch anytime sandwich in the world,19,2
8178,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,2.0,negative,very small amount and a strong fishy taste,8,3
8179,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,fresh and perfect for a small meal or add to salad or make a salmon dip delish,17,4
8180,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,not bad at all but still very fishy needs more seasoning,11,5
8181,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,2.0,negative,super small amounts flavor was a little off for us I shall buy from our local store next time,18,6
8182,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,i have ordered alaska smokehouse smoked salmon fillet twice the last time i ordered two packages i love salmon but grow more hesitant to eat my relatives from the highly toxic ocean i like this salmon i can make two small meals with each package bagels and cream cheese it is obvious that the alaska smokehouse takes pride in their product and packaging the inner vacuum foil pack is sturdy and easy to open the colors and the design of the cardboard package are pleasing to the eye,88,7
8183,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,4.0,positive,it is tastes good and is a easy way to get salmon in your diet however the fillet is a bit overpriced for the small portion,25,8
8184,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,came in box with dry goods was not refrigerated when i went to open the package to use at the smell was so bad we had to throw it out I have had smoked salmon many times before and it is never smelled as bad as what i got,48,9
8185,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,5.0,positive,most delicious experience yet delightful it is expensive but a perfect appetizer will reorder for sure,15,10
8186,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,old salmon makes for smelly tough fish overpriced not good,10,11
8187,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,1.0,negative,this product should have tasted like lox it is more like dried fish,13,12
8188,Prime_Pantry,B01COSMU2G,2.0,negative,had a strong fishy smell not smoke smoky flavor and had a very congealed / wet texture very low quality product at least compared to the smoked salmon I am accustomed to,29,13
8429,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
8430,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
8431,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,the other reviewer does not seem to like this product maybe it is his computer but I am also using a macbook running snow leopard and i love this software it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per song but that is exactly how long they say it should take this program fixed my 3000 song library really fast and there has only like 50 or so songs that do not have the correct album art but it is way better than before and worth the money if your still unsure about this program there is a trial you can get at their webstite that will clean 100 songs i recommend it,104,2
8432,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,i used it for two windows xp computers one one it worked fine with 2 gb ram and on the other it locked up several times 1 gb ram i suspect you might have issues if you do not have at least 2 gb overall i am very pleased with it i cleaned up a library of over 5000 songs with a high degree of accuracy although a handful of songs were overwritten with titles in foreign alphabets nothings perfect but i feel like i got a lot of value out of it,92,3
8433,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not purchase tuneup does not work do not waist your money not worth it company does not care no product support likely to be going out of business soon,30,4
8434,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this program works great does what it says it will do and is easy to use i would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean up their music library it does what itunes will not do,37,5
8435,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product delivers as advertised it does a good job of straightening out tags and filling in all the information to test it first i took 5 songs and changed the tags incorrectly tune-up corrected all of them successfully my only complaint is that it is a little slower than i would like but i have a 9000 song library this is definitely worth the 40 lifetime price,70,6
8436,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this product some time ago and wanted to come on here to warn others against buying this software not only does it incorrectly tag many songs it takes a tremendous time to do so and freezes constantly i have used the program on two different computers including a macbook pro and it has frozen on both it may do an acceptable job of identifying fairly well-known rock songs but good luck if your collection includes hip hop electronic or certain older songs even common rock such as the rolling stones steer clear of this product it will save you a lot of hassle,105,7
8437,Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
8438,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
8439,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i actually bought the software in a store and upon installation it promptly downloaded an update this update simply does not recognize my activation code that came with the store software but acts like a free trial version and cheerfully let us me know that i have run out of my free service so i go to the website convinced that this certainly must be a mistake but it is not the new service works as annual or lifetime service for additional fee that is it became a webservice instead of a standalone application but they forgot to notify vendors about this who still sell it as the latter and this makes it a plane rip off the software seems to be a greatbut even when it worked it appeared buggy freezy pathetic you can achieve more by doing everything manually than relying on this piece of s tware,149,10
8440,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,be careful of getting a lifetime membership with tune up because your activation code will only work once or twice i sold my old computer and got a new one and even tech support can not solve my issue of transferring the activation key to my new computer super lame it is as if they are at the mercy of their own slow / glitchy software,62,11
8441,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
8442,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
8443,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,this software no longer works with the latest version of itunes it is simply criminal that it is still being sold,21,14
8444,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
8445,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,my itunes library was a mess this product tuned it up works awesome just as promised now my library is up to date with album artwork found or corrected i highly recommend this product,34,16
8446,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
8447,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,tuneup does what I have bought it for it has been able to successfully arrange most of my songs and get the right album artwork and this is not limited to american songs alone I had recommend this to anyone anyday,39,18
8448,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,as a bestselling author of non-fiction investigative books i do not have time to keep my itunes library in any kind of order i took a chance on tune up expecting the worst 24 hours later i opened itunes and found it in astonishing order some album covers were still missing but i found only one error mozart by don giovani instead of don giovani by mozart and this was a minimalist version of tune up bravo sterling seagrave,78,19
8449,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,especially if you have a big messy library with lots of different sources like mine tuneup worked wonders making complete sense of my library and making the de-duplication task insanely easy highly recommended,33,20
8450,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product works very well it does a decent job of cleaning up song titles and other information i had a very large 17 gb itunes library and it is now 999 accurate the only tracks tuneup could not fix i was also unable to fix manually so i think that is pretty good my only complaint is that when it finds album titles and artwork the majority of the time it will offer up greatest hits or other compilation albums rather than the original album on which the track was released,91,21
8451,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,I have been using tuneup for a while now and i have to say i love it it does exactly what it is supposed to do it cleans the track info and album art additionally the concerts feature is great for me because i have a giant library and it is tough to keep track of who is in town and when tuneup is amazing for making your music library more presentable which is great for ios devices because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better they also just sent me a coupon code for friends and family for 40 off at their website for anyone interested in a deal the code is friends40 either way i highly recommend this product,121,22
8494,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,microsoft mappoint is good for two types of users those who need a super gps and those who need to create maps to go with their presentations and analysis with a gps puck not included ms mappoint becomes a great gps for salesmen delivery men and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner most gps devices fail in this regard they work great from point a to b and could include a detour but forget about going to ten locations it would be great if ms had a self-contained gps device not a laptop which could be programed with the information generated from mappoint by using a pc as the user interface it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen as for the maps it generates we are currently analysing a coal mine and our pitch book was much more comprehensive as a result of using mappoint over copying and pasting googlemaps and the like,169,0
8495,Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,i have been using this program for the past few weeks and am very satisfied with it the software installed and ran without problems on my windows 7 ultimate machine i was dissapointed that the usual irritating microsft activation technology was used if the user just wants a mapping program then microsoft streets and trips 2010 is a cheaper and more practical way to go the programs interface is extremely similar to streets and trips 2010 mappoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in the capability for interface with excel is provided and seemed to work well,112,1
8496,Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,a great piece of software for using a map as a reference user needs a good background in excell or they can be lost,24,2
8497,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,was used and did notcorrectly told by microsoft it wa obsolete so the do not support it an go to forrum for help bad registry keys had to send it back,34,3
8498,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,old version not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies,29,4
8499,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this product i can not find 40 percent of the existing addresses I have entered google map finds them even mss own bing maps finds them but not mappoint 2010 I am sorry i bought it,38,5
8500,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i got this product mainly to import maps into word documents the interface works seamlessly the maps are gorgeous and with a high level of detail perfect for a multitude of applications including illustrations for flyers maps diaries blogs or journals,41,6
8501,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i recently purchased mappoint 2010 through amazon so the price was already better than buying it directly from microsoft or at any office supply stores i am finding it to be very useful for my business we have to generate a lot of maps for our clients and mappoint is better than alternative mapping software from the standpoint of clarity of the maps and boundary definitions we do not need the wayfinding function so having that is of no value we use the territory function to highlight market areas by county or zip code that works okay but is a little cumbersome i also find transferring a map to word or powerpoint documents to be more difficult that it should be smartdraw is easier and it is not even a microsoft product,131,7
8502,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,it is marginally ok for mapping addresses and mapping simple fields but you can not do more advanced functions such as exporting business names addresses and more for this i had to write custom code and extract into excel it has ended up being of little value from a business standpoint absolutely do not buy thinking it can be used as a cheap gis tool,63,8
8503,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i liked the microsoft mappoint 2010 software it was easy to install and works well with vista the software is also easy to navigate and fun to use however it may not be for everyone it seems to have features you may not even use if you just need it to go from point a to b but if you need it for work related purposes or even to map out an itinerary with stops then look no further and the price may even be worth it,87,9
8504,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,i will give it to microsoft when it comes to mappoint it has always been a breeze to setup relatively simple to use and very effective at what it does that being said there has not enough new content in mappoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software unless you absolutely need the new features the improvements on mappoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor pushpin management has been overhauled and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from map settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation also you are now able to import export gpx files making for easier data sharing if you need new features like these then by all means i would recommend purchasing mappoint 2010 if this is your first purchase of mappoint take advantage of the free trial download online and also compare mappoints features to those of the cheaper microsoft streets and trips 2010 personally that is what i use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs,182,10
8505,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,I have had this program for a while now and i can confirm that it is not that good however it is better than streets and trips it has the same abilities but is also suited to add info to microsoft office applications i can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily but if you just want a street guide go with s and t what worries me considerably is that microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application bing maps this application is only available direct from microsoft and the cost varies with the number of seats you license that makes me wonder how long mappoint will be available and whether bing maps will be a better program in addition other map companies like google may already have similar applications or be about to release them i suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you will buy,159,11
8506,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,first if you plan to sync and use this software in conjunction with a gps device you would better have the garmin brand preferably the latest one moreover if you business extends into canada this software will not be of much use for someone who wishes to put together say a national sales presentation or wishes to analyze data by geographic localities mappoint might be just the ticket given the number of options available for businesses today however this software seems overpriced a bit outdated even irrelevant and limited for most purposes other reviewers have rightly pointed out some of it is other shortcomings and limitations on the other hand if your business needs the specific capabilities that this particular program offers you will not find a better alternative what it does do it does relatively well if not easily,138,12
8507,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,mappoint does not recognize some major streets in the community in which i am plotting data technical support was not able to help product not worth my time and effort if it does not work properly,33,13
8508,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i have previous versions of microsoft streets and trips and have used it numerous times for maps and vacation plannning as well as it is gps capabilities microsoft map point is basically the big brother of ms streets and trips however it adds the ability to download maps to a gps device which is definitely a nice add-on and something i wish streets and trips could do and it adds the ability to import or link contact location data from ms outlook and display it custom maps beyond that i can not see where it really adds enough features to be worth the much higher price they charge for map point as opposed to streets and trips but it does run well and does all the functions it is supposed to do so if you really need to easily link and map your outlook customer data then this is the way to go,152,14
8509,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,sometimes the position of the location flag is not very accurate and the data must be pristine as the software can not deal with post office box numbers that are on the same line as the addresses garbage in garbage out sometimes it gets confused if county road is abbreviated as cr or c r or even county road so clean up the data in excel before importing it into map point but for what i paid for the software i am satisfied,82,15
8510,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,there has almost no configuration and to be perfectly frank the resulting maps look like crap the icons are of very poor image quality even if you manage to import a custom one because the pixel range is so darn small and again almost no configurability i feel sorry for everyone including myself stuck using this horribly designed software,61,16
9149,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,if you buy any trainer i would recommend this computer to train with it is easy to operate gives instant information not hard to setup and works well it is particularly useful if you track your workouts,35,0
9150,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,for a device at this price i would not expect much just a consistent power reading for the effort i put in it does not even have to be correct or reflect short spikes in power to test this out i bought one and used it with my powertap the initial readings were pretty close but over the course of a one hour workout it drifted by about 30 watts for me as the fluid in the trainer heats up it gets easier and easier to spin while this is great for the ego it is not useful for training as the computer makes no adjustment for this even if the readings were wrong if they were consistently wrong it would still be a useful device as it is it is pretty useless i returned it,132,1
9151,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,the directions are horrible I have hooked something like this up before and so i improvised it does not work i called customer service they responded quickly and tried to resolve problem they are sending me a new wire for it,40,2
9152,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,goodpoorly designed the display is not appropriate for serious workouts the premise is that you can see your power output becuase the kinetic trainers are so accurate however while you are observing your power you can not see your cadence so you can not accurately maintain your rpm and power at the same time but both aspects are important when training i returned the product because it did not meet my needs,71,3
9153,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,did not get far enough to see how this thing worked because installation was ridiculous with poor directions / instructions i consider myself pretty mechanically inclined but these directions were impossible to follow so rather than waste time and aggravate myself further I am returning this thing,43,4
9154,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,this is the w model it does not do heart rate or altitude so no need for a chest strap like the wl model i bought it to use with my kinetics road machine and specialized hard rock bike it took a bit of time to figure out the placement for the sensors for speed and cadence but in the end it seems well laid out the manual is small and the pictures a bit hard to understand but the company was great and sent me a pdf version of the manual the most difficult to understand is the arrangement for the lap timers but those will not be of that much use for me just now and the rest of the functions seem to work well this unit was about the same price as the strada cc-rd300w wireless but has a larger display and includes cadance and power which i really wanted,151,5
9155,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,this is not the easiest computer odometer to operate it functions well but is somewhat difficult to reset will need to spend more time with the operation manual,28,6
9156,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,i was getting sporadic gaps with another manufacturers wireless model so i purchased this product to match the kinetic by kurt trainer plenty of included ties the install is pretty straight forward the wattage calculator is wonderful and there was plenty of cord slack for application on my cannondale hybrid solid product no complaints,54,7
9157,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,4.0,positive,i installed this unit and it works great the only after thought was if it would have came with the chest strap also it would have been 5 stars,29,8
9158,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my son and he said that it worked as expected he was well satisfied with it,21,9
9159,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,i concur with the reviews that describe this device as shoddy and poorly manufactured however i want to add that it is totally a misrepresentation to describe this as a power computer it does not really compute power what is does is take your speed and run it through a simple equation that derives your power as a function of your speed if you are expecting a device that does anything but give you a rough approximation of your power output by placing your speed into a quadratic equation with some regression coefficients derived from who-knows-where this is not it very deceptive product description good thing it is cheap,104,10
9160,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,5.0,positive,at first i would agree seemed like junk however everytime i called kurt kinetic they were extemely helpful and shipped me a new one mine kept shorting out and losing the display and info then might or might not come back on after i receive the 3rd replacement i saw that the use of an extention cord had been eliminated and a solid wire from computer to pickup was used instead that was it my computer works perfectly now for 50 bucks you can not go wrong it is extemely accurate and matches wattage with the other much more expensive offerings ie power tap and more great service from kk,108,11
9161,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,2.0,negative,very cheaply made readout is small buttons are loose wires are flimsy shocking contrast in quality when compared to the kinetic road machine trainer i bought it with should be included free with a 275 trainer in my opinion but it works just not worth 45 - 50 bucks be careful installing it as to not pull out the wires or crack the plastic tab that locks the computer on to the mount,71,12
9162,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000CPM2KY,1.0,negative,this computer is a remarkable piece of junk everything on it is the cheapest possible grade the magnet broke in my hands when i tried to install it i used the magnet from an old cateye computer even the plastic zipties were dried and snapped the reset button on the computer itself sticks in the in position the mounting bracket does not hold the computer firm enough so when you press the display button the computer goes flying off the bike the battery only lasted 3 months the display turns rainbow colors at about 60 degree f but you get wattage and all other vital info for your workout so you need this thing my kurt kinetic rock-n-roll trainer is bomb proof i love it however this computer is the biggest hunk of junk I have ever used in my life everything about it is of the lowest quality but you need one so buy it kurt kinetic should tar and feather the guy who thought it would be a goodto put their name on this thing it is just shameful,179,13
9163,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,i was looking for a good stopwatch to help me with my training and figured i would give this inexpensive product a go it was fairly simple to set and it worked well until i noticed that the clock was falling behind i reset it and slowly it fell behind again i went and bought a new battery and it still fell behind i am looking at it right now after reseting it for the last time a couple of weeks ago and it is almost 15 minutes behind with the clock being so off it makes me wonder how accurate the other modes are i either recieved a shody stopwatch or some reconfiguring needs to be done by the manufacturer update 09/02/2006 was cleaning out my desk and came upon my stopwatch do not ask me why i still have it i was delt another hard blow when i looked at the clock again it has not fallen behind this time no instead it is twenty minutes fast i am incredibly disturbed by this i believe i will go lie down and try to forget about this oh so traumatic experience,189,0
9164,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,good stopwatch for the price it does feel like plastic and it does basic functions however feels that it can break easily,22,1
9165,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,great for track and field these timers work great and are a bargain actually found they will work for several seasons on the same battery,25,2
9166,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,works great no problems for our use not a professional stopwatch but good for everyday use would recommend good price,20,3
9167,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought the sportline 240 stopwatch about 8 months ago it has always been a little funky specifically not responding when i hit one of the buttons now it periodically has the display go out it will come back on about 5 minutes later i have reseated the battery and ultimately replaced the battery but it still does not work consistently bottom line is that i can not recommend this watch to anyone,72,4
9168,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i bought this product sportline econosport 240 as an impulse buy when checking out at a local sport store had i read the reviews on amazon i would have known better the very brief instructions which are printed on the container are unintelligible as reported by other reviewers the alarm seems to go off at random times and there is no obvious way to stop it i was hoping that the sportline website might have a manual with better instructions the web site says that the manual can be found on the website but i can not find it overall i think that the combination of a poor user interface and poor instructions is the worst i have ever seen on any product,122,5
9169,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,super annoying beeping that you could not turn off until i disassembled the product and snipped cables inside to turn it off it worked well until it died just a few months after i got it waste of money,39,6
9170,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,the stopwatch works seems accurate anyway but i can not set the time of day on this thing I have done exactly what the instructions are telling me i can switch between hours and minutes but i can not select anything to make the watch begin i really think there is something wrong with the watch i guess it does not matter but the watch should work,63,7
9171,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,i do not know how a company can sell such utter crap hit a button and it clicks twice starts and stops now i have to bang it against something hard to get the led to display this company does not deserve a penny of ours,45,8
9172,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the first one i received had a defective left reset button no way to reset the count-up time i returned it and got a replacement which functioned perfectly i love amazon they even refunded the postage required to send back the defective unit,43,9
9173,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,4.0,positive,i use the stopwatch primarily for timing student presentations i have not had to change the battery once in over 5 years amazing,22,10
9174,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,1.0,negative,this one attempts to be a stopwatch clock alarm and calendar it can not do any of these functions well every one of these functions get messed up because of the haphazard mode button to switch between the clock and the stopwatch you have to go through the alarm set mode then the clock setting mode this causes you to set the alarm for 100am and to reprogram the time moreover it is not rugged enough to survive a long jog without getting messed up very annoying inaccurate and worthless,89,11
9175,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,product is excellent and exceeded my expectations i would definately suggest recommend this product to anyone,16,12
9176,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,in the instruction manual for this stopwatch it says chime is on when dashes appear above display chime is off when no dashes appear unfortunately the instructions are lying the alarm on this watch will go off regardless of dash situation there is absolutely no way to turn off the alarm if you are there to turn the alarm off at the same time every day then this watch is a decent purchase everything else on it works well,79,13
9177,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,2.0,negative,the stopwatches lost their battery life within 1 - 2 weeks they constantly went off for no reason and it was not very easy to use the ones that did not die served their purpose,32,14
9178,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,now that my elementary school aged girls are taking timed tests this has been great for timing their homework it is easy to use and seems to take a lot of abuse,32,15
9179,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000EFER46,5.0,positive,this is such a great stopwatch it is so much fun to play with the timing is incredible and has features such as a clock and a calender it is a very easy using stopwatch and i love it,39,16
10137,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,reading other reviews i thought these lights would be quality they were not they are all plastic except for the stake but that is cheap metal very disappointed sent them back immediately but to add insult to injury i had to pay over 800 in shipping out of my own pocket for this piece of junk buyer beware,58,0
10138,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,it was nice reeived the package intact the lights are easy to assemble they look nice in our front yard,20,1
10139,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i bought both moonrays 91398 balletto style solar powered hanging plastic path light and this one and i think this one is much better than the moonray light the only problem of the product is the battery without good batteries the lights are just pieces of junk can only last for around 2 hours at night but after replacing the batteries the effect is so good that I am thinking buying more btw i bought sanyo eneloop batteries and they works great for these 2 weeks,85,2
10140,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these two solar candles were a perfect accent for the patio they really look like real candles and light up all night,22,3
10141,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i purchased a set of these lights to go around my backyard pond they look great these are much more realistic than other solar candles I have seen i was so happy i bought a second set my parents also ordered a set one came in defective but the company quickly processed an exchange no complaints here,56,4
10142,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i purchased this product for my new home on a military base i placed them on the walkway to the side entrance to the home they look real nice my new neighbors have comment that they like th lights and they are pleased i am using solar power for my lighting i plan to use solar power for my holiday lighting as well,63,5
10143,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i bought four of these solar lights to replace four similar lanterns i had had for seven or eight years unfortunately the ones i had were no longer being made or i would have bought those but these were the closest i could come but when i received them they were not even close the quality of the stakes was poor and two of them bent immediately trying to put them in to the same holes i had before the lanterns themselves were flimsy / cheap not made in heartland america at least the heartland america i know the lanterns may have worked a whole few weeks and then they died never to return i should have sent this junk back but i did not i live in south-central new mexico and we have sunshine lots of sunshine more than enough to charge these lights the lights still stand well two as a reminder to myself to not buy junk like this again if i can not find quality setups do not waste any more money i would suggest to others they do not waste their money either at least not on these,183,6
10144,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,would have been great if they were not all smashed to pieces in the box too cheaply made to withstand shipping returned,22,7
10145,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i love these little solar lights they have a wonderful flickering effect that mimics a candle,16,8
10146,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,they work well but are a bit spindly if they are moved often like i do when i mow break easily,21,9
10147,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,very flimsy 2 out of four were broken pure junk,10,10
10148,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these look really good in my yard at nite,9,11
10149,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these solar lights are extremely dim they are barely even visible along the pathway i purchased them to help light the pathway to the door at night I have had to purchase others because these did not do the job i would not purchase these again,44,12
10150,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,amazon said this light is heartland of america but they shipped me the light by lily home i bought this product from heartland of america before and they are good but this one from lily home is a strip down model they are the same price of 3000 for two lily home light use only one battery instead of two it has 2 battery compartment but one is not wired up so the light is very dim and almost could not see that is on even the candle itself is very small not like the one heartland of america which is big did amazon do a switch on me because it said the light is by heartland of america the product detail is lily home did amazon advertised one thing and sell the other may be heartland of america product is sold out so they sub the lily home instead do not buy lily home product and it is not good at all construction is poor light is very dim and use one battery instead of two lily home product is bad,182,13
10151,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,the lamps are very poor quality being made of very thin plastic the lamps i ordered had scratches on the pastic and appeared they would fall apart with the first good wind i would not recommend this product the lamps really look nice on-line but not in person i returned thethe day i received good news is amazon stands behind the products they sell,66,14
10152,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,no the lights are not yellow are white and the quality of the batteries is very poor,17,15
10153,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this purchase i ordered two pairs and from the 4 i received i had to take parts from all four to create two functional candles pieces were broken upon arrival batteries were old and not working wires were not connected and the metal posts from which the candles hang were not complete,57,16
10154,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,very cheap for a reason do not expect it to last very long we did not even bother to get them after we used them after the wedding,26,17
10155,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,total junk had to return them save your money,9,18
10156,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,only three flickered then two died replaced with others purchased elsewhere not what i expected,15,19
10157,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love the flickering i use them all year round but they look especially nice with winter decorations,17,20
10158,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these months ago and they have proven the test of time against the florida rainy season they are beautiful in planters and i always get compliments,28,21
10159,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i received a defective set one lantern arrived with the dawn / dusk sensor ripped off and the other had a deformed battery cover the glow is surprisingly minimal given the size of the candle and i even used my own fully charged battery to test it very disappointing,47,22
10160,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i bought these for my mom and she just loves them heed the warnings about the inferior batteries that come with these solar lights although and get yourself some 2300 mah energizer power plus nimh aa rechargeable ones instead,39,23
10161,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,beautiful lights they make my front porch look so neat,10,24
10162,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i just love these putting them along the bushes of a walkway in front of my home the soft flicker looking like a candle in the night the charge does not last as long as i would like but it stays on about four to five hours and for the price these are also hard to find as an fyi and having owned similar solar lights before i took these apart and put caulking around the inside of the solar panel holder which tends toand allow rainwater into the electronics and of course you will want to bring these in during the high point of winter to give the panels longer life out of the elements which seem to be in all these kinds of units the first part that goes,133,25
10163,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,I am not the pickiest person and will settle over most things whew i have to say these poor things are really cheap flimsy and unattractive the company that makes these hired a good photographer for the product images the lights inside of the candles only illuminate the side of one wall and i can see shadows of the wires the lanterns might make it through one season if i do not expose them to the rain they are so ugly i stuck them on the side of the house I had say you get what you pay for but I have bought cheaper candles from a dollar store that look better than these,110,26
10164,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look beautiful in the photo i wanted lights just like these and loved the look the package arrived and they are made of cheap plastic i broke off one of the stems that place them in the ground and it was soft ground after it just had rained they are not sturdy i live in a windy area in the mountains the light they emit is very dim not what i had imagined would tell other to steer away from making my same mistake,85,27
10165,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,candles work great get a lot of comments on how they look only use in the summer only thing would recommend better batteries for longer life,26,28
10166,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,i purchased two pairs of these lanterns and am very happy with the 3 that worked one was defective which is why i gave the product only 4 stars i used these lanterns to replace the battery powered lanterns i used previously these are much easier because they can be left on constantly and they recharge every day they looked very pretty hanging in my perennial beds all summer i added split rings to the top of these lanterns so that they would fit on the sturdier shepherds hooks already installed instead of the flimsier hangers that came with them i did use one of the included hangers to hold a different garden ornament,114,29
10167,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,one of candle did not work already i try to switch reset and figure it out outside but i do not know what is worng,26,30
10168,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,the lights arrived not too long after i ordered them i am very satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the lights themselves they are like glowing candles in the dark after soaking enough solar power,38,31
10169,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,since heartland america will not post let me post an unhappy review on their site I shall post it here do not buy this set it was embarrassing i bought this as a gift for someone and they have not been able to get it to hardly work she told me all kinds of damage was done to the products and some trouble was went through to get these lights to work a little i contacted ha and they said since she had to work with it to get it to turn on somewhat they considered it being tampered with and would not assist in any customer service you have been warned,108,32
10170,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,love the natural glow and flickering of the candlelight the only reason i did not give the product 5 stars was because the original batteries that came with it were cheap and had to be replaced,36,33
10171,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,after only a few days only one lights up i am very disappointed with this product this product is very cheap,21,34
10172,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these look like they might be pretty high quality but do not be fooled they are super thin black plastic and easily damaged during shipping amazon sells some great products but these are not part of that set,36,35
10173,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i purchased this set for the cemetery at my parents graves i liked the concept of a candle flickering in the night unfortunately when i received thenumerous key pieces were missing a solar battery a battery cover screws for the rod to put together i had to invest more money to correct all the problems would not reccomend anyone buying this too bad i like the look of the light but not the people that distribute it,79,36
10174,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,given the price of these lights i was expecting a better quality product first off do not be surprised if you are missing the screw lags that connect the 3 piece poles together as i found mine rolling around in the bottom of the box the lights themselves appear to made of very cheap plastic with large gaps between individual pieces i do not expect these to hold up to the elements for long the top of both ground stakes broke as i gently pressed them into the fresh dirt around my patio stones which is another example of the cheap quality i have lots of solar ground lights at my property and these are by far the worst stakes I have every seen so be very careful when you put them in the ground i plan on replacing the batteries as per other reviews experience but time will tell how these lights hold up to the weather,156,37
10175,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,this product is not amber when received they are white if you are ordering them for the specificit shows you will be disappointed,25,38
10176,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these came in and i put them right back in the box and sent them back each one had 1 out of 2 battery doors broken they would not stay locked on their own 1 of the batteries was out as well upon arrival i could not imagine having to use tape for an outside lantern just to keep the battery in so it would work correctly each one also had 1 out of the 4 locking mechanisms broken off and missing 1 lantern had a big glob of glue or something on the top as well that looked really crappy they are all plastic and you can tell they just look kind of cheap and well plastic the stakes that come with them are in 3 pieces which i thought odd you have to screw them together and never looked exactly straight to me they are not 100 horrible although and can serve a purpose maybe i was just unlucky and somebody else would get them in a better condition I am just not taking a chance again,176,39
10177,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are very cheaply made do not waste your money they are also white and not amber as pictured,20,40
10178,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these are delightful providing a wonderful hint of lit candles as they hang in our living room one reviewer was correct place new batteries in from the start and they last forever,32,41
10179,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,merchandise was constructed very poorly fell apart very easily when handling very poor performance only stayed lit for two hours at the most daily have ordered similar product from another seller and they work just great stay on all night,40,42
10180,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love these lights for the ambiance they work great the light submitted is low but i love the amber affect,20,43
10181,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,I have had these lights for a couple of years now and enjoy watching them when I am sitting outside i especially like seeing them sway in the breeze they have a soft glow and flicker randomly much like real candles in fact shortly after i moved them to a different corner of the house my neighbor called worried that something was burning in the back yard these lights are decorative they are not bright enough to light a walkway they have withstood plenty of wind and rain they do need a lot of sun to charge I have had the best luck with them on the south side of the house but you can remove the batteries and charge them if you have a nicd battery charger the batteries that came with them stopped charging after less than two years i put the lights in storage during the winter i do not know if that contributed to their demise after replacing the batteries they are working fine again,163,44
10182,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,thiscame with a missing part that the other lantern could not be as tall as the other one it was returned and the customer service did not follow up thewas cheaply made not like the photo,40,45
10183,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,contents arrived with pieces broken off inside the light housing original seller / manufacturer did not use packing materials disappointing because it is difficult to find amber solar lights rather than the white lights that almost look blue,35,46
10184,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i purchased these for a christmas present and returned them immediately they looked very cheap and not what i expected at all,22,47
10185,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i really liked this but the batteries corrode regardless of the type they light are great for pretty and not functional because they do not put off much light we got about 1 summer out of them before they went to crap not really worth it,45,48
10186,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,love love love these solar lights they work great and look fantastic i will probably be buying more would highly recommend buying these,23,49
10187,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i had to send them back because they were obvioulsy used they had scratches on them and only one of them worked i was very bummed because i loved the looks of them if they could assure me that i would get brand new ones then i would definately order them again i can not find these anywhere else so very disappointed,61,50
10188,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,a very good purchase no problems i enjoy watching them at night would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying this set,24,51
10189,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,what you see is not what you get can not tell by the picture what you are actually getting it is all plastic and very flimsy not worth the money get better ones in home improvement stores for same price,37,52
10190,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,these lights are not what they claim to be they were fine for the first week since then i have not gotten them to burn anymore either of them do not waste your money,32,53
10191,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i was so excited to put these on either side of one of my garden statues and they looked terrific the first night and they have not come on since i like some other reviewers also broke the flimsy shepherds hook just trying to put it into very soft ground so i used a couple of my big lots hooks luckily they fit through the top ring of the lantern i did see the review regarding bad batteries and may try that because they really did look like candles flickering for the first couple of hours however i would not buy again not worth the hassel of returning,106,54
10192,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,these are way cool unfortunately the hanger part broke on one of them right away it is still useable just can not hang it up,23,55
10193,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these are attractive when viewed close-up unfortunately one of my two stopped working i tried new batteries and even charged them in my home charger at first it came on if i tapped it but then it stopped entirely i do not recommend them,44,56
10194,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i have 10 of these and might get more if i want to hook up these lights to a solar array it panel can be done easily breaks if not handled real carefully but the shipper replaces them without fail and covers the shipping cost so no pain for me the cheap plastic top when you fist go to turn on the battery would break easily as you then try to lock it in place i learned through this breakage that thisbattery while cheap the wires can be hooked re-connected to a solar panel to get all night lighting you can find a good panel at any store which you can find woks allnight for thirty bucks which comes with their own lights i have which i plan to hook up in far future but for now it lasts about 4 - 5 hours in full sun and shade and 55 to 6 hours in full direct sun i added pics,161,57
10195,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,these look very nice but unfortunately are very poor quality i broke one just trying to get it open to turn it on the price makes it cost prohibitive to send it back i will spend more to get better quality the next time,44,58
10196,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,these look great on my walkway on the way to the patio they look just like lit candles very romantic looking and pretty durable so far i have a few large dogs and they have bumped into and knocked them over quite a few times and they continue to work just fine very pleased with these solar lights,58,59
10197,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,i love thisand feel i received a good bargain i have put these two lights in the front by a walking path and they have really improved the look and curb appeal of the yard not just at night when they are flickering but also during the day even although the lantern part is plastic it is hard to tell it is plastic and they have withstood a couple of pretty severe hailstorms without any damage at all i am very pleased,83,60
10198,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,i love the look of these lights but they are not amber they are white i bought them because i thought they were amber also the plastic holder the stake goes in broke immediately on several of the lights very cheap the lights worked okay for two nights and then they stopped working completely when they did work the lights did not stay on for very long what i found out after only a few days of use is that the top plastic part have several sections that are glued together and the glue stopped holding and the top part of the lights started coming apart which caused the wiring to pull apart after trying to fix this i was so aggravated at how cheaply they were made and how they kept falling apart that i threw three of the four lights i bought out a complete waste of money i see now that for something like this it is important to see and inspect them for quality before purchasing,171,61
10199,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,they look so nice but how fall are they I am looking for some like this but tall like 6 maybe,20,62
10200,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,i have never written a negative review but i have to warn people these are complete junk i buy from amazon all the time but these were a complete waste of money i literally broke these in just ten minutes and have thrown them away cheap quality and the plastic tops of the lamps broke just untwitsting to turn them on the metal stakes do not align so i could not use those either this is my personal opinion but the worst purchase i ever made on amazon save your money folks,91,63
10239,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son received this walker from grandma and really loves it i was looking at walkers before and this one is aabove the rest it has a speed control we tried out the fisher price walker at his aunts house and he kept falling down the walker just rolled right out from underneath him i was hesitant to give him this walker but he loves it for now the speed control is about half way on but when he get a little better at walking the skies the limit,91,0
10240,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this walker and after putting it together i immediately had misgivings about it it did not seem very stable and i was right when my 9 month old son tried to use it to pull up it flipped over backwards luckily since i had my suspicions about it doing just that i was standing right behind him and able to catch him in addition to tipping over withing 1/2 hour he had the two mailbox panels pulled off the front of the activity area I have already disassembled the walker and put it back in the box it is going back to the store,103,1
10241,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,all my son 11 mos wants to do is walk but he can not quite do it by himself yet we got this walking toy so that i did not have to spend my days hunched over holding his hands as he toddled around the house since he is still learning to walk most walking toys we tried just slipped out from under him but this one is stable and slow just right for a learner my sons walking has become much more confident and stable since we bought this walker he can easily push and turn all around the wood floors and some carpet in our house the toy portion is not very exciting my son mostly puts things in the mail slots and then takes them out but walking is the most exciting activity for him right now my friends little boy 9 mos larger and stronger than average 9 mo old sat and played with the walker and the first thing he did was pull the doors off but it did not seem to pose a hazard he also enjoyed spinning the rotating piece,183,2
10242,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this is a tough one overall i would rate this toy as fair it is not terrible and my daughter when she was stable and could walk with a walker used this and did fine but the doors on the front are a pain they have fallen off at least 100 times and for this reason alone i would say get another walker it is just not worth the minor irritation of having to constantly put them back on when there are many other walkers that do not have this issue we moms have enough little battles to fight every day than to have to put back pieces that should not be falling off every single time the little one gets his / her hands on it my son uses it now and it is just the same thing sorry not worth it,138,3
10243,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we got this walker as a gift for our 8-month old son he is just learning to pull up and stand on his own so we were excited to get a walker as a gift i have not compared this to other ones but it is not very stable it can easily be tipped especially when he runs into a door or something if he pushes hard enough he topples over the front of it he has also lost his balance and fallen backwards i just expected it to be a little more sturdy like some of his other toys i understand it can not be perfect and expect some falls but it seems cheap to me the little doors mail slots always come off again just seems cheap he loves this toy however he pushes it everywhere one good thing is that the wheels can adjust so that it goes slow or fast depending on the floor or the skill of the child that is really a good thing and has worked for us other than that although I have been a little dissatisfied with it,184,4
10244,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this was a great walking toy for my 11 month old granddaughter she loves the bright colors and the mail toys are great for teething,25,5
10245,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this walker for our daughter when she was about 9 months old because she was starting to cruise around things and we thought maybe a walker would be fun there was more assembly than we had expected not difficult but it was not out of the box ready we discovered quickly that mail carrier was not in this walkers future the doors have not been on it since the first week they come off so easily that our daughter rips them off whenever she sees them she likes to put her dolls in the walker and push it around like a stroller she is now a year old i like the feature that let us you put the wheels away it works well for controlling out of control older siblings the only warning i have is that the wheels are slick on hardwood floors for little ones that are not sturdy on their feet yet i looked around although and could not find one that was good on hardwood anyway overall this toy has been played with off and on and has held up very well,186,6
10246,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this days ago and it is already going back an impromptu stop at the store for a walker for my 10mos old to take on vacation so he would not be cruising all the furninture at grandmas house after three kids i was missing the old ones i had for the other two but was tempted because of it is simplicity and no battery thing let me break it down time consuming assembly had to hunt down screwdriver it tipped over immedietly as the baby pulled himself up so it only worked when i held on to either him or the front of the walker making this not an independent toy within minutes mailslot doors came off now have to hunt for mail so it can all go back to the store the adjustable traction worked on some floors in our home but not all of them on the plus side it does not run on batteries is pretty basic and the baby loved playing with the mail slots while the doors stayed on either way i am returning it and getting a different activity walker for him,186,7
10247,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,as the grandmom of 1 year old triplet girls this is a great product the girls are just learning to walk and are fascinated with the activity walker the width gives them stability the tension on the wheels is adjustable so they do not go flying across the floor the removable doors are entertaining off the walker as well as on,60,8
10248,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought this walker for our daughter when she was 11 months just a few weeks later she was walking she loves it she is constantly putting the letters in and out of the compartment it is quite funny to watch her walk around the house picking up different things the remote control books the dogs toys and putting them in her mail bin as for me and husband we love the fact that you can adjust the speed on the wheels much safer for her the doors came off once but that was no big deal they pop back on easily i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality walker for your baby,119,9
10249,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,the package was delivered quickly the toy was easy to assemble it seems like it will not easily come apart my granddaughter loves it there are lots of things to push and twirl and it will help her stand up and begin to walk at the same time as entertaining her it is a good toy,55,10
10250,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we bought this for our baby in january when she was 8 months old because she was just starting to cruise she loved it then and still uses it now that she is 12 months my only complaint is that the doors come off so easily that they are never on the thing which means you can not store anything in it if the doors are off they were designed this way but i think they would be better if they were not quite so easy to remove,87,11
10251,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i did not like that the doors came off so easily or that my son could stand next to it and knock it over but he really enjoyed it he was walking on his own within 2 weeks of having it,40,12
10252,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this products does not hold up it falls a part from get go not really safe for toddler learning to walk sorry but truth i was very disappointed susanna / nanna sc,30,13
10253,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you are looking for a sturdy push toy for a child who is learning to walk this is a great option the wheels can be tightened depending on the flooring it will be used on we have tile throughout our house and i was worried about it sliding out from underneath my daughter when she tried to use it that never happened it always remained within her control yes the doors come off easily and some of the sliding toys on it are hard to move but she never showed much interest in them anyway and as a push toy it is great even now as an almost [ ] she will put her toys in it and cart them around the house with her at top speed,125,14
10254,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,it is cute it holds my 11 months old attention for a brief period she loves to place the mail in the slots the slots do not stay on they do fall off quit easily but they slip in pretty easy too it is a great push toy do not expect much it is pretty flimsy the bright colors are attractive although,59,15
10255,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,within 1 week of having this toy my daughter wanted to walk on her own within 2 weeks of having this toy she was walking by herself she was 10 months old now at almost a year old she uses it to run around the house i have recommneded this toy for several moms that have babies around the same age as mine,62,16
10256,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my mother bought this for my 11 month old son who is a late walker the doors were constantly falling off and there is not much else to do if there are no doors also every time he would try pulling himself up the whole thing would tip over if we would lift him so that he could walk with it he would either fall backwards with the whole thing falling ontop of him or the front wheels would go flying forward and he would fall forward even when he was playing with the front toys it fell on him the only good thing was that we called little tikes to complain and they were very nice and replaced it with a different toy,124,17
10257,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 11-and-a-half-month-old nephew for christmas 10 days later he took his first steps on his own to be fair he was pretty close already but he loved this toy and walked it all over from the day he got it i know other people complain about the mailbox door and yes it comes off pretty easily but it is no big deal to slip it back on at all my nephew loves the mail too he will put them in the box and take them out over and over again this is a sturdy toy and perfect for a kid who has almost walking but not quite for what it is worth my 2-and-a-half-year-old niece loved this toy too she kept stealing it from my nephew and trying to put all kinds of toys in the mailbox i do not know why this toy is adaptable to lie flat my nephew totally lost interest in it when we changed the position we also never got to try out the tension control because the playroom is carpeted but it is a great feature nonetheless,184,18
10258,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i have tile floor and this walker was so terrible i threw it away if you have carpet i guess it would not be so bad but the speed control wheel did nothing on the slow one it just drug accross the floor and left scatch marks and on any speed the thing was too light weight in the front and tiped over as i said i have tile floor and every time she fell she would fall sideways and land on her head very very very dangerous do not buy if you do not have carpet,95,19
10259,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this product is just awful my son 10 months recd it as a christmas gift and it stands there empty all of the time the doors fall off the sticker inside says removable door for easy acess what a joke i bet that sticker was an after thought when they realized how bad of a product it really was i am sick of putting this thing together 10 times a day when my teenagers were young i trusted the name little tikes because their toys were usually better than the others because they seemed to be more rugged and used heavier plastics it is a shame how they have changed i am very dissapointed lisa,115,20
10260,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is not very sturdy it tips over easily the toys on the front are not easy to use or very engaging,23,21
10261,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this walker play toy was one of my grandsons favorites at age 1 - 2 years old first he just played with the attached toys and then taught himself how to walk with it i sent one to my great niece for her lst b / d her mother raved how wonderful the toy was she also helped herself learn to walk i just sent my cousins child the same gift for his lst b / d with the same response this will definitely be my gift of choice for this age group,87,22
10262,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,it was easy to put together i just wish it would stay together the doors on the front for the pretend mail are worthless i wish this toy had more activity things for the child to be impressed with because i was not get another walker toy i would not recommend this one,53,23
10263,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,easy to put together very sturdy my almost-walking-11 month old nephew loves walking with it playing with the pieces and teething on them too he can not get enough of it finally he can stand upright with the correct proportions for him to be stable and walk around like everyone else hurrah,47,24
10264,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,not worth the money there are better walkers out there i agree with some other posts that the little doors or whatever you call them come of way to easy i am sick of picking them up off the floor i got this because my son loved the walker a friend of mine had for their baby so i figured they were all alike and bought this one i was wrong he hardly touches this one but loves any other walker he comes in contact with not enough integrated toys on this one to make him happy especially once the doors fall off,104,25
10265,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my little boy loves this walker i know it was not expensive but it does the trick just perfectly i love it because it is simple no batteries required i also disagree with some reviewers that the plastic letters are not a good asset my boy plays extensively with the letters even if he has not focused on walking I have seen him take the letters and use them as a hammer and happily bang away on other things,74,26
10266,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we bought this for our first child and loved it this one is so stable with the wide stance we turned it into an outside toy once he was a good walker because he loved to use it to deliver mail when our 2nd was born we bought a new one for inside we thought about getting a different one but so many out there have flashing lights and more kids do not need all that junk to have fun walking is already fun for them,84,27
10267,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy helped teach my girl to run around and walk she used to fly around no problem with thisshe first had it when she was 13mos old and still uses it today she has 2 she uses it with the doors off to cart her doll around and will on occasion pretend to deliver mail with it not bad for the price no annoying sounds to drive me crazy either,72,28
10268,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my grandson just loves this toy and now he is trying to walk with it,15,29
10269,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,wow this was an instant hit with my 10 month old it took me nearly an hour to put together simply because she was crawling over me the entire time trying to help with the slide toys my baby is only 18 pounds and pretty agile so we have not had any problems with tipping she loves walking through the house after me i also think the letters are a greatjust the right size for chewing and large enough not to get lost easily fun toy and great value for the price,93,30
10270,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you are like me and sick of toys that play music and have flashing lights then this simple walker is for you because it folds up flat easily we would take it to the park with our 10 month old son and set it up on the grass my son would push it from one end of the park to the other end happily and when he got tired he would sit and post the letters or whatever else he got his hands on or play with the buttons yes it occasionally tipped but no harm occurred and what toddler is not going to go face down from time to time and because it is so simple i never worried about getting dirt grass or sand in it it washed off easily but here is what really struck me a kid at the park came up to us and started playing with the walker after pushing the numbers stickers really he complained this does not do anything my son would disagree,172,31
10271,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is unstable and falls over when my baby tries to pull himself up it also collapses when my baby tries to walk with it it is probably the worst one i have ever seen save your money and save your baby from a horrible fall do not buy this walker,51,32
10272,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son loves this walker even now that he is walking on his own he loves pushing things and this moves good on any type of floor the doors do fall off easy but he does not care he likes to carry the doors around great walker for the price,49,33
10273,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old all the other reviews are right the doors break off way too easily but our daughter really liked it and for that one month she used it as a walker to help her walk now she uses it with her playhouse and sticks all kinds of things into it she is now a year and a half and although it sits along the wall she still uses it with her other toys when her friends come over they always want to play with it for 2 - 3 minutes and then they move on the other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well i think it was a great gift but i would not have bought it 2 stars for durability due to the doors they are still somewhere around the house,157,34
10274,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my sister purchased this for my little guy for christmas and it is not a good toy it is a good walked but the compartment doors on the front just fall off when you open them i would not recommend this toy,42,35
10275,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this activity walker for my son when he was about 8 months old we had visited a friend whose son had it and as soon as i put my son behind the walker i assisted him up to the handle he took off walking it does not get much more exciting than that i ran to the toy store that evening and bought it my son has always loved this toy he is very active and started walking on his own around 11 months i am sure his use of this toy helped him develop that skill he is almost 17 months now and he still pushes the cart around often collecting toys in it the little mailbox doors have been long pulled off but he uses it in other creative ways similar to a grocery cart i highly recommend thisin fact i am buying it for a friend,152,36
10276,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,after researching several walkers online i chose this product because of the adjustable wheel speed i was very disappointed after spending 20 minutes assembling all the parts with screws and a screwdriver my daughter pulled off the doors on the front-in about 1 minute next-she tried to stand up to walk and it fell right one top of her i had to hold it still while she stood up-but it still was too light weight and tipped to easily also the smooth plastic wheels slid right across the rug so the speed adjustment feature was mute the toy was so boring that within 5 minutes she was off doing something else needless to say i was disappointed and will be returning it immediately,123,37
10277,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker whe my son was standing up on his own and trying to learn how to walk it was too dangerous for him to use before he could walk because it would tip over whenever he leaned on it now that he can walk it is too dangerous for him to use because he tries to climb on it and it tips over so i would not recommend this toy,73,38
10278,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son tried to pull himself up with the handle of this toy and as the toy tipped backwards he fell backwards and hit his head on the floor he did not want to give up although and proceeded to try again same result except for the fact that we caught him this time this walker tips backward did not work returning it,61,39
10279,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we recieved this as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law her daughter played with it from one year to eighteen months and loved it the doors do come off the front very easily for cleaning purposes it claims and it does require parental supervision she can not pull herself up on with it tipping over and it does not steer very well but the speed adjustment puts it far ahead of similar toys and she just lights up when playing with it and can not stop laughing overall it works well for us we just colaspe it when we are not walking around with her when calasped she loves to play with the attivity board,110,40
10280,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i did not like this toy at all as all the others say the plastic door on the front come right off my baby enjoys putting the letters in but they slide right out very poor construction,36,41
10281,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy with the hope that i could encourage my 9 month old to start walking he pulled off the pieces and scattered them everywhere for 1/2 the money i found another similar toy that works just as well,41,42
10282,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we received this toy last christmas for my 9 month old at the time the first night she ripped off the doors and they do rarely stay on however the wheels do tighten easily to allow them the right speed i thought for sure after she learned to walk it would be old news but around 15 months she used it as a seat without the doors it fits her perfectly she loved to get pushed around in it as well as stand up in it scary but no accidents now at almost 2 years she uses it to push her dolls around in it just keeps transforming,109,43
10283,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we bought this toy for our 9-month old daughter I am glad we did although the activity portion of the toy leaves a lot to be desired we did not buy it for the activities our daughter needed something to hold onto while she learns to walk and this toy was perfect for that purpose it offers a very wide and stable platform while still encouraging our daughter to develop her own sense of balance like other reviewers we also appreciated the speed control so that our babys first steps could keep up with the walker my daughter loves the mobility that this toy provides and occasionally enjoys the activity features i would definitely recommend this toy to my friends and family,120,44
10284,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,like other reviewers i thought the only good thing was the speed control on the wheels unfortunately my box was missing the screws to attach the large blue handle the exposed sides were dangerous and my daughter pulled the lids off then used the spaces as stairs to climb the toy of course it could not support her weight so she fell over i removed it quickly after that,68,45
10285,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my grandmother had purchased a winnie the pooh walker for my 9 month old which he had trouble controlling where it went especially when it went forward too quickly when he was not ready this walker is much easier for him to control and he loves getting around on his own steam with regard to the front panels coming off my son actually likes taking them off and they are very easy replaced he has never injured himself by doing this and i do not see that being feasible,87,46
10286,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,it is a great toy for a toddler who likes to push toys on wheels it also has very interesting activities to challenge a childs mind and easy for small hands i believe it is a great toy,38,47
10287,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my son has loved this toy since he was about 6 months he is now 11 months and walks all over the house with it it is great because he could play with it flat on the floor and then when he was ready we turned it into a walker it is durable enough for him to push around yet is not beating up all of our furniture and doorways i recommend it for the money,74,48
10288,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i recently bought this toy for our son he has been cruising for weeks now from one piece of furniture to another when i opened it he immediately began trotting across the living room the other problem is not enough floor space he gets upset when he hits the wall and it does not move anymore since we have bought this toy he has taken a few steps on his own i believe it helps little ones learn to walk i would recommend this toy to anyone,85,49
10289,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my son because he is walking along furniture and i thought it might help learn to walk i loved that it said it had adjustable speed but on our carpet the wheels do not turn at all it just glides over the floor just as fast we have also had the mail door problem the worst thing about this toy is that my son was playing with the mail slot while i was putting his laundry away and i heard this awful screaming he got his little finger stuck in the side and had his other hand pushing the mail door shut with all his body weight by the time i got to him and released his finger it was white and then bruised shortly after i removed the doors and put them away so he can not get them but he has not touched this toy since this has been a total waste of money for our family,160,50
10290,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,if you have a sore back from helping your cruising baby walk i recommend the wide-track walker my daughter loves the independence it provides her and i love seeing her grin as she walks all over the place pushing it,40,51
10291,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy was great although i bought it only one month ago and both doors are gone they do not stay on ver well one is supposed to be removable but my 9 month old could get them both off this was his favorite part it really is a great toy he was walking with it the same day the wheel has a resistance lever so the toy does not go flying when they push on it but this lever always switches itself back to the least resistance position oh well for the price it was worth it they grow out of things so qiuckly,104,52
10292,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i was sooo excited to see this product and thought it would be perfect for my baby girl so when grandma brought it home we were thrilled and tried it out right away when it is folded down on the ground she loves it all although the little doors just snap right off she will just play with the door too but she has learning to walk and that is the part i liked best until she actually started walking with it she lost her balance and fell backwards and the toy went backwards with her and smacked her in the face this happened everytime she tried to pull up on it as well so i have put it away in the closet for now so be careful not to let your little one use this toy on hard surfaces they might crack their head and smack their face at the same time,150,53
10293,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i was disappointed in the design little tikes usually makes such great things my son started playing with this at 9 - 10 months and even then he could pull the doors right off it was not very good if they were intended to be used as mail slots to learn how to put things in and take them back out i agree with the other poster that he was not at all interested in any of the other toys on it like the caterpiller or little bugs my son did walk at 10 months and has not stopped to rest since he only pushes this on occassion like i said we received it as a gift but i would never buy this one on my own,125,54
10294,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,not a very good toy for a young child it is too lightweight and it tipped over backwards everytime my daughter tried to walk behind it this caused her to bang her head on the floor many times also the doors on the front come off very easily so my daughter uses it as ato climb on and even used it to help her climb up onto the couch,71,55
10295,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we were very displeased with this product the pieces come off way too easy and the worst part about it is that when baby starts to tumble backwards the toy comes with my daughter also can not use the toy to pull up on either we got a much better playskool one for 5 at a yard sale sorry i wasted my money on the other one,66,56
10296,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i absolutley love this walker and so does my son my son is now 10 months old and loves to walk we received the fp brilliant basics walker as a gift but we soon found out that it was not for us it was lightweight and flimsy everytime my son tried to use it it would push ahead of him and he would end up on his knees or on his face not exactly the right way to help a baby learn to walk my mil bought our son this walker and he just loves it the speed / traction control feature is a must gone are the days of him falling on his face or to his knees he can actually walk across the room with this and it does not fly out from under him yes the mailbox doors come off very easily but so what my son likes to take them off and play with them when the doors are off you can put a favorite toy there instead my son loves to push around his stuffed animals overall great sturdy walker for the price very pleased,184,57
10297,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this walker is very lightweight my son picked the whole thing up instaed of trying to push it even with the brakes on the plastic wheel just slide right across the floor leaving baby face first behind it do not waste your money go with fisher price,45,58
10298,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,we bought this for our 7 month old girl at christmas she loved it from the beginning taking her first few steps with the walker with daddy right behind her even although she is now walking independently she still loves the walker as she has found new ways to use it she pulls off both flaps to make a seat for herself and now at nearly one year she loves to climb all over it and placing one foot on the front uses it backwards as a scooter at first the bee and caterpillar were too stiff for her to move but over the months she was able to move them great value great product,115,59
10299,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this is only good if your child can stand up on his or her own it is so light and narrow it tipped over backwards when our daughter tried to support herself with it by the way putting it together is no fun,43,60
10300,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this for my 8 month old who is learning to walk she absolutely loves walking around the house with this and gets the biggest smile on her face for that alone it is worth the 20 it is bright and cheerful looking when my husband put it together i had him readjust the toys on the front the moving bee and caterpillar so they would be looser and easier for her to move back and forth yes as everyone else said the mailbox covers come off way too easily but that is not too important to us my 2 year old is the one who pulls them off i will try the suggestion from a previous reviewer of putting the top slot on the bottom my 2 year old has had fun with this toy too she likes the novelty of pushing it around the house and then watching as her baby sister does it i would definitely buy this again,162,61
10301,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my daughter got this toy for christmas right about the time she was starting to stand alone i really do think it has helped her learn to walk although as soon as she could walk without it she lost interest in it i do like that it has a wide base and is adjustable as far as speed i think i would buy it again,65,62
10302,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we bought this when my daughter was ready to start walking she was able to stand by herself and sometimes would make aor two so we thought it would help her to learn walking however this toy did not help at all the tires are plastic so they slide very easily which means a child has to run very fast in order not to fold down because as soon as a child presses on the handle the walker starts sliding forward like it is onthe leters and other fun features of the toy are ok and my daughter played with them a little but she was not really excited about the toy,115,63
10303,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker for my ten month old and 2 mins after we put it together the doors are pulled off they do not stay on and the letters then just fall out and it is very hard my son to turn it i packed it up and brought out my daughters old fisher price walker much better quality,58,64
10304,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we bought this for our daughter to play with when she was learning to walk the mail is difficult to put into the holders and it frustrated her the little drawers that open up to put items in fall off the cart after using it a few times the bottom one fell off completely causing a huge temper tantrum of frustration it does adjust in it is speeds ie it gives more resistance for those that are still unsteady which is nice,81,65
10305,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,while in the sit down position playing with this toy my daughter got her foot stuck inside the corner of the blue handle opening it might seem hard to believe but she had her ankle wedged inside where the blue handle tapers down to the walker i immediately threw the walker in the trash this will never happen to me again luckly i was right there to remove her foot and it was not easy i was very scared her foot was going to be broken can you image your baby with a cast on it is leg it is just not worth it,102,66
10306,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,i can see how it can tip easily but my son likes that it is more flexible he takes turns and does 3 - 60s it is his first choice of walkers we have the hippo and a car as well,39,67
10307,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this toy appears to be pretty neat but alas it is not my daughter was always trying to play with it from the front and would pull up on it to put the envelopes in the mailbox and when she leaned on it the doors fell off and she fell face first into it one time she fell into it she got a huge knot on her forehead w / a nasty purple bruise this toy went in the trash after 2 weeks we are totally not thrilled with this especially being made by little tikes which is a brand we have always trusted i do not recommend this toy to any child no matter what the age it is not safe,121,68
10308,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this for my twin nine month old grandsons for christmas the problem i have is that i can not get the speed of the wheels adjusted no matter what setting i put them on the walker goes too fast and they fall i find that they are always removing the mailbox doors they also get their fingers caught in the doors it is cute for the price but i wish i had bought just a regular old fashioned walker like my children used thirty years ago,89,69
10309,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,there are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market but they also cost more money so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker personally my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase as soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest i put it away in the baby things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking that being said if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk this is not the toy the mail slots come off way too easily and are boring the mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house the accessory toys bug themed on the walker are way too hard to manipulate plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox what are the bugs doing on it you have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs / wants,188,70
10310,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,my husband and i purchased this for my son when he began to walk he absolutely loves it he pushes it all around the house and in the backyard he likes to drop the mail into the mail slots he also enjoys playing with the bee and caterpillar it is not difficut to move at all for him the mail doors do come off easily but it is not bothersome at all i guess it just depends on what the child is more interested in doing my son just loves to push it all around i think it is a great toy and helps begining walkers i would recommend it to anyone,110,71
10311,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this walker for my son when he was 9 months it was much less expensive than the other walkers and i liked that it had a wide track and wheel speed control i was initially very disappointed like the other reviewers i could not believe how easily the mailbox slots fall off we had the toy home and assembled for 10 minutes and the bottom mailbox fell off and our dog chewed it up even with the wheels on the slowest setting the walker would go too fast for my son to keep up and it skids on all surfaces even although it claims to have wheels that grip however my son loves this toy and loves to pull of the mail slot and play with the plastic envelopes now at 10 months he can pull himself up easily on it without tipping it onto himself and can cruise around the house pushing it he likes to put his stuffed animals in the mail slot area and give them rides I am so glad i did not get rid of it right away which was my first instinct because this is his current favorite,193,72
10312,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my 7month old son who was standing and walking while holding on to things but this toy was a total waste of money he did great walking while holding on to it for a while but if he pulled back on it both him and the toy would hit the floor and then after he started walking at 8months he could rip the covers off the front way too easily and once he realized that they would come off so easily he continuously pulled them right off and walk around with it in his hand while never bothering with the rest of the toy so it was pretty much useless after that,117,73
10313,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,since she learned to walk at 105 months this has been my daughters constant companion she has still using it at 13 months in different ways we had another similarstride to ride but this has been the clear winner she prefers and uses a lot it was stable esp as she started out leaning on it and then pushing it now she can steer it and gets great satisfaction as she negotiates corners and doorways i like the speed adjustment on the wheels the stickers faded outside it is an indoor / outdoor toy with us and the dexterity activities on it are pretty lame but she is mainly just go-go-go w / this she does try to climb and sit in the front pouch area although cute / funny we discourage that safety issue overall i think this purchase was a good value,141,74
10314,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this toy falls over every time my nine month old tries to brace himself to stand up and push it also the mail slots fall off constantly overall this toy is dangerous and a waste of money,37,75
10315,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this toy for our 10 month old who was starting to cruise unfortunately this toy did not instill any confidence in our son everytime he tried to pull up using the toy it would roll away from him causing him to fall when he was already standing and tried to walk holding on to it it would scoot away from him again causing him to fall the doors do break off easily this toy has gone in the garbage as i do not feel it is safe enough for any child to play with,96,76
10316,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,when i bought this walker i did not realize that the rear wheels are not on an axle and therefore do not spin easily they are secured with screws the wheel control is on the front wheels so you would think that the rear wheels would spin easily they do not and will seriously scratch your hardwood floors we had our floors refinished two years ago and now due to this toy they will need to be refinished again this is a very poor design and as others have mentioned the doors come off very easily my son likes playing with the doors but gets frustrated when they keep coming off the other toys on the walker do not interest him at all i will say that the walker is sturdy,131,77
10317,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,as other users have stated there is not enough weight at the base of this toy to keep it grounded when a child is using the handle to pull up it does fall on the baby when he falls using it this toy is being thrown away at my house my morals will not allow me to sell or donate it risking the endangerment of another child,69,78
10318,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this toy is not recommended for babies learning to walk it is flimsy and when my son falls backwards it winds up falling on top of him and frightens him sometimes even hitting his face there should be more weight to the bottom of the thing to help keep it stable i wish i knew this before i purchased thisinstead of assisting my baby with walking it hurts him,71,79
10319,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this for our son just before he was 11 months i wanted something with speed control because he just kept falling on the others he had tried i love the speed control he was not falling forward like he was on the others we had to stay close for awhile because it is light so he would tip over when he was first getting the hang of it he is almost 1 year and does not tip and is able to pull himself up on it despite it being a light toy,94,80
10320,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we recently bought this walker for our 9 month old he loves it we like it because it does not have music noise yet another toy with the abc song it does what is was intended to do be a walker he loves the envelopes and is getting good at putting them into the mailbox yes the doors come off easily but our leapfrog table has a purple door that pops off just as easily plus this walker was not expensive,77,81
10321,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i purchased this toy for the sole purpose of helping my baby to stand and then walk he can stand if he pulls up on a couch or similar unfortunately this product is so light and flimsy that it topples with the smallest amout of pressure there has no way my baby can pull himself up on this toy unless i hold it and then what has the point in addition i agree with several of the other parents comments about the flaps being easy to come off and then a hazard my son loved in the 1 day we owned it to pull off the flap with the spinning disk and then promptly got his hand caught and pinched in it as he tried toon it he did love biting the plastic envelopes oh boy i returned this product,140,82
10322,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,this push-toy is nice when pushed but the doors come off very easily and once they are off my daughter climbs into the shelf on the front of the toy that is very dangerous plus the busy-box features on the front are lame and the letters are a waste they just wind up scattered all over the house i wish we would gotten her a different walker,66,83
10323,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my twin boys first birthday as everyone has said the doors come off very easily i am sick of picking them up off the floor it also falls over backwards very easily it falls over backwards onto my sons when they try to sit down holding onto the handle one of my sons likes to touch the bee on the front while he is holding onto the handle standing behind the toy it falls over backwards on top of him this toy is not very sturdy for small children trying to learn to walk i expected a lot better quality from little tykes,108,84
10324,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,my son loves this toy he got this toy as a gift when he was 10 months old yes the doors fall off but my son could care less he uses this toy to walk all over the house it is also light enough that we take it to the park shopping and more so he can walk on his own when we go out he has fallen down a few times as other people mentioned but i assume this is the case with most early walkers now that he has the hang of using it he pulls himself up with the bar and has few problems walking around with it i would say this is one of his favorite toys we own so i think it is quite a deal for the price,134,85
10325,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,this is a terrible toy like all of the other reviews say the mail doors come off way to easy both of my boys would try to walk with it but the toy would not stay up and they both just fell on there backs and then within 2 days the toy would just collapse once i walked in the boys bedroom just in time to see one of the boys standing on the toy where the doors are supposed to be lifting himself up to the crib and almost falling i just with i could return this toy what a waste of money and it is too dangerous to donate,111,86
10326,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this for my son when we was 9 months old he had been walking around the furniture for over a month my main complaint about this toy is that the doors come off very easily garrett loved the letters and opening the doors but as soon as they came off he was scooting them around the floor i think he used the walker feature 2 or 3 times i returned it after a few weeks,77,87
10327,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we just purchased this toy a few days ago the doors on the front are detachable and they detach way too easily my son was pulling himself up on the toy and the doors fell out and he bumped his head on the toy now he has a big shiner on his head i am so upset that little tykes did not know better it is very dissapointing dangerous toy,69,88
10328,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,the two pieces on the front will not stay on and my friend has a different one and it looks more durable,22,89
10329,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i just watched my 10 month old daughter topple over with this contraption on top of her from the moment we put this thing together my wife and i were concerned about it if you have hardwood floors be prepared to chase your child around as the walker simply slides uncontrollably across the floor my biggest criticism is that the weight distribution is totally screwed up presumably this walker is being used by children who are learning to walk when our daughter pulls herself up on the handle there is not enough weight in the front to prevent the walker from tipping over I am no engineer but something about the design is all wrong ours is going in the trash,120,90
10330,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i got this walker for my 8 month old and i highly reccomend it people keep complaining about a piece of the toy coming off and losing toys well i did not buy it for the toy part i bought it for the walker part-as will most people i assume i love the parent controlled speed adjustment i was expecting about 3 speeds to choose from no there are 11 yes 11 i was so happy when i stood my little girl up with it and it did not roll out from her that is why i would reccomend this walker to everyone i know i only gave it 4 stars although because the toys on it are a little cheezy my daughter seems to love them although so i guess that is all that matters,133,91
10331,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,the first time my baby started walking around with this i screamed i called my mom and said my baby is walking my baby is walking it was so cool watching him walk all over the living room he loves this toy give it a try every baby is different,50,92
10332,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my 10 month old son it is pretty sturdy however the doors as well as the envelopes that come with it are lost somewhere in the house the doors do come off with little or no effort and thus making it possible for my son to climb onto it and stand which makes me very leary to turn around for a moment because it looks like he will tip over he played with it for approximately 30 minutes and his 4 year old brother like to use it to try to run over him and the dog with it i like the speed control of the wheels but would be better if the wheels clicked or made noise of some kind it does not teach you anything at all keep on looking unless you are prepared to keep putting on the doors and not let them climb on it,152,93
10333,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,my daughter loved to play with this toy the only problem was the doors come off way to easy the first thing she would do when she played with this was take the doors off they need to do something to secure them it also tends to tip back when she tries to walk with it i think your better off trying a different toy if you are looking for something that will help your child walk ours now takes up space in the garage,85,94
10334,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this toy for my 8 month old son who is learning to walk it was not a good buy for me it is made cheaply and is not worth the money i spent on it not only do the doors come off but the slider toys do not slide well the speed control on the wheel does not work either beware of buying this toy,67,95
10335,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i was really disapointed in this toy i have had numerous little tykes products over the years my oldest 22 youngest 8 mths and i expected the same quality but was let down with this toy when my son trys to pull up to this toy so he can walk with it it flips over backwards with him and he falls hurting himself the little snap on pieces on the front just pop right off with little effort this was a waste of money fortunately it did not cost to much,89,96
10336,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,too unstable it tips when they pull up to stand also the plastic flaps which my son would normally love came out to easily to be any fun,29,97
10337,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son who is now 15 months old got this when he was 8 months old and just learning to stand and cruise my son still uses it and loves to push it around however thiswas purchased new and since day one the mailboxes have yet to stay on they keep falling off even with the smallest amount of pressure so we just now leave them off because frankly they are useless at this point the workmanship is poor so in essence this toy is just used to push around the house and little else i hope other people who have gotten this do not have the same trouble I am just glad i did not shell out my own money for this,119,98
10338,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,we received this as a gift for my third child the older two used a wonderful one that gave out after the second one and unfortunately they are not made anymore this one only has two advantages over the old one 1 it has a wheel control like those on roller skates to tighten the wheel so it will not go too fast for the baby learning to walk and 2 it is much easier to make it go flat or sit it back up right i broke a lot of fingernails trying to make the old one change positions the two doors like the other reviewers said come off way too easily once they are off there is little left on the toy except the boring sliders in comparison to other baby toys the three letters just float around the junk pile and are a waste at least the walker has two handles one on top for standing and one on the back for walking on knees which my baby likes to do I am glad it was not me who bought this,181,99
10339,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i bought this walker despite what the reviews said i now see for myself how right they are about the doors my 8 month old granddaughter loves to walk and play with the walker it is very stable and i love the break controls on the wheels the only problem is the doors want stay on surely they could come up with a better door all in all the price and the over-all performance is worth the buy we just do not use the doors,85,100
10340,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for my 9mo son and he has had nothing but accidents with it the doors on the front are very easily removeable leaving afor the child toup and climb on top of the unit causing the unit to topple over child and all the doors need to be permanent fixtures on the unit the unit also is called wide tracker activity walker this unit is not any wider than the traditional activity walkers previously out on the market i personally have not been pleased with this purchase,93,101
10341,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,sure most of the parts fall off and get lost but so does every other toy and walker on the market after the doors were removed and lost by my 10 month old son he became interested in using it as a walker this walker is wide and much better then the narrow handle bars on the fisher price it is resistance is great for carpets and i never worry about him speeding off uncontrollably he just loves using this walker and complains every time we take it away i think it is a great stepping stone for his next milestone walking on his own,104,102
10342,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i would rather not have a toy with a lot of frills this was purchased in an effort to help my son walk and because he was sure footed and cruising already he had no problems taking to it at 9 months and 23 pounds the doors on the front do come off super easy but that is not a concern of mine if my son gets to the point to where he takes it off to use as a stair to get on furniture i will simply super-glue the doors on there so that he can not i do believe it is sturdy although i think that is proven by my sons age weight and use of the toy there are probably better choices out there but i think the price is right and so is the product it is not always necessary to have the perfect and most expensive choice out there,151,103
10343,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this walker for my daughter loving thethat the speed was adjustable my daughter is almost 9 months old and is ready to take off cruising but we just do not have much for her to cruise around so i thought that if this walker was slow enough for her it would be a great beginner walking toy for her i got it home put it together and she loved it instantly especially the spinning flower but when she tries to hold onto the handlebar and go it falls on top of her the legs are set way too close to the body of the toy so it gives absolutely no balance whatsoever unless your kid is so secure on their feet that they never wobble this is not the toy you are looking for i took it back immediately within an hour of purchasing it,148,104
10344,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,we bought this for my 10 month old daughter where do i start the brakes do not prevent this contraption from slipping and sliding sideways and forward so every time she hangs on she slides face forward on the ground now she is afraid to walk with it she will try to put the envelopes in the mail slot which just like the others has broken off countless times and she has cut her face from falling forward do not leave your child alone with this product,86,105
10345,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i have this for my 12 month old son it is not sturdy at all do not buy this with thethat it will help balance your child and assist in walking it is so flimsy that it tips over anytime my son tries to pull himself up the only thing he liked about it is the plastic envelopes that he could remove he lost interest in this toy in about a week,73,106
10346,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i was a little leary of this after reading the other reviews but i had already bought it so i took it out of the box you have to understand i am not a logical thinker and have a hard time putting anything together but once i got past the fact that there were no written instructions i figured it out pretty easily armed with only a philips screwdriver i managed to get it together with only a few curses all by myself even with my baby trying to climb all over it he nine months old loves to walk with it and it moves at just the right speed for a beginner my four year old daughter will fight with him to play with it is that good so it is not one of the toys in the corner gathering dust because no one wants to play with it I am glad i bought it and i love watching my son smile as he walks all by himself,169,107
10347,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,like nearly all of these reviews i was really excited to buy this product for my 1 year old who is just beginning to cruise not 5 minutes after I had put the toy together she had crawled up on the green mail flap it snapped off and she fell to the base no split lip but a flurry of tears i can not believe how poorly-made those doors are an infant can pull them off i agree with one of the reviewers stating that that alone should be reason for a recall as well as this the toy when collapsed is not flat enough to provide a sturdy base for a budding and unstable new walker to play on very disappointing,120,108
10348,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,2.0,negative,i bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old who can not wait to walk on his own he rarely uses it as a walker although he has more interested in pulling the doors off the front of it and on more than one occasion has used it as a climbing tool once he even fell and split his lip open the doors on this thing should be attatched better and barring that the toy should be recalled,80,109
10349,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,we got this for our 10-month old son and he loved it instantly he is just beginning to start cruising on things and this gave him a stable start he pushes it well and stays steady he also loves the mail slot and double doors that open on the front and loves to put everything inside a good purchase all in all,62,110
10350,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my son received this for his first bithday and has yet to get any good use out of it it has no balance capability so your child is always at risk of falling back also the door flaps are poorly made and always falling off basicly i do not recomend any one to buy this toy i would have been really upset had i purchased it my self,67,111
10351,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,i bought this for my 10 month old daughter as she had been cruising for about 1 1/2 months and i thought she would enjoy having something to practice walking with and push I am not happy at all with the durability she is constantly pulling the mailbox slots off they come off very easily and has squished her fingers in them on more than one occasion once she pulls them off she likes to stand in the opening thing which looks really cute but it is really dangerous as i can just see her tumbling backwards she is not interested in the toy things the catepillar is too hard to move back and forth overall i wish i would have bought one of the fisher price walkers they seem much sturdier and do not have parts that come off so easily i would recommend you shop around before purchasing this one,150,112
10352,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my husband choose this activity walker because of the speed control feature thinking it would be safer on hardwood floors i expected a little tikes product to be sturdy but i am very disappointed in this one my nine month old pulled the mail doors off within the first minute he began playing with it i am also concerned with the safety the back wheels the back support is very unstable and appears as if they might snap off at the least amount of pressure i would not recommend this activity walker there are much sturdier and safer choices than this,101,113
10353,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,1.0,negative,my husband and i bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter we liked it because it was the only one on the market that had cruise control and we thought that would be important since we have hardwood floors we spent almost an hour putting it together and then we let the little one try it out at first she was so excited to play with the toys but as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up the the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip needless to say it went back to the toy store and we bought the playzone activity walker she likes the colors sounds and sturdy craftsmanship better than the little tikes,132,114
10354,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,5.0,positive,this toy is an excellent tool for babies learning to walk it has a speed control which is great for hardwood floors the only problem is that the doors on the front are easily pulled off but can be placed back,41,115
10355,Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,i recently purchased this toy for my daughter she had so much fun with it until she leaned on the front of it and the pin that holds it open snapped and it collapsed causing her to fall and scrape her back we did not use it improperly i feel that we may have gotten a defective one since i have not seen anyone else complain of this problem i wrote a letter to little tikes today so i have not recieved a reply yet i just wanted to let you all know incase there is more than one defective one out there,103,116
